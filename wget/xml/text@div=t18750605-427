                  </hi>. I am one of the coroners for the County of Kent—on the 4th of May I held an inquest on the body of Charles Downes in due form of law—I heard evidence and took depositions of persons in reference to the death; among others I took down the evidence of the prisoner—he was sworn—this is his original deposition; it was read over to him and signed by him. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I live in Warwick Street, Woolwich. I am a labourer. The deceased child was my son, Charles Downes, aged 2 years last birthday. He died on 1st May, at my residence, in Warwick Street, Woolwich. He had been ill for the last nine or ten months. When he was first taken ill I thought it was from teething, as my other children suffered from their teeth at first. He gradually got worse and worse up to the time of his death. I don't know the complaint or disease under which he was labouring. Every care and attention was taken of him by myself and my wife. I called in no medical aid or advice. I am one of the Peculiar People and do not believe in it; I trust to the Lord. The child was prayed for and prayed over, and the Elders laid hands on him and anointed him with oil; by both the elders, Hines and Hurry. I thought the child had been seriously ill for some time past; I trusted in the Lord. I thought the child would have died before but for our trust in the Lord. I do not know the cause or disease of which he died. I did not treat him for any par<lb></lb>ticular complaint. He had every attention to his wants.") The prisoner was afterwards bound in recognizances to appear at this Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Plumpstead and am an engine driver.; I am a member of the Peculiar People and am one of the elders—we never call in medical advice when we are ill, nor give medicines—we have religious objections to it—in sickness we call for the elders of the Church, and they pray over the sick person and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord, as you will find recorded in the 5th chapter of James' Epistle, 14th verse—there is another passage we refer to about the laying on of hands in the last chapter of Mark's Gospel and the last few verses—I know the prisoner and his wife—during the illness of the child I frequently visited it—I was called in sometimes and sometimes I voluntarily went, as it was a long illness—I observed that the child was in a declining state and thought it was teething; it was wasting away, but the children of these parents have always been so, all of them—in my capacity of elder I put hands on the child and prayed over it and anointed it—the prisoner did not ask my advice about the child, no further than we would speak together concerning its state; he has said something like this "What would be your advice to give to the child?" and I would advise port wine and arrowroot and such things as that, as I believed was best required for the child, and new milk and eggs and such things as them—I never advised him to call in medical aid—he did not ask me anything about medical aid to my recollection—I believe we have agreed to call in medical aid in cases of contagious diseases, on account of our neighbours—I believe we promised that before Justice Byles—if a member broke his <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> or had a serious wound inflicted on him we should provide, but we never met with such a case in thirty years now past—our women are not attended by a medical man in childbirth; we have skilful women in our sect—they do not take the name of midwife; they do not take that responsi<lb></lb>bility, but they answer the place of one; they have been found competent by experience to carry women through their labour to. the delivery of the child—I was not present at the death of this child; I was there about a quarter of an hour after—I could not exactly say how long before its death I had seen it; it was a long illness—I used to see it once or twice a week.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Woolwich and am an M.D., and M.R.C.S. of Edinburgh—I did not see this child until it was dead, when I received an order from the Coroner to make a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I examined the body—it was in an extreme state of emaciation—there were no external marks of violence, or want of attention, or cleanliness, or anything of that sort; it was cleanly and well attended to externally—it was unusually emaciated—I examined the chest—the left lung was in a state that revealed old standing chronic inflammation, and also inflammation of a more acute character—the two <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi> were adherent to a most unusual extent, showing old-standing <hi rend="italic">pleuritis</hi>—the lung was permeated by little collections of matter, showing recent acute inflammation; I am now only alluding to the left lung; that is the one that is first affected, as a rule—on the left bide of the chest the <hi rend="italic">pericardium</hi> was more than normally full of fluid—in the right lung there was a commencing tubercular deposit, which is a very frequent result of pneumonia—the appearances in the right lung did not present the preliminary stages of the results that I found in the left lung—I found some fluid in the stomach, showing that food had been properly conveyed to the child—in my judgment the cause of death was pleurisy and chronic inflammation of the lungs—the condition of the <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi> indicated Jong standing disease, gradually and slowly progressing—it was certainty a disease amenable to treatment in its earlier stages; of course I do not for a moment presume to say that the child would have recovered under treat<lb></lb>ment, its life might either have been prolonged or saved; that I cannot say; I say that its life might either have been prolonged or saved if proper treatment had been applied to it in the earlier stage—the emaciation was of such a character that it must have existed for some time, it must have been ob<lb></lb>servable for some time—teething had nothing at all to do with the disorder of which it died.</p>

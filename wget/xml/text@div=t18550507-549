                  </hi>. I live at No. 144, Drury-lane. On Sunday night, 1st April, I saw the deceased, Joseph William Hart, about half past 11 o'clock—he came into the room where I was sitting—I know a woman named Ransom—she came to the door—she did not come into the room—Hart staid in the room some time, and ultimately went up stairs to his own room—I afterwards heard the cries of "Murder!"—I proceeded up stairs, and find<lb></lb>ing there was no light I returned a portion of the way down the stairs, and called out for a light—while I was on the stairs the prisoner came down the stairs—I asked him what he had done, and what he had struck the man with—he said he had struck him with his boot—I caught hold of him by the collar, and we went down stairs, I walking rather behind him—he then showed what Hart had done to him—he had his nose bleeding—Hart then came down, and addressing Watkins, the landlord of the house, he said, "George, look what the villain has done"—he had then got an incision in his forehead, over the left eye, about three inches or three and a half inches long—it was a wound, and was bleeding very much—the prisoner was given into custody—I afterwards went into his room, and saw marks of blood on the floor—I found the top of a chair, which the policeman has.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 144, Drury-lane. On Sunday evening, 1st April, Hart came into my parlour, and staid there about half an hour—he then went up stairs to his own room—about three minutes afterwards I heard the cries of "Murder! George, come up; I am being murdered"—I proceeded to the parlour door, and before I could open it Mr. Evans was partly up stairs—I saw the prisoner come down, with his nose bleeding—Evans came down for a light—before he could get the light Hart came down, and said to me, "George, see what the villain has done"—I said, "What is to be done with him?"—he said, "Lock him up"—I then fetched an officer—Hart had a large wound over his left eye—Dean said that Hart</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 144, Drury-lane. I first saw Hart on the night in question, about a quarter past 10 o'clock, in Mr. Watkins's shop—about 12 o'clock he came up to my room, and asked me to get him a light—I said I had no light, and had not the means of getting one—he said, "I will have a light," and told me to go to my b——fellow and get one—I said I would not do so—he said, "I will bring the fellow in front of your face"—he brought the prisoner to the door—the prisoner went back in<lb></lb>stantly—I was undressed—I followed them, and saw Hart strike Dean several times, making use of a bad word—Dean said, "Hart, do you mean it? do you mean it?" and with that they fought, not many moments—I returned back to my room, and put on some garments—they were then fighting—I saw the prisoner strike him with something; it was not the back of a chair—he had too good a light in the room for me not to see—it was something much smaller than the back of a chair—there was a very good fire in the room, so that I could see plainly—Hart then came out on the landing, and called to Mr. Watkins, "George, bring a light; here is a b—game"—no cries of murder were uttered at all—Hart stopped till the light was brought up—he then went down stairs—the prisoner had partly got down, and he was given in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not see the actual blow struck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not swear to it, but he received a blow as I went into the room—Hart was very much excited under the influence of drink; he appeared angry and excited against the prisoner at the moment, but there was never any previous quarrel, and then they did not quarrel, they came momentarily to words and blows—Hart struck the prisoner with fearful violence, and even knocked him down under the fireplace the first blow he gave him—Hart was a very much bigger and taller man than the prisoner; a very much more powerful man; he had not his boots on—before Hart struck the blows, he said that the prisoner had been having an improper intimacy with me, making use of a very filthy word; the prisoner said, "You are wrong."</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at King's College hospital on Monday morning, 2nd April, when the deceased was brought there about 1 o'clock—he had a lacerated wound over the left eye, about three inches in length, and he was in a confused, excited state—I dressed the wound, and I saw him two or three times during the week; the wound at first got on well—on the Saturday morning I saw that he had erysipelas, and I immediately admitted him into the hospital—the erysipelas got worse, and he died on the following Friday, the 13th—the cause of death was the erysipelas produced by the wound.</p>

               <p>to the blow—I cannot say whether he was a drinking man—he was confused and excited, perhaps that arose from the injury—there was nothing else from which I could judge whether or no he was a man of intemperate habits.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoners in Nine Elms-lane, walking together—Churchill had a bundle over his right arm—I followed, and asked Churchill what he had got there—he said he had a piece of lead—I asked where he got it—he said he had brought it from the Water-works, where he was at work, and was going to take it to Mr. Hemmings, his master—I asked him if I went to Mr. Hem<lb></lb>mings, whether he would know he was going to bring it—he said no, but the foreman had told him to take it—I asked Higgins if he had heard the foreman say so—he said yes, it was all right—I went to Mr. Morland, the foreman, but the prisoners were not present—I had left them with another constable—in consequence of what I heard at Mr. Morland's I went and took the prisoners to the station-house—they were about three-quarters of a mile from the Water-works, coming towards Westminster—I produce the lead—here are 43lbs. of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Hemmings, of Regent-street—he is a stone-mason—the prisoners were employed by me on the premises of the Southwark and Vauxhall Water-works—I did not direct either of them to take away any lead from the premises—I was working there—I cannot say that I saw any of this lead on the premises—there was lead about, but in much larger sheets than this—this is my signature to this deposition—I think it was read over to me.</p>

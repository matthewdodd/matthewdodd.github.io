            . I am an officer. I went with the prosecutor, searched the prisoner, and found a quantity of gold upon him. I found a quantity of gold wire in his breeches pocket, and gold filings and cuttings in his jacket-pocket, and a crucible with gold mixed with pearl-ash ready to be melted, in his jacket-pocket. I asked him how he got into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210044"></xptr>his master's shop? he cried, and said there was a key in his box at his lodgings, which opened the shop-door. I went and found it there. The house is in the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence - (written.) - I fully acknowledge my fault, and humbly implore the mercy of the Court. I lost my mother three years ago - my father is since dead. It is with the greatest pain and reluctance I am obliged to stir up the ashes of my deceased parents, and expose their vices; but when I know I can only attribute my present perilous situation to the profligate examples set me in my infancy, I cannot forbear calling their faults in question, as some excuse for my early depravity, which, under any other circumstance, I should blush to mention. My father for several years kept a Little Go, where I had the opportunity of witnessing the worst of vices and characters. At my poor mother's decease, my father introduced a prostitute to his home, who lived in the house until his death. He was in prison for the lottery several times, and suffered great distress during his imprisonment, which excited my affection and pity, and induced me to pilfer my master to supply his wants. This offence was continued at intervals through the bad company my father encouraged me to keep, which has at length brought me to this melancholy situation. This is the naked truth and history of my unfortunate life, and I humbly hope for mercy.</p>

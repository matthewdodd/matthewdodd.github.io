                  </hi>. I reside at Brentford, and am a coal and corn-merchant. I have one partner, who is my brother William—the prisoner Woodington was in my service, and had been about ten years—he was decidedly a con<lb></lb>fidential servant—I had a person of the name of James Syms—he had been about six months at the wharf, and about two years in our empty at the farm, which is about three miles off—on the 21st of February Syms was sent out with a cart to Southall, between four and five o'clock—I was not at home—I had some information given me or Thursday (the next day) at Uxbridge; in consequence of that, I had Syms taken into custody—I asked him a question, and he told me something—in consequence of what he said, I had Woodington taken—after he was in custody I said to him, "How came you to give Syms the beans?"—he said if he did it was a mistake—I said, "There was no mis<lb></lb>take about your receiving the money for them"—he said he had received no money—after that he was brought into Syms's presence—I then said to Syms, "How much money did you give <hi rend="italic">Dick?"</hi>—(Woodington went by the name of <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>)—Syms then said, "9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—Woodington then said he had said he had not received any thing, but he had received 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and what he said before was untrue—nothing was said about what the 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was for—my beans were kept in a granary, and on the wharf—all the man have access to the granary—if any beans were to be given out it would be</p>

                  </hi>. I have come out of the gaol of Newgate. I was committed to be tried for this offence—I was in the service of the prosecutor on the 21st of February—I had that day to go with some things to Southall, with the horse and cart—about three o'clock in the afternoon I had to take two bushels of malt, two pounds of hops, half a sack of flour, half a sack of barley-meal, a sack of bran, two bushels of oats, one bushel of beans, and a peck of oats—I had to take some of these things to Hanwell, and some to Southall—among other things, I took a bushel of beans, which Wood<lb></lb>ington gave me—he gave me most of the other things—some I took off the landing myself—before I loaded the cart, I said I had no money—(my matter gave me money to pay the gate)—Woodington said he would give me a bit of corn if I knew what to do with it—I did not want that to pay the gate, but to buy me a pint of beer on the road—I said I thought I did know what to do with it, and he got the corn—it was nearly a bushel of split beans in the bottom of an old bran sack—I cannot say who put them in the cart—he gave them to me—nothing more passed between us then—I went off—I went first to Hanwell, and then to Southall—I went to the White Hart, and saw the ostler, which is the prisoner Reeves, about five o'clock in the afternoon—I told him I had got a bit of corn in the cart, if he knew what to do with it—he said he did—we then went in doors to have a pint of half-and-half, and he came out and took it away out of the cart—no<lb></lb>thing was said about the price—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. after we came out of doors—he had taken the beans out—I did not see that be opened the sack—I did not tell him what the sack contained—I told him it was a bit of corn—I then came back to my master's place—I gave Woodington 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the next morning gave him three penny-pieces—I paid twopence for the half-and-half, which a man gave me where I went to, and Reeves put 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more—Mr. Stevens's wife gave me the twopence—I told Woodington I had got 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for what he gave me, and he should have half—he did not say any thing.</p>

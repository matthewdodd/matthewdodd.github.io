On Saturday, the 22d of April I went out with my wife about ten minutes past eight o'clock in the evening; I left my little girl, who is five years old, and my little boy, who is two years old. in bed - there was no other person in the house; I fastened the door - the window had been fastened before - we returned twenty minutes before nine o'clock; I found the door as I had left it, but the candle, which I had left burning in the front room, had been moved into the back room; I saw a mustard-pot empty, in which I had left a half-crown and a shilling: I found a pair of old slippers in my room which were not mine, and were not there when I went out; my boots were taken from the cupboard - they were there when I went out; I went into the back room and missed my hat and the box in which it was kept; I went to some pawnbrokers in the neighbourhood, and when I came back my wife said "God bless me, they have taken all my child's clothes," which had been tied up in a bundle; I went out again and found my hat at a pawnbroker's, who gave me a note; I did not miss my other property at that time - the house could only have been entered by a false key, as there were no marks of violence on the door or window; there is another way of getting in by the back door, but they must have got over the neighbours' gardens, which were all safe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ROBERTS. Q. What time was this? A. About ten minutes past eight o'clock - it was getting dark; I only had this hat a week, and had worn it on the Sunday; I then put it away, and had not seen it again; I saw the box but not the hat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did your hat box stand? A. It hung on a nail in the back room.</p>

            . I am shopman to Messrs. Nichols and Latter - they are pawnbrokers, and live at No. 80, Broad-street, Ratcliffe. On the 22d of April, between nine and ten o'clock, Eliza Douglas, whom I knew before, came and offered a hat to pawn, which appeared nearly new - it was in a box; I lent 6s. on it - she told me where she lived - here is the hat and the box.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MALCOLM. I take this hat to be mine - there is no mark of mine in it; I only know it by the maker's name - there was a crape on it - here is the name of Braggs on the box, which was put on by the maker, I suppose for a person it had misfitted - it was on it when I bought it; the hat was wrapped up in paper - it fitted me exactly and so does this; I have every reason to think it is mine; I have not found any of the other things since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the maker's name in the hat? A. Yes; but no mark of mine - this is like the hat I had; I left the house ten minutes before eight o'clock, and returned twenty minutes before nine - there is a clock in front of my door.</p>

On the 7th of December, the prisoner came into our shop, pretending to purchase some shoes, accordingly I shewed him some shoes, which he objected to as not fitting, I shewed him others, and the last I shewed him he said fitted him very well, he offered me two shillings less than I asked him, he then went to the door and offered sixpence more, I told him I did not do business in that way, and then he went out. About ten minutes previous to his coming in, I saw the shoes, and in about ten minutes after he went out I missed the shoes. My partner was in the shop with some customers. I then suspected the prisoner, I went to several pawnbrokers near to tell the men to stop the shoes if they came there. After I had returned home, a young man came into the shop with the shoes in his hand, asking me if I knew those shoes, I told him they were my shoes which I had lost, he said the prisoner came to pawn them, they had sent him to the watch house, and kept the shoes. This was between seven and nine at night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this from the time that you lost the shoes. - A. About an hour and a half.</p>

            . - I am a pawnbroker, 90 East Smithfield. On the 7th of December, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in the shop and offered these shoes to pledge, I looked at the shoes and saw that the shoes did not correspond with his dress, I suspected that he had not honestly come by them, he then told me that they belonged to a shipmate of his, I told him I should detain the shoes untill he proved that he came honestly by them, I sent for an officer and sent him to the watch-house, seeing the name in the shoes, that they were made for a person in Ratcliffe Highway. That is how we found it out. These are the shoes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are mine, there is my writing on them. There was nobody but me serving on that side of the shop at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the shoes. - A. Seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along the highway, I went into this man's shop, he asked me nine shillings, I offered seven shillings and sixpence and went out about my business, I went to the public-house, a man came to me and asked me to pawn the shoes, he would give me something to drink, I went to the shop, he asked me if they belonged to me, I said, no, they belong to another man. I declare to God I never stole them.</p>

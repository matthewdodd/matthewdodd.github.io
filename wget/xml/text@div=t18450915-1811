                  </hi>. I live in Gray's Inn-square, and am assistant to Mr. Wood, the town agent for the Portbury Pier and Railway Company, at their office, No. 449, West Strand. I was at the office on Saturday 26th July last—the prisoner, Lemoine, was there that day, and presented this letter, (B,) to me—it is the allotment letter, and here is the banker's receipt at the foot of it, signed by the banker, for the receipt of the deposit money for the ten shares—the deed was at that time lying on the opposite counter, closed—he presented the letter to me, and said he wished to sign the Port<lb></lb>bury Pier deed—I laid the deed before him, and he at once proceeded to sign it—I presumed, of course, that he was the person to whom the letter was addressed, Mr. Dethick—he wrote—(<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>)—"WM. Dethic, Esq., gent., North-end, Fulham, London, 10 shares 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" and, under the amount of subscription,"£25. Wm. Dethic."—omitting the final "k"—I no<lb></lb>ticed, when he was signing, his manner was hesitating, and his hand trembled—he put his hand to the seal, and delivered it as his act and deed—I observed that there was a final "k" in the letter of allotment, and called the fact to his attention—I asked if he was Mr. Dethick—he said he was—I told him I thought he was not, and that I was sure he was not—he still continued to say that he was—I fetched my principal, Mr. Wood, brought the facts to hit notice, and he questioned him as I had done—I had, at the time, a letter of application for shares in my hand, for another concern—there was the name of Drummond, the banker, on that—I suggested, as Mr. Dethick had referred to Mr. Drummond, he should go down to Drummond's to be identified—he said he would go—I put on my hat, and went out at the office with him to go—as soon as he got out<lb></lb>side the door, he said it was no use going to Drummond's, for they would not know him—that he was not Mr. Dethick, but he was employed by a person to sign Dethick's name, and that person was waiting for him at Capel-court, which person would give him half-a-crown for his trouble—he returned to the office with roe—Mr. Wood questioned him, and he was given into custody.</p>

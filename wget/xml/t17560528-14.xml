When I came away he used to come to my lodgings to see me. I suspecting him, took him up on suspicion, and carried him before justice Wright, and charged him with taking of them; he then own'd he took them from my lodgings, and said they were pawn'd in Copeland-Street. I went with the constable thither, and there we found them</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you give me liberty to take the cloaths? You know I lived with you as my wife, we cohabited together.</p>
               <p>M. Eaton. No, I never did. He took the room, and told the people that he had a wife. I was but a week and four days in the house. I did not live with him in a criminal way. I never said I was married to him, he never call'd me his wife when I was by, in his life; he used to come when he pleased into the room.</p>

            . I live in Shug-Lane. The prisoner came first to my house to take the lodging; my wife ask'd him if he had got a wife; he said he had; she then said she must see her; so he went and fetch'd the prosecutrix, and they took the lodgings together, and lived there about seven days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they lie together ?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175605280010"></xptr>Edler. They did. When the week was out she came and told me she was going into a service; and said she had given the prisoner a gold ring to pawn, to pay for the week's lodging. She always said he was her husband, and that she was ask'd at church; and at St. James's church was married to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Swaebe—on 16th January I was a passenger in an omnibus to Cheapside—the prisoner sat beside me, and I noticed that her hands kept moving under her cloak—when we got to the middle of Cheapside, another passenger got out—the prisoner followed, and I directly missed my purse—my pocket was torn, though it had been per<lb></lb>fectly sound when I left home, my dress being new—my purse contained a sovereign, three half-soverigns, a crown, some sixpences, and threepenny or fourpenny pieces, a pair of earrings, a watch-key and a bill—it was safe in my pocket not four minutes before I discovered its loss—it was afterwards picked up and given to me by Miss Flemington.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At the moment the prisoner went out was there not another woman who got out too? A. Just before, but they were very close together—there was a cart not far from where the omnibus stopped to let them out, just at Bennett's door—I did not notice what became of the other woman—the prisoner sat next to me, on the side my pocket was—she was not more inside the omnibus than I was—she was sitting third from the door, and kept fidgetting about, as though she had not sufficient room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of. the London General Omnibus Company, and was with my omnibus in Cheapside on the day in question—after the prisoner left the omnibus, the prosecutrix spoke to me about her purse, and I followed the prisoner—I said, "Here's your umbrella"—she said, "Thank you"—I said, "This lady wants to speak to you"—she said, "Oh dear, not me"—I told her she must come back, and she said, "Well, you need not hold me"—I took her back to the prosecutrix, who charged her with stealing her purse, which she denied—as I was bringing her back, we had to go round a cart which was standing opposite Bennett's clock—the purse was picked up and handed to me by Miss Flemington.</p>

I live at Pritchard-row, Hackney-road—on Monday afternoon, 15th January, about 3 o'clock, I was in Cheapside, near Bennett's clock—I saw the omnibus conductor taking the prisoner round a cart—she brushed against me, and then I saw this purse on the ground, on the very spot over which she had passed—I had not noticed the spot before she passed.</p>

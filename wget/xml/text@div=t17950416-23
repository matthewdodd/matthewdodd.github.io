            ? - The currier, the man who I bought these legs of, came with another man, to give me to understand that the boot legs were offered to sell.</p>
               <p>Q. Are either of these men here in court? - I don't know that they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost any leather boot legs? - Yes, I lost some at different times, but a person in custody acknowledged that she took them on the 6th of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you charged her with taking them? - When they informed me that these legs were my property, I inquired how they came by them; in consequence of that I found they had been sold by one Whitacre, who is now in court, to one Mr. Knowlys.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of her having any boot legs? - She had five pair the last Easter Tuesday, I think it was; she asked me to sell them for her; I carried three pair to Mr. Knowlys's shop, and he gave me thirteen shillings for them.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160051"></xptr>Q. What are you? - A shoe-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. So the prisoner brought these to you, and asked you to sell them for her? - Yes, and I gave her the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the prisoner before? - Yes, seeing her about the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how she came by them? - No, I never had the presence of mind to ask her that question; and I went the next day to Mr. Shipwell's with two pair more, and he stopped the property, thinking they were stole, and the next day I heard they were Mr. Dutton's, and I went to Mr. Dutton's and told them who I had them of.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you excuse yourself for taking these boot legs from this woman? - She asked me to do such a favour for her, and I did it without a thought.</p>
               <p>Q. To Dutton. What are these three pair of boot legs worth? - I gave five shillings and sixpence a pair, and paid ready money.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for a shoe-maker to mistake the value, and go and sell them for thirteen shillings to another person? - He ought to know the value of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know them to be your own? - I do; she acknowledged taking them; I had not missed the legs before she came in and made a low curtsey; and I said, what is the matter? what do you want? she said, I have taken the legs, and I sent for a constable immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say, I leave it to the mercy of the court.</p>

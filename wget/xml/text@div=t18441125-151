I was at Croydon in the morning, and at Mile-end in the evening—I slept in the Mile-end-road all night—on that day I placed the whole of a drinking-booth in a loft belonging to Mr. Walton, who keeps the Old King Harry—it consisted of the canvass and other things stated—I valued them at about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 30th of Oct. I received information, and came to town—I went to Mr. Walton's, and found my goods were gone—I know the prisoner Taylor—I had given him an odd job now and then, but not regularly—I gave a description of him, I sod after some hours'search I found him near Ratcliff-highway—he took me to Mr. Wren's, in Rosemary-lane—I saw Rayner there on the top of the stairs—he was in his night-gown, just got out of bed—he came down stairs to me—I said to Taylor, "Is this the man you sold the goods to?" he said, Yes, it was—Rayner said it was a bad job, he could not get them back that night, he might the next day, or he could the next day, or some such words—a friend called in some policemen—they searched the house, and some goods were found, some bits of green-baize, some crockery, some glass, a piece of canvass, and a couple of small flags—they were shown to me, and I knew most of them as my own property—it was rather late in the evening—I should say it was after eleven—I saw no pewter measures then—I have seen some since, and a copper boiler, a gravy-dish, and other things—I believe them to be mine—most of them I can swear to—they were some of the articles I had left in the loft.</p>

I am a hawker, and am the prosecutor's brother-in-law, law, I went with him to Rayner's on the 30th of Oct;—I saw the ar<lb></lb>ticles found, which the prosecutor has mentioned—when I went in Rayner was in bed—I went up stairs and called him—he opened his room door, and came on the landing in his shirt—he then dressed himself, and came down—Young said, "I am come about my things"—Rayner said, "I can't get them back to-night, nor yet to-morrow,"but Taylor had before that stamped his foot on the ground, and said, "The things are here"—while Rayner was in the shop, a man, dressed as a sailor, came in and said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "Mind your own business"—Rayner nodded his head to the sailor, as much as to say, "Go out"—the sailor went into the back room, got a light, and went up stairs—some policemen were called in—I went up stairs with them to Rayner's bed-room—we found in his bed-room this piece of baize, and the narrow piece of canvass which bad been cut off the baize; and on the top of the drawers in the room we found some glasses and some cruets—I could swear to two of the dram-glasses, and to the piece of baize—I went into the adjoining room, and found some dishes and plates, which I believe to be my brother-in-law's property—they had been through my hands several times—I went up stairs, and saw the sailor in the front room at the top of the house—he had a light, and there were some beds which he tumbled out of a cupboard—I did not know any property found in that room—I came down, and in about half-an-hour I went up again—I saw the sliding-win<lb></lb>dow in the room in which I had seen the sailor, was a little open—I shoved it right back, and got on the leads—I went as far as the next win<lb></lb>dow, turning towards the left, and in the gutter I found a piece of new</p>

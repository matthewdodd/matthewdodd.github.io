My client is most anxious to avoid a notice being given to his uncle, the surviving trustee of the fund, because it might affect his future prospects; he proposes instead to make a statutory declaration that he has never assigned or encumbered it in any way affecting the same, and I feel certain this will be as operative as any notice; and from what I know of his character, every reliance may be placed upon his honour and integrity. I will get the other information required, and also the certificate of age of his mother.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say under what will he was entitled to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really don't recollect what he said about it; I did not pay much attention to it—I did not select that property—I did not go into it at all; he merely said there was some reversionary property at Limehouse—his original request might have been for a loan of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't exactly remember—it was not 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first—he told me the amount of his debts, and then I suggested, as they amounted to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he should apply for that sum; but I think the first sum he wished me to apply for was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am quite sure it was not 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the sum I handed over to the prisoner was 275<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I had made some advances to him—those advances were subject to the deduction from the office of a policy of insurance, and about 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Mr. Cobbold's costs in investigating the title, which I thought very reasonable.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 38, Harding-street, Ratcliff—on 7th May last, I purchased of Mr. Francis Robert Newton the reversionary interest just mentioned—it was sold by auction, and I purchased it at auction—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the assignment by which the reversion was conveyed to me by Mr. Newton—I paid 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, I won't be certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you happen to purchase any other reversion on that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was a reversion by which the prisoner was entitled to a part of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not got that document with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City detective-officer—on 24th of October last, in company with Underwood, a brother officer, I appre<lb></lb>hended the prisoner on a warrant, which I held from the Guildhall police-court—I saw him at Kilburn; when he saw us he ran away—he gave us a chase over some fields—I caught him at West Hampstead—I asked him if his name was Ridley—he said, "No"—I read the warrant over to him; he refused to say anything on the matter—I took him to the station; he there denied that his name was Ridley—one of the directors of the British Mutual Investment Society came, and then he said he was known by that name.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> By what name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the name of Ridley—I did not tell him, when I first saw him, whether the process on which I was about to take him was a criminal one or a <hi rend="italic">ca sa</hi>—I had seen him some time ago at Pinner, and he then told me he was not the person—I did not know that there was any civil process out against him—as soon as I took him to the station, he requested that Mr. Strutt might be sent for.</p>

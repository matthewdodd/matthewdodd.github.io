                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Deeks, 12, North Street, Manchester, Square—on 25th March, between 3 and 4p.m., I was walking in the, Seven Dials, and had my daughter with me 15 years of age—I went into a bird-seed shop, leaving my purse with my daughter, who was just handing it back to me as I came out, when two men came between us, and snatched it out of my hand, and ran away together into a court in Porter Street—I followed them, but a crowd got between us, and I left them—before they took the purse they had followed us for some distance, and I saw the prisoner so as to recognise him, and pick him out amongst several others at the police-station—I saw nothing more of him—from the description I gave of him I was taken to identify him at the police-station—I have no doubt he is one of the men who took my purse and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a box-key—I knew him again directly I saw him—the key has not been recovered—he had been following us; I noticed them before I went into the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The purse was between us, and I had just got hold of it as it was snatched from my hand—my daughter had my purse, and was waiting for me, and looking into the window, and I had just come out of the shop—I did not look in at the window—there were several people pass-ing—I do not know much about the Dials—I can swear the prisoner is one of the two youths who took my purse—I followed them into a court in porter Street, and they went into some bouse and banged the door, and a lot of people were there and said, "You can't find them"—I identified the prisoner about a fortnight ago at Marlborough Street—he was with about 15 or 20 others in a long row—there were several like the prisoner—they looked about bis age and size.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I had noticed the prisoner and somebody else loitering behind us, and had noticed them sufficiently to identify the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have beard the last witness's evidence—I did not count the lads; there were 12 or 13—some of them were dressed very nearly like the prisoner.</p>

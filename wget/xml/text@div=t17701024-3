There is a room in my apartments that looks into Piccadilly, and two other back rooms that look into Air-street. I was in the back room till eight o'clock at night on the 14th of July, when I went into the fore room, where I staid some time. I locked the door of the back rooms when I went out about nine o'clock; I walked in the park for some time, and then went to the

My landlord let me in when I came home; I went up stairs, and when I put the key into the lock I found it would not turn; upon trying the latch I found the door was unlocked. I am certain I locked it when I went out. As soon as I opened the door I observed that the inside shutters to one of the windows were opened, which I am sure was shut when I went out; this made me suspect somebody had been in my room. When I went a little farther into the room I trod upon some cloaths; this frightened me, and I ran down stairs to Mr. Hemmings for help. We got a candle and went up stairs; I found the lid of my trunk open, out of which were stolen four waistcoats, two pair of sheets, two scarlet cloth waistcoats, a silk waistcoat, mazarine blue, trimmed with silver, a sattin waistcoat with the lace taken off from the flap of the pocket, a linen waistcoat and a pair of leather breeches. I found a drawer open in my chest of drawers, out of which were taken eleven shirts and a pair of sheets; from the chimney-piece was taken a metal watch and a stand in which it stood; from my bed-room, which was an inner room that went out of this, I missed two gold watches that hung by the side of the window, and a hanger that hung near the watches. Henley is a shoemaker; he had been in my room, and seen me open my trunk; he made my shoes; I knew nothing of Conroy. I applied to Sir

            . On Sunday the 22d of July in the afternoon, as I was standing at my door in Duke's Place, the two prisoners came up to me and asked me if I knew one Solomans, a Jew; I told him there were a great many of that name. They proposed to go to an alehouse to drink, which I did. Henley asked me if I would buy a gold watch. I told him I should like to see it, and made as if I would buy it. They said they had not the watch with them, but they would bring it at nine o'clock to me at the Mitre in Duke's Place; they came accordingly at nine o'clock. We went from there to the Blue Boar, in Camomile-street; we went into a private room, and there Henley pulled out the plain gold watch, and offered it me for 7 l. I bid him six guineas for it. (I had no intention to buy them because I suspected they had stolen them ) they said they would take six guineas; then Conroy pulled the other watch out of his pocket, and offered it for sale; he asked me six guineas for it. I asked them how they came by them; they said they did not expect I should have asked them such a question. They said they had some laced cloaths at home to dispose of. I told them I had not money about me to pay for the watches, but I would go home and fetch the money. I went to one Pagett, a constable, for assistance; Pagett staid at the door while I went into the house. I asked them to let me look at the watches again; Henly gave me one of them; I said I would stop them and the watches. Paget came in and took the watch from Conroy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Urry, a pawnbroker, in Deptford—about 7 o'clock on Tuesday evening, 2d January, I missed these three woollen shirts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I had seen safe about half-past 5 or 6 o'clock, hanging inside the shop door, tied up by a piece of cord, which anybody with a pen-knife could cut, but not without coming into the shop first—on Thursday I missed these cord trousers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were hanging outside the shop.</p>

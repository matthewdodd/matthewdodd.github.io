            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Broad Arrow-court, Grubb-street. I have known the prisoner four or five years - my wife had his child to nurse. On Sunday, the 14th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock, he called, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here, Nance, go and get change for this note, and bring an ounce of tobacco and a quartern of gin." He put a note into her hand, she gave it me, and told me to go. I took a bottle, and went over to Mr. Bee's, the chandler's-shop, his wife gave me the change, and sold me the tobacco, which came to 4 1/2 d. I told her the note belonged to Mr. Myers, and she marked it in my presence. I bought a quartern of gin out of the change, returned, and gave the rest to the prisoner - he counted it, and put it into his pocket. Next day he came again, gave her another note to get some trifling articles from the chandler's-shop, she went out, returned with tea and sugar, and gave him the change - he counted it, and put it into his pocket. On the Tuesday following he came again, between eleven and twelve o'clock, and gave her another note to get changed; she went out, returned, and I saw her give him the change, he counted it, and put it into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did he owe you any money - A. He owed my wife some, he gave her 2 s. 6 d., she wanted 4 s., he said he could not afford to give her more. She had lived with him as a servant, eighteen or twenty months, when he kept a house in Bridgewater-square - he has a wife and two children. I understand he has money in the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not proposed to go over to Ireland to avoid coming here - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Was any proposal made to you to go to Ireland - A. Yes; some of his family proposed it to me since he was apprehended.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I had the prisoner's child to nurse. On the 18th of May he came to my room, and gave me a 1 l. note to get changed, and buy some tobacco and gin. I gave it to my husband, he took it out, and brought the change back to him; next day he gave me a 1 l. note to change, and to fetch some tea and sugar. I got it changed at Mrs. Bee's - the things came to 2 s. 2 d. I returned, and gave him the change - he stopped two or three hours with his child, and then went away. Next day he called again, gave me a note, and told me to bring in a quartern loaf and some butter. I changed it at Bee's, and gave him the change. I told her both times whose notes they were, and she marked them; he staid an hour, or an hour and a half. I saw him again the day following, he requested me to get him change for a 1 l. note, and get a bit of bread and ham, which I did - they came to 11 d., and I brought him 19 s. 1 d. change. He called again on the Saturday following, and asked for his child - I told him the mother had taken it home. He left, came again on Sunday at one o'clock, stopped a minute or two, and went away; he came back again at three o'clock, asked me to get change for a note, and bring in a small complement of green ham and a bit of bread. I got it from Bee's, gave her his name on that note, and gave 19 s. 1 d. change; he then went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay out any other notes for him besides what you took to Bee's - A. Never. When I was his servant he paid every thing himself. The most I spent for him at one time was 1 s. 3 d.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence Not ever having had to address a Court, I trust no misconstruction will be put on what I have to say. It is my life for which I am pleading, and also my character. When a man's reputation is once lost, then farewell to future prospects; and I would as soon lose my life as my character, which I have proved, by throwing myself into your hands, instead of accepting the lenity which is allowed in these cases. Knowing myself not guilty, why should I plead guilty? But, knowing my innocence, I place myself under your protection, hoping to show my innocence. I do not wish to say any thing against the proceedings of the Bank; but I must say, there are some, at times, who state themselves to be innocent, and yet plead guilty to the minor offence, being afraid of being convicted of the capital offence; but this is not my case. I throw myself on your hands, and trust to you for an impartial hearing; and to you, Gentlemen, for an impartial verdict. You may be assured I would sooner die than live, should your verdict be against me. Mr. Bee knew nothing of me, but by seeing me pass his shop. Murray lived servant with me for two years, and had many notes in that time to pass. I left Bridgewater-square in consequence of losses, and was afterwards arrested, and was four months in Whitecross-street prison; since that I have lived on my dividend of 26 l. a quarter,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280027"></xptr>and can it be supposed I should so far traduce myself as to become an utterer of forged notes, when I have a comfortable living without labour. On the 8th of April, I received my dividend, and 20 l. of it was in 1 l. notes, all dated the 9th March; I had a child at nurse at Murray's, and it was only natural that I should go there, she was always in want of something, and very seldom without going for a glass of gin. I have given her notes at different times, it appears she and her husband were taken up for passing bad notes, and she said they had them of me. The notes I gave her I had from the Bank, I had no others whatever, I paid no others. Were I an utterer of forged notes, was it reasonable I should go to those who so well knew me. Murray has said, if I would give him 30 l. ready money, he would go out of the way, and not be seen in this country for eighteen months? Why should he who has nothing to fear, wish to compound with one who has every thing to fear? I could have got this money, a friend offered me 40 l.; but no, I would sooner trust myself to a British Jury, than compromise when I know myself innocent, and wait with firmness your verdict; but let it be what it may, I shall not repine, for innocence knows no shame.</p>
               <p>JOS. SWEATMAN. I am a horse-boiler, and live in Grub-street. Just before they were going to file the bill against the prisoner, I saw Mrs. Bee at her shop; some party or other had mentioned, that it was desirous not to hurt the prisoner, provided she could have things settled. When I heard it, I went over to her, and mentioned it, she said that things might have been put to rights, if they had not gone so far. I told her, if she had wished to have done my brother-in-law any kindness, as respected me, she might have told me, and not had him dragged off by the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner any relation of yours? - A. He married my sister.</p>
               <p>MR. SERJEANT BOSANQUET. Q. You went to know on what terms this could be made up, did you take any letter from the prisoner to Mrs. Bee - A. Yes; she looked at it, and said she should show it to some friend, she did not read it, the letter was directed to me, I took it to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you desire her to say she mixed up these notes with those, that she could not distinguish one from the other - A. I do not recollect it, I did not on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. You positively swear it - A. To the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago was it, was it a fortnight, more or less - A. I cannot say. You are getting me to such points, I cannot answer you. The prisoner requested me to go and see how things could be settled; Mrs. Bee observed to me, that if things could be settled, she did not wish to come up here at all. Something was said about 145 l. that was 120 l. for the bail, if the Sheriff should seize, and 25 l. for expences.</p>

I told him I knew nothing about it, but I would show it to a friend.

I said, "Mr, Johnson, come and relieve me," but he went on - he said he had money in his pocket; I then went on to Mr. Townes, a saddler, but he was not at home - I then went on, and was still surrounded by a mob; and, being faint, I slipped off the pavement under a cart, in Newgate-street - when I got up my watch was gone; I should not have known it, but a boy picked up the case of it - the prisoner was then gone; I did not see any one I knew there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. So, then, this woman ran away? A. Yes, Sir; but she was taken in a moment afterwards - I do not rightly know where; I was so pushed about that I cannot tell whether she was taken on the very spot, or was demanding the money, which she said I had defranding her of - she had never ceased to accuse me of defrauding her of the 1s. 6d.; I believe the officer who took hold of me, in the church-yard, is not here - I do not know where she put the first shilling; the sponges were forced upon me - I had no wish to buy them; it was more like charity - the second shilling she put into her mouth; I do not know whether she might have swallowed it - I did not see her searched; there were two men supporting me; I believe it was the street-keeper who took her at last - I cannot say whether any money was found on her; she kept hold of my collar all the way, and a mob of people were about, who seemed to be taking my part, but they might be some of her friends; my watch-ribbon was what she saw - there is not the least doubt of it; I was very poorly, and was tossed about by the crowd - I have had people to inquire about her, who say she is a notorious character; I have not heard that her father is in the employ of Mr. Myers - she had hold of my collar when the officer came up, in the church-yard, and said I had not paid her; but there were persons who had seen me pay her - a man said so, but I have no business to call him - the prisoner had hold of my collar when I slipped down, and that was the time my watch was taken; she nearly fell down.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever got your watch again? A. No; I paid eight guineas for it a good many years ago - it was capped and jewelled.</p>

            . I live in Great Alie-street - I saw a mob in Newgate-street; I ran up, and saw the prisoner holding the prosecutor's collar, and her other hand had hold of his watch-ribbon - almost directly I got up they both fell; I saw a boy bring the watch-case to the prosecutor, and then he said his watch was gone - the prisoner was then gone too; I ran in the direction she went to see if she was stopped - I came up to her in St. Martin's-le-grand, opposite the Post-office; she was there given to the officer by some men who had stopped her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were not in St. Paul's-churchyard? A. No; I had lost sight of her when the prosecutor said his watch was gone - he was not far up Newgate-street, going to the Old Bailey, on the right-hand side; upon my oath, the prisoner had got more than three yards from him before she was taken; I looked to see where she was, and I ran into St. Martin's-le-grand - I did not hear what was said between her and the prosecutor; they fell down nearly together - I did not see whether they got up together, as there was a mob got round them; a very few second selapsed from the time I lost sight of her till she was brought back; I was at the Compter when she was searched; I believe the prosecutor did not come in till afterwards - I did not see any silver, or watch, found on her, or any ribbon.</p>
               <p>JOHN LAYCOCK. I live at No. 3, Hanover-court, Milton-street, Cripplegate. I saw the prosecutor and prisoner together - I saw him pay her a shilling for some sponge, and as he was turning round to walk about his business, she caught hold of him, and said he had not paid her - as they were going along Newgate-street I parted them, and he went on; she then turned round behind me, and caught hold of him again - they both fell down in the kennel, and I pulled them both up; as soon as I had pulled them up a little boy picked up the watch-case, and gave it to the prosecutor - be directly said his watch was gone; the prisoner was then gone - I believe she ran away; I did not see any more of her till the officer was bringing her back - it was between Butcherhall-lane and Bagnio-court that they fell down, and about the second lamp down St. Martin's-legrand I saw the officer bringing her back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A labouring man, but I am out of employ, and have been for a fortnight- I was at that time going to inquire about a situation; I last lived with Mrs. Bailey, in Chapel-street, Grub-street - she is a town carwoman; I have not seen the little boy here who picked up the watch-case - he was at Guildhall the first day; the officer did not ask his name there - I believe he gave his name at the Compter, I do not know to whom - I have had no money, nor any thing else for coming here - I swear I have not talked to the officer about it; I was present at the beginning of the transaction - I did not see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170065"></xptr>any constable before this one; I believe it was the same man who removed them from the church-yard - I did not see the woman in the saddler's shop; I had only seen one shilling paid to her - I saw one sponge, and I saw him pay her a shilling for it; I do not know whether he had any more than one sponge; upon my oath, I have not been promised money for my evidence to-night; I was by them all the time, but when I pulled them out of the kennel she was gone - I cannot say how long she was gone; I went into the Compter, but I believe I was not there when she was searched.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. She did not repeat her charge of not being paid for the sponge, after she got up out of the kennel? A. No - I lost sight of her.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner together in Cheapside; I saw a great crowd cross from St. Paul's-church-yard to Cheapside - they went a little way down, and I followed them; I took the prisoner about ten yards down St. Martin's-le-grand, hearing that she had run away with the prosecutor's watch - I did not see them when they fell down; there was a general cry of the watch being lost, and people were running after the prisoner, which induced me to follow her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the officer who interfered in St. Paul's-church-yard? A. No, that is a mistake of the witness' - I saw them in Cheapside; I saw them going from the saddler's-shop to Newgate-street - the prisoner said the man had not paid her; she had hold of him, and refused to quit him - I separated them, and desired her to go about her business - the prosecutor said he had paid her; I did not take charge of him, because I have such trifling things every day, and I do all I can to get them out of my district - when I took them out of Cheapside and down Newgate-street, I got a good many of the crowd away, and I left them - I saw no part of the first transaction; I took her in about three minutes after he said he had lost his watch - she was running down St. Martin's-le-grand, and was stopped; plenty of people saw her run - I took her from some other person's custody, about ten yards down St. Martin's-le-grand; I searched her in the Compter - I found some halfpence and some sponge on her, but no watch, nor a shilling; I took down the name and address of the boy who found the case - he lives in Ironmonger-row, St. Luke's; I have his name on a piece of paper at home, but I do not recollect it - Sir

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that she had not touched the prosecutor's property, and was only following him to obtain payment for her sponge, which she had never received.</p>
               <p>JURY to C. W. BREWER. Q. Why did you not call out when you saw her lay hold of the watch-ribbon? A. They fell almost instantly, before I had time to speak - I did not see the watch taken from the prosecutor's pocket; I did not mention about the watch till the case was given - I told some person I had seen her hand upon the watchribbon.</p>

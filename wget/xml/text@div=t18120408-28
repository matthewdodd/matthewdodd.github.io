               <p>Q. When did you lose this bottle of wine - A. On the 23d of March; I was moving wine from one cellar to another, the prisoner was employed in my service; after he had got to the cellar in Suffolk-lane, the cellerman went out to open the door, and left him with the wine standing at the cellar door, which were in open baskets; there were ten dozen in the baskets. While he was gone on to the cellar-door, I promiscuously came down the street, I saw the prisoner take a bottle of wine out of one of the baskets, he secreted it in his bosom, and was going to the door where he lodged, which was close by the cellar; I immediately ran down the street, took him by the collar with the bottle of wine in his bosom, and snatched it from him. My cellar man at the same time was opening the door, he saw me have the man with the bottle of wine; I put him in the warehouse and called my clerk while I went for a constable; the cellar man is here, and so is the constable. I only employed the prisoner occasionally as an assistant. This is the bottle of wine, it contains port wine, being part of that ten dozen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took the bottle of wine up with intention of drinking it only; I could not get the cork out. I did not intend to make the least property of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid at 6, Lowndes-square—the prisoner was kitchen-maid there for about two months—on Thursday, 21st May, she complained to me of being ill—she did her work up to 12 o'clock—about 4 o'clock I went up to her room, and found her ill—she told me she was very poorly, but hoped she would be better soon, and I left her—she said her courses had stopped for some time, and she thought they were coming on—she afterwards called me up again—I then saw what was the case, and went down to the housekeeper—I remained with her all night, and next morning the housekeeper sent for the doctor—I was present when he found the body of a child in a small box—it was locked—the prisoner told me where the key was, and the doctor opened it—I Have seen the prisoner with a razor—she used it for cutting her corns.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 33, Sloane-street—on 22d May, about half-past 12 in the day, I was sent for, and found the prisoner in bed, suffering from a flooding—I prescribed for her, and saw her again next day—I examined her, and found she had been delivered of a child—I looked about the room, and ultimately found the dead body of a female child in the box—it was apparently a full-grown child—it was wrapped up in some clothes—its throat was cut on the left side, extending right through the bones of the spine—all the vessels and nerves were cut through—at that early age there would be very little resistance of the vessels—I sent for the police, and on the following day made a post mortem examination of the body—in my judgment respiration had been fully established in the child—respiration might be accomplished before the child was entirely produced—I should say the wound had been inflicted before death—the flesh would present a different appearance if the wound was inflicted after death—the umbilical cord was broken—I cannot say whether the wound had been in<lb></lb>flicted before or after the umbilical cord was broken—when I raw the wound I said to the prisoner, "How could you do it?"—she said, "I did not do it"—it was a clean out—it must have been done by an instrument—such a razor as I saw would probable do it—it could not have been done by the umbilical cord.</p>

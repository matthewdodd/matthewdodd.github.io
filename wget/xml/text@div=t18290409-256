On the 17th of February the prisoner came into one of the private boxes, and asked the shopman to give him a sovereign for a pounds worth of silver; the shopman is not here; I saw him give him the sovereign - he did not seem satisfied, and said, as well as he could speak in broken English, that he wanted it changed for two half-sovereigns; he gave him the two half-sovereigns and then he did not seem satisfied, but wanted one of the half-sovereigns changed for silver; the shopman pulled out the till to do so; the till had been out before - it was just under the counter, opposite the private boxes; he then put the half-sovereign on the counter, put his hand into the till, and said in broken English, how easily any body might help themselves; I saw him draw his hand from the till, and put it down by the side of his trousers pocket; he then took his hand from his side, and put it into the till a second time; I had not seen him put any thing into his pocket, but he was saying something which we could not understand; I watched him more sharply - I was standing on his right-hand side, and saw between his thumb and the palm of his right hand a crown-piece, two half-crowns, and some other silver, which he drew from the till, and put into his right-hand breeches pocket; the shopman and I together accused him of it - he said something that we could not understand, and shifted his hand from his breeches pocket to the side pocket of his coat, or to that part of his person - his hand was under his coat on his left side: Mr. Hows sent for an officer and had him taken - this half-sovereign and the 10s. were laid on the counter during the scuffle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Have you always given the same account of this? A. Yes; I did not state the prisoner asked us to give him change for a sovereign; he wanted a sovereign for silver; he spoke English very imperfectly - we had some difficulty in understanding what he wanted; he pointed to the drawer, that he wanted 10s. for a half-sovereign; I saw the two half-crowns and the crown in his hand, and some more silver; I swear I saw shillings and sixpences in his hand - there were, I suppose, 5l., 6l., or 7l. in the till - it was not so very large; a female was on the same side of the counter as he was - he could see her if he looked round; she is not here, she has left her lodgings; the prisoner made great resistance; Mr. Hows jumped over the counter and seized him, and they were scuffling when I left; he put his hand across to show what sort of silver he wanted - the counter is about four feet high, and about two feet and a half wide - and the till was opposite him.</p>

            . I was sent for, and found the prisoner and Mr. Hows scuffling together; I took the prisoner into the back parlour, and from his left-hand waistcoat pocket I took 2l. 13s. in silver - there was one crownpiece, six half-crowns, and shillings and sixpences; I began to feel at his trousers pocket, and from his left-hand, trousers pocket he drew a purse which contained money -I took it to Marlborough street, where Mr. Plank opened it - it contained thirty-six sovereigns and a half; I do not know why the woman is not here; I went to her lodgings several times, and last Saturday the landlady told me that a Jewess had been there and given her money.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not the prisoner a pack of goods near him? A. Yes, he had: I did not search his coat pockets till we got to Marlborough-street.</p>

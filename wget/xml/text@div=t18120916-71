             came into the yard; he worked for me. He walked about a little while, and presently John Sturges came to the gateway. He came into the yard. They joined in conversation. Reece took up one piece of marble, and brought it to the sawyer's box, where he worked upon; he put it down. Reece took the tub and the pail, that he had water in. He took up another piece of marble, and took it to the box. Reece and Sturges met again, then Reece took the marble to put in the tub; it would not go in. He broke it and threw it in the tub. Hudson, one of my sawyers, was coming in at the gate. Sturges walked up the yard with Hudson. Reece took up the tub with the marble. I immediately ran down stairs, and desired my men to pursue him; and they caught him about an hundred yards off. He was brought back with the tub, with the two pieces of marble in; they were my marble. Reece said, he hoped I would forgive him. I told Sturges, I had been watching them for some time. Sturges said, he had nothing at all to do with it.</p>

I have not found my handkerchief - his hand was in my pocket when I secured him; the other man was within reach of his arm: he ran off; I had used my handkerchief a minute before; he denied the charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. Was you alone? A. I was with a friend; I gave the prisoner to a watchman, and desired he should be searched; I did not say I would let him go, if it was not found on him; my friend said so; it was about eight o'clock at night. He offered to compensate me for my loss if I would let him go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you saw me pass something to the person who was by my side? A. I did see you pass something to the person behind; I was so confused I could not take the other.</p>

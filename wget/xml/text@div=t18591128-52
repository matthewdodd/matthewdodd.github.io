                  </hi> I live in Shepherd's court, Old Nichol-street, spital<lb></lb>fields, and am a coal porter—on 6th September, I went home quite sober about half-past 5 o'clock—I had seen the prisoner before—he lives two doors from the court—I came out about half-past 12 o'clock in the night, and told my wife to come in doors, and not to be quarrelling with the prisoner at that time—the prisoner was calling her all sorts of filthy names, and I told him if he did not leave off I would knock his head against the stones—he said, "I will go and fetch something that will settle you"—he left me, and I went in doors to my family—I remained about 10 minutes, and the prisoner came up the court to my house—I heard a noise outside the door, opened it, and saw a policeman, and my wife, and the prisoner's wife—directly I came out, the prisoner's wife struck me in the face across the policeman's arm—I turned round to the prisoner and said, "If you do not take your wife down the court, I shall thrash the pair of you before you leave the place"—he turned round and hit me on the side of my head with his left hand, and with his right he shoved an instrument into my left thigh—I told the officer to lay hold of him for he had stabbed me—I took off my neck handkerchief and tied it round my thigh, which bled very much—we went to the station—I was taken to the hospital, and was there seven weeks and three days—I am still an out-patient, and am a little lame from it now, but shall get better—the prisoner had challenged me to fight previous to this.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Edward Noland a hatter, of 6, Pearl-row, Spitalfields—on 7th September, I lived at 47, Old Nichol-street, at the corner of Shepherd's-court—the prisoner and prosecutor are both neigh<lb></lb>bours of mine—between 12 and 1 o'clock that night I was in bed and heard a noise under my window—I heard the prisoner and the prosecutor's wife having high words, and he called her very bad names—the prisoner said he would go up stairs and get his knife and do for the <hi rend="italic">crew</hi> of them—his wife said, "Don't, don't"—he went up stairs, and shortly afterwards I heard the prosecutor say, "Oh dear, oh dear, I am stabbed"—I put my clothes on; came to the door, saw the prisoner in custody, and the prosecutor holding his left thigh, saying, "I am stabbed."</p>

                  </hi> I am surgeon to the H division of police—about 1 o'clock on 7th September, I saw the prosecutor at the Spital-square police-station,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185911280064"></xptr>
               <p>and found a large deep wound on the outer and upper part of his thigh—it went inwards four or five inches—the whole of my finger was immersed in the wound in probing it—it went just behind the large vessel of the thigh, and it seemed strange that it had not injured it—it was a most dangerous wound; very deep, but narrow—I had to stop the bleeding by plugging it, so as to stop the hemorrhage till he arrived at the hospital—the whole floor was covered with blood, and he was lying on his back exhausted by hemorrhage—as far as I can judge a knife inflicted it—it was in a lineal position, of from one to two inches wide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you hear Connor describe the way in which I struck at him; and did you not say to the Magistrate it could not be done in the way he described? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said that it was more likely to be done in some other way; because if he struck him in this way it would take him on the outside of the hip, and it would go inwards and downwards; and I conjectured that that was the way the wound was inflicted.</p>

About 1 o'clock in the morning of 7th September, I was on duty in Old Nichol-street, and saw the prisoner at the top of Shepherd's-court, with nothing but his trowsers and shirt on, and a strap round his waist—he said that be would dash some man's brains out, but I did not hear the name—I said, "Why don't you go in doors?"—he said that he should not, and started up Shepherd's-court, followed by his wife and myself—I saw Mrs. Connor standing at her door—the prisoner said to her, "If your husband does not come out, I will give you a dressing"—Connor then came to the door, and said to his wife, "Come in doors, and drop it for to-night," but she refused to do so—I saw the prisoner's wife strike at Connor, on which he said, "Take that woman away, or I shall strike her"—I moved her with my left hand, and the prisoner went round in front of me, and struck two blows at Connor—his left hand went to his head and his right to the lower part of his person—Connor halloaed out, "Policeman, I am stabbed"—he pulled down his trowsers, and there was a quantity of blood pouring down his thigh—I took the prisoner to the station; returned to Connor's house to search for the knife, and found a quantity of lucifers and some blood on the ground—on the way to the station, the prisoner struggled, and said that if he had got the knife, he would do for me as well.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

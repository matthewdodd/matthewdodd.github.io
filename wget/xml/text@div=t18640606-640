                  </hi>. I am a sawyer of 10, High-street, Vauxhall, between half-past 5 and 6 on the afternoon of 18th May, I was in Webber-street, Waterloo-road, and went up to the prisoner's oyster-stall—I had two-penny<lb></lb>worth of oysters, and I paid for them—there was nothing unpleasant between us then—I then went to a public-house, and had some refreshment with another young man—we then went back to the prisoner's stall, and there were some persons larking with the prisoner—I took up a penny worth of whelks with the intention of paying for them, and he said, "The first person who comes and takes up my goods I will stab him with a knife"—I had not said or done anything to him—I took the whelks up, and was taking them round to the back of the board to the prisoner for him to take them out of the shell, and as I was doing so he made use of that threat, and came round to the left side of the board and stabbed me in the back—the whelks fell out of my hands—I was in motion when I was stabbed—it was a violent blow—it went through the sixth and seventh ribs, and penetrated the lungs—it caused me to spit blood for ten days—I had not taken part in any of the chaffing that was going on.</p>

                  </hi>. I was passing down Webber-street on the 18th, and saw a great number of young men round this oyster-stall—I stopped a few minutes, and while there I heard the prisoner say, "Is not this shameful?"—I went over and there were some of them upsetting his oysters; others were upsetting his dishes, and some with whelks in their hands—I said to them, "You ought to be ashamed of yourselves," and the prisoner then said, "The first man that comes round to me again, I will stab him"—imme<lb></lb>diately afterwards he ran after the prosecutor and stabbed him in the back—I do not think he intended to do him grievous bodily harm, but in his temper he stabbed him—I thought the prosecutor was larking with</p>

               <p>him, as well as the others—the men who were with him were—I saw blood flowing from the wounded man, and I went back and said to the prisoner, "I shall detain you until the constable comes," and I did so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 19, Westminster-road, Southwark—on the afternoon of 18th May, the prosecutor was brought to my house in a fainting state—I had him unstripped, and found he had lost a large quantity of blood—his clothes were saturated with blood—he had a punctured wound on the back, between the sixth and seventh rib, rather behind, it had penetrated the lungs on the right side; such a wound could have been caused by this oyster-knife—at first I was very appre<lb></lb>hensive of its being a serious wound, but he progressed favourably—con<lb></lb>siderable force must have been used—it penetrated all his clothing.</p>

On the evening of 18th May, I saw the prosecutor in the Waterloo-road, bleeding very much from the back—I then went to the oyster-stall, where I found the prisoner in Gray's custody—I took him—he told me that he was aggravated very much by the men round him—this oyster-knife was given to me, and I was told in the prisoner's presence that he had stabbed the man with that—he told me that he said the first man who took a whelk he would stab, and the prosecutor did so, and he stabbed him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Canonbury-square, Islington, and am a merchant. On the night of the 17th of October, I took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I had a gold watch with me, a guard-chain, a chain, and seal—I was set down at Holborn-bars, and got home at eleven o'clock at night—I missed my watch and chain, and seal the next morning—I was not aware that I had lost them—I thought I had left them in the City—this is my watch and chain—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—the watch was perfect when I had it—the glass is now broken and the dial damaged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to my uncle, a pawnbroker, in Providence-row. On the 19th of October, at nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner produced the watch and chain, and asked me if it was gold—I asked whose it was—he said it was his own—I asked where he got it—he said he found it in his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I asked him what he was going to do with it—he said to keep it—I sent for an officer, and gave him into custody.</p>

I was fetched, and received the prisoner—I asked him where he found the watch—he said in cleaning out his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, amongst the straw—he did not then say what he meant to do with it, but at the station-house he said he meant to take it to Somerset House to know what to do with it.</p>

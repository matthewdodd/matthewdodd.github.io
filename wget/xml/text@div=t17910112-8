               <p>I live at No. 3, in Bridges-street; a hatter: I was standing at the door, between ten and eleven, the 14th of December; I saw Miss Dipple following the prisoner about two yards from the door; I had not observed the prisoner before; I saw her stop the woman, and the woman gave her the muff; she was about two yards from me: Miss Dipple said, Mr. Gent, this woman has stole a muff; I heard her say to the prisoner, you have stolen a muff from my father; and I conveyed the woman back to Mr. Dipple's back parlour, with the muff; the young woman had not laid hold of her; when she came back, I asked her if it was not a sin, at her time of life, to be guilty of such a thing, and the prisoner seemed to be very sorry, I thought, but answered nothing; when I came into the back parlour, she said she was a widow woman, and lived in Gray's-inn-lane; this was before the father was called down; the muff was laid in the parlour; she was taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the prisoner appear to make any resistance that made it particularly necessary for you to take her to the shop? - Yes, at the shop-door she did; she struggled a little at the street-door.</p>
               <p>Was Miss Dipple with you all the time? - Yes, and went into the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Did you see any woman in the street waiting for the prisoner? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>(The muff deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not see this muff in the shop that day; it might have been sold; but I know it particularly by the damaged place; it cost me 22 s.</p>

               <p>I went into the shop to sell some skins; they did not seem to like to buy them, and I was coming out; the girl pulled me back, and called me a thief; and the horror of being called a thief at these years struck me dumb, and they pulled me to the back parlour; I had done no harm; he said I was an old offender; I never wronged man or woman.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to her character.</p>

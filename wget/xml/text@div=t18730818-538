                  </hi>, I live at 11, Fletcher's Row, Clerkenwell—on Satur<lb></lb>day morning, 12th July, I weut with my wife to Muswell Hill—I met the prisoner and another man, and remained with them all day—I did not know them before—I gave them some beer-we left Muswell Hill at 8.30 in the evening, and the prisoner said "This is the nearest way to the train at Finsbury Park"—we went down a lane, one man stood at the right and the other stood at the left—the other man said to the prisoner "Let him have it in the b----head"—the other man then struck me in the mouth, and the prisoner delivered all the blown into me after that, and knocked me down and put his hand in my right hand pocket, but took nothing out—the other man put his hand in the other pocket and took 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out—they ran down the lane—I was sober, and so was the prisoner.</p>

I am a horse-keeper—on Saturday, 12th July, I saw the prisoner and another man, and the prosecutor and his wife, in the King's Head public-house, Crouch End—I saw them come out and go up a lane, and heard the prosecutor call out—I went up and saw the prisoner holding him down, in the act of striking him—he attempted to get away but I stopped him—I saw the other man run away previously—the prosecutor said he had been robbed—the prisoner said he should go after his mate, but I kept him in custody till we met a policeman.</p>

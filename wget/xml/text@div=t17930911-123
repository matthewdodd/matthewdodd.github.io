I told him yes; says I, I have got no loaf left but a three-penny one; says he give me that; I goes behind the counter and gives it him; he asked me if I sold cabbages? I said, yes; he said, give me a cabbage, and I gave him a cabbage; he asked me what they came to? I told him the cabbage was three halfpence and the loaf was three-pence, four-pence halfpenny in all; he gave me half a crown; I thought by the feel of it in my hand it felt very light; I took up the candle to look at it, and I went to rub it, and as I went to rub it he gave me a blow on my breast, and said don't rub it I will change it for you; with that I asked him how he dare use me so? a woman came in and went between him and me, but what passed between them two I don't say; the woman went out again directly, I did not see what passed between them, but he kept the loaf under his arm and cabbage, but he began to ill use me very much with his tongue; so I sent for an officer and had him taken up as he did not give me the goods nor the money.</p>

               <p>On the 28th of July, Sunday, I happened, by mere accident, to go into this shop to buy some cucumbers, and while I was there buying some things, the prisoner at the bar came in, and bargained for a loaf and cabbage, and he offered a half crown as I suppose, and the woman offered to try it, and he refused to have it offered to be tried whether it was good or not, and he pushed his hand against her breast and said if she did not like it he would change it; a woman came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed? - She held up her apron in this manner, and he emptied some money out of his pocket, which appeared to me to be silver, and which I wondered at, because he looked like a poor man; with that Mr. Lowe came, and he went for the constable. It appeared to be money to me, it might be good money for what I know of, but she received it and went away with it.</p>

               <p>On the 28th of July I was the officer of the night at our watch-house. About ten o'clock in the evening a charge was brought to the watch house for an assault and uttering a bad half crown; I had the prisoner then in custody; having of him in custody I wished to know where he lived, I found out where he lived in a minute, I went to his house and I ordered one of our patroles to attend the house; another person resumed the name of his wife, and I secured one woman and I got admitted into the house, and he told me it was his house, and going into the house I found several pieces of money in a cupboard. (The half crown produced that he had of Mr. Lowe.)</p>

               <p>I have looked at the money, it is counterfeit.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor sent for my wife and persuaded the poor thing to give her some money, a guinea and a half, and after she had taken it she said she would come and get me discharged by the alderman. I was very much in liquor when I went into her house, and if I had known I should have been tried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110191"></xptr>I should have prepared for it; if you will stop half an hour I will send for witnesses. As to this cupboard where this money was found it was for the use of all the lodgers to put their bread in. Ask my prosecutor whether or no she was not going to bail me herself? - No, no such thing.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband keeps the Gun public-house in High-street, Wapping.

               <p>not return it"—I said I should keep it, and give it up to the policeman—the other man said, "We know where we took it, we will go and get it changed"—he went to the door, and went away, leaving the prisoner still there—I sent for the policeman, and gave him the half-crown—it never went out of my hand from the time the prisoner gave it me, till I gave it to the police<lb></lb>man.</p>

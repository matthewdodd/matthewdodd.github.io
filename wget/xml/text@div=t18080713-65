            . The prisoner called on Monday evening; she asked me to let her leave the silk braid till the next morning, then she would call for it, it being late, she said she did tot like to take it home that night. On the next day in the evening the officer called for it, and my mother gave it him.</p>

               <p>MR. WILLIAMS. I am an officer. I was called upon to take the prisoner in custody; she told me she went to a lobster shop, there she bought a lobster; somebody saw the parcel in her hand; she lost the parcel between Mrs. Mackgee's house and the lobster shop; she said she left the braiding at Mrs. Arnold's house.</p>

               <p>Q. You have been in the habit of taking her out to visits and dances - A. No, not but once; she could earn half a guinea a week by her labour.</p>

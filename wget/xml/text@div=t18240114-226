            . On the night Dynan was taken I was at the Coach and Horses, Bolton-street. The officers came. Prichard, the landlord, called the prisoner, who was in the tap-room, and said,</p>
               <p>"Tom, there is a screw loose about the boxes you left here for Dynan." He took him into the passage, and was in private conversation with him when Hesketh came in. I saw the whole party together - this was between seven and eight o'clock at night. I went out, and afterwards saw him in Broad-street. He told me to fetch Prichard over to him, and about half-past ten o'clock I was at the Coach and Horses; the prisoner came in; Prichard said he ought to have been ten miles from town.</p>

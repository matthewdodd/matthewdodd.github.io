                  </hi>. I live at No. 210, Whitechapel-road. In the early part of Dec, I was desirous of borrowing some money—I advertised in the newspaper, and received this letter (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"No. 1, Upper Stamford-street, Blackfriars, Dec. 16th, 1852. J. Rickerby wishes for an interview with Y. Z., as to the loan to be granted for the time named at five percent; an appointment punctually attended, Y. Z., No. 20, Wilson-street, Grays-inn-road.") I did not know who it came from—I have seen the prisoner write, it is his writing—I replied to it, and the prisoner came to me on 15th Dec.—he gave me this card, "J. C. Rickerby, auctioneer and accountant, No. 1, Upper Stamford-street, Blackfriars,"—I showed him the letter, and he said he had sent it—I told him I wanted a loan—he offered to advance money on certain conditions, that I should ensure my life fur 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Gresham-office, through him—I told him I wanted 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said be would advance that on that condition—he showed me sundry papers about the Gresham-office, prospectuses, and reports; and he said, alluding to the reports," You will see by the reports we have been very successful; "and than he gave me these reports and prospectuses (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I am sure he said" we, "he used the word" we "and" our "repeatedly with reference to other matter contained in the report—I saw him again the same evening when be brought this inquiry or proposal paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which he filled up in my presence for me; he examined me respecting the questions and answers and filled it up for me, I told him what to do—he then requested me to sign the paper, and he witnessed the signature—he then wrote this receipt for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) handed it me, and said I was to give him one guinea to hind me to my part of the contract—he stated he wanted that guinea as in many instances he had been at a deal of trouble, and afterwards the parties had declined—I objected to pay him at that time, but made an appointment to see him at his office, No. 1, Upper Stamford-street, the next morning—I paid him the guinea there, and he gave me this receipt with a note stating he was just going out, and was leaving it for me—he said he would let me know as soon as he heard the result from the Insurance-office—I then left him, and did not see him again till he was in custody—I heard nothing from the Gresham-office respecting the insurance—I gave him the guinea believing him to be an agent of the Gresham-office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you appoint an interview with me in your first or second letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I wrote you a note appointing a time you might see me, and you came—the loan of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the interest, and all the <hi rend="italic">minutiœ</hi> were then arranged, and you stated," I will let you have this money on condition you assure in the Gresham-office through me," and there was also to he security</p>

               <p>In bills of exchange—I gave you several references—you gave me the reports, and said, "We have been very successful, you will see how many proposals we have had"—I stated at the time that I should prefer insuring in another office, and said that my father-in-law was agent to another office, and drew your attention to the difference in the rates—you did not tell me I could insure in any office I chose—I positively swear you said, "We have been very successful"—you did not say, "You see the Society has been very successful"—you said, "We have been"—you said the guinea was to insure you from any personal loss from my not performing my part, and I wished it inserted on the receipt that the guinea should be returned if the loan was not granted, that was if you did not perform your part of the contract—(<hi rend="italic">the receipt, at the prisoner's request, was here read as follows</hi>:—"Dec. 16th, 1852. Received of Mr. J. W. Lynn, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as inquiry fee in respect to a loan; to be returned if not granted, J. C. Rickerby)"—I read the receipt before I paid you, and was satisfied with it—I have applied at your premises for the guinea, but did not see you, and I have also written—I deposited the guinea with you on the faith of your obtaining the loan, and also the insurance, one matter was bound up with the other—my references were in Gray's Inn-lane, Guildford-street, some at Islington, and at Loughton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to let him have the guinea? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Believing he was what he represented himself to be, in a position to command the money I required through the Gresham-office—I thought him to be in a position to get the money from there by examining the report, there was a certain manner and mode laid down that the money could be obtained, and believing him to be their agent.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I say the loan was to be granted through the Gresham, or through myself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You did not state; you left me in doubt as to who it came from—the policy was to be held till such time as the bills were duly honoured, and then the policy was to be given up—you did not say the Gresham would advance it to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am loan clerk to the Gresham Life Assurance Society. I have only known the prisoner since he has been in custody—he has nothing to do with the Gresham-office—he was not an agent for loans, and has never been employed by the Society; if he had been an agent for obtaining debtors to the Society I should have known it—he did come to the office and ask me about Hillmer's case, and I said it bad not been proceeded with—when loans are advanced to persons on their insuring, there is a fee for making inquiries as to the securities—the prisoner did not pay me any fee on account of Mr. Lynn, or anybody else—if he had paid it at the office, it must have passed into my hands—I have made inquiries about the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You have other clerks in your office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but not in the loan department—it it usual to give prospectuses to any one who applies for them—if a person represents himself to be an auctioneer or commission agent, or any profession, it is usual to give a commission—there was a proposal left at the office as regards Mr. Lynn—that is it that has been produced—it is not a proposal for a loan, a life insurance only, there is nothing about a loan—it is not requisite to pay any fee with that—if that proposal had been proceeded with, I should have reckoned you ought to have bad a commission on it, supposing you to be an auctioneer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That fee would be from the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did not obtain any money from Mr. Lynn by false pretences; I stated I would get him the loan, but it would be necessary for him to insure his life, in connection with a Bill of Exchange, which he was to give for the amount; he gave me four references, some situated in Essex, and some in Clerkenwell, and I told him I should require 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as inquiry fee; he said he should have no objection to pay, provided it was repaid him I told him I would get a proposal for his life from the office, which would be going on in the meantime; in my business as auctioneer I can get persons to discount bills in connection with life insurances in any company; the guinea was paid to me for the inquiries, I never refused to return it him; it is only because I have been brought up on another charge that he has thought fit to charge me with this; I have often effected insurances in other offices, and was never charged with this offence.</p>

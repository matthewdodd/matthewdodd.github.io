On Tuesday, the 10th of March, about ten o'clock at night, I was in my father's house - the prisoner lodged there - my father had been drinking a little porter, but was sober; the prisoner and I were in another lodger's room down stairs - the prisoner's mother came in, and went up stairs grumbling; she cohabited with my father - she went up stairs muttering; I said to the prisoner, "Your mother has gone up stairs, grumbling as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090094"></xptr>usual" - my father came in shortly after, and went up stairs to his own room; he had not been up stairs long before I heard some China break - I said I would go up to see what was the matter; the prisoner followed me into the room - I saw water scattered all about the room, and the stove pulled out of its place; my father and the prisoner's mother were in the room, with a little boy, eleven years old: I said, "What is all this about?" Mrs. Hales said, "Ask my -;" I said, "Father, will you put up with this usage?" he said, No. he would not; the prisoner said, "Come up stairs with me, mother, and let her and her b - g old father be together" - he and his mother went up stairs; my father followed them up, and said neither him nor his mother should remain in the house, for he would not be so annoyed, and they both should go to the watch-house - he sent the little boy for the watchman, who came and said, "Be peaceable and comfortable together, and have no more words;" my father promised he would not, and while my father was lighting the watchman down, the prisoner caught me by my hair and threw me down on the ground - I screamed out; I had had no quarrel with him before - my father came up with an open razor in his hand - he had not been shaving; he said the disturbance was more than he could bear - the razor was down one pair of stairs before; he said the disturbance was more than he could bear, and he would cut his own throat - I said, "Father, for God's sake don't think of such a thing, and give me the razor;" he gave it me - I shut it up, and put it in my bosom;" the prisoner then picked up a piece of wood which was on the floor in the front of the room, and said, "You old b-r, you are going to cut my throat, are you" - he had seen the razor in his hand, while he was looking for the piece of wood, or something; my father said, "What are you looking for, Jem? what are you going to do? are you going to kill me, I am only an old man?" the prisoner had got the wood in his hand - he said, "You old b-r, I am;" he then took the wood in his hand - it was a thick piece of wood, with a sharp edge; he struck him on the side of his head, and made his head bleed - he fell directly from the blow, and the prisoner went down stairs; he did not strike him a second time -I am quite sure the prisoner picked up the wood after I had put the razor in my bosom: I am sure he must have seen me put it in my bosom - his mother was in the room at the time; he was sober enough to hear me ask my father for the razor - I went down after him, and said,"You wretch, you have knocked my father down, why don't you pick him up;" I did not stop to pick him up, but ran down is a passion after the prisoner - he said it served him right. he had no business to come up with a razor; I staid below about five minutes, and when I got up my father had walked down stairs, and laid on the bed on the first floor - this happened on the second; the prisoner's mother was sitting by his side on the bed, with an oil bottle, which she put to his head - the prisoner went and looked at my father's head; I said, "Is his head hurt" - he pushed me away, and said No, and told me not to frighten myself, he was not hurt; his mother said it was only grazed - I asked if oil was good to put to it; she said Yes, it was good for a graze; I left her with my father, and we all went to bed, and next morning, between eight and nine o'clock, the little boy was sent to tell me Mrs. Hale could not awake my father - I went into his room; he seemed as if he was asleep - this was Wednesday; he died the next day, but never opened either his eyes or mouth - he never spoke after Tuesday night; I fetched two doctors, and he was taken to the hospital, where he died.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your father was quite sober? A. Yes, and so was I; the prisoner was not quite sober - he and his mother had been out drinking since the morning; I had been to the King and Queen public-house, Norton-falgate, and the Fleur-de-lis public-house, Magpie-alley, with the prisoner, his mother and my father - we went to the King and Queen about one or two o'clock, and staid till between six and seven; we drank gin and beer, but very little, for there was very little money - several of us were drinking together; the prisoner and my father went out to pledge some tools of my father's - he wanted 1s. to get some victuals with; we then all went to the Fleur-de-lis, and had a pot of beer and a quartern of gin - my father left his flute at the King and Queen for a quartern and a half of gin; I cohabited with the prisoner, and my father with his mother- I drank nothing after I got home; the prisoner fetched some gin for my father after he had the blow - he and his mother drank it. I did not tell the doctor my father bad fallen against the fire-place, and cut his head - I said he had been struck with a piece of wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, that at the time the prisoner gave the blow your father had the open razor in his hand, and was going to cut his mother's throat? A. No; I know Boston - he is the prisoner's brother-in-law; I never told him so, nor did I tell him to tell the prisoner not to come home to sleep for fear of a row - my father did not put the razor to his mother's throat; it was the noise and vaxation that made my father talk of cutting his throat - he was a quiet man; I was sober - I did take half a glass of gin.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother. In the morning, while I was out, they were out drinking - I was not with them, but between two and three o'clock, when I came home, Harris fetched me himself, and took me to the King and Queen, where they were merry-making: we went from there to the Fleur-de-lis - after a deal of dancing and singing, (the deceased went with us.) he persuaded me to go with him back to the King and Queen between six and seven o'clock - we went from there to the corner of Primrose-street, to the wine-vaults, and then got home between nine and ten; we came home with the deceased - the prisoner had been with us, and also Maria; both of them had been to the King and Queen and the Fleur-de-lis, but I am not certain whether they had been to the wine-vaults - Harris and I came home; the prisoner and Maria came home soon after -I went and lighted the fire in the first floor room, in which the deceased lived; Harris made tea himself, and after tea asked me about some money I promised to lend him - I said I could not get it, and not being able to get him the money, as he had an execution come in, I told him I was quite dissatisfied, and would leave the place and get a room for myself: he asked me if I was determined to do that - I said I was, and he struck me and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090095"></xptr>knocked me down: I cannot say whether any body was present when he did it, or no - neither my son nor Maria were present; there was a noise in the room in consequence of that; I went up stairs - the deceased came up in a very short time with the razor in his hand; my son was in the room before that, going to make his bed to comfort me, because I had been knocked down - the deceased followed me up instantly, with the razor in his hand, and said he would put an end to us all; he ran at me with the razor, and said he would cut my bl-y throat - my son hallooed Murder! I rushed over the arm of the chair, and twisted round to get away from him; when I turned round he was struck over the head - the daughter called out."Oh, father, give me the razor!" and took it out of his hand: I did not see the blow, for he was struck, I suppose as I turned round - he had got his hand to his head, and was walking away; his daughter Maria shut the razor, and put it in her bosom; the deceased went down stairs - he walked down stairs; my son staid in his own room - he was not out of it; the deceased did not fall down at all while he was in the room - they asked me to go down into the deceased's room, as his head was cut, and I went; it was about ten minutes before I got into his room, I observed his head was cut, and he put his hand to it; I saw it was hurt, but it did not bleed much - he was standing up; his daughter was there, and did not know what to put to it - I had a little bottle of oil, which had cured me of a broken arm, and I put some to it; he went to bed, and arose up as the watchman called three o'clock - he appeared ill; he said his head ached very bad - it was bound with his handkerchief; there was no assistance till the afternoon, when I came home - he appeared in the morning to be in a sound sleep, and in the afternoon I went with his daughter to Spital-square; I waited while she went in - she came out, and said the gentleman told her he might never awake again, and advised his being taken to the hospital; he was taken there.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he rushed towards you with the razor in his hand? A. Yes, and said he would do for us all; I never saw any body in such a vehement passion in my life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Maria share in the drink at the King and Queen? A. Yes, she drank porter and gin, and was dancing and singing; she was there twice, and drank each time - she had beer and gin at the Fleur-de-lis.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the deceased came up with the razor in his hand, who was nearest to him? A. I was, for I was by the door - it is a smallish room.</p>

I was set to watch; I heard the lead thrown down about three o'clock, and the tiles rattled down the gutter; there were two men came to me up in the building, and I saw two more on the ground; I cocked my pistol, and told them if they did not stand still I would shoot them; they ran down; I called the watchman, as he was calling the hour; he stood on one side and I on the other; I called my master; we found the prisoner in the house fast asleep, about an hour after the lead was thrown down.</p>

               <p>Court. What time of the day was you with him? - The fore part of the day, it may be ten or eleven, I cannot say to the hour, but it was before dinner, I was with him above half an hour, we had a pint of beer, he told me to come the next morning and they should be cleaned, I came the next morning to the same place, and they told me he was gone to clean them, in Fleet-market, I went down there to him, and he was at work cleaning them, that was before nine o'clock, or between nine and ten, I stopped while he cleaned three hilts, I suppose it took him an hour and half, or two hours; he went from there to fetch me some swords, I staid for his coming back, he did not return, and I heard he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Court. How was he dressed; - He had a great coat on, when he was at work at the wheel, and I believe he had nothing under it but a waistcoat, and his sleeve was tied up, with either list or garter; he always bore a very good character, I have dealt with him for many hundred pounds.</p>

               <p>What were they? - I suppose Clarke knows.</p>
               <p>They were dies? - I fancy they were dies, I only saw them at a distance, I cannot remember.</p>

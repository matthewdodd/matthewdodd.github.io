                  <hi rend="italic">conducted the Prosecution</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM SMITH</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). I received instructions on Monday, 6th October, from Mr. Moore, the manager of Brook's Wharf, in consequence of which I went with West wood to Upper Thames Street about 12.30 or 1 o'clock and watched the wharf—about 2.10 I saw a van pull up at the wharf; I asked Westwood to follow it and I went after him; it stopped in Cannon Street—the driver looked round as if expecting some one, we then followed him to Eastcheap, where he stopped opposite the Cow and Calf and went into a beershop in Love Lane—I ordered Westwood to follow him—he returned to his van and drove to Stratford and from there to 25, Cambridge Terrace, West Ham—he knocked at the door and went in—I went in, and while talking with him, Cox came up—I told him I was a police officer and should take him in custody for being concerned in stealing tea, pointing to some tea in the shop and the remaining portion of it in the van—he said "I know nothing about it"—I said "You occupy this place?"—he said "I don't, it is Mr. McQuillen's"—one of the witnesses said "You know you do, Mr. Cox"—I inquired for the landlord and Sinclair came and said that he did occupy it and paid 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for it—Sinclair also said "Who is the other party who comes with you?"—Cox said "I don't know and I decline to say"—there was nothing to show that business was being carried on there—I found three empty tea chests there—I took him in custody, took possession of the tea, left Westwood there, and took Cox to Bow Lane police-station, where I charged him for being concerned with others in stealing the tea—he gave his address 48, Lichfield Road, Bow, and about 10.30 p.m. I went there with Westwood, and in a back parlour or kitchen, found Stephens, Wigmore, and another person, and Cox's wife—I asked the wife who those persons were, she said that one was her husband's brother—I had stated that we were police officers—I asked Stevens his name—he said "Stevens"—I said "You are employed at Brooks' Wharf?"—he said "Yes, I am a scaleman"—I said "I shall take you in custody for being concerned with Cox in stealing tea"—I then said to Wigmore "Your name is Wigmore?"—he said "Yes, Joseph"—I said "I shall also take you for being concerned in stealing the tea"—</p>

               <p>Stevens said "I know nothing about it"—Wigmore made no reply—Stevens afterwards said "I met Wigmore in the Bethnal Green Road this afternoon; no, I mean this evening, and he told me there was some trouble"—Stevens said in the cab "I know nothing about this affair" and afterwards "I am sorry I am in this trouble"—I took them to Bow Lane—I have omitted that I said to Wigmore "You were in a public-house with Harrison, the carman, this afternoon"—he said "Yes"—I said "Wigmore said you had not that overcoat on then"—he said "No, I had not"—two or three days afterwards I went to No. 10 or 11, Little George Street, Minories, and found these documents relating to sweepings and to the delivery of tea at different wharves and docks—that is where Wigmore carries on business—he has. only one room—I understand they are sampling orders by which he could get access tothe wharf—I found on Cox this document relating to the rent of No. 25; it has Wigmore's name on it—I also found on Cox this newspaper report of a tea robbery at the Mansion House.</p>

You came to Cambridge Terrace 10 or 20 minutes after I arrived—Mr. McQuillen said to you "Oh, Mr. Cox, why do you bring us into this trouble?"—you at first denied being the occupant of the place—that was why the landlord was sent for—we had got the four half-chests of tea reloaded before you arrived, but they had been into your house—I said to Harrison, the carman, "Is this one of the men engaged in this transaction?" and he said "Yes."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a delivery carman in the employ of Thomas Warner and Son, of Brooks' Wharf—on 5th October, at closing time, 4 o'clock, as I was leaving I saw Cox and Wigmore—Wigmore asked me if I knew Joe Cook, and would I fetch him—I said "Yes," but I could not find him, and came back and saw them outside a public-house at the top of the street; Cox said "Will you come and have something to drink?"—we all four went into a public-house, and they said "Would you like a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note? "—I said that I should—they said that I could have one by letting goods go away from the firm that I served, and they would give me the money in the evening—they suggested that a carman should come down with a list, and that I should honour the list and give the goods, and that Harrison should be the carman, and I should know him by that name—Stevens said he would see that the goods on the list should be goods in the ware<lb></lb>house—the pass was to be taken by Stevens or myself in the event of their getting the goods—it was to be given by me—I. was to take it from the gatekeeper's file—the prisoners were all present at this conversation—the passes taken by the gatekeeper are checked every night by the warrants, and if one was taken away it would destroy his record—I then left them, and on Monday morning I told Mr. Moore, and received instructions from him, and about 2 o'clock on Monday afternoon a van came to the wharf driven by a man who I now know as Harrison—he handed me this list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a warrant is lodged first, and then the list is brought to, me, and I select the goods to be delivered. (<hi rend="italic">Read: Per Harrison, please deliver</hi> 20 <hi rend="italic">chests of Congou</hi> 281 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 300 <hi rend="italic">per Holman's</hi>.) Those were rotation numbers of chests on my floor; they had come by the ship Placenta—Stephens was the foreman; it was his duty to see that it was done—he would have cognisance of all matters contained in that document—I delivered the tea and gave Harrison this pass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was my duty to have the Customs warrant</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Cox</hi>. I have been rather over four months in Mr. Warner's employ—previous to that I was at Hay's Wharf—I believe I had a character from there—I got a week's notice to leave—I was rather puzzled over a ship; they thought I was incompetent, and discharged me—my meeting with you was quite accidental as far as I was concerned—we adjourned to the Hatchet public-house and drank there—Stevens joined us just as we came out of the wharf, and I think he accosted me—I admit that I was slightly inebriated, but I recollect all that occurred, and told my employers—a man came in who I told you was the night watchman—I know you suggested robbery, and I acquiesced in it—you asked me if I should like to improve the state of my funds and I said "Yes, they are not very plentiful"—I do not remember lending Stevens two shillings; you gave me a half-crown to go and get something more to drink.</p>

I had received from him—you did not assist me in delivering the chests of tea to Harrison—I did not see you—I should give it to the loop<lb></lb>hole man, and he would give it to Collins, who would get the goods out and send them down. to me, and I should deliver them.</p>

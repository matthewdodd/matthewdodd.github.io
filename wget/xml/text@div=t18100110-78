            . I am a poulterer. I live opposite of Mr. Buck. I was in my own shop, I saw the prisoner at Mr. Buck's door; he went away about ten yards, he came back again, looked in the shop, he put his hand in the door to where the goose laid; he took the goose away from the shop; I ran after him; there was a woman waiting for the goose, whom I saw him give the goose to, the woman ran off; I came up to him, told him he had taken a goose out of the shop and given it to the woman; I called out stop her, she has got a goose; she dropped the goose. The prisoner turned down a gateway where there was no thoroughfare; I picked up the goose, took it into Mr. Buck's shop, laid it on the counter, and told Mrs. 
               <persName id="t18100110-78-person673">Buck</persName>
             this man had stole the goose; I went down this yard and there I found the prisoner in a privy belonging to a private house; I took him back to Mr. Buck's, he took him in custody. The woman ran away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going past that way, I happened to go into this privy, this gentleman came and took me out, he said I was the person that stole the goose, because I had a brown coat on.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Swayne Jump, a tobacconist in Carburton-street, Fitzroy-square. On the 21st of June, the prisoner came for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco—he gave me half-a-crown, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I looked at the half-crown, and said, "Is it a good one?"—he said he wished he had fifty of them, he should be a better man than he was—he then went out, returned immediately, and said, "You have given me a bad shilling"—I said I had not, I had no bad money—he said, "You must change it"—I gave him a good shilling for it, and took it back—I wrapped it up in a bit of paper, and took it down stairs—it was not fit to show to any body—I feel quite confident it was not the</p>

               <p>one I gave him, but I gave him another for it, because I felt rather alarmed at his appearance, and thought I had better lose the shilling—I kept it distinct—on Sunday, the 23rd, he came again for the Dispatch newspaper, which comes to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him change, and he went out in a moment—Mr. Mason came in and spoke to me—I gave him the half-crown—he ran out, and brought the prisoner back—the prisoner asked me to take the money back, and give him the half-crown—he asked me not to give him in charge, and went down on his knees—I said, "Let the man go, as he has given the change back," but Mr. Mason would not let him go, and then he seemed to be resolute, and tried to knock the half-crown out of his hand.</p>

I saw the prisoner pass to and fro, by the parlour windows, and the shop door, looking about—I had some suspicion, and, directly he came in, I concealed myself behind the door of the partition which divides the shop—I heard him ask for the Dispatch, and I heard some money pass—the moment he was gone, I said to Mrs. Jump, "Let me look at that money?"—I felt it, and put it to my teeth—I ran after him—he seemed very much alarmed, put down the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said, "Give me my half-crown?"—he went down on his knees, and Mrs. Jump said, "Let him go," but I would not—after that he tried to knock the money out of my hand, and tried to get past, hut I held his collar—he was very abusive, and said I should tear his clothes, and I would not buy hint more, and so on—I gave the half-crown to the policeman—on the way to the station-house the policeman took it out, and the prisoner knocked it out of his hand, and struck me with his right hand—we had a great struggle to get the money—a female came up, and tried to get it, but I got it, and gave it to the policeman again.</p>

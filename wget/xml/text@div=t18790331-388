I am a medical student and live in Bartholomew Close—on 6th March, about 5 o'clock, I saw the two prisoners together in Chis<lb></lb>well Street; I followed them into Beech Street, Barbican; they there met a man carrying a hamper; they took it off his head and had some conversation; Gower gave him dome money and the man then left them and went towards Finsbury Square—the prisoners each took hold of the hamper and carried it to the top of Red Cross Street, they met a man there with a costermonger's barrow and spoke to him, and then placed the hamper on the barrow and all three went on together, Gower pulling one side of. the barrow assisting the man, and Gardner walking on the footway—I followed them into Charter-house Street, I saw Sergeant Coldery, and gave him information; we followed them and they were taken into custody—I went with them to the station—the hamper was opened there and contained 50 pairs of boots—this is the hamper and these are some of the boots.</p>

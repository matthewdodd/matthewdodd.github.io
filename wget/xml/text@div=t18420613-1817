                  </hi>. I am shopman to Thomas Henry and David Henry. The prisoner came on the 31st of December—she said Sherman was ill at home, and she had come for her work—believing that, I gave her forty yards of sackcloth to make up—she was to have brought it back in two or three days, but in three weeks or a month I found this cloth at the pawnbroker's—it is our cloth, but I cannot swear it is what I gave her that morning—I made inquiries of her about the work, but she had previously sent a man she said was her husband, with the duplicate.</p>

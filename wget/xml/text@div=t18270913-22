On Saturday, the 16th of June, I came from market, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, and am certain I had this money in my purse, which was in my bag - I gave her some things to carry down stairs, and went up into the dining-room; she came up soon after and said, she had had a fall; I gave her a glass of wine; she went up stairs, and I went up to my room, and then missed my purse - I had been home about half an hour; I sent her to look on the stairs for it, with a candle; she continued with me till the 23d of July; our lodgers discharged their servant; she charged the prisoner with something, and we all went up to the prisoner's room to search her box; nobody but her slept there. I found in a box there, (of which she had the key.) my purse, with other things; the box was not locked; it contained nothing else but her apparel - I am confident of the purse, having made it myself - it was empty; she knew it to be mine as well as I did - she had frequent opportunities of seeing it; she was present, and directly it was found, she knelt down and begged forgiveness, and said she would never do the same again. I had simply said,"Oh! Emma, how could you do this?" the box was not hers; she had none, and used this of mine, which I had no objection to.</p>

They were safely traced as far as Calais, and were stolen from the train after leaving that place. On the 4th September, a month afterward, the prisoner was-found dealing with them in London, and the question arose as to the jurisdiction of this</hi> Court <hi rend="italic">to try the case, the robbery having been com<lb></lb>mitted in France.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE DENMAN</hi>. "<hi rend="italic">There can be no doubt that this was a larceny fully completed in France. I do not at all say that it might not be a very reasonable thing that any one afterwards dealing here with property so stolen might make cogent evidence of having received them knowing them to have been stolen, just as much as if they had been stolen in England, but it appears to me that the point has been too solemnly decided for me to give the go-by to those decisions. It has been solemnly decided and acted upon so often that there is no jurisdiction in England to try a case where the stealing has been committed abroad, either against the principal or the accessory, that I have nothing to do but to act upon those decisions, and to direct an acquittal in this case. I entertain no doubt that the case of Rex</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Prowse is directly in point, and Reg</hi>. v. <hi rend="italic">Madge fortifies it to the extent of recognising and acting upon it. Debreuile's case also decides that a conviction of receiving under similar circumstances could not be sustained. The prisoner must therefore be acquitted.</hi>"</p>

               <p>Mrs. BOWLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the goods being lost that are mentioned in the indictment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Whose property were they? - The property of Mr. Smith, who is a <rs id="t17791208-16-viclabel88" type="occupation">gardener</rs>

               <p>Was the box open or shut? - It was a fort of a hand-box tied up in a cloth.</p>
               <p>How came you to know what that box contained? - I did not know, till it was brought back.</p>
               <p>What time in the day was it? - I think about six o'clock in the evening. I was in the shop, about two yards beyond the box. Mrs. Smith had come to town that afternoon, and left it in the shop on the tub. I was either with my side or back to the door, I cannot say which. I imagined I heard a noise, which occasioned me to look towards the door, and I saw a man going out of the shop with the box.</p>
               <p>Was there a light in the shop? - Several.</p>
               <p>Where is your shop? - In Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>What did you do upon that? - I went to the door, and cried stop thief! or stop him! I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Was he stopped? - He was brought back.</p>
               <p>Do you know by whom? - By a gentleman who lives in Fleet-street; he is not here; he only assisted to bring him back.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080023"></xptr>Was the box with him then? - No; they said he had dropped it at the end of Camomile-street.</p>
               <p>Did you see him stopped? - No; I saw him run along the highway till he turned the corner of the street; then I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>How long was it before he was brought back? - Within five minutes, I believe.</p>
               <p>When you saw him turn the corner had he the box with him? - He had.</p>
               <p>Was the box ever brought back? - Yes; in a quarter of an hour after, by a woman who sells greens at the corner.</p>
               <p>Is she here? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before this at all? - Not to my knowledge; we sent for a constable; he was secured, and has been in custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the man you saw go out of the shop, and run away with the box, is the man that was brought back? - I cannot say that I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>What did the box contain? - I have a list of the things here which was taken from Mrs. Smith's list this morning.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot give that in evidence.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect what the things were from seeing them in the box? - I did not see them till the prisoner was before the alderman the next day.</p>

               <p>On the 29th of October, between five and six o'clock in the evening, as I was coming by Mr. Bowley's door, I observed the prisoner, and another man with him, looking into Mr. Bowley's shop; judging their intention by their appearance, I rather stepped by them, and turned round, when I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Bowley's shop. I saw him take up the box, containing the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>How do you know what the box contained? - I know it since by seeing them. He brought the box out of the shop. I stepped up upon the step of the door, and heard Mrs. Bowley cry out thief! he ran into the middle of the street, and came on the pavement again, and turned down Camomile-street. I pursued him, and overtook him in Camomile-street. I never lost sight of him from the time he came out of the shop till I overtook him; he dropped the box in the middle of the highway at the end of Camomile-street. I laid hold of him, and carried him back to Mr. Bowley's shop.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the man? - I am very certain he is the man; he was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>How soon after did you know what things were in the box? - The next day at the Mansion-house; they have been ever since in the custody of the constable.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Bowley. Is the prisoner the man that was brought back to your shop? - That is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Russel. Whether you brought me into the shop? - I did, and then went back to see for the things; a woman, who keeps a stall at the corner of Camomile-street, had taken the box up.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the box never opened when it was brought back to Mrs. Bowley's shop? - Not to my knowlege.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How far was you from me when you saw me drop the box? - About two yards; I was obliged to jump over the box to prevent myself falling.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Did you, on the 29th of October, leave a box in the shop of Mr. Bowley? - Yes; a paper band-box tied up in a handkerchief; it contained the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). I left it about three o'clock; it was tied up in a white cloth, and corded as I brought it from the stage. I was in the house at the time. I put it on a tub, or something that raised it from the ground as high as the counter.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to Russell. At how far distance was you when you saw me go into the shop? - Close by the shop-door; the other man, who was with the prisoner, saw me, but the prisoner did not, as his back was towards me.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Bowley. Did you see Mrs. Smith set down the box? - I cannot say whether Mrs. or Mr. Smith set it down; I saw it immediately after.</p>
               <p>Was it corded when you saw it? - It was.</p>

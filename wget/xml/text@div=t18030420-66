               <p>Q.You say that Warren gave you a note - when did he give you that note? - A. On the Saturday, after we were out.</p>
               <p>Q.For what purpose did he give it you? - A. He gave it me to huy half a dozen cups and saucers, which I bought.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I don't know whether you were acquainted with the fact, of some cups and saucers being broke? - A. Yes, and they were to replace those that were broke.</p>
               <p>Q.Isael, the Jew, you say, gave you a one pound note, and Warren the other? - A. Yes, and it is impossible for me to say which of the notes I gave to Mrs. Groffnell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Q. Look to those gentlemen, and recollect what my Lord has said to you, respecting your own situation - how soon after you left Newton-street, did the prisoner give you a one pound note to purchase some cups and saucers? - A. I cannot exactly say how long.</p>
               <p>Q. How longbefore you went into Groffnell's shop? - A.Just before.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to Groffnell's door, when he delivered to you the one pound note? - A. I cannot exactly say, I was near it, I dare say I was in sight of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he direct you to go to that shop to buy his cups and saucers? - A. Not directly to that shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How many paces? - A. I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you further than you now stand from me? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Further than the Gentlemen of the Jury? - A. I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep the note which you received, in your hand, till you delivered it to Mrs. Groffnell? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it then, if you did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200077"></xptr>not keep it in your hand? - A. I put it into my pocket-book which had the other note.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Isael's an older note than the other? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you deliver the cups and saucers first to Warren? - A. I fancy it was at the door, the fatigue was not a great deal; then I proceeded with him to the glover's.</p>
               <p>Q. And there you changed Isael's note? - A. Yes, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you any doubt the one that you passed at the glover's, was Isael's? - A. I cannot say, I speak to the best of my knowledge; I passed two as I have already informed you, Mr. Warren's was one, and Mr. Isael's was the other; I had only two notes in my posession, I am telling the exact truth.</p>
               <p>Court. It is impossible to go on any further, a great suspicion hangs about this woman, as to the manner of giving her testimony, but the first step in the cause is to identify the note, she will not undertake to say that that is the note she gave to the china woman. <rs id="t18030420-66-verdict354" type="verdictDescription">

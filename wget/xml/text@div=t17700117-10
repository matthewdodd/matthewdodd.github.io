My master was going out that morning, and gave me his gold watch to lock up in a drawer. He went out soon after ten o'clock. I locked it up and returned him the key; and at eleven I saw the prisoner in that room. As soon as my master came home I dressed him. The company were all come just before the clock struck four: dinner was ordered to be upon table. When the waiters came to bring the dinner, they brought the prisoner and the gold watch together.

            , No. 78. I have been at the maker's house with it. There was a gold chain and a gold hook to it. It used to hang at master's bed's head. The prisoner had taken the hook and a gold ring off, and he told the pawnbroker where they were, and he went and got them. The pawnbroker put them to the watch, and my master has got the watch with him.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Kates, pawnbroker in Chandos-Street. On the 29th of December in the afternoon, a woman brought this watch to pawn. I asked her how much she wanted upon it: she hesitated some time, and at last said as much as I could lend her. She seemed not to know whether it was a gold or metal one; first she asked twenty pounds, then ten. She said a gentleman sent her. I told her it was necessary to see that gentleman. She took me to him. I got assistance and took him into custody. It was the prisoner. He acknowledged he sent her with it, and claimed it as his property. I had one of Mr. Fielding's men with me. We took him into my master's parlour; there he acknowledged how he came by it. Then we took him to the prosecutor, who said by all means he would prosecute him. I heard him acknowledge he took the hood and ring off, and where they were. The key that was delivered to me by a woman where we had the ring and hook, opened the lock as well as if made for it.</p>

On 28th April, when the prisoner came, I saw her stooping down, and afterwards found the tobacco in her handkerchief; she was afterwards called into the counting-house—the tobacco was put on a chair—she was asked if that was her handkerchief, and she said, "Yes"—I asked her what she was going to do with it, and she said she was going to take it out to some man—I do not know whether she mentioned the name of Smith—I think it</p>

Taddy's—I found him in the passage, and said, "Smith, you know me," (I was in plain clothes)—he said, "No;" I said, "I am a police-sergeant, of this division, I want to speak to you, come up stairs"—I went up stairs, and said, "Is this your bedroom?" he said, "Yes;" it was the first floor front—the key was in the lock, and I unlocked the door—we both went into the room, and I looked round and saw a bag containing 33lbs. of leaf tobacco, quite damp—I said, "Smith, how do you account for this?" he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "You have been receiving tobacco for some time from a woman named Frances, in Messrs. Taddy's employ in the Minories"—he said, "I do not know her"—I said, "You received 10lbs. weight last night of her"—he made no reply to that—I saw some weights and some scales with leaf tobacco on them, which was damp; also some damp tobacco on the floor; some was adhering to the scales—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took him into custody; he is not a dealer in tobacco, he keeps a lodging house for sailors.</p>

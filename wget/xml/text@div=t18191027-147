            . I keep an old-iron shop, No. 13, Hampstead-road. On the 19th of October, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me, alone, and brought four pieces of lead-pipe, which weighed 18 lbs.; it was very dirty, and appeared to have been cut and laid in a ditch, it smelt very badly. He said he found it in a ditch, and offered it for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask where the ditch was - A. No. He frequently brought old rags to sell for his father. I asked if his father sent him? he said No. I told him to send his father to me. He went away directly, leaving the lead, and never returned. I gave it to Davis next morning, and told him who brought it - he was taken up next day.</p>

            . I am a plumber. On the 22d of May I put the lead on the house, over the water-butt, in an exposed situation; I afterwards saw it in the custody of Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say the lead you saw in custody of Davis was part of the pipe - A. The colour was much altered - it could never have got so black; if it had been stolen and laid in a ditch, that might alter its appearance. I fitted it to the pipe, and it made up the deficiency - it was the same size.</p>

            . The lead was delivered to me by Warden. I saw it applied to the pipe, it fitted exactly in every part. It was not cut exactly even - it fitted also to the ball cock; I have no doubt of its being part of the pipe. I took the prisoner about an hour afterwards. I had the lead, and told him I wanted him; he looked at me, and said,</p>
               <p>"That lead I found in a ditch."</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Robert Johnson, of No. 68, Cornhill—it is his dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Peter, on Corn<lb></lb>hill. I was going up stairs about ten minutes before five o'clock, on the evening of the 20th of Jan.—I saw a shadow of a young man in the bed-room on the fourth story—I knew the person to be too tall for Mr. Atkins—I said, "Is that you, Mr. Daniel?"—no one answered—I then said, "Is that you, <hi rend="italic">Dan</hi>?"—the person said, "Yes," but I knew it was not the person I called for—I stood a few minutes, then ran down, and saw Mr. Atkins in the shop—I told him to keep his eye on the door, that no one went out—I told the porter to come up stairs with me, as there was a man there—he came up with me to the kitchen, which is on the second floor, and the prisoner was stooping down at the door, putting the waistcoat, scarf, and handkerchief under the table—I had seen these things safe at three that afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Curzon-street, on the 13th of April, and in consequence of information, I turned round, and went in pursuit of the prisoner—I saw him run down against the market, and drop my hand<lb></lb>kerchief—I took it up—this is it, my name in on it—it was safe in my pocket just before.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">policeman C</hi> I.) On the the 13th of April, between one and two o'clock, I heard a cry of "Stop thief," in Shepherd's-market—a man caught the prisoner in his arms; I collared him, and took him back, and met the prosecutor with handkerchief in his hand—there was a labouring man who said he saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from the prosecutor's pocket, but I could not get him to go down to the station-house.</p>

               <p>Did you know the persons of the prisoners? - I had had information of them before, I knew the tallest, Langford, before, I watched them for a quarter of an hour, I saw them both, during the time I saw Petrie passing the window, I could see them perfectly, I was but a little distance, Petrie fixed his back against the window in Little Peter-street, and I saw him fumbling along, while at this wooden pannel that he broke in, they both then went up Bowling-street eying the window.</p>
               <p>Did you see him break it in? - No, I saw him a fumbling, which made me have a strong suspicion that they meant to rob the shop; there is a court in Bowling-street, called Oliver's-court, and they both of them went in there; I saw them return and pass this shop, I went to carry my tools home, and I went for my cutlass, and I returned immediately, and when I returned the robbery was committed; the men were gone away, I went in pursuit of them; I took them before Justice Abingdon, and saw no more of them that night.</p>
               <p>Are you positive those are the two men? - Yes, I viewed them near a quarter of an hour or better, and they were not further from me much than you are, I am positive they are the two men, I passed them several times.</p>

               <p>Did you see the prisoners do any thing? - We saw them walk backwards and forwards looking in at the window, then they both joined together about the part where this pannel was broke, the pannel was pushed in with a knife, we did not see them brea n the pannel, they were in the dark<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220031"></xptr> part of the window, but we saw them there, and saw them go by with nothing, and then Langford came away with a bundle, it had the appearance of cloaths, it came from the direct spot where that pannel was broke, the prisoners ran one one way and one the other, and we tried to overtake them but could not, and in about a quarter of an hour we took them, we met with them in Duck lane both together and took them, they had nothing with them, then we searched them, and found on

               <p>Is the account that Persival has given a true account? - I can explain it a little better in some respects if you please; first I was called by Watson, he told me there were some thieves, I went with him, and we called on Persival on our way, when we got into Bowling-Alley, almost facing the house on the opposite side of the way, we met the prisoner Langford, and I believe Petrie, but I am not quite so clear to him as the other; says Watson, there they are; then we went into an area the corner of Tuffton-street and concealed ourselves, and presently they came back round into Little Peter-street to this place where the pannel was broke out; the low part of the sash they fill up with pannels instead of glass, and painted dark, which made it rather dark that we could not see what they were about; when they came back to Bowling-street to us to that particular place; immediately I saw the cloaths slide off the rail, and them two men at that identical place, I could see into the shop by the light that was in the shop, I saw very plain the cloaths slide off the rail, but I could not perceive their arms so plain as if the other pannels had been glass, one of the prisoners passed us and out-run us, we tried to pursue them, but we knew them so well we were in no doubt of finding them again: I do not speak so clear to Petrie as I do to Langford: We took them soon after in Duck-lane.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the dress of the other prisoner? - Not so well my Lord, we found these two knives upon them, and one of them matched with the impressions that were made on the wood, and it much about fits these things, they are rabbitted on the inside, and bradded in with bradds.</p>
               <p>Jury. What distance was the area you was concealed in? - About thirteen or fourteen yards.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Barnard. Had you had any occasion to take notice of this pannel before this evening? - They were all secure for what I know.</p>
               <p>Do you know that they were secure? - I am pretty clear they were, they were all safe between three and four.</p>
               <p>Jury. How high was the rail from the ground where the cloaths hung? - I cannot justly say, it was breast high.</p>
               <p>How low down was the pannel? - I cannot say.</p>

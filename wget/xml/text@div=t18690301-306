                  </hi>. I live at 7, James Street, Somers Town—on Saturday night, 23rd January, I was standing on the footpath near the bridge in the City Road—I saw the prisoner there, running about the road—I suppose he had a knife in his hand, for he cut my throat and ran away—he did not say anything—I had not had any dispute or quarrel with him—I had never seen him before—I had no companions with me, I was by myself—I was standing quite still—the prisoner ran up and cut me; I expect it was done on purpose—I had seen him running about the road about two minutes before—I did not see him quarrelling with anyone—he had his coat and hat off—he was not drunk, that I know of—I was taken to the police-station, and the doctor attended to me—I saw the prisoner at the station; he appeared sober then.</p>

I live at 22, Aldenham Street, St Pancras Road—I happened to be coming by at the time of this disturbance—I went to see what it was—I saw Cooley and two more young chaps walk by—the prisoner and two or three others shoved up against him, and he turned round and made use of bad language, and struck him in the mouth, took off his coat, and said he would fight the best man in the company—another person, a stranger, had a fight along with the prisoner, and thrashed him—his companion then said, "If you can't do it by fair means, do it by foul;" and he passed a knife to him—I saw the prisoner with the knife in his hand—I saw him go up to Seymour with the knife, but I did not see him stick him in the throat; but when he left him I saw the blood trickling down his neck—the people called out that he had a knife in his hand—the prisoner then ran across the road, he fell over the kerb, and East ran after him, and fell on the top of him.</p>

I am divisional surgeon of police—on the Sunday morning, soon after 12 o'clock, I was called to the station and examined Seymour—he had a wound on the right side of the neck, just about the level of Adam's apple—it was a punctured and incised wound, evidently the result of a stab—it extended from behind forward for about half an inch—he appeared to have lost a good deal of blood, he was very faint indeed—it was not a deep wound, it looked as if done with a blunt knife—Seymour was perfectly sober.</p>

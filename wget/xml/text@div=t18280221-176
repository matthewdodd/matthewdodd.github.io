On the 16th of February, a little before two o'clock in the afternoon, I was going down in the craft on the river, and saw the Edward barge laying outside the dock of Brooks and Penny's wharf; I am their clerk. I saw the prisoner's head just over the barge, which was loaded with coals; he was taking coals out of the barge, into his boat; I came up to him, and he said, "If you will let me go, I will put them back," and he did throw two or three pieces back; I took hold of the chain of his boat, and held him till an officer came - I suppose there were nearly two bushels of coals in the boat- they appeared the same sort as those in the barge.</p>

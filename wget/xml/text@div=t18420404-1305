                  </hi>. I am housemaid to Mrs. Wood, of Great Queen-street—she does not reside there all the year—she came to town three weeks ago last Wednesday—while she was out of town the prisoner has been in the habit of taking care of her house, at times for nearly two years—when Mrs. Wood comes to town the prisoner assists in the house and sleeps there—she is a widow and has two children, who also live at Mrs. Wood's—she sleeps with me—on the night of Easter Sunday, the 27th of March, we slept together—she awoke me between twelve and one, and wished me to go down stairs and warm her a little gruel, which I did—I then observed things lying on the kitchen floor which raised my suspicion (I am not married) there was some linen on the floor soiled with blood, and a pail put in the sink with linen soiled with blood in it—when I went up stairs I wished her to hare a medical attendant—I did not tell her what I had seen, I was so frightened—she said no—I then insisted on sending for her brother's wife, Mrs. Spencer, which I did—she came directly—I then left her, she looked very poorly and seemed low—I had slept with her from the Wednesday week before, and perceived that she was in the family way—we thought so—I communicated this to one of the young ladies and afterwards to Mrs. Wood, and between nine and ten Mr. M'Cann, the surgeon, was sent for—in the course of the day I had occasion to go to the dust-hole, which is under the steps leading from the dining-room to go out at the back door, and saw there what appeared to be a child—I did not handle it—I told one of the ladies of it—Mr. Joseph, mistress's son, saw it—I saw it again in the afternoon when the beadle came and took it away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am undertaker of St. Margaret's. I remember going to Mrs. Wood's house—I saw Hurst there—she showed me a child I put it into a shell, and took it to the workhouse—it was a girl, and had a string round its neck—it was not washed—Crow saw it in my presence, to the best of my recollection, but I am not positive—I put it in the dead-house about six o'clock on the evening of the 28th of February—I produced the same child at the Coroner's inquest—the cord was tied in a knot, and appeared to me to be tight.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the child in the dead-house on Easter Monday, as near as I can recollect about nine in the evening—it was a female—there was no other child there—it had a cord tied, I believe, twice round its neck—the cord was about twice the size of an ordinary packing string, it was a sort of sash string, about two lines wove—Mr. M'Cann came to me at the workhouse and saw it there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he come with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not go with him to the room where the child was—I never was there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Not into the dead-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I went into that room and pointed the child out to him—I am sure the same child was produced before the coroner's jury the next day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M'CANN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I attended before the coroner—I examined the child's body—it had a cord round the throat—it was tight—I removed it—there was an indentation round the throat on the skin—it was a large full-grown child, and quite perfect—the cord was only tied once—I opened the body and found the viscera perfectly healthy—I took the lungs out and submitted them to the hydrostatic test—they floated in water, which was an indication of the child having breathed—I examined the head, and found the vessels of the brain, congested—the <hi rend="italic">pia mater</hi> was considerably gorged with blood—death might have occurred from several causes, but, having seen the cord round the throat, I should imagine death was from strangulation—if I had not seen the cord round the throat I should have very great doubts whether it was not caused by whatever position the wo<lb></lb>man was in at the time the child was born—the extravasation might be caused by that, but seeing the cord, I say it was from strangulation—but still there are doubts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there marks on the head as if it had fallen on the floor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a kind of mark of discolouration, or a slight bruise on the head</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184204040147"></xptr>
               <p>—if there had been no cord, the bruise on the head would have been suffi<lb></lb>cient to explain the symptoms in the head—the lips were livid and the tongue swollen, which is evidence of death by strangulation or suffocation—a fall might partialy explain these symptoms—my opinion is that the child had lived—that it actually had life in the air, not merely foetal life—my opin<lb></lb>ion is on the presumptive evidence of the cord round its neck, that the suffo<lb></lb>cation was from that, but it is only presumptive having seen the cord—I cannot positively swear, but I should say certainly that death was caused by suffocation or strangulation—I do not exactly make a distinction be<lb></lb>tween suffocation and strangulation, for instance, the child might have been smothered at the time—not exactly in the act of being born, or the lungs would not have the appearance they had—anything getting in the throat or pat into the mouth might produce congestion on the brain—I found no<lb></lb>thing put in—I attribute the suffocation or strangulation to the cord—that is a doubtful opinion—it is possible the fall might have killed it, and the cord after death might have been placed round the throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After a body is quite dead there will be no appearance of ecchymosis, will there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes there will, if very soon after, before the body is cold—the umbilical cord was still attached to the child, and the after-birth also—I saw the prisoner again the same evening, and again next morning—she asked if I had seen the child—I said yes—she asked if there was going to be a coroner's inquest on it—I said yes—she said, "What will my sen<lb></lb>tence be likely to be?"—I told her I could not tell, and that the inquest would be about three o'clock—I do not know whether it was before or after the inquest, but she told me she regretted that Mrs. Wood had re<lb></lb>turned to town, that she had a sovereign sent her to buy things for the child, but Mrs. Wood's returning prevented her going out for them, and the child would have been out to nurse—she said nothing about the birth of the child that I recollect—she was going on to say something more about Mrs. Wood's return, I told her she had better not say anything to me—I checked her in her conversation—on the day after the inquest she showed me two caps and a piece of flannel in her room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you speak of the child being born alive, do you mean it has actually been removed altogether from the person of the mother?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—the floating of the lungs is a certain indication of that—I mean to say, if the lungs will float in water, if we cannot compress the air out of them, that child must have been born fully—full respiration must have gone on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that an indication of any thing but the child having breathed at some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It may be produced by putrefaction, but there was not time for that—if it breathes once fully, and the lungs become completely distended with air, it is just as much as if it had lived for hours—that could not take place thoroughly before the child is completely removed from the mother—there are instances of a child crying in the process of parturition, but it has been found, by experiment, if a child died before the parturition was complete, the inspiration—could not be so perfect as if it was entirely detached, not so freely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But would not, under those circumstances, the lungs float? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They would—a person delivering herself would have considerable difficulties to contend with—the umbilical cord does not offer an impediment in the actual birth, unless it is twisted round the neck, or round any portion of the child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would not its getting round any portion of the child, or round the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184204040148"></xptr>
               <p>neck, cause the appearance of suffocation you found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might—it was still attached in the usual way when I saw it—the mark of the cord round the neck was very slight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In strangulation by a cord there would be what you call congestion of blood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There would—there was sufficient mark on the neck to indicate that—it does not follow that there should be a considerable mark—I do not call it congestion at the neck, I said in the brain—there may be an effusion of blood, but in this case there was none, nor any extravasa<lb></lb>tion—she would very likely deliver herself standing, but it is impossible to say—in natural delivery the head is downward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Another mode would be for the woman to be on he knees? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was no mark on the body as if the umbilical cord had been tied round it—the cord might have been put round the neck after death, for attaching a heavy weight to it to drown it—I did not see the dust-hole, but it has been described to me, and the cord might have been put round to give her power to throw it into the dust-hole, as I understand it was impossible for her to get to the dust-hole herself.</p>

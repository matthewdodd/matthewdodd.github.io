I fell, and on my falling he drew my watch. He did not say a word to me. I got up, and followed the prisoner as far as St. Mary Axe; there I lost sight sight of him as he turned down Rolls-buildings. A person came up and told me the prisoner was taken. I immediately went up to him, and said the prisoner was the man that robbed me. He was taken to the watch-house and searched; nothing was found on him but a knife. The knife was not mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drunk or sober - A. I had been drinking; I was not dead drunk, I could distinguish one man from another.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you recollect saying to Jennings that you got into an aukward situation, and you should like to know how to get out of it. Will you swear that you did not say so - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell a woman that the flap of your coat got between your legs and threw you down - A. I fell running after him; my great coat got between my legs, but I did not tell a woman that. I fell first when the prisoner struck me.</p>
               <p>MR. JENNINGS. I am an officer. I was sitting by the fire side; I heard a voice going by my house, saying, stop thief. I immediately ran to the door; I saw three men running, laughing; the prisoner took one way and they the other. I followed the prisoner about thirty yards; he let his breeches down; he let his breeches down as though he was doing something for himself. I asked the prisoner what he did there; he said he was doing a job for himself. A little girl ran out of the house with me; I told her to go into Leadenhall-street, and see whether there had been anything done or not. She returned with Alexander in about ten minutes or more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Was not the prosecutor drunk - A. He had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw no person in company with the prisoner when he knocked me down, not did I see any man join him.</p>

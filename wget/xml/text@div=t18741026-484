On the 23rd September I met Burchill in the Commercial Road—we went to the house, 16, Hardinge Street, with her—we met Church just before we got to the house—I told him who we were and that the female prisoner with us was in custody 'charged with felony, that the hat and dress she was wearing were stolen property, and that we had reason to believe that she lived at 16, Har<lb></lb>dinge Street, and we were going there to search it—he said "I am the landlord of that house, she does not live there; what is there belongs to me"—by that time we got to the house—I asked him what rooms he occupied in the house, and told him that I wished to search those rooms—he pointed out two parlour and said "I occupy those two rooms and the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> kitchens beneath"—he remarked several times that Burchill did not live there, and said that whatever things were there belonged to him and not to her—I went inside and told him I should search for stolen property, that I had reason to believe there was stolen property there—he said "I shall object, and before you search you must first obtain a warrant"—I said "There is no time for that," and I showed him a card to satisfy him who we were, and told him that he could have his remedy if I did search—Burchill was very violent and the sergeant went for assistance—Fanny Potter was present, Mrs. Miller's servant—she said "I do not live here, do I <hi rend="italic">Fred?"—he</hi> said "No"—she said "There is nothing here belonging to me"—he said "No"—she said "I live at 59; Helen St.; why don't you go there and search"—I went there afterwards and saw the shop—at that time we only found the things she was wearing, and I told them over and over that I should search the house in every part, and she said "What things I have are what my brother gave me"—then I searched—I pointed out a large box marked "F. C," and said "I want to see the contents"—Church pulled out the keys—I said "Will you hand the keys to me"—he said "No"—I said "Then I shall force the box open," with that he opened the box himself—I took out two or three things and found the piece of fur which Potter identified—I told Church I should charge him with being concerned with others in stealing this, with other articles, on the 31st March last—he hesitated a minute or two, then said "It is not me, Mr. Morgan, I know nothing about it; it is William White, Rhoda's brother, who brought the things here"—I then found the cash-box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in a cupboard in the same room—I asked him who that belonged to—he said "It is not mine; it was brought here by White, the same person who brought the other things"—I asked him for the key—he said "I have no key, it is not mine"—I told him I should force it open and I did so, and found forty-one duplicates, and amongst them one relating to the counterpane produced by the pawnbroker, pledged 13th August, in the name of Rhoda White—that is part of the property identified by Mr. Miller and his servant, also a suit of clothing identified by Mr. Miller—the dressing-gown pledged on the 1st April, the day after the robbery, the pawnbrokers will produce—it was pledged in the name of White of Sydney Street—in the same cupboard was found the tools by Shaw—they are the sort of tools used by burglars in breaking into houses, and also used as</p>

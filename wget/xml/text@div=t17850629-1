               <p>Jury. Did you see the prisoner at the bar? - I think I do remember his face, but he was in the room but a very little time, he was one of them that went up stairs, I am as sure as I can be to the best of my knowledge, I cannot say any further; I had an opportunity of observing the faces of those that were in the room with me , but the prisoner went up stairs, I could not know them that went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you cannot speak to the person of the prisoner? - No, I cannot, I saw them take these spoons, and the milk pot, I am sure all this plate was in the house at the time they entered it , and there was a watch hanging by the chimney side, that was gone.</p>
               <p>What is the value of that plate? - I do not know the value, let anybody value it.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Thompson, I was there on the 10th of March, 1784; a quarter past seven in the evening, there was a small knock at the door, I was in the fore parlour with my mistress; my mistress said, somebody knocks at the door, I went to the door, and before I opened it, I called who is there, and a man said he had a letter of importance, which letter I have now in my pocket. (Produced, being a sheet of blank paper addressed to Miss Young, Islington.) With that I opened the door, and a man presented the letter, I had a candle in my hand when I saw the direction I told him it was not for us or anybody in the house, and he did not give me the letter into my hand, but they all rushed in; and to the best of my knowledge, I always thought there were six, but it appeared by evidence upon the last trial there were but five; when they entered the passage, I shrieked out Lord Jesus! we shall all be killed, and one of the men seized me by the throat, I cannot say who he was, whilst<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290004"></xptr> I was leaning my back against the passage, I begged of them to let me go into the parlour; one of them had hold of one arm, and the other of the other, and they led me into the fore parlour, and my mistress schrieked out, and one of them had gags, and swore he would gag us; another man, a tall one, who has turned evidence, had a cutlass, and said he would cut her down; I saw more than four in the room, two of them left the room, and those that were left in the room, one had a pistol, and the other a cutlass; we heard the others up stairs in the rooms, pulling the drawers about; some time after that, a short man came down in fustian breeches and jacket, he was pock-fretted; he could not open the desk immediately, and he took the tongs and wrenched it, but what he took out I did not then know; this was in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner there? - I saw that man to the best of my knowledge among them in the parlour, for he struck me when I came here to-day, I have not seen him since; it strikes me he is the man that had the gags in his hands.</p>
               <p>Do you imagine he is one of the men that stood in the parlour all the time? - No, he was not, I am perfectly sure of that, I should have known them three seven years after, I have not such a perfect knowledge of him, I have no great doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Have you any? - I cannot directly say to the face of the man, but he is remarkably like the man in his make about the shoulders, I think he is the man that had the gags; I have not so striking a likeness of him as I have of the other three: the plate was always kept in a little round basket, what we used at dinner, and the child had got some of the plate out, and was playing with the basket; there was one salt-seller, and two spoons, and the old pepper-caster, the rest were in the back parlour of the beaufet .</p>

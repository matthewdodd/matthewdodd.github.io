I told her I could not tell. Mrs. Terry said she believed she was, because she saw the Prisoners that night at her house with some of her things, and that they had left a knife at her house, - that knife was my wife. They were taken up, and my wife's two checquered aprons were found in the room where they lodged, between the bed and the sackings I asked Morris where the aprons were, and she said Sears had them to wash. - My wife is dead, and according to all accounts she died about three quarters of an hour after this thing was done.</p>

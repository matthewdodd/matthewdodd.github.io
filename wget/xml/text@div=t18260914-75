               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. How far from home were you robbed? A. About 600 yards; I had been selling shrimps and perriwinkles that afternoon, and sold some in the tap-room of the public-house - I was there about half an hour, not more - I had been round Hackney-road, and through Haggerston, and called at two or three public-houses, to sell my goods, the Plough and the Shoulder of Mutton - I drank at the Plough, but at no other house, till I got to the Adam and Eve, and am quite sure I was sober - it got dusk about nine o'clock; I might leave twenty people at the Adam and Eve - I am sure I left the prisoners there; as soon as I got the penny, their companion owed me, I went out; there is not a house nearer to where I was stopped, than sixty yards; I do not know who lives there, but believe Thomas George does; I did not go there - I went straight home; I found my wife at home- I knocked at my door, asked my wife for another hat, and afterwards went back to acquaint the night officer; I did not return to the public-house, as I was as near my own house, and thought the alarm had been given, as I had cried Stop thief! and Murder! all the way home as I ran. Nicholls stood on my right side - I turned my head, and saw him - he put his hands round my neck - I am sure he is the man; they were kneeling down on each side of me, and kneeling on me at the time the money was taken - I had two farthing among my money; I did not see them in custody till I got to the White Lion - Mr. Algar had told me he had got the men in custody - they stood up in the passage; it was a very light night, light enough to distinguish their countenances; I was not struck, but thrown down - I never saw them before; it might last five minutes, perhaps - I cried Murder! three or four times, and was alarmed when I was thrown down; they were on each side of me, and not behind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did they meet you? A. No, they came behind me; I turned my head, and saw Nicholls seize hold of my neck, and, as soon as I got down, Goulby was on the other side of me; I am certain they are the men, and have always been certain.</p>

            . I am a shop-keeper, and live at Hackney-bay. On the 29th of June I was at the White Lion public-house, and heard a cry of Murder! coming in a direction from Homerton - there are fields at the back of the White Lion, and Nichols' house is not far from there; on hearing the alarm I went, in company with Bawm, towards the corner of Mr. Alsager's field; I heard the cry of murder just as I got up to the field, and presently heard footsteps coming toward me, having first heard the turnstile move; I then heard footsteps of two persons running towards us, as from Homerton - there is a footpath in this field - it is a short cut from the Homerton-road to Mr. Alsager's; I stooped down and Bawm stood on one side to prevent the persons from seeing us, and secured the persons, who were the prisoners; I took Goulby, and Bawm Nicholls - Goulby wanted to get from me, but I had a cricket bat in my hand, and told him I would knock him down if he did; I found two cloths tucked into the left side of his waistcoat; I gave them to Martin; some copper money was found on Nicholls, and 1s., in silver, which Cowling had. We took them to the White Lion, left them there, then went to see it - any one was robbed, and found the prosecutor, Nicholls, with another man, just against the place where he said he had been robbed - that is about ten yards from where the footpath leads from; he was all over blood - he told me of his being robbed, and that he knew the men who had done it - I told him they were in custody; he appeared to have been very ill-treated - indeed, when I got to the watch-house I observed marks of blood on both the prisoners' clothes; I rubbed fresh blood off the knee of one of them in the watch-house; the prosecutor had marks on the side of his head and throat - it seemed quite white matter in the morning; there were several marks as if a hand had been thrust into his collar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoner Nicholls taken? A. Yes; I did not see him attempt to get away- I saw them searched by the officers - a great many coppers, and two farthings were found on the prisoner Nicholls. The spot where I found the prosecutor is in a direct road from the public-house to his home; the prisoners were in a by-way to the public-house, and not the shortest way.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know who brought you the cloths? A.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you been there? A. Ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; there might be ten or twelve men there; I do not know Goulby; I cannot say whether the prisoner Nicholls went out alone - he shook hands with me - I saw him go out of the door way, and observed nobody else go out; several persons were standing up at the time; I know the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM NICHOLLS. These cloths are mine, and were stolen from me that night; I had them when I was robbed; I know this penny-piece - it is one I had - I took particular notice of it when I took it - it is marked and bent; the basket is mine, and the hat has my name on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You took a good many coppers that night? A. Yes, but no more like that - I particularly noticed its being beat round the edge and battered in the middle.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the prosecutor on the night of the robbery; I was sent for about twelve o'clock, and found his face and head all over blood; I cut off his hair and found none of the wounds likely to prove mortal; but he was much bruised about the head and face, and pinched about the throat - that appeared to have been done by the fingers - he must have been very ill-treated, from the state in which I found him - I attended him about a week.</p>
               <p>NICHOLLS' Defence. I was not at the place; I went no farther along the lane than the foot-path, which was in the road to the public-house.</p>
               <p>GOULBY's Defence. When I came to the style I turned out of the road, and ran across the field.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave Nicholls a good character.</p>

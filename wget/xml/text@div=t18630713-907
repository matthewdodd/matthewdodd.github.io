                  </hi>. I live at 8, Paradise-row, Hammersmith—on 6th June, I was in the Seven Stars, Starch-green, Hammersmith—the deceased, Collins, and the prisoner were there—the prisoner threw down a sovereign, and said to Collins, "I will fight you for that to-night or to-morrow morning"—Collins said, "I have not any money, and I shall not fight you to-night; I will come to your house to-morrow morning and call you"—the prisoner, I believe, said, "I will fight you after"—a short time after the prisoner said, "I will fight you now," Collins said, "If there is ere a man in the room that will pick me up, I will fight you to-night"—a man named Simpson, who was there, said, "I will pick you up"—they went out—Simpson then said he would not pick Collins up, he picked the prisoner up, and Newell picked Collins up—I saw them fight—Collins was knocked down several times—I saw the prisoner strike him—they struck each other, and both fell—before the last round, Collins said, "I will give in"—West said, "I will fight you another round or two"—they had another round, and then they both went into the Seven Stars and drank, and shook hands together, and Collins began to sing—West then pulled his jacket off to fight Collins again, but he would not fight—I saw blood coming from Collins's head; I could not see the wound—I saw his head come on the ground—they had both been drink<lb></lb>ing—Collins was the worst of the two.</p>

               <p>Hospital, at Hammersmith—on 27th June, I saw Collins at his residence, 3, Albert-place; he was in a half-conscious state—there was an incised wound on the top of his head, which was strapped up with plaster—it was just above the forehead on the right side—it might be done by falling on a stone—there were two or three other wounds, but they had quite healed—he died on 30th June—next day, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there was an abscess on the brain directly under the external wound—there was also a wound at the back of the head—that had nothing to do with his death—the abscess on the brain was the cause of death; and that was, no doubt, caused by a blow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not the abscess arise in consequence of the wound not being properly attended to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not mean to say that he would hare got well if he had been properly attended to; but he would, no doubt, have stood a much better chance—there was no fracture of the skull, but the bone was exposed—this took place on the 6th, and I did not see him till the 27th—I did not notice any marks about the face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the wound one that could not not have been given by the knuckles? In all probability he had something in his hand at the time; but the deceased was bald where the wound was, consequently a good sharp blow with the knuckle might have caused it; it was a clean out—it is possible it might have been done with a knuckle, but not likely; it is much more likely to have been made with a stone, or something of that sort—I think it would have been a very difficult matter for the wound to have been caused by a fall, unless he fell against something, because a man does not generally fall on the top of his head—I am twenty-three years old—I am a member of the College, and of the Apothecaries' Company.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Seven Stars—on 6th June, the prisoner and Collins happened to meet by accident against my front door—they had been drinking—they came inside and began to talk about their work—all they had at my house was a glass of ale each—Collins wanted to fight West; he said he wan a better man than him at anything—two men in front of the bar persuaded them not to fight—they began to take off their clothes—I ran round the bar and said, "I will not allow fighting here; you must fight outside if you want to fight—they went outside—in a minute or two I went out, and they were both lying down in the dirt—they were picked up—the police came up, and the men came into the house—Collins wanted to fight again, and swore with bitter oaths that he would call the prisoner up at 5 o'clock in the morning to fight—West chucked a sovereign on the counter—Collins called at my house again at a quarter-past 11 that night with one of his children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it Collins who originally challenged the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he first talked about fighting—when he came at a quarter-past 11 he made no complaint—he said he should go to West and call him up at 5 o'clock, and fight it out—the road is gravel in front of my house—I have known the prisoner twenty-two months; I never knew him to be in trouble; he is head man in a brick field.</p>

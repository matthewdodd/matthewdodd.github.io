               <p>MR. EDWIN ALDERMAN. On the 31st of May, as I was in <placeName id="t18300708-91-crimeloc515">Barbican</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Is it a place of much thoroughfare? A. Yes; there were not many persons passing at that moment - I am sure I saw it in the prisoner's hand; he was the middle one of three - it was not in the hand of either of the others; there is a pastry-cook's shop just behind, and the light from that made me see him.</p>
               <p>JOHN ANDREWS. I am an officer. I came up, and the prosecutor gave the prisoner to me; this other handkerchief was found on the prisoner at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That other handkerchief he took off my neck. Witness. No, I did not; but I believe it was taken off his neck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home; two boys picked the gentleman's pocket, and dropped the handkerchief at my feet; I took it up to give to the gentleman, and he said I had picked his pocket, but I am innocent.</p>
               <p>MR. ALDERMAN re-examined. Q. Did the other boys run away? A. Yes - the prisoner went on his knees, and begged I would forgive him; he did not say he had picked it up.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

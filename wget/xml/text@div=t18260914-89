               <p>THOMAS HOBLEY. I live in Great Guildford-street, Southwark. On the 13th of September, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was returning from Brentford-fair - I was quite sober; I had been <rs id="t18260914-89-viclabel536" type="occupation">selling pastry at the fair</rs>

I was going on to Turnham-green, for assistance, and when I got a little way I heard a cry of Murder! I saw the prisoners and another coming towards Turnham-green - I got assistance, and they were secured; I have no doubt whatever of them. I have not found the tray.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. How long had you been at the fair? A. From about noon; I was quite sober; it was not a general fight; I did not strike till I was knocked down - I believe my friends were looking on - one of them was in contact with Gould - we were not all fighting together; I saw Gould with his nose broken - I wished to put up with the insult and go home.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in Fann-court, Miles'-lane. I went to the fair about three o'clock, and was selling cakes; I was quite sober; I was returning but did not see the first of this; I saw the tray knocked off Hobley's head; Freeland, who was with him, callled out "Wilson, come up, we are attacked;" I went up - Stephen Leake immediately struck me, and I struck him in my own defence; we had a great scuffle, and I fell to the ground - they left me on the ground - I did not see what became of the tray; I am certain the prisoners were all of the party.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it not a general fight? A. No: I fought in my own defence; the prisoners appeared in liquor. I believe I took off my coat, and had about three rounds; I believe there were six in the party - they came back and beat me a second time; I flew to a waggon for protection, and in about three-quarters of an hour, saw them in the watch-house. I lost 11s. but that might have fallen from me.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in East-lane, Walworth. I was returning from selling my goods at the fair - Wilson and I were behind with Hobley; the tray was knocked off his head - Wilson went up to help him; Stephen Leake fell on Hobley, and I cannot say what was done, for two lads were jawing me all the time; I saw both the Leakes attacking Hobley, but am not certain about Gould; I was terrified, and was returning to Brentford for safety, when these three men rushed out upon me, knocked me down, and tore the tail off my jacket; I am certain Gould attacked me then; this was a quarter of an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140072"></xptr>hour after Hobley was attacked; they afterwards tore my trousers off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you go from the path into the road to fight? A. No - we were in the road; the prisoners' coats were not off; I saw nobody come up to separate them - one of the prisoners had a black eye and broken nose; I met Wilson returning with two tilted waggons, and I returned with him; I did not see the first of it - I saw no woman there.</p>

            . I am a pastry-cook. I had been to the fair; we were all coming home together; Hobley was a stranger to me; the prisoner, Leake, knocked the tray off his head; he caught it as it fell, and put it on his head again; he knocked it off again with violence; Hobley picked it up, and Leake put himself in a fighting attitude; Wilson came to assist Hobley; two or more fell on him - I went to assist Wilson, and Gould struck me several times; three or four of them were on me all at once; Gould knocked me down three or four times; after getting away, I went to lift Wilson up; Stephen Leake then struck me, and said, "This is the b-gg-r in the black coat;" the confusion was very great; I saw Stephen Leake take away the tray, but what became of it afterwards I do not know - I did not see the end of it; I went towards London; the same party attacked me again, and knocked me down; Freeland came up, and asked if they were going to murder me; I got up, and escaped over a hedge there were more than three engaged in it; one boy had two large stones, and threatened to knock my brains out; I swear the three prisoners were active in attacking Hobley.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were engaged in the scuffle? A. There appeared seven or eight at first, but afterwards a good many more; there were seven of us; I heard nobody try to part them - none of the prisoners called Murder! we only defended ourselves; I laid behind a hedge till they had gone away, I was so alarmed.</p>

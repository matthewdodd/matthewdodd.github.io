The prisoner came into our service the latter end of May, recommended by the matron of Covent-garden workhouse; I had a ring in my care, in my father's house - it belonged to a gentleman, and a neck-chain of my own; I missed them on the 14th September, with the other things - they were in a box, which I placed in my father's bed-room, on the first floor, when I left home, which was in July.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not offer me the neck-chain to pawn for you to get money to go to the fortune-teller, because you could not get to your father's till before you went to school? A. No; I had the neck-chain in my possession, and desired her to go and ask the value of it, and she brought it back to me.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marylebone. I was fetched to Mr. Martin's, on the 15th of September, and found the prisoner there - I inquired among the servants, and suspected the prisoner; she gave me this pocket-book, with eight, duplicates in it, one of which relates to a ring pawned at Chapman's; he gave it up before the Magistrate - as she was a female, I desired Miss Martin and her mother to search her; Miss Martin brought me down two duplicates, one for a petticoat, which the pawnbroker gave up; the other was for a shift - one duplicate was for a silk handkerchief; that was given up - Miss Martin produced a white handkerchief to me, as coming out of her box.</p>
               <p>MISS MARTIN. I was present when her box was searched, and I found the handkerchief in it, marked with my father's initials; this neck-chain I know - it was my sister's, who is dead; this is a mourning-ring - it is my father's, and was in the same drawer with the neckchain; the other ring is mine.</p>

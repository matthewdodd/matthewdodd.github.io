Mr. Bambrough; Sir, I hope you will pardon me for the very un<lb></lb>grateful thing I have done to you. Dear sir, I have done so wrong to you, that I do not know what to say or do until I send you the money I have sent Mr. Pipe for you. If he has received the horse and cart, I will send you all the money in about a week; I expect to have about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. next week. Please, if you will pardon me for what I have done, I will pay any money Mr. Barker and you may say. Yours truly, R. Brown. ")</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> About the hiring of the pony, I certainly had the prosecutor's sanction to take it I had some drink in the morning, and drank twice with Mr. Pipe, and had some more after I had the pony and cart. I then went to Charrington's Brewery to buy some iron, and found they had sold it I was very wild at losing it, and drank at two or three places. I remember having a man or two in the cart with me and going to Mr. Bambrough; but I never recollect leaving there, or receiving any money. I heard next day that the pony was missing, but could not call to mind where I had left it till I was told. I then wrote that letter, and another to Mr. Pipe, telling him where the pony was. We all live within four hundred yards of each other, and it is not likely, if I done it for felony, that I should take the pony and cart to sell close by; I should have taken it into the country, where it could not be found. I wish to call a witness to show that I was drunk; the remark was made that I should fell out of the cart.</p>

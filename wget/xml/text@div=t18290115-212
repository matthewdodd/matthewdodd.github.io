I had been to the Adelphi Theatre on the 5th of December, and the prisoner met me against the Ship public-house - I took him home; we were not in bed, but I had taken off my shawl, and as soon as he was gone I missed it; he had been ten or twelve minutes with me - he gave me no money: I did not ask for any - he asked me if he could stop all night; I said No, and he said that would not do - he said he had been to Richmond, and torn a piece out of the sleeve of his coat, which was neatly joined in.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you told all the story? A.No, not all: I did recommend him to a friend up stairs - he went up, and stopped about ten minutes; I was in my room that ten minutes, but did not miss my shawl from the sofa - my friend has absconded; she did not come to my door: I do not know that she is a woman of the town.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you go to a public-house and see him there? A. Yes; I went to the watchman, and asked if he could go in and take a felon out - he said, No, but he would take him when he came out; I went in, and the landlord insulted me grossly - he said he never saw me.</p>

                  </hi>. I was manager to Oswald Arthur Beaumont, who trades under the style of R. A. Jones and Co., chocolate manufacturers, in Acton Street, Haggerston—some time in the middle of May last Mr. Beaumont was away ill and asked me to take charge—I sent out statements of accounts to customers who had accounts standing against them; amongst others to Mr. Smallman, of Manchester, for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I received a reply, which I showed to the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 29th May, and stated that the amount claimed had been already paid to the prisoner, and that no sum of</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was paid on the</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.) The prisoner had credited Mr. Smallman with 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as paid on 25th May, and he had remitted that amount on that date—I communicated with the prisoner and received a telegram from him and afterwards saw him—I asked him for an explanation of this letter of Mr. Smallman's, and what he meant by giving him credit for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when Mr. Smallman had never paid it—he said it was a mistake, he could not understand it, or something of that kind—there were one or two other little accounts similar, and I said "How do you account for those?"—he said he could not account for it, it was a mistake, or something of the kind, and went off on another subject—he said "You know what a lot of accounts I have to pay for you," and he also said that I did not understand his position, and the expense he was put to—I asked him if there were any other amounts similar that he had kept and not paid to the firm—he said he did not think there were, but he could not possibly tell unless he saw his books—I insisted upon his letting us know at once, because he was putting us into a false position with our customers, as we were sending out accounts that were paid—he said he would look at his books and let me know—I said he must let me know on Monday or Tuesday, this was on Saturday—he said he could not see his books, they were down in the country, at Manchester or Birmingham—on the Monday his wife came and brought this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Gentlemen,—I am sorry I could not get together more cash than I did on Saturday, but if you will only give me sufficient time, I will do my utmost to pay you as quickly as possible. I will send you more at the end of the week. Trusting you will be as lenient as you possibly can, for it is not my intention to rob you of a penny. I have mislaid Mr. Roberts's address. Yours, W. T.

               <p>the prisoner and told him I was very much annoyed at the matter, and asked what he meant by collecting this money and not accounting for it—he did not say much, he looked very uncomfortable, and beat on the table, and tried to make, some excuses, and said his expenses were heavy—I asked what he did with the money—he said he had used some of it in his own business—I believe he had a business of his own, as I found out afterwards—I called his attention to his commission account being overdrawn 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., apart from this—it was as to that he said that his expenses were heavy; he said he would work it out in good time as he was getting such a good business—I then left him and communicated with our solicitors—he was in the habit of sending off cash and what he called a balance-sheet once or twice a week—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of them—these are books supplied to him; there is a tally in the book, he tears this part off and sends it with the money—he was instructed to remit immediately—on 31st May he represents 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as his balance in hand, and <hi rend="italic">in</hi> all these accounts the balance from the last week is carried into the next—I sent him a cheque for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. every week drawn to his order; he often came for it.*</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I joined this firm when Mr. Beaumont went away ill—the procuration is dated 30th May, and a week or ten days previous to that I took charge—I had been going there for a month before, looking over the books, and seeing how things were worked—I was a merchant, and I had thoughts perhaps of becoming the proprietor of this concern—I think I first went to the premises about 20th April—I am not related to Mr. Beaumont—I had nothing to do with making the engagement with the prisoner—I made myself thoroughly acquainted with the business—I told the prisoner it was very hard that he should take 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd after he was already 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in debt—when I left him Mr. Field, the accountant, was with him—since then he paid 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the accountant did not report to me that he said to the prisoner "If you pay 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down there will be no prosecution, but if you don't there will"—he had no authority to say anything of the kind—he is not here—he said that the prisoner had proposed a bill of sale, but he said that would not be worth a rap—he said that he told the prisoner I was so determined, that unless he made some effort to make the affair right he, would not guarantee that I would not send a policeman to him that very day—I noticed by the accounts that the prisoner's sales had increased very much, but that we had never got the money—although the business was large it was not profitable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chocolate maker, trading as R. E.

Hetherington, of Manchester, on 6th March, 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 4th April, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and 17th April, 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. were not accounted for by him—the discount on the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. should have been 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it is 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>,—what the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is for I do not know—he had no authority to allow over 10 per cent.</p>

He should not have allowed extra dis<lb></lb>count without first obtaining leave from the office—we should not have grumbled at a small amount like that, but he should have mentioned it—he travelled for cocoa and confectionary—our business had been entirely for cocoa, but in October, 1876, We took up confectionary upon the prisoner's suggestion—I had no special knowledge of confectionary, nor had my partner—the prisoner suggested particular journeys, and ultimately went them—our connection chiefly arises from the prisoner's travelling—he paid his own ex<lb></lb>penses out of the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, except for stamps or stationery—we estimated what it would cost him, and then upon the basis of 10 per cent agreed to allow him to draw 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—his remuneration would be what was left after paying expenses—the 10 per cent was on the nett—he was to have 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, whether he got orders or not, to start with—the first three or four months he did not win any trade—if he had not taken any orders. ultimately, we should have stopped him, because it would not have paid us—he never earned his commission, and we have not stopped him yet—we knew he would not earn it at first; we assumed that he would after the first year—I never waived the arrangement that he was not to carry on any business for himself—I heard that he did do so—I do not know it—I did not know that he was carrying on business at 28, Spencer Street, Goswell Road, as an importer of comestibles and soups of different kinds—I do not know of the establishment, nor that the firm went there—we dealt through him, not for him—I mean if we wanted some cherries or other fruit, and he would say, "One of our customers has some to sell," and we would give him orders to buy them and pay for them, and paid him on Saturday when he brought the bill—I did not know that he got anything by it—he might have arranged with the shopkeepers—it did not come out of our pockets—he got some fruits for us for the Alexandra Palace—I ordered them—about 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth, I think—I cannot say whether it was written on one of our business forms; I should not think it was entered in our books—the money would be put to the fruit account—we did not put in Youard's case the name in our ledger—I did not ask Youard to get three months</p>

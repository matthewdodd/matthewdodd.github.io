                  </hi>. I work for Mr. Boothby, a farmer, at Twyford Abbey, on the other side of Hanger bill Middlesex. On the 15th of March, as I passed the Fox and Goose public-house, at Ealing, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, going Some from my work, the prisoner was waiting against his house with a stick concealed in his pocket—he said he would cut my head off—I had said nothing to him—I had a bill-hook hook and glove in my hand—his wife was with him standing at the door—I threw the bill-hook and glove down in the road, and turned back towards him, expecting he was going to fight with his fists—I got to him and he put his hand into his pocket, pulled the stick out and struck me on</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Appleton, in the parish of Harrow. I was coming from work with Abbey, on the evening of the 15th of March, and as we passed the prisoner's house, his wife abused the prosecutor very much indeed—the prisoner said he would cut his b—head off—the prosecutor turned back, raised his temper up, and turned back to fight the prisoner—the prisoner was coming towards him—he put his left hand in his right-hand pocket, and drew a large stick out—the prosecutor ran away—the prisoner ran after him and knocked him down, within about two yards of me—he hit him on the head, and he laid a few minutes senseless, and bled a great deal—I told him to keep himself quiet, and not mind her abuse.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the Broadway, Westminster, and sell pork—I am the prisoner's mistress. On Saturday night, about ten o'clock, I received information that a piece of of was taken from outside my shop-board—I sent for a policeman, and charged the prisoner—my brother asked him where he had sent the pork—he denied sending any pork at all—the value of it was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had strictly forbidden him to send any goods out without my knowledge.</p>

               <p>of the day—he placed the money on the counter—I did not take it up—it was after he was questioned as to where he sent the pork—I was present when he was questioned—that was I think a little after nine o'clock—it was about ten when he paid me—the meat weighed 41bs., at 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—the policeman weighed it when he brought it back the same night—after I gave him in charge the policeman was ordered to fetch it.</p>

On Saturday night, about ten o'clock, I was helping the boy to put the horse in the cart for Mrs. Mills—the prisoner called me from helping the boy, and said, "Here, Jones, come and take this piece of pork to my house"—I knew his house—I had been there before for him—I took it in a tray—I came back, and put the tray outside—I did not pass the shop—I came back the way I went.</p>

Between ten and eleven o'clock, in consequence of what Fry told me, I said to the prisoner, "Where have you sent the joint of meat to, that you sent by a boy through the Bell-yard?"—he denied sending a joint of meat at all—he afterwards went out with the cart, and afterwards produced the half-crown—that was after I had made the demand.</p>

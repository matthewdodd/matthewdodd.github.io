                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 299). On the 14th Dec., about half past 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I was on duty in Marshgate-lane, Strat<lb></lb>ford—I observed three men coming along from the Eastern Counties Rail<lb></lb>way, the prisoner was one, and he was carrying a short piece of iron, and his companions had one larger piece between the two—the prisoner saw me, he threw the iron from his shoulder and ran away—I followed him, but he escaped—I took another of the men—the prisoner was taken on the 22nd of Dec, I told him he was one of the men who took some iron from the railway—he said he knew nothing about it—I have not the least doubt that he is the man—I had seen him before on several occasions.</p>

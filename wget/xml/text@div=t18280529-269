            . I am an officer of Islington. On the 21st of May, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner on the path which leads from Colebrook-row to the City-road, about three hundred yards from Mrs. Scott's; I asked what he had got - he made a very impudent answer; his pockets stuck out very much, and I took him to the watch-house - I found on him the articles stated in the indictment; the two gowns were wet - one was in his hat and one in his pocket.</p>

            . I live with Mrs. Scott, as servant. On Tuesday night, the 20th of May, I fastened up the house and went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock - everything was secure; I got up about half-past six and found the back kitchen window open, a piece cut out of the shutter, and the iron bars which go across, were forced - I know these two dresses - they were wet and were in the back kitchen.</p>
               <p>ISABELLA SCOTT. I am a widow and rent this house. I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock; this small silver box is mine and was on the front parlour mantel-piece; I know these dresses and other articles - my house is in the parish of St. Mary, Islington; all these things were in the house the day before.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BOND. I lodge at the prosecutrix's house. This is my hat; I left it in the hall, with these gloves in it - it was gone in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the property in the brick field, near the house.</p>

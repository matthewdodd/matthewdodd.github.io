I am stationed at Islington—on Sunday, 27th July, I went to the Crown public-house, Islington, where the prisoner was stopping—I saw him there and asked him whether he had got a little bay mare for sale—he said "No," Mr. Newman up the yard has "I took him up the yard and looked at it—I said "I have no doubt in my</p>

I went to the prisoner on 22nd July at Mr. Gower's repository—he asked me if I would buy a cab-horse, and said a dealer had one who wanted to sell it and go to Ireland; if I bought it he thought it would suit me—on the Saturday he brought me a bay mare marked "C.H.," or "G.H.," on the near side of the rump—he said it belonged to a dealer who wanted to sell it and get away—he offered it first for 25 guiness, and ultimately said he would take 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; he said he had brought it from Rainham—I put her in a cart and drove her down—the prisoner also offered it to a Mr. Farndall at the Victoria Docks.</p>

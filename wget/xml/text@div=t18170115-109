            . I am a cabinet-maker. I found the till (producing it,) at the back of the chapel. I kicked against it as I was going down Corbett's-court. I asked the last witness whose it was, and he gave me a description of the prisoner, and told me his name and his dress, and said that he had been lurking about the door for some time. When I took the prisoner his companion ran away. I found them at the sign of the City of Canterbury, in Mile-end. Ward swore to his being the person he had seen go into the court.</p>
               <p>WARD re-examined. I believe he is the man - I did not tell his name.</p>
               <p>TRUEWILLIAM re-examined. He told me that he was the man, and that he went by the name of Smouchey, and I found him by that name. He said that he had seen him skulking about the door, about a quarter of an hour before he brought the till up the court. He said, that he knew the prisoner, that he ran down the court with the till under his arm. He said, that he had blue pantaloons and a blue coat on, and ragged shoes; and that his name was Smouchey. I took Ward to the watch-house the next morning, and shewed the prisoner to him, and he said he was the same person, and began crying.</p>
               <p>WARD re-examined. Did you see the prisoner that night, or not - A. I did, between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you had seen him walking backwards and forwards several times - A. Yes, I said that I saw him go down the court; I said he had something under his arm, either a box or a till, and that he had blue pantaloons on.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say, you did not know what was under his arm - A. I told his name.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say you did not know his name - A. I think he is the same person.</p>
               <p>EVAN JONES. He told me that the prisoner was a playfellow of his, and that he was afraid of the rest of the gang. He ran away one day, and would not come to Hicks's Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. to WARD. Are you afraid of the gang, that you do not give evidence? - A. I am.</p>

            . I met the patrol, who said he had picked up the till. Ward described the prisoner in a very accurate manner; and the patrol said, that he knew the man by the description he had received. I went with him and took the prisoner; and Ward said he was afraid of the gang; Mr. Jones said, that he would protect him, and he then said, the prisoner was the person.</p>
               <p>JONES, the patrol, brought the till to my house. Ward said he knew the prisoner. There was 2l. and some silver and copper in the till, my door was not shut.</p>
               <p>Q. to WARD. Is the prisoner the person, or not - A. He is the person. <rs id="t18170115-109-verdict576" type="verdictDescription">

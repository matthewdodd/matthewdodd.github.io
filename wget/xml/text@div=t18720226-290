I am a soldier in the 23rd Royal Fusiliers, and I serve in the canteen at Woolwich—on 5th February, Stewart came in for a quart of stout, and gave me a bad shilling, which I broke on the counter—he said he had been up to London the night before, and got change for a sovereign—I offered it to him back again, but he would not take it, and the sergeant in the canteen had it.</p>

I am potman to the last witness—about 5 o'clock, on 15th February, I saw the two prisoners in front of the bar—shortly after they had gone I was called out of the tap-room, and my master showed me two bad half-crowns—I put them in my pocket, and followed the prisoners—I overtook them in the Raglan Road, about half a mile off—I saw Gittings pass something to Stewart, and seven or eight small pieces of paper fell from Gittings it was like tissue-paper—they crossed the road, and Stewart asked me if I lived in the neighbourhood—I told him "Yes"—he asked me the way to the barracks, and I told him—he asked me if I would mind showing him, and I said "No"—that was about half a mile from the barracks—we walked along, and he pulled out three-halfpence, and asked me to have a glass of ale—I told him I did not require it—I had not met a policeman up to that time—we went into a public-house, and they called for three glasses of ale—I did not drink mine—I went out to see if I could see an officer—they came out, and I saw them both running away—I followed—I called them, and they came back—Gittings asked me if I had drunk my glass of ale—I told him no, and we went back to the same place—I afterwards saw a constable, and gave Gittings into custody, and gave the two bad half-crowns to the constable.</p>

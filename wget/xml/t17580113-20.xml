               <p>Q. Had she ever work'd for you?</p>

            . We went to a pawnbroker in Benjamin-Street, near Cow-Cross, where the man was very cross, and would not look for any thing in that name. The prisoner said she knew Chetham used that shop, for she had been with her several times when she had pawn'd things there. After that I had some business up in Bloomsbury, with my lady Haines; the prisoner told me she had been there along with Chetham several times.</p>
               <p>Q. What was this Chetham?</p>
               <p>M. Harvey. She was a washerwoman of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she steal this apron do you know?</p>
               <p>M. Harvey. I don't know that she stole it, but it was missing when she work'd for me. The prisoner at the bar pawn'd it, and said she had it of her; they were bedfellows together.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Chetham?</p>
               <p>M. Harvey. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the apron since?</p>
               <p>M. Harvey. I saw an apron at a pawnbroker's shop, and described the marks of it. He took it down, and it was mark'd as I said.</p>

The prosecutrix came to my house on the 17th of September, and asked for things pawn'd in the name of Chetham, and then in the name of the prisoner. I searched about, and found an apron in the name of the prisoner. She said she knew where the person was to be found that pawn'd it, and went and brought the prisoner, as I had said I would not part with it 'till I saw that person.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she describe it?</p>
               <p>Warner. She said there was a mark of blue upon the hip. The prisoner said she would make<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175801130020"></xptr> satisfaction to her for it. I went with them before the justice, where the prisoner confessed she came along with Chetham to pawn the apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember their coming with it?</p>
               <p>Warner. I remember the prisoner coming once with a woman, and pledging a thing for a shilling: I believe this to be the same, but I can't prove it.</p>

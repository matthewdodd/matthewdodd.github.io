                  </hi>. I am a hop dealer, in the Borough. Two days before 9th Aug. the prisoner called on me for a sample of hops—I lent it him, and on the 9th he called, and said that he had sold the bag of hops, and if I sent them with him I should have the money—I was very ill at the time, and gave the bill to my wife—she did not bring me the money—I did not see the prisoner again till I met him on 1st Nov., when I gave him into custody—he said that he had not sold the hops—I said, "Could not you show your face to me before this?"—he was to pay me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for these—he was to have them at 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—he told me to make out the bill at 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. On 9th Aug. I saw some hops put on the prisoner's truck, at my husband's warehouse—my husband gave me the bill, and I went with the prisoner—he told his man to stop, and he and I went to a house in Basinghall-street, next door to Fore</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I sold the hops to a person named Jones, whom I had known about three months; he asked me to let him have a sample, and I gave it him; I was to meet him on Saturday morning in Fore-street; he made an arrangement to send his man with the truck; I met him at 3 o'clock, and he had a man there with the truck; I went, and came back with Mrs. Evans to Aldermanbury-postern; he was to meet me there at 5 o'clock; I went to the house to wait for him; he was a long time, and we had a pint of beer; he did not come; I went to look for him; he was not there, and the man and the truck were gone; whether the man took the money or not, I do not know.</p>

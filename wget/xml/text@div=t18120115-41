               <p>Mr. Alley. Through fear and dread of what - A. If they had gone to a public office and have sworn my life away; I considered that my life was in danger if I had not given them the money. They then said that would not do for them; I had given them five pounds; I gave Norton three pounds more, in addition to what I had given them before; they then left me.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in New-square that you gave them the money - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in the City of London - A. It is. I had not proceeded more than eight or ten yards from the square when Jones came running to me again, and said that Norton would give him none of the last three pounds, I gave him a few shillings, five or six. After I got into the Minories I saw them both in company together walking down the Minories. I saw no more of them on that day.</p>

            . I apprehended Norton on the 14th of December, I had been looking after him five or six weeks; I found him in a one pair of stairs room in a court in Hoxton Town; I got into the room by means of a picklock key, and found him concealed behind the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Norton's Defence. One night this lad Jones was standing opposite the London Docks, Mr. Cole asked him which was the Play-house, this lad shewed him; Mr. Cole asked him if he would go a little further with him; Mr. Cole laid hold of him and led him across Wellclose-square, and pushed him down Pell-street; Mr. Cole was indecent and ran away; I halloaed stop thief after him; Mills stopped Mr. Cole, and this lad and me gave charge of him; we took him to the watchhouse, he immediately fell on his knees at the watchhouse, and said he would give us any sum of money if we would discharge him. Mr. Cole gave Lancaster the beadle five pounds; Jones and me had a pound each of it.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. I was indicted here last sessions, and tried.</p>
               <p>COURT. Mr. Cole, you have heard what these persons said - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what day these persons speak of when they talk of your being taken to the watchhouse - A. On the 8th of May. I never saw them till that night. About nine at night I was coming from Shadwell market, the Three Compasses, the lease was to be disposed of; I had four glasses of brandy and water there; I then came out with the intention of going home; I proceeded up Ratcliffe Highway. When I was walking I perceived myself overcome with the liquor I drank; I got into the entrance of Castle-street, on the left hand side of which there is a dead wall belonging to the London Docks; I saw Jones as I was proceeding on; Jones was standing against the wall; when I went close to him he turned round and made water across the pavement; I called him a dirty fellow, and asked him what he did it for: he said if my sister was there he would give her a good swishing; I said, pray how old may you be to talk about such things; he said, sixteen, and he had come from the West Indies, where he had seen plenty of such business. I said, which is my way to Well-street, conceiving that when I got there I should know my way; he said, come, and I will shew you the way; he took me up a street which I have since found to be Neptune-street; he took me round Wellclose-square into North-East passage. When I said, this is not my way home, he said come along, and took me into Pell-street. When we got there he gave a whistle, which alarmed me, and I set off running down the street. I heard two or three following of me, and voices singing stop thief; I had got one third of the way down Pell-street when a man stopped me and asked me what was the matter, these two lads came up and stated to him that I wanted to commit an unnatural crime; I asserted my innocence to the man, Mills, who said he was a watchman. I was taken to the watchhouse; he related to Lancaster the beadle what these lads had informed him, and these lads said to Lancaster that I had wanted to commit an unnatural crime; I asserted my innocence at the watch-house. Upon the oath I have taken I never went down on my knees at the watchhouse, and beg forgiveness of them. Lancaster told me it was a sad thing, that he must take the charge; he put his hand into my waistcoat pocket, and took some silver out of one pocket, and a pencil case out of the other pocket. I begged him not to search me, I would shew him what I had got; I took out of my left hand breeches pocket a five pound note, and three one's, I gave them into Lancaster's hands; he said, I find you are well lined. I told him I was a man of some little property, and my abode, and my wife and family, and declared my innocence, and if he could make it up with the lads I would wish him so to do. Lancaster took the lads out one at a time; he came in the watch-house, he returned to me the three one pound notes, and said he had settled it with the lads.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of the five pound note - A. They divided that among themselves as I have been since<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150040"></xptr>informed. Lancaster said I might remain in the watchhouse a few minutes until they were gone out of the way. In a few minutes afterward I left the watchhouse, I had not proceeded more than ten or twelve yards from the watchhouse when I was again accosted by the two lads, who said that they had only one pound each out of the five pounds. They demanded the three pounds that Mr. Lancaster had returned to me, or they would come down to my house and see farther into the business; when I, through fear gave them the three pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any of your family what had happened - A. Not at the time. The 18th of October was the first time that I mentioned it to any of my friends.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. I will now ask you, sir, whether, at the former trial you did not say that you parted with the money on the 8th of May through fear of exposure in your own neighbourhood, and no other cause - A. I considered my character as dear as my life at the time, that is the reason I assigned for parting with my money at that time.</p>

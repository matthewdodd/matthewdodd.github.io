                  </hi> On 26th Dec., about four o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, I was going up Rupert-Street three men rushed out of a gateway, one of the struck me a blow on the chest and knocked me down, two of them fell on me-the prisoner was one of them, I caught hold of him, called "Police," and held him till a policeman came—I do not know which of them knocked me pocket—I was only struck, by one—while on the ground I felt a hand in my pocket—I lost half-a-crown, which I am quite sure I had in my pocket five minutes before—I gave the prisoner in charge, and went to the station—he was there searched in my presence, and several half-crowns and some silver were found on him.</p>

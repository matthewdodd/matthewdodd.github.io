The prisoner came to me about five or six o'clock in the afternoon, on Dec. 6. He asked if I had three dozen of each sort of lanthorns. I said, I had not on so short a notice; he said, he would call next day. He came on Friday evening; the things being all ready; he said he would pay for them; I asked him into the parlour; he drank a dish of tea; he gave me a draught of 25 l. I had not cash enough to give him change; I got it at a neighbour's. He went by the name of Captain Jackson; I gave him in change twelve guineas and three shillings. He said, he would call the next day with a cart to take the things away; (this is the draught producing it,) dated December 6, 1770, directed to Mess. Walpole and Co. bankers, for 25 l. I carried it next day to the bankers for payment; they said they had no such person kept cash with them. I asked the prisoner no questions about it.</p>

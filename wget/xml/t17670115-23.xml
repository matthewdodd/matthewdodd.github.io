            . I am wife to the prosecutor: last Tuesday Archer came to our shop, with a whole Gloucester cheese, and asked me if I would buy it; I said no, and bid him, he gone; in about an hour after he came again, with the other prisoner; they wanted to buy some red herrings; I thought, by their behaviour, they did not want to buy; I would not serve them; with a great deal to do I got them out of the shop; after that I missed a piece of hung-beef; they both came a third time; they were very troublesome; and seemed to sham drunk; I called for my husband; before he came, they both got out of the shop; a woman said they had taken some cheese; I desired my husband to follow them; he went and brought this half of a Gloucester cheese back (produced in court;) we had the other half in the shop; I put them together, and know it to be our property.</p>

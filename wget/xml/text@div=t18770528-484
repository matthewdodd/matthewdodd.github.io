                  </hi>. I am a miller, of 160, Kingsbridge Road, Milwall—on 14th May, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the night,. I was on Blackfriars Bridge, and sat down on one of the <hi rend="italic">resters</hi>, as I felt a bit drowsy—the prisoner came up with his friend and said "Look sharp you b—, or else you will lose your chance," and he drew my watch from my pocket, but I caught it and put it back and shouted "Police"—he and iris friend were kicking up a bother and running to and fro on the bridge as if they had not seen me—a policeman came up and I gave the prisoner in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I did not jump up and say "You b—, you I want my watch"—you were not talking tome when the police<lb></lb>man came up.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN</hi>—(<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 451). On the morning of 14th May, about 12.15, I was on Blackfriars Bridge, heard a cry of "Police" I and saw the prosecutor and prisoner and another man chasing one another, and Dawkins said, pointing to the prisoner, that he had tried to take his watch—the prisoner said "Oh, no, it is your own mistake"—I took the prisoner to the station; he gave a wrong address.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was crossing Blackfriars Bridge with a friend, and a man who was coming the other way shoved me against this man on the seat—he said "You b—, you want my watch"—I went a few yards after the man to ask why he shoved up against me, and the prosecutor gave me in charge—I never touched his watch, but I was shoved against him.</p>

On the 27th of February the prisoner came to my shop; my man was showing her some rings in a tray, which contained thirty or forty rings - I was looking from a back window, and saw her take a ring from the tray, and after attempting to look at it, put it into her month; the shopman then suspected she had done something with it, but his suspicions were removed by her returning him a brass one; I then sent for an officer, and with some difficulty this ring was got from her mouth.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and this brass ring was produced at the shop; the shopman said she had stolen a gold one; I asked what she had one with it; she said she had not one - I asked her to open her mouth, which she would not do; I opened it by force and this ring was in it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

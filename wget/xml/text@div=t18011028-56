Yes, but they were connected with one another; I waited some time, and Blundell came in again; I asked him for my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180110280051"></xptr>waistcoat; he said, he knew nothing of any waistcoat; I applied to the landlord again to get it back for me; he took me by the shoulders, and turned me into the street; I was going to Lambeth-street, I met an officer; I took him to the public-house, and he seemed to know two of the men, and they talked together, and he sat down and drank with them, and liberated him.</p>

I immediately took out my little staff, and said, this is my authority; he gave me a blow upon the breast; several watchmen were in the tap-room sitting down, and did not attempt to assist me; he then got bold, and said, d-n your eyes, I will score some of you, and made a blow with a knife at my arm; I did not know I was wounded till I felt the blood run.</p>

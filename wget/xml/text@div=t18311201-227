            . I live in New-cut, Lambeth - my father is a baker. On the 29th of November, about five o'clock in the evening, I was in <placeName id="t18311201-227-crimeloc1218">Princes-street, Westminster</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q.What are you? A. I lived at a baker's about three months ago - I am now looking for a situation; it was rather dark when this happened - I stood at the corner of Tothill-street, and could see which way they went; the man turned up Fludyer-court once, and the next time up Dean-street; I sometimes looked at him and somethimes at the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not first charge the prisoner's brother with doing this? A.When he stood up I said it was not him.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. King gave me information on the 29th of November, and I took the prisoner in bed with another man; he said he knew nothing about any stones - I asked if he had got any in a court, at the back of his house; he said, "No, I have no stones there;" I said, "Well, this boy says he saw you take some there;" he said, "Oh, they are my stones;" that he had bought them of one person and another - he could not exactly say who; I went with Mr. Howell, and brought the stones from the court to Newway watch-house; King pointed out where they were taken from - they are large flag-stones - we compared them with the place, and four exactly fitted the place; we found fourteen - after he gave me information I went to a court in the Almonry, and found some large flagstones; I watched, and the prisoner and another man came out of the house; King immediately said, "These are the two men;" they went towards the stones - I afterwards went and found them in bed, as I have stated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he go up to the stones? A. No, because he saw me - I am certain he faced and saw me; they were regular square stones - one in particular fitted in the joint; King at first charged the prisoner's brother with this.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the prisoner claim the stones, and say he had bought them? A. Yes; I told him there were fourteen; he said he had bought them all - no stone would fit, unless it was the size of the one taken up -King pointed out a small stone to me, which fitted exactly.</p>

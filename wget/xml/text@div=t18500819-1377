I received this half-crown and these two shillings from Mr. Elliott, on 11th Aug.—I went to the prisoner lodging, and she was given into custody—I saw a blue vapour rising from the fire, and I said to her, "There has been metal passed through that fire within a minute or two"—I saw some little white bubbles of metal—I saw some part of it on the ashes—I have got a part of it here.</p>

                  </hi>. This half-crown is bad, and these two shillings are bad, and from one mould—this metal is very similar to the metal the coin it made of; it might have come from the soldering part of the saucepan—if it had not been full of water, the solder might run—I should think there would not have been so much as two ounces of solder in the saucepan—I have now examined this metal with a penknife, and I think I can say it is the same metal as the coins are made of.</p>

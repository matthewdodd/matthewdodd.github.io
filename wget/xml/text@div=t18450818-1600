                  </hi>. I am an officer. I was on duty in plain clothes, and met the prisoner in Austin<lb></lb>friars with something bulky under bis jacket—I followed him into Broad-street—he crossed over to a woman who kept a fruit-stall, said something to her, and gave her a bottle, which she put under her basket—I followed him round by the Bank—he went down a passage into Broad-street, and went towards the woman again—I got to the woman at the same time as him, and asked what he had under his jacket when he passed down Austin<lb></lb>friars—he said he had nothing at all—I took the bottle from the woman's basket, and asked her whose it was—she said she did not know, but a man had left it there, and was to call for it in half an hour—I am sure it is what the prisoner had given her, for I had seen the label on the seal.</p>

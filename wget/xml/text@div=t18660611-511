                  </hi>. I am shopboy to Daniel Thorne, who keeps a cook's shop in Lisson-grove—on the 3rd of May the prisoner came at a little past ten o'clock and asked for a quarter of a pound of boiled pork and a halfpenny-worth of greens, which came to threepence-halfpenny—she gave me a shilling—I gave her eightpence-halfpenny, and put the shilling in the till—there was another shilling there and some small coins—she came back again soon after for some pork and greens, and gave me another shilling, which I put in the till—she came back again a few minutes afterwards for more pork and greens, and gave me another shilling, which I put in the till, and gave her the change—she came a fourth time for the same thing, and gave me another shilling—I put it in my mouth, and then took it to the detector and bent it, and laid it on the counter—I then went after the prisoner, and found her two doors away, took her back, and found the shilling where I had left it—I said, "You have been passing bad money"—she said that I had made a mistake, she had not been in the shop before—I said that she had been in four times—I called my master and gave him the bad shilling—I found one good shilling and three bad ones in the till—I had put no</p>

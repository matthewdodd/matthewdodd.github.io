            . I am wife to the prosecutor: about a fortnight before the 24th of January, the prisoner was at my door with a little baby in her arms, and was frighted at a drove of cattle that went by; the seemed sickly. I asked her to come in and sit down with her baby; I never saw her before that time; and on the 24th of January she came to my door again, and thank'd me for my civility, when she was so frightened with the cattle, and said her little baby was dead. I asked her to sit down; she sat till my husband came to dinner, and would send for a pot of twopenny; she drank to my husband, when he came in; she said she was very bad with her breasts when we were at dinner: I said I could not draw them with a full stomach, but if she would come again, in about an hour and a half, I would draw them for her; she came again in that time, and I drew them for her; then she would insist upon having a dram; I sent a little boy for it: I had some suspicion of her after that; she desired me to lend her a looking-glass; I shut the door while she used it, and was looking another way: I believe she then took the watch; for, as soon as she was gone, I miss'd it; she gave me a false direction to come to draw her breasts the next morning: after I miss'd the watch I went and told my husband.</p>

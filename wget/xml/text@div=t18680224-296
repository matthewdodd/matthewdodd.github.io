                  </hi>. I live at 9, Windmill Row—Hart and I work toge<lb></lb>ther, and sell boxes—I was with him all day on Tuesday, the 4th—I went with him to Mr. Foster's with some boxes on a barrow—we got there about a quarter past three, and left at five or ten minutes to four—we went into the shop, and saw Nicholls—I have frequently been there, and know him very well—the boxes were paid for—we got back as near six as possible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where does Hart reside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Windmill Road, further down, on the other side of the way—I do not know hie number—I have been in business with him three years—I have been in the habit of supplying Messrs. Foster with boxes, and other large firms—ours is only a winter partnership—I am a general dealer—in the summer he does not assist me then—on the morning of the 4th I went out at half-past nine to Covent Garden—I was at the police court when the prisoners were com<lb></lb>mitted—I</p>

               <p>was examined—I did not hear Hart make his statement—I was outside, and was not called in before the case was over—I was examined—I went to the police-court to see how Hart got on, and he called on me—he was not out on bail between the first examination and the second—he did not call on me to go to the first examination—he did not think he was going to be detained—I have that from people about the court—I went up there because I thought he would call upon me—it is a fact that I went to Bell's, in Covent Garden, with Hart—we bought twelve boxes, and we took sixteen—I do not carry a watch, nor does Hart, but I looked at the clock at Messrs. Foster's; it was a quarter past three, and the parties said we should have to wait—it might have been later—we left Covent Garden about twelve o'clock, and I went to our stable, where we mend the boxes—we left the stable between one and two—it is in Windmill Street, near my house—I was not at my house again in the middle of the day—I live in Windmill Row—we did not go from Windmill Street to Foster's—we went to a public-house, and had some beer—we knew it was too soon to go to Foster's—we next went to buy some more boxes—after we left Foster's we went to get some more boxes to cooper up till next day—we did not get home till six—I recollect that particular day, because it was Tuesday, the 4th of the month—we go to Messrs. Foster's twice or three times a week, and some<lb></lb>times once a week—I have supplied him with boxes since—I did not go there again the same week—I went twice last week—I cannot say whether I went there the week before 4th February; I might—I recollect 4th February, because it was the night the prisoner was taken.</p>

                  </hi> I am a butcher, and live in Bridge-place, City-road—the prisoner was in my service for about six weeks. On the 22nd of March I ordered him to go to market with the cart for my father—he came up to the door, and I ordered him to take a side of beef to the cart—he had got the straw up in one corner of the cart, and I wanted it put about the cart—I went to it, and saw this bundle—I said, "What is this?"—he said, "My dirty clothes"—I looked at it, and found it was some fat of mine—he had no business with it.</p>

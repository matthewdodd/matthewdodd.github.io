                  </hi>. I am chief waiter at the Rautzenkrantz Hotel, at Eisenach—I recollect the prisoner coming there on 24th November, 1875, but I saw him about three weeks before that, when he came to make inquiries and engaged three rooms—he signed the visitors' book on that occasion; I produce it—he signed it as Count von Howard—about three weeks afterwards he came to reside at the hotel with a lady who passed as his wife; they occupied the three rooms, a bed-room, a sitting-room, and a study or writing-room—I have been in the writing-room about twice, to ask him questions; I always saw. him in the sitting-room when I wanted to see himthe writing-room opened on to the passage; the door was always locked, and the key was in the sitting-room—when he came, he brought fourteen or sixteen portmanteaus; they were all kept in the writing-room—letters were never delivered at the hotel for him; he always went to the post-office to get them there-two days after he came, the postman brought some letters, and the prisoner sent them back to the office, and said "I will come down and fetch them"—during the time he was at the hotel I some<lb></lb>times saw him bring in newspapers and letters; they were small letters—he had no visitors while with us—on 21st February Mr. Schmidt, the burgomaster, and Mr. Weller, and a police-officer came and asked for Mr. Howard—I took them to the writing-room; it was then unlocked—they went into the room—the prisoner was sitting at a writing-table; he did not understand German very well, and I interpreted what was said—I said to him in English "The gentlemen want to speak to you about your passport"—he said "I have not got any passport"—the burgomaster afterwards took him into custody, and he was taken away—I believe Mr. Schmidt locked the portmanteaus and also the room, and put the key in his pocket—he returned in the afternoon with the Judge of Instruction and Dr. Baltzar, and went into the writing-room; no one had been into that room in the meantime; they took possession of all the papers and portmanteaus—whilst the prisoner was with us he used to go away early in the morning to different places, and come back late at night—he did not say where he had been; he did that about once a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been at the hotel about four years—English and American visitors often come there; they occasionally go away for trips and come back againthe prisoner remained about three months at our hotel altogether-at the time the burgomaster came the portmanteaus were unlocked and the room door also—it is the custom in Germany for visitors to go to the post-office and receive their letters.</p>

               <p>Ernst Schmidt (<hi rend="italic">interpreted</hi>). I am the second burgomaster at Eisenach, in the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar—I first saw the prisoner there last winter; I cannot say in what month—it was at the Hotel de Rautzenkrantz—on 21st February last, in consequence of some information received from England, I went to that hotel and saw the prisoner there; the waiter Rimmermann was with me—I went into the writing-room and caused the prisoner to be arrested—I locked the door of the room, and took the key with me—there were a quantity of papers on the table in the room and in the portmanteaus—I returned the same afternoon with the Judge of In<lb></lb>struction, the public prosecutor, and Professor Baltzar, a sworn expert—he understands English; I do not—he examined the papers in the room; they were collected and taken away—I believe I saw seventeen seals, but I think I can only recognise one; they were lying in a box on the table—some had three seals on one handle—I can identify, this seal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) by the in<lb></lb>scription <hi rend="italic">samar poto;</hi> the prisoner said it was the seal of the Norfolk family—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the portmanteau in which there were a great many letters—I did not notice these two books.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not pay particular attention to the date when I first saw the prisoner, but I remember seeing him once going out in a sleigh, therefore I suppose it was about Christmas time—I took my dinner at the same hotel where he was lodging, and I think I have seen him there on repeated occasions before that—I did not see him in the spring of 1875; I am quite certain about that—I don't know whether I saw him that summer—we had received from England an impression of a seal, and I found a corresponding seal in the prisoner's room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Doctor of Philosophy, and reside at Eisenach—on the afternoon of 21st February last, I went with Mr. Schmidt and other persons to the hotel at Eisenach—we went into the writing-room—I saw papers on the table, and also remarked the box of seals—there were about silken or seventeen; some had three sides and some two; altogether they would make forty-five or fifty impressions—I looked at the papers in the room by the order of the Judge of Instruction—I recognise these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as being on the table. (<hi rend="italic">This was a Utter dated 14th February</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">from Mr. Thornewell, on the fly-sheet of which was some writing in red ink, and an unfinished letter headed "Strictly private and confidential," and a piper containing the name of "Richard Harvey" and various other names</hi>.) These two books were also found in the room; I have had them at my house several days and examined them-at page 189 I find "Richard Harvey, Castle Baynard, 13, Upper Thames Street, and Carnousie House,—. Turriff, Aberdeenshire, 15/1/75;" at page 191, "J. Harvey, legacy, 30/1;" 192 "J. Harvey, A B letter"; 196, "J.

Tuesday"—I also find a number of similar entries against the name of "C. H. Williams"—in this other book all the various items under the head of "J.

               <p>great many such in a portmanteau—I saw a large number of letters which purported to be written by Mr. J.

H."—at page 24 of this smaller book I find an entry relating to Colonel Murray and a request to forward enclosed letter; there is no date to that entry—I also found some envelopes with the words "On Her Majesty's service."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I met the burgomaster and the public accuser at the hotel at their request and went with them to the prisoner's room—we looked over everything that was on the table, and we looked into the large port<lb></lb>manteau that contained the letters, but I did not see everything then, of course; they were all brought to the Court-house, and these two books and the letters were sent to my house by the Judge of Instruction perhaps two or three months later—I don't recollect seeing the books or the pencil enve<lb></lb>lopes when I went to the hotel—there were papers and envelopes not written upon, large ruled sheets of the same sort and colour as these produced—I think there was also note paper and envelopes; I don't think any of those were sent to me.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The letter was as follows:</hi> "Strictly private and confidential. Mr. F. C. Judford presents his com<lb></lb>pliments to Mr. John Harvey.

Neumunster, Canton Zurich, Switzerland—on that letter there is now some writing in red ink which was not there when I sent it, it is a summary of the following letter that I received; the envelope is also written on, it is in red ink "J.

Bank of England note in a calico cover for security, and inside was an envelope directed to Judford; I registered that letter at Cornhill—I now find on that letter the draft of a reply which I afterwards received informing me that no one else was interested in the will—I received the letter of 4th June in the same way through the English post, and on 9th June I received in the same way this letter acknowledging the receipt of my letter containing the half note—on 10th June I wrote this letter, which is dated in error 10th July, in which I enclosed the halves of three notes, one for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., one for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I received an acknowledgment of their receipt, dated 16th June—on the 17th June I sent the remaining halves of the notes, making up the 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I registered that in the same way at Cornhill, and addressed it to Urach; this is the receipt for the registration of that letter—I afterwards received this letter acknowledging the remaining half notes; that letter purports to be written from Morton Hampstead, near Exeter—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the notes I sent—I did not receive the will—I received and wrote these other letters (<hi rend="italic">looking at several</hi>), one of them, dated 21st July, 1875, intimates that Mr. Howard was going to travel in Spain, Portugal, and various places—I wrote to some of those addresses and my letters were returned through the Dead Letter office—I was a month or six weeks after that without any communication from Judford—I had a letter addressed to London which had gone to Dusseldorff and had been a month on the way home; in that he told me to put an advertisement in she "Courier" under the, heading of <hi rend="italic">Ego Potomi</hi>—I did so on 2nd, 9th, and 30th October and 11th and 27th November—I afterwards received this letter of 20th Decem<lb></lb>ber addressed to me by Judford with the same penny stamp on it-previous to that I received a letter, which I have lost, telling me that the holder of the will, not having heard from me so long, had deposited it with a relative or some lady, the soul of honour, who would not give it up—some time after that I communicated with the police in Scotland Yard-in the early part of this year I heard that a Mr. von. Howard was in custody at Eisenach and on 30th March I obtained a warrant from the Lord Mayor for his arrest that was put into the hands of the police—I afterwards attended at the Mansion House when the prisoner was brought over—before that I received this letter, dated 10th July, 1876, signed Howard, purporting to come from Eisenach—I knew nothing personally of Mr. Richard Harvey, of Greenway, Dartmouth, who is referred to in these letters—I am not related to him that I know of-when I sent the Bank notes I believed that the letters I wrote addressed to Judford were received by Herr von Howard and forwarded to to Judford in London, that he was a solicitor, and was acting for some client—I believed all the statements contained in these letters; unless I had believed that I would not have sent the Bank notes.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This letter was in almost the some terms as the first addressed to Mr. Harvey, only stating the amount in this case was</hi> 50,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) Upon that I wrote this answer—I must explain that I read his name as Hovard, not Howard, and if you look at my envelopes you can see that all through—I neglected to mention that before the Magistrate—I sent the answer in an envelope to Mr. Tent—I have seen produced by Mr. Clarke nearly all the letters I wrote to Howard, and the outside envelopes—I do not find any inside envelopes addressed to Tent—I produce all the letters I received from Tent, they all have the same seal and the same writing, and all have penny stamps—here is a letter dated 16th February, in which 380<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is proposed to be paid for the purpose of releasing the will—there was a further correspondence, and in August, 1874,. I sent the bank-notes the first address was Passau, Bavaria, and in August, 1874, the address was changed to Moileu—I did not receive the will—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter in which I enclosed the notes, I sent the halves in a registered letter, and the will not being forthcoming I delayed sending the remaining halves; I did after<lb></lb>wards send them—I received this letter of 31st March, 1875, through the English post-office. (<hi rend="italic">This was marked "private and confidential" and stated when week after week passed without a letter from Mr. Williams, the will was retained under certain conditions which had not been violated.</hi>) I remember a letter informing me that Mr. Howard was going to change his address, and I sent letters to the address given me, which were returned through the Dead Letter Office—I was without any comunica-tion with Mr. Tent, and I advertised for him in the "Times", about 9th January, 1875, and got this answer. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had returned the will in his possession for six weeks, and that then, not hearing from Mr. C. Williams he had returned it to the holder</hi>.) I have never received the will, and I did not get my money back—I communicated with the police at Scotland Yard when I heard that he was taken in custody—I then got a warrant which was sent over to Germany—I knew nothing of Tent or Howard—Mr. Richard Harvey, was a cousin of mine—I knew that he died in December, 1870, and heard of his leaving 390,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by will and codicilsthe description on this paper, Charles Henry Williams, son of Sir William Williams, of Tregellan, is a description of myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I lire at 27, Red Lion Square, and am an expert in handwriting which I have made my study for many years—I have been many times examined in Courts of Justice, to assist the Court—I have examined the letter found on the writing table and marked "Private and confidential", also a letter from Mr. Thornley, with some red ink writing on the second page; also a number of letters written in the name of Judford; also the red<lb></lb>ink writing on some letters purporting to be written by Mr. Harvey; also the letters purporting to be written by Mr. Tent, to Captain Williams, and they are all without doubt in the same writing—this letter to Captain Williams, with red ink on it is no doubt, also in the same writing, and so is the whole of this, document marked T 75—this document headed "Doctor's Commons," also seems in the same writing—this envelope to the hotel-keeper and the memorandum enclosed appear to be the same I speak more strongly about the enclosure—this letter to the "Daily Telegraph," dated February 21st, is in the same writing, but it is in an altered style—I have looked at the signatures on the list of visitors at the German Hotel; and the signature in the Urach post-book, they bear the same signature as this letter to Lord Derby, and this letter to Sir Robert Carden; but—they are studied writing, they are unnatural—these two letters produced by Mr. Groth, and signed Howard are in the same writing as this to Lord Derby, and the letter written in prison, the yare the same signature, the same writing and the same style—this letter to Mr. Harvey, 86 A., dated July, 1876, are in the same writing—I have examined these letters from the War Office, I should not know them by comparison, but letter No. 84 is in a different style of writing to those written to the War Office—the letters signed Tent and Judford, and the letters in red ink are in the same' writing; the letter to the "Telegraph" seems to be the connecting link between the two, I should not have been able to found that opinion without the letter to the "Telegraph."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I say that the writing of the letter from the prison is different from the Judford and Tent letters, and, but for what I call the connecting link I should come to the conclusion that it was a different writing—I have the assistance of the letters to the War Office, they are a good deal more like the Judford letters—I am a professional witness, I am not a lithographer—I sometimes appear for the Crown, and sometimes for prisoners—my livelihood is not derived from the fees I receive; I have a private income—I sometimes appear with Mr. Netherclift, a brother expert, and sometimes against him—I recollect the case of Davis and May, in the Probate Court, in December, 1875, that was a suit to upset a will on the ground that the signature of the testator was a forgery—I gave evidence with Mr. Netherclift, on behalf of the will, and we both derived our fees from that side—I did not give an opinion, I only pointed out discrepancies—I was not in Court to know whether the jury stopped the case before Justice.</p>

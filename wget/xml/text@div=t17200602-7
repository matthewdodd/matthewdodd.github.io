The Evidence for the King deposed that the Prosecutor's Lock of his Closet Door was broke off and his Trunk taken away; that there were in the Trunk several Lottery Tickets, one of them a Prize of 10 l. a Note for 100 l. a Sword-Blade-Bond for 100 l. and other things besides those mention'd in the Indictment; that some of the Writings were found on the Custom-house Key, and that he had his Note and Bond again, but not the Ticket of 10 l.

Prize, but he could not tell the Number of the Ticket, that the next Morning he follow'd him to East-Malling, and took him out of his Bed, that he owned he shewed the Ticket at Rochester, and offer'd him a Bond for the Money, and produced some small pieces of Paper saying that was the Ticket, but it was tore so very small that he could not tell the Letters; that he owned he left the Trunk on the Custom-house Keys, and said the Sheets were left at a Cooks; but going there to enquire for them, the Cook declared that he had left nothing there. The Prisoner denied the whole Matter, and in his Defence said, that he workt for the Prosecutor Six Weeks, lay in the House, and had Opportunities enough to have robb'd him, but that he never wrong'd him of any thing; that the Prosecutor used to leave his Door open for his Brother to come in at late Hours, and sometimes a Candle for him in the Entry, so that any Body might come in and rob him.

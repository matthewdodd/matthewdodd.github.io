               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Have you brought your books here? A. Yes; I am a diamond merchant - I think I have been about three years and a half in the wadding business; Middleton had been with me the whole time - he was never in partnership with me, and I never said so to any one; I could not say it; a gentleman named Day and his lady called on me - I never told them that he was my partner; he, at first, had a guinea a week as wages, then 25s., and, from the 2nd of May last, he has had 30s. - there is an entry in my book of the bulk of the wages of the whole of my servants - he used to put it down on a state; I sent him the money - he paid the men, and took his own wages week by week; I never told him he should have half the profits, nor that if the trade made a crown he should have half of it - I have lived in White-street, and in Wentworth-street, before I went to George-street; I had the misfortune to be burnt out of two places - my landlord warned me out of two places - this machine had been standing unemployed below for six or eight months; it could not be brought into work - there was no carding on it; it was merely the wood work; I had not mentioned any wish to sell it - we could, at any time, bring it into work- it is very large, and would weigh 14cwt. or 15cwt.: my clerk entered it in the book, on the 19th of July, as if it had been sold; it was not to his account, but to mine - here is the entry of it in this book; I have a wages-book in which the wages of each man is entered; I have sometimes eighteen or twenty men at work in the factory, but at that time there was but little work, and I probably had not more than two boys and a man; I used to see the book from time to time, but I was not there regularly; I have not probably gone there for a month or five weeks; I have seen that the entries were made from week to week - Middleton bought and sold what was wanted; here is the entry of the machine to Snape at 3l. 10s.; it was put down on the 19th of July, in Burrell's hand-writing- it is carried into my journal; I sent for Middleton, and took him up - I took Stultz and 
               <persName id="t18311020-166-person1147">Jones</persName>
             the next day; I preferred a bill at the September Session - the Grand Jury threw it out; I was examined as a witness, and so was Burrell and Leonard; but Snape, the principal witness, was kept out of the way - I have every reason to suppose so; I can swear he had removed, and no one could tell where he was gone - when the bill was thrown out I did not make any application to the prisoners to forgive me for what was past, and say I would take no further notice about it - I went before the Grand Jury again the next day, with the same witnesses and the same charge; Snape<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200066"></xptr>was not found - I never said that it was not the value of the machine I cared about; that it might be removed over and over again, for what I cared, but I felt sore at Stultz taking the concern to my prejudice - he had set up business in Spicer-street, five hundred yards or half a mile from my place; it appeared that Jones had gone to work for him, as I found him there - Jones had worked for me.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.Had your attention been called to the entry before the 1st of August? A. No; I had not attended there.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Who are Mr. and Mrs. Day? A. I do not know, except that they called at my house one Saturday, and asked about Middleton; it appeared that Middleton had gone into the country for the purpose of marrying Mr. Day's daughter; they said he had represented to them that he was carrying on an extensive business in the wadding-manufactory, and they thought it adviseable to come to me - I said he was a trust-worthy servant, and I had every confidence in him, but he had not one shilling except what he received from me; if they thought proper to give their daughter to him, and she had any fortune, I would give up the business to him, as I was tired of it - that was all that passed; I think that must have been in the month of June - the conversation, between me and Middleton, took place on the 18th of July; it was stated he had sold the machine six weeks prior to that - he had no authority whatever to deal with any machinery or plant of mine, without my direction - it was his constant course to sell the wadding, to attend the factory, to make the wadding, and give account of it; here is no entry of the sale of the fly-wheel, or tub, or carding - they are quite distinct from the machine; the fires, at my former premises, were accidental - our premises are not insurable.</p>

            . I was, in June last, in the service of the prosecutor. I remember the carding-engine being in the cellar - it was removed six or seven weeks previous to the prisoners' being taken; I helped to put it into the truck, by direction of Middleton - Snape was there, and assisted; I did not go with the truck. On the 4th of August I went to Mr. Stultz's premises - I saw the machine and the fly-wheel; they were the same as had been at the factory, but as to the carding it is impossible to say - sixteen or seventeen sheets of carding had been missed from the factory about three weeks before; they are about two feet and a half in length, and sixteen inches wide - there was only a piece here and there found on the machine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.What time in the day did you remove this? A.About two o'clock in the day; I did not see Burrell there - there were five or six of us present; I did not tell my master of it - Mr. Snape and Jones were there; a lad named Conner, and another named Miller - we were not desired to keep it secret; the machine could not be used without the fly-wheel and trough; there was some old carding on the machine when it went - I received 12s. a week, and there might be seven or eight at the factory in July, receiving wages- Middleton paid us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Were you in the service of the prosecutor, when he removed from one place to another? A. Yes; I do not know whether Snape was employed to remove his articles then - Middleton lived on the premises, and used to pay the men; Mr. Mellingen came every morning to the factory -Borrell kept the books.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean you saw Mr. Mellingen every morning? A.Sometimes he might miss a morning or two, or a week.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Mellingen. About the middle of July I had some conversation with him about a carding-machine - I had not then missed it; I went to Middleton, and told him that Mr. Mellingen had been inquiring of me about the sale of a carding-machine, and if it was sold it had not come to my knowledge - he took no notice, but turned round, and walked out; I went into the cellar, and missed the machine - I spoke to Middleton again in a day or two, in the counting-house; I said, "That machine is gone, and you have not made me acquainted with it;" he said the reason was that he had not got settled with for it - it would have been his duty to have mentioned the sale of it to me whether it had been paid for or not; on the 19th of July, which was after the conversation, I entered it in this day-book, by the direction of Middleton, "One carding-machine, sold for cash to 
               <persName id="t18311020-166-person1150">W. </persName>
            Snape, 3l. 10s.;" Middleton is charged with it by this entry - I went to Stultz, and saw the machine on the 1st of August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you and your wife reside on these premises? A. Yes, in a dwelling-house behind the factory; I cannot tell how many men were employed on the premises - there is a wages-book of the men who are employed, but that is at the factory; the wages are entered here in a lump - here is a running account with Middleton in this book; on this page it appears he had a balance of 1l. 11s. 6d. in his hands - he had always paid the men their wages, and perhaps did not like his name to appear; Mr. Mellingen is my master, but I call many a man my master - I may have called Middleton so in a joke; I swear I never considered him my master, and he never was so - I do not recollect whether I have ever called him so; Mr. Mellingen sometimes came every morning, and sometimes not for a week - he was very uncertain; I have known him stay away longer than a week - in July, to the best of my recollection, he made it his business to come every morning; I do not think I ever knew him to stay away a month or six weeks together - he might stay two or three days, or a week; it was my duty to go out to travel - Middleton did not go away till August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did you make the entry on the 19th of July? A. Yes, and I told Mr. Mellingen of it, I believe, the next day - I do not recollect that Middleton knew I had told Mr. Mellingen of it; I kept the books, by Mr. Mellingen's direction - here is one of them, marked at the edge

               <p>COURT. Q. How long did you continue issuing bills of parcels in the name of Middleton, when, as you repre<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200067"></xptr>sent, he was not a partner? A. I cannot say; they were in the name of Middleton only.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to MR. MELLINGEN. Q.Can you explain the statement of the last witness? A. In consequence of an indictment against two persons, named Owen and Riley, who were in my employ, of which they were convicted, for a conspiracy to defraud me of about 1200l., and as Owen had been to my customers and received money which I sent for again, the customers would not purchase any more goods from the factory, as they said they did not know what they were about, and I directed Middleton to send what goods did go out in his name.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How came you to keep Middleton in your employ after what you found out? A I was told if I let it rest a few days, I should find out such things as would astonish me.</p>

I do not recollect what he said - I do not know what passed; he might mention the machine - I think there was something he said, that I was to say he bought it of me for 10l. - he had not bought it, nor given me any money.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it after the machine had been removed that Middleton told you it was to be booked? A. Yes, three weeks after; I said it made no difference - I had paid nothing, but was to have 5l. for repairing it.</p>

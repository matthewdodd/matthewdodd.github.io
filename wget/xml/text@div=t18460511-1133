                  </hi>. I keep the Paul Pindar public-house in Chiswell-street, St. Luke's—the prisoner was in my service about ten weeks—on the 4th of April I put some marked money in the till—I cannot say that I missed any of that, because we are constantly taking money—the prisoner was given in charge on the 11th of April—the officer searched his box—six shillings and one sixpence were found marked—five of the shillings had my mark on them—I put marked money in the till several times, marked in the same way—before I gave the prisoner into custody, I told him I had reason to believe he had been robbing me, and asked him if he had any objection to be searched—he said, not the slightest—he was searched by the officer, but nothing was found—it was his duty in the event of his taking any money on my part, to put it into the till—if he wanted change for a shilling or half-crown, he would take it from the till—I had spoken to Mr. Gamble, a friend of mine—he marked a shil<lb></lb>ling, and he spoke to another friend, who marked a sixpence—the other marked shilling, found in the prisoner's box, had been marked by Mr. Gam<lb></lb>ble—I keep halfpence and sixpences and shillings on a sideboard in the bar—the prisoner might have given change from there—if my friend had given him a marked shilling, he might have gone to the money on the sideboard to get a sixpence and some pence, supposing there were none in the till, and then the marked shilling would be put on the sideboard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publican, and live in Beech-street. On the 8th of April I went to Mr. Robinson's bar—the prisoner served me with a glass of ale—I gave him in payment a shilling, which I had previously marked—he went to the first till, and I heard a noise, as though it had gone into the till, and he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out.</p>

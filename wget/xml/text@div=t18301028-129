               <p>EDWARD JONES. I was at the search of the prisoner's box on the 11th of October; the officer asked him if he had anything in his box belonging to me; he said he had nothing besides his own things - I saw the articles mentioned found in his box; the officer pointed them out, and asked whose they were - before I could make any reply the prisoner said, "They are Mr. Jones';" I asked him why he had taken the white wax; he said to make some cold cream of - he did not say why he took the other things; they are worth six or seven shillings.</p>

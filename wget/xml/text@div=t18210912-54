On Saturday the 23d of June, the prisoner came to my shop, and wished to look at some lumps of sugar, for compounds; stating that his mother had driven it off late, and wished particularly to know if I could send a person with him with the goods; I said, Yes. I shewed him three sorts of lumps; he fixed on one sort, and gave me the price I asked, which was 106 s. per cwt. He ordered 56 lbs. I pressed him to take other goods, and sold him 1 lb. of tea and some pepper - they came together to 3 l. 1 s. 6 d.; he tendered me a 5 l. Bank note - I asked his address; his answer was, "Lord, No. 4, Searle's-place." I asked where Searle's place was? he said, Castle-street. I then gave him the change, and put his name and address on the back of it, in his presence. (Looks at one.) This is it; it has that written on it by me, "23 - 6 21". I ordered my shopman,

In consequence of what he said, I went to No. 4, Searle's-place, Carey-street, Chancery-lane, and found no person answering his name or description. Castle-street is on the opposite side of Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. This was Saturday night - A, Yes, between eight and nine o'clock; he was alone, and was nearly half an hour with me; I was busy, and could not immediately attend to him; my young man was serving in the shop. I found there was no Searle's-place in Castle-street. I think I took no other 5 l. note that night. I cleared out my till about every two hours, and had cleared it previous to taking this - there was no note in it when I put this in; I put others in after. I am positive he is the man. I marked it in his presence.</p>

             I am shopman to the last witness. I carried the goods which the prisoner bought. I heard him ask for sugar, but did not hear the address he gave; I walked behind him all the way with the goods, he went down Gray's Inn-lane, across Holborn, to Southanpton-buildings, down into Chancery-lane - he was joined by another man in Chancery-lane; they both walked on before me together, to Randall's public-house, the Hole-in-the-Wall, Chancery-lane; the prisoner then jumped on the bar before the window, looked into the tap-room, and said,"My father is at home;" the other man immediately said, "The devil he is?" The prisoner said, what shall we do now. The other said to me, if I whistle, bring them in; the prisoner said, never mind whistling, my father must see them, bring them in, they then both took them out of my basket, and carried them in themselves. I went home, and immediately after, went back to the public-house, to search for them, they were gone.</p>

               <p>"You may as well treat Betsey with this pair of boots, it is your first treat;" he said he would, and took his pocket-book out of his pocket, and took out a 5 l. note. Lee immediately took the note from his hand and said to me,</p>

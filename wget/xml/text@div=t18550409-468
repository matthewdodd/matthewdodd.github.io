                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mrs. Morgan, a milliner, in New North-road, Hoxton. On 13th Feb. a female came to the shop, and selected a quantity of goods to the amount of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; she directed them to be sent to No. 21, Marion-square, Ann's-place, Hackney-road, and her husband would pay the money—about a quarter past 7 o'clock on the evening of that day, I went to No. 21, Marion-square; I took a boy with me with the goods—I saw the same female there—the prisoner opened the door to me, and asked what I wanted—I said I had brought the goods from Mrs. Morgan's, which were ordered to be sent by half past 6 o'clock (that was the direction of the female)—the prisoner called his wife, and he said to me, "Oh, Miss, I did not expect you here to-night!"—I said, "Mrs. Wilson ordered the things to be sent at half past 6 o'clock, but I could not get here before"—he then told his wife to take the goods into the back parlour—he examined the bill, and said, "It is all right"—he then took out his pocket book, and took out this cheque (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—he said the smallest amount he had got was 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked me if I had got change—my bill was 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I had not change, and I asked him if he could not get change for the cheque—he said, "No;" but if I had come the next morning, he would have had change—he said he could not get change, for he was quite a stranger, he had only just moved into the house, he had only been there half an hour, but if I would take the cheque, he would call for the change in the morning—he said he was not afraid to trust Mrs. Morgan with the change—he said Mr. Topham, in the City, had recommended him to our shop—I do not know such a name—when he opened the door, I asked for Mr. Wilson, and he answered to that name—I took the cheque and went out of the door, and he called me backhand said, "You have not given me a receipt"—I wrote on the back of the invoice, "Received by cheque of George Wilson, 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I gave the invoice to him; he wanted me to receipt it on the front, on the receipt stamp, but I would not; I thought if there was anything wrong, he could come upon me for having receipted it—he said, "You had better do it"—I said, "No, you will call in the morning and Mrs. Morgan will do it"—when I got home, I gave the cheque to Mrs. Morgan, and in consequence of what she said, I went back to Marion-square as soon as possible—I knocked at the door, and a female came up—I could get no intelligence of the prisoner, except that they said he was a friend of theirs, and he had come there and stopped about twenty minutes, and he had lodged with them about two years ago—I went back to Mrs. Morgan—the prisoner did not call the next morning for his change—I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier at the Royal British Bank, in the Strand. This cheque for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., was presented through Prescott's and paid—I authorised its payment; I passed it, believing it to be genuine—this other cheque for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was presented to me, I declined to pay it—there was some<lb></lb>thing suspicious about it—it was torn, which led me to examine it more particularly than I did the first, which coming in through a banker's, I paid—a person named Wallace some time since had an account at our bank,</p>

               <p>which was closed, I suppose, about fifteen months ago—there was a cheque book delivered to Mr. Wallace, and these cheques came from a cheque book which we gave to Mr. Wallace.</p>

                  </hi>. I was sometime since in partnership with Mr. Doherty—I had an account at the Royal British Bank, about five years—I had several cheque books delivered to me for the purpose of drawing my cheques—when I dissolved partnership with Mr. Doherty, which was in June last, it was agreed that I should leave all the stock materials and books with him; and I left the last cheque book with him, at No. 1, Bridgwater-square—after the dissolution of partnership in June, I had occasion to go to Bridgwater-square—I called there—I know the prisoner, I have seen him several times at Mr. Doherty's, in Bridgwater-square—he went by the name of George Wilson—I have seen that cheque book once since, on the evening that the account of this case appeared in the news<lb></lb>paper—Mr. Doherty saw it and sent for me—it was on the evening of the examination—I believe Mr. Doherty is in the country.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer.

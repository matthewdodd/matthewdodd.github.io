                  </hi>. I am a furrier, and live in Church-street, Borough—Mr. Murray lives about forty yards from me. On Monday night, the 22nd of April, a little before nine o'clock, I was walking home—I saw Lee standing opposite Mr. Murray's door—Skeggs came to the door and let Lee in, for about three minutes—Skeggs then let her out, and she went up towards St. George's-church—I saw an officer—he took her, and took the bundle from under her arm—she had no bundle with her when she went into Mr. Murray's.</p>

               <p>On the sixteenth of January I lost nineteen pound weight of moist sugar; there is a warehouse where we deposit sugars, in which the several persons named in the indictment are warehouse-keepers, in care of, and answerable for these sugars. I saw the prisoner coming out of the warehouse, and, on searching him, I found nineteen pound weight of moist sugar in his pockets; I cannot say out of what particular hogshead it came, but there was a large quantity of the same quality in the warehouse as that; the prisoner, when he was apprehended, said, somebody had called out work, as is usual when they want, as porters come for the purpose of getting work; and that not finding employment he took the sugar, and said he should have made another trip if I had not stopped him.</p>

               <p>I am one of the partners in the warehouse; I assisted in taking the prisoner; we found the sugar in his pocket; the prisoner said he heard somebody call out work; that he came there, but found nobody to employ him, therefore he thought he ought not to go from thence for nothing, and admitted that he had taken the sugar. When he came before Alderman Sainsbury he did not then deny taking the sugar.</p>

               <p>I found the sugar in a paper bag, under one of the gateways; I found the bag was wet, I put it in my pocket; I was backwards and forwards upon the keys for some time. This person, seeing my pocket stick out, stopped me and asked what I had got. I said sugar. He said he had lost sugar often by soldiers, and was determined to make an example of me.</p>

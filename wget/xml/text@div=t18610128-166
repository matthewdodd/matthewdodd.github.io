I lodge at 6, Adam-street, next to the prosecutor—on the night of 10th January, I heard him distinctly come up-stairs—I did not hear him say anything, but when he had been in his room two or three minutes, I was going down again, and heard him say, "Get out of this, you have no business up here," as near as I can remember—I then heard some-thing which I thought was a friend of his, and that they were merely larking—they opened the front door, and I thought he was going home with a friend—I heard his hat fall distinctly on the pavement, after he went down—he came and told me something next morning, and I noticed a soar on the side of his face—I should say from his talk that he was sober.</p>

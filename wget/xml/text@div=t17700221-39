I came home from money-gathering on the 6th of January about nine in the evening. I went to the Coach and Horses in Whitechapel; there was the prisoner and another woman with her; they asked me to drink; after I had drank, the prisoner asked me to treat her with a dram: I told her I had no money. She asked again; I told her, if she would get me change for a guinea I would treat her with a dram. I gave her a guinea; she went and brought some change, but it was not right; she said it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177002210020"></xptr> was: I said it was not. I never minded it but put it in my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking before?</p>
               <p>Edwards. I had had two glasses of brandy and part of a pint of hot. I was a little in liquor, but not much. She saw I had other money in my purse. I came out there, and was going home; she followed me, and said she wanted to speak to me. I went up <placeName id="t17700221-39-crimeloc228">Petticoat-lane</placeName>

She began fumbling about my breeches: then she said, There is somebody coming: then she went away about a couple of yards and came directly. After some little time she said again there was somebody coming, and ran to the corner of Petticoat-lane: as soon as she got to the lane, I clapped my hand to my pocket and missed my pocket-book; then I felt in my breeches-pocket and missed my money.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you lose?</p>
               <p>Edwards. In all it was 20 l. 6 s. 10 d. It is impossible to tell what species of money it was, I had some at one house and some at another, and gave change at some places. I know I had fifteen guineas, two moidore, two half guineas, a six-and-ninepenny piece, and two quarter guineas. I ran to the corner of Petticoat-lane, and looked about Whitechapel, but could see nothing of her. Then I went to the Three Jolly Weavers; there I found her and the other girl. I took her to the Coach and Horses, and told her she had robbed me. She said she had not seen me, and had never been out of the Coach and Horses with me, and had just then come from the Coach and Horses. I know I had my money in my pocket after I got to the corner of Petticoat-lane. Nobody came near me but she.</p>
               <p>Q. What pocket was your money in?</p>
               <p>Edwards. It was in my right hand breeches-pocket. I will not say the pocket was buttoned. I never got a farthing of it again. She never owned it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>He came in at the Coach and Horses, and asked me if I would drink part of a pint of purl: after that he asked me to drink a dram of gin. I would have rasberry. He gave me a guinea to change. I got change and gave it him. He said he lived with Mr. Matthews, a butcher. He went out and came in again, with his face all over mud, and said he believed I had robbed him. He knocked me down. I asked what he meant by that; he insisted upon my being searched. I was searched by a constable, and nothing found upon me.</p>

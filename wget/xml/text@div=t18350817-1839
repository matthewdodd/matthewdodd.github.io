I saw the prisoner give something into another man's hand, and he went into a baker's shop—my brother officer, Moore, came up, and we secured the prisoner and another, who was discharged—the third man escaped—we were taking them to the station, and as we were going along the prisoner put his hand into his right-hand pocket, took something out in a paper, and threw it over a house, in Brook-green-lane—I went back to the house to make inquiries, and on the flower-bed I found two bad</p>

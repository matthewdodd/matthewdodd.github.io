                  </hi>. I live at Hillingdon-end, and am a labourer, in the em<lb></lb>ploy of John Arthur. On 6th Sept., I used a barrow and screen—I left them outside a shed belonging to Mr. Arthur—I missed them on the 8th, and a tub also, from the shed—I afterwards saw them in the possession of the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a whitesmith, and live in Windsor-street, Uxbridge. I have a shed in my occupation, in the parish of Cowley—I have had the care of it for the last two years and a half—it is enclosed by a wall, and a quick hedge, and a gate, with a lock to it—there was in that shed a wheel-barrow, a tub, and a screen—on 8th Sept I was informed that they were stolen—on 17th I was going through Cowley, and met Thomas Corby, and his labourer, about half a mile from the shed, the labourer was wheeling</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150082"></xptr>
               <p>my barrow—I got out of my cart, and asked Corby where he was going with my barrow, and where he got it—he said that his father lent it him—I said, "The barrow is my property; it has been stolen out of my premises, and there are two other articles "—he said he had seen the other articles, and had no doubt if I went to his father's, he would send them all back—I got a policeman, and give him in charge—the father, Charles Corby, afterwards came to my worktop, and said he was very sorry such a thing had happened, that he had been repairing a building, and as he was on the ladder he saw my barrow in the yard by the side of the shed; that he wanted a bar<lb></lb>row, and he put his ladder over and took it out; then afterwards he wanted the screen, and he took that out; and he wanted the tub, and he had lent them to a friend—I believe he is a bricklayer and plasterer by trade.</p>

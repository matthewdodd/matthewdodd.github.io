                  </hi> I am a plasterer. In March last I lived in Star-court—about half-past twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the 13th of March, I was going up Brad-street, St. Giles's—I did not see any men behind me till they came forward—one man only came forward, that was the prisoner—I had never seen him before—I am sure he is the man—he struck me in the forehead with a small stick—I called for the Police, and he struck me in the face with his naked hand—the policeman came to my assistance, and he ran away—the policeman followed and took him—the other men pulled my coat and got it open—after prisoner was taken, they pushed me into a gin-shop, and said, "Come, old fellow, and have some gin"—the prisoner struck me twice—none of them put their hands into my pocket—I was sober—I bad had nothing but 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> worth of rum-and-water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, of No. 1, Coleman Place, Banner Street, St. Luke's. On Saturday night, 2nd Aug., about 12 o'clock, I was going along Golden Lane, and the prisoner Regan came out of a court or a doorway at a very dark part, and struck me a blow under my left ear with her fist—I did not see her before she struck me—it caused me severe pain, and was swollen for two or three days afterwards—I do not know whether she had anything in her fist, but it was a very hard blow—Flynn then came on my other side, and seized me by the throat, marking my neck with her nails so much that it was bleeding when I appeared before the Alderman on Monday—I was sober—she had her thumb under my throat, and here is the mark of her nails above—I seized both the prisoners, and called for assistance—Regan pulled me down, and Flynn put her hand into my trow<lb></lb>sers pocket, and turned it out—I kept hold of them both by their clothes, and we were all on the ground together—I lost my money, four half crowns, two sixpences, one penny, and two or four halfpence; I have not seen it since—a policeman came up, and I gave Regan into custody; just as he came up, Flynn bit me on this hand in several places, and her dress tore, and she got away from me—my money was safe when I left my father's house, about twenty minutes before—I was going to fetch a pair of boots from Barbican—I went with Regan to the station, and on Sunday morning, about 10 minutes past 6 o'clock, I saw Flynn at Moor Lane.</p>

On Satur<lb></lb>day night, 22nd Aug., shortly after 12 o'clock, I was walking down Bar<lb></lb>bican, and saw the prisoners and prosecutor down Golden Lane; Regan had got hold of him, and they were both striking him—there were twenty or thirty people round—I saw Flynn and the prosecutor fall, if not three of them—a cry of "Police!" was the first thing that attracted my attention—Davis got up, and Flynn got hold of him again; a policeman came up, and Davis gave Regan in charge—I am sure the prisoners are the women—I did not see Flynn go away, but as soon as the officer came up, she was gone—I went to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 135). I was in Golden Lane, saw a mob, and saw Davis holding Regan—he gave her in charge for assaulting and robbing him—he said that there was another, but that she had gone—I saw Flynn standing there, but did not know she was the party; I knew her before—Davis did not see her, as he was engaged holding Regan—he gave me a description at the station, from which I took Flynn at half past 5 o'clock the following morning—I fetched Davis, and he identified her—three farthings were found on Regan, and a halfpenny on Flynn—I found Flynn turning out of Bridgwater Square—she had no dress on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Flynn.</hi> He tore my frock so dreadfully that I could not put it on; he thought I was a prostitute, and offered me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I said, "Go up a little higher, and perhaps you can find the person you want;" he struck me on the eye, and gave me a black eye. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She told me that she was in bed, and had just got up—she had her petticoats on—she said that the prosecutor had torn her gown, and she took it off—she did not show it to me—the prosecutor did not smell of drink; there was nothing to show that he was not perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoners' statements be ore the Magistrate were here read as follow</hi>: "Regan says, When the prosecutor struck Flynn, I asked him what he did it for, and he put his two hands round my neck, here is the mark, and called me a b—w—, and said he would choke me, because we would not go with him; he turned his pockets out himself in the station house, and I told the constable here to look round; it was a quarter past 12 o'clock when he stopped us in the street; I have nothing more to say.' Flynn says, 'On Saturday night he came up to me, and asked me where I was going; I said I was going home, and he said he had a sixpence, "Will you come with me?" I said I would not go with him, and he <hi rend="italic">upped</hi> with his hand, and struck me in the eye; as soon as he struck me in the eye, I laid hold of him by his hair, and I asked the constable here to take me on Saturday night, and he said, "No, you are not the one we want," and he let me go; and on Sunday morning the constable took me, and I asked him what he wanted of me; and when he told me what it was, I came with him; this is all I have got to say."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Flynn's Defence.</hi> I was sent by my mother for a bundle of wood, and met the complainant; he offered me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to go with him to a house; I said that he had better take his money to some one else—he took hold of my dress, and we fell, and when I recovered myself he said that he had been robbed of 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this young woman by my side was the person who had got his money; the policeman told me to go home, and I did so, and next morning he met me, and took me to the station; I was not allowed to speak at Guildhall, and therefore thought I should not be allowed to call any witnesses here, but my mother is here.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business with one partner at 9, Mincing Lane, under the firm of the National Bonus Tea Company—Mr. Arthur Ward was employed by us to get orders—about the 19th November we had a communication from Ward, which I believe was in writing; it was for six half chests of tea—I sent forward an invoice, and got this acceptance from the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can identify the writing, having seen him write—this is a portion of the invoice that I sent him in a letter with a draft for him to accept, and I received back the bill accepted as it now is—I don't know when I first had a personal interview with him; it was before the 6th January—nothing of importance transpired—the bill was not due before that—I received this letter on the 4th December—I believe it is in the pri<lb></lb>soner's handwriting—it is misdated by accident the 3rd November; it came to me on the 4th December. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "No. 2a, Ponsonby, Bessborough Gardens, Pimlico, S.W. 3rd Nov., 1875 (? Dec). Messrs. John Tucker&amp; Co. Gentlemen,—Will you have the kindness to acknowledge our accept<lb></lb>ance of your draft for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and say if you can supply a more supe<lb></lb>rior class of teas in packet If you can, please reply by return of post, as we have inquiries for some; also for coffees. Yours faithfully, ho, McDonnell &amp; Co.") I replied to this, and on the 6th December received this letter from prisoner, which I believe to be in his handwriting. (<hi rend="italic">This acknowledged the receipt for acceptance, and contained an order for certain quantities of tea.</hi>) On the receipt of that letter I directed Mr. Ward to call upon the defendant with some labels—the order contained in this memorandum was executed by the Thursday mentioned—this is the original invoice, 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is the draft we forwarded for his acceptance, which he returned to us—I believe it is in his hand-writing, and it was accompanied by this letter.

The 20 1/2 lbs. are struck through in the invoice, but not by me or my partner—it went forward without that line being drawn through the last item, and the amount is represented by the bill of exchange—I saw the defendant some time before the 6th January at my office, 9, Mincing Lane, but nothing of importance transpired—we addressed all our documents to Messrs. McDonnell &amp; Co.—I did not know anything at all of <hi rend="italic">Macdonald</hi> &amp; Co.'s bakery and confec<lb></lb>tionery, Newhampton—on or about the 6th January defendant called at my</p>

                  </hi>. In the month of November last year, I was a traveller. to Mr. Tucker—on the 19th November, I called at 2a, Ponsonby Terrace, and received an order for teas——it is a private residence; not a shop—I was shown into what I suppose was the dining-room——I met the defendant at the door, and I said I had been recommended to call, and he said he could not give me an order that morning, or it would only be a small one, and I took his order for sis half chests of tea——he said nothing else at that time——he offered first-class references, which I submitted to my principal, and I believe they were not asked for——I believe the six half chests came to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>——I forwarded the order by post to my employei, Mr. Tucker?—I afterwards, at my principal's request, went to Bee prisoner again at 2a, Ponsonby Ter<lb></lb>race with a letter, when I received from him what I believe was an acceptance in an envelope—I saw him again, I believe, about the 7th December, and took two labels with me, and asked him if he would have the packets labelled with those labels, and if he would have them priced in pencil, so as to distinguish one from the other, and he said yes, they would do, and they could put their own labels on them afterwards, and they we're to be delivered not later than Thursday morning, as he had orders from the country for them——to the best of my belief, I can scarcely recollect the exact thing he said, they would be left on his hands if not delivered by Thursday morning—I then communicated with my employer, Mr. Tucker.</p>

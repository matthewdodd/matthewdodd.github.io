Two or three days previous to the 31st of January, the prisoner came and left his card, stating himself as a tailor, living at 32, Cumberland-street-road. I enquired, and found he did live there. He said he wanted a piano-forte for a most respectable lady, who had his first floor; he hired it at 16 s. a month, and referred me to Mr. J. Bunning, No. 14, Cumberland-street, and then left. I made enquiry, and was satisfied. We had no further conversation. I went to his house about the middle of the day on the 31st of January, I was to have a month in advance, and 2 s. for the carriage, which the man who took it brought back. I did not see him again till I saw him in custody. He called at my house, when I was out, and paid 3 s. more. On the 9th of February, I found my piano at Mr. Green's shop, in Newman-street, about three minutes walk from my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by PRENDERGAST. Q. You found his representation correct - A. Yes. It was worth twenty guineas; I would not sell it for less.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Stafford-street, Lisson Green, Paddington. On the 31st of January, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the private door of my house, and gave a double knock; I answered the door - he wished to know if I would take a piano-forte in pledge, and produced a card. After some hesitation, I agreed to go and look at it; I went to his house, No. 32, Cumberland-street, and examined the piano - I agreed to advance him 10 l. on it; it was brought to my house the same evening by two porters, and the prisoner with them. I gave him the money next morning. On the 8th of February it was redeemed by a person named Green, who paid the interest and principal.</p>

            . I am a furniture broker, and live in Newman's-passage, Newman-street. I redeemed the piano-forte on the 8th of February - I believe the one produced to be the same. I have known the prisoner a year and a half; he came to me on the 7th of February, and asked if I would buy a piano-forte - I refused, he said it was a very good one if I liked to buy it. I said if I can buy it worth the money I will. He said it belonged to a lodger on his first floor, and he wanted to sell it for her;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170071"></xptr>as she wanted some money to pay her rent. I told him to call the next morning at ten o'clock, and if I could I would look at it; he came next morning, and took me to Goodwin's, and just before we got there, he gave me the duplicate, and stood on the other side of the way while I went in; he said he would wait there. I looked at it, and redeemed it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he give you any reason why he would not go into the shop with you - A. He said if they would not let me have it he would go in himself - he said,</p>
               <p>"You take this ticket in, and I will meet you at the public-house;" he said he would not go in - I did not ask him why. I had no suspicion of him. I redeemed it for 10 l. and 2 s. 6 d., interest. The prisoner wanted 6 l. for the ticket, I said I would give him 5 l., which I did - I gave him part of it in the public-house, and part at home, where he gave me a receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not go nearer to the shop than the public-house - A. Yes. I looked at it, then went over, and told him what I would give him for the ticket. I redeemed it, and we both went home together - he asked what he should give me for it back again in a week's time. I said,</p>
               <p>"If you want it back, why do you sell it;" he said he thought he should want it again - I said I would rather have the money than the piano, for mine was a bad place for business, and he should have it back for the same money, and if he brought any one to buy it, and got 2 l. on it, I should expect something. It had not been in my shop two hours before Mr. Nutting's man claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You agreed to let him have it back at the end of a week or fortnight - A. Yes. He made no secret of it. While he was out of the way, his wife gave me the delivery note, which the prosecutor had sent with it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he get out of the way - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean when you said,</p>
               <p>"While he was out of the way" - A. He was not at home, and the officers said he was out of the way. His wife said he was afraid to come home, for fear of the officers.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 18th of April, I had been looking for him from the 9th of February. I waited at his house four hours before I could gain admission, and then found him laying on the roof, about ten minutes before eleven o'clock at night. It was at a house in Clerkenwell, which he had taken the day before the piano was pawned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a letter to say that a distress was to be put into my house for rent, and pawned the piano to pay my rent. I asked Green to advance me something on the ticket for a time, and shewed him the delivery note, and said I did not want to dispose of it altogether, or I should get into trouble. He looked at it, and said he would advance but 4 l. I said,</p>

            . On the 22d of December I and Wake were in a lane, leading from Colney Hatch to East Barnet - the prisoner was running out of a shed, and threw off a pair of wooden shoes, that he might run faster. About ten o'clock that morning I found in Mr. Rayfall's barn a great coat, a tablecloth, a pair of shoes, and a napkin, and gave them to the landlord of the King of Prussia, public-house - he gave them to Simmonds.</p>

            . On the night of the 21st of December, about twelve o'clock, I found the prisoner sleeping in Rayfall's barn, and on the beam of the rowing mow I found a pair of shoes and a dagger - he was covered over with the rowing; there are two large and a small door to the barn, and instead of coming out at the small door he escaped over the large one, which was open above; I returned with a light, and found his hat, and a handkerchief which Mr. Simmonds claimed. The prisoner had left my service a week or ten days before. I was with Langan next day, about two o'clock, and saw him in a shed, three miles off - I said,</p>
               <p>"There he is;" he immediately ran out, and I after him, for two miles, and then took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Bavin, a cow-keeper, at Staines. About half-past one o'clock, on the morning of the 28th of Sept., Buckle, a constable, called on me—he had a goose with him, which was mine—it was marked on the feet—I then went on the common—I had the geese on the common—I had seen this gander some time before—it might be a week—when I went on the common I missed this gander, belonging to the geese—I missed the one that was brought back by the police-constable—it was my husband's property.</p>

On the morning of the 28th of Sept., about seven o'clock, I saw both the prisoners together, coming into Staines—I went across the road to them—I saw Molineaux had something in his lap—I asked him what he had got—he said he had got a bag—I said I must see what he had got in it—I took it of him, and found in it a large gan<lb></lb>der, weighing upwards of 12 1/2 lbs.—it was quite warm, and bleeding at the neck—there was a piece of flag round the neck, as if it had been recently killed—Osraon said it had been lying about the common ill for three weeks, and that they had killed it—I took them into custody.</p>

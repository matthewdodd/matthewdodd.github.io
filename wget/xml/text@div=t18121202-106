            . I am a porter at Hoare's wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Briant's carts - A. Yes. There came a waggon that day with a load of loose hemp, between four and five in the afternoon. Mr. Briant's waggon came to our wharf with hemp. The prisoner was unloading hemp. I knew him us Briant's carman. He unloaded the hemp, and he called to us to unload the flax. We took the mats of flax as he set them out of the waggon. I afterwards went in the waggon, I found some hemp under the tarpaulin in the waggon. There was a bead of hemp under the tarpaulin, and some loose. I went and told Mr. Hoare. The prisoner backed the waggon out of the wharf, and when Mr. Hoare accused him of having stolen the hemp instead of delivering it on the wharf. The hemp was taken out of the waggon, and then Mr. Briant was sent for.</p>

            . I have the management of the wharf. Mr. Briant's waggon came to our wharf, and I thought it had delivered all the hemp that was in it. I heard Priest say there was some hemp under the tarpaulin. Clark came to the head of his horses. I asked Clark if he had delivered all the hemp he had. He said, yes. I then went to the gateway of the wharf, waiting for the waggon coming out, to see whether he would take the hemp away. My gate opens into Wapping-street. After he had backed into the street I desired him to go into the waggon, and turn his tarpaulin of one side. He went up reluctantly; he turned it of one side, and in the fore part of the waggon was this hemp concealed under the tarpaulin.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it have happened by accident - A. I certainly think not. The weight of the hemp was nineteen pounds, near a pound in value. He said he did not know that it was there. I told him to hand it down. I then sent for an officer, and his master came and gave him in charge. This is the hemp; it is part of the same load, I have no doubt. The hemp laid in the waggon in such a way I am sure it could not have come there by accident.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I knew nothing of the hemp being there at all.</p>

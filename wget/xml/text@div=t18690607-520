                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the Treasury on matters relating to coin—on 12th May I went to 6, Eltham Place, Stony, in consequence of information—the prisoners had then been taken in custody, and I had seen them at the station—their room is the first-floor back—the house consists of four rooms—I found Dickenson in possession of the room—I found a temporary bench fixed from the wainsooat to the window, upon which were a quantity of plaster of Paris articles, which appeared to been moulds, and a file on the window-ledge, with white metal in its teeth and some iron clamps to hold the metal when it is in a state of fusion—there were a quantity of metal dregs under the stage—Sergeant Bridge handed me these five <hi rend="italic">gets</hi>, which are the overflow of the metal when the mould is full—these ten bands are to form the moulds in—here is plaster adhering to them, and a little grease, which is to keep the plaster from sticking—this grainers' comb is used as a burnisher for the counterfait coin—this glass, covered with lamp-black, is to give the coin a dull circulating appearance—I also found this piece of wood with two nitches in it, to insert the coins in and hold them; here is metal in this ladle—I also found pliers, copper—wire, tissue-paper, and all the implements which I have on various occasions found in the possession of coiners—when we returned to the station this cylinder and jar were pissed on the inspector's deak, and King said, "You have got my machine there"—I said, "Yes, you will have to account for it"—he said, "All right; I had it for my own amusement; it is used for electro-plating"—this copper-wire has been dipped in cyanide of silver; it is coiled so as to hold a coin—I found this copper-sheet with hooks in the room—it hangs on a stove, and may have been used for drying plaster of Paris moulds—there was no food or furniture in the room—I have had thirty years experience—these fragments have formed a mould for making counterfeit coin.</p>

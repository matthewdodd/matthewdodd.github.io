               <p>Q. In consequence of information you received respecting the prisoner, did you go and see Burton - A. Yes, he is an officer; and what I afterwards did was in pursuance of his directions. On the 14th of December, I went to the George in West Smithfield, about one o'clock; my husband went with me; the prisoner was there; we entered into conversation together; my husband told him I was his wife, and if he had any to dispose of I would look at some as well as himself, my husband said, I could pass money as well as he could, the prisoner told us if we went to Whitechapel, he could get us what money we wanted. We then went to Dickson's public-house, in Essex-street. When we got there, the prisoner talked about Jacobs; he said he was going to Jacob for the money. He left us and went away; he returned, Jacobs followed him. The prisoner gave me ten counterfeit shillings; I gave him three shillings; he said they were good ones indeed, my husband's money was. After this Jacobs said he would give no money in that house. He proposed to go to the Rose and Crown, in Essex-street. We all went to the Rose and Crown, into the parlour. Jacobs came in; Jacobs put his hand into his right fob, and took out a great many counterfeit shillings. He said he would not give any body counterfeit money but the prisoner. He said if my husband was a trap or, an officer, he did not care for him, he could have but a twelvemonth; he would save the money for buttons for his coat. Jacobs went out the prisoner followed him, and immediately the prisoner returned in and gave my husband eleven shillings; my husband gave him three shillings in value; the prisoner said he had, used my husband well. He gave him eleven shillings; he had given me but ten; I was to go down the following morning to get some eighteen-penny pieces and three-shilling tokens; I was to have them on the 15th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did your husband give him for the eleven shilling - A. A three shilling piece; I know it was three shillings in value; we came away, we had been in the public-house about two hours together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She swore at the office, that her husband paid me three shillings, now she says a three-shilling piece; now she says she purchased on the 14th, at the office she said on the 15th.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you the first conversation with him - A. On the 13th of December; we met at the George public-house, West-street, Smithfield; we met afterwards at the Rose and Crown, Essex-street; Whitechapel; we met on the next day, the 14th, in West-street, at the George again; we went from there to the Rose and Crown again, the prisoner was present, and Payne, and Tahoy, and a many more of these people at the Rose and Crown.</p>
               <p>Q. You went from Smithfield to Whitechapel - A. Yes; we went into the back parlour; the prisoner asked me what I should like to have; I said tokens. He said, the tokens were not ready, if I liked to have a few shillings, I might; accordingly he produced ten shillings, he counted over, and found them eleven; he counted them over again; he gave me eleven shillings. I gave him three single shillings for them.</p>

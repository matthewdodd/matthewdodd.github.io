About ten minutes after that he put the tankard to the landlord to drink; then he wanted us to drink, we refused; but by importuning my friend he drank, and he asking me several times, I drank once; I never went out of the room; but our pint of beer was not out before the tankard was out; the prisoner took it, and said, me will go out and me will have fresh and fresh, and went out with the tankard; when he had been gone five or six minutes, I said, where is the captain? (the landlord had told us he was a captain) they said let us go out and see; we called the landlord in; I asked where the captain was, he said he did not know; I said the tankard was gone.

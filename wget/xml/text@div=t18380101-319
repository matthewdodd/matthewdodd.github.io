                  </hi>. I am a tea-dealer, and live at No. 18, Lawrence Pountney-hill. I know both the defendants—on the 20th of April, I called at the house of the defendant Boone, in Paradise-row, Chelsea—I think it was No. 64—I am in the habit of calling at houses for orders—I saw a person there who represented herself to be Mrs. Boone—I soli<lb></lb>cited an order—(the defendant Boone was not within at that time)—I have seen that woman since—she is called Ann White—she represented herself as Boone's wife—when I asked for the order, she said Mr. Boone had gone to our house to give me an order, but as I should not see him she would give me an order herself—I had called at the house once before, and left my address—the order she gave me amounted to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told her my manner of doing business was for ready money—she said if I had a mind she would give me part payment then—I said that was not the general way of doing business, the general way was to receive the money when we delivered the goods—I went away without any money—I sent my porter with the goods the next day (Friday)—he did not bring back any money, nor the goods—on the 1st of May, in consequence of what I heard, I went to Boone's house in Paradise-row, and found it</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live at Knightsbridge. On the 7th of April last, the defendant Boone came to my house, and wished to be supplied with grocery, and to have credit, but he was to pay for the first Parcel—he said he had taken a shop in Paradise-row, and was going to commence business—that he was a cabinet-maker, and had taken this shop for his wife—he gave me a reference to a person named Collier, No. 9, Fann-street—in consequence of his statement I let him have the goods—he was to pay for the first parcel on delivery, which was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801010012"></xptr>
               <p>only paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was understood, on the first parcel being paid for, and his reference proving satisfactory, that he was to be supplied with another parcel at one week's credit—I then went to the reference, No. 9, Fann-street, Goswell-street, and saw a little woman—she was not in widow's mourning—I asked for Mr. Collier—she said her husband was not at home, but would be at home at ten o'clock at night—that he was gone to Dept<lb></lb>ford—I then said Boone had referred me to her husband, and asked her if his statement was correct—(I afterwards saw that same woman at St. An<lb></lb>drew's-hill—she called herself Mrs. Collier there, the same as she did in Fann-street—she was keeping the house on St. Andrew's-hill—I asked for her husband—I expect Boone represented the Mr. Collier there, but I did not see him there myself—when I saw the little woman in Fann-street)—she said, "Boone has served his apprenticeship to my husband, and he now works journey work as a cabinet-maker for my husband; he has married a ser<lb></lb>vant-girl at Chelsea, with whom he has received about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he has get about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. property of his own, and intends to open this shop for his wife, and he will still carry on the cabinet-making business himself; he has now work at home for my husband, which, if he brings home on Saturday, he will be paid for"—all this corresponded with what Boone had told me him<lb></lb>self—in consequence of this I let the goods go—I saw Boone again on the 15th of April, and mentioned to him the conversation I had had with this woman in Fann-street, and told him I was satisfied—he had previously told me himself what Mrs. Collier had told me—he promised then faith<lb></lb>fully to pay me for the goods every week—when I told him I had not seen Mr. Collier, but Mrs. Collier, he said it was all quite correct, that I could see Mr. Collier at any time—I went again, but could not fee Mr. Collier—Boone was to pay me for the goods on the following Monday, when he would want more—I let him have four parcels, which, altogether, came to 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the balance of the first parcel before he had the second, and then he had four others, which came to 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he never paid any part of that—I went to Fann-street again twice in the week before I parted with more goods—I saw the same woman again, and she told me the same story both times, that her husband was not at home, but would be at home after ten o'clock at night—I repeated the first conversation I had with her to Boone—I did not repot the second—on the second Sunday after this I missed Boone from Paradise-row—I believe he had run away on the Monday morning on which he had promised to pay me—I received a letter, in consequence of which I went to the house on a Monday morning, in the last week of April I think—it was about three weeks after the first order—I found he had broken his name off the board—he had absconded, and the fixtures were taken away—there was no stock left behind—on the following Monday week I saw Quantock on Brook-hill, when I was in company with Mr. Bennett, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Fennell—we found they were at St. Andrews-hill after he ran away—I had been there myself, and seen the little woman there on Sunday the day before, I saw Quantock—I went into the shop with other parties who had been defrauded, and saw the woman—I said, "It is most extraordinary to find you here keeping a shop from Fann-street, after Boone has absconded from Paradise-row, and I verily believe you are all a set of swindlers together"—I asked her for her husband—there was a man in the parlour, who I said I would see, but he escaped by a side door and got away directly he heard the name of Collier mentioned</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801010013"></xptr>
               <p>he hung his head down—I said, "Collier is in the parlour, is he not?" she said, "No he is not," I said, "There is some man in the parlour, let me see him, perhaps that is Boone,"—he then crouched down and made his escape—next day I went with others and saw Quantock on Brook-hill—I was introduced to him by Mr. Fennell, who said, "Here is Mr. Collier," Quantock looked as all bad people do, ready to drop, and said, "My name is not Collier, my name is Quantock"—Mr. Fennell said, "Why you represented yourself to me as Mr. Collier yesterday, Mr. Quantock, why did you do so?"—he said, "I did answer to the name of Collier yesterday, but it was to suit my own purpose, you may take what ad<lb></lb>vantage you like of it"—Mr. Dimsdale was not present—Mr. Bennett, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Fennell, and myself were present—(Mr. Taylor it now very ill in bed)—I thought Quantock would have struck Mr. Fennell—I intimated that he must be connected with those swindlers in Paradise-row—I said, "Mr. Collier, I must have some conversation with you respect<lb></lb>ing that swindling transaction of Boone's"—he directly changed his countenance from a florid complexion to a pale white, and was ready to drop, and said, "My name is not Collier, it is Quantock."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, living in Gerard-street, Soho. On the 19th of April a woman representing herself as Boone's mother, called at my shop—I afterwards saw Boone, and he spoke to me on the subject of paying for what the woman had ordered—she ordered some goods of me—the first order came to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said they were to go to Pandise<lb></lb>row, Chelsea—I agreed to give her a week's credit—I told her the first parcel should be paid for on delivery, and after that I would give her a week's credit—she said she would, and the goods were sent—she came again and ordered goods to the amount of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had not been paid for the first order then—the second parcel was sent—I afterwards called at the house in Paradise-row, and saw Mrs. Boone and two or three others who I do not know—she gave me a third order—I rather objected, on account of its being such an immense sum—it amounted to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being more than I agreed to give her credit for—she had not paid for either of the former parcels then—she said she had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to receive at Somerset House, and was going to receive it on the Saturday—I did not send any more goods—the defendant Boone called on me after that and wished for another order—he asked for some gunpowder tea to make up an order he had from his friends—he said he was a cabinet-maker and had a great deal of goods to take home on the Saturday, and was about to receive money—I said in consequence of its being such an enormous amount and more than I had agreed to give them credit for, I objected to executing the order he gave me—he said he would call, on the honour of a man, and pay me on the Saturday for the goods Mrs. Boone had had—the credit expired on the 26th—on Monday the 28th I called at Boone's, and called several times in vain—I did not see him at all—I was at last pro<lb></lb>mised to be paid on the Saturday, but was not—the second parcel of goods was due on the Saturday—I was never paid for either.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the house, No. 9, Fann-street, In March last I let that house to a person calling himself "Thomas Collier"—it was not either of the defendants at the bar—I saw a man named Leather one night when Thomas Collier gave a reference to him and to Quantock, for a character—Quantock was living at Brook-hill, and Leather in Northamp<lb></lb>ton-street, Clerk en well—he stated that Leather was his father-in-law—I am quite sure Thomas Collier was neither of the defendants—I called on Quantock on Brook-hill, and told him Collier had applied to me—he gave Collier a very excellent character as a hard-working, industrious man, in a small cabinet line, more particularly in the looking-glass frame line, and he showed me one of his frames of a dressing-glass, and said that was one of his making—he did not say where Collier worked, or who he worked for—Collier told me previously, himself, that he supplied various shops in London, and mentioned one gentleman whom I knew, but I did not go to him—the other reference in Northampton-street, Clerkenwell, was equally satisfactory—Leather stated him to be a hard-working man, and that he had married his daughter—I have never seen Leather since—I then let Collier the house—during the time he occupied it I went there—there was a young man at work in the back shop—I did not see either of these defendants there—I afterwards received information that the parties were gone—I got no rent—I did not find the house in so good a state as when I let it—some of the fixtures were gone, and sashes from the windows—I after<lb></lb>wards went to Quantock to know if he could tell me where to find Collier—he could not tell me where to find him exactly—he said his friends were living at Reading, and I ultimately received the key with a letter in a brown paper parcel, one night at my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a paper-hanging-maker, and live in St. John's-street. A man calling himself Collier, who is not in custody, came to me, and ordered 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of paper-hanging—I told him I had me objection if he could refer me to a respectable tradesman, and he referred me to a person named Quantock—I went to Quantock, at Brook-hill, and asked him if he knew a man named Collier, of Northampton-street, Clerken<lb></lb>well—he said he did, he had known him from a child—I said I was referred to him by Collier, as I was about letting him have 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods for six or seven days—he said, "Sir, you need not hesitate one mo<lb></lb>ment, let him have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth; he is perfectly safe"—I then let Collier have the goods, and on passing the house in Northampton-street afterwards, I saw it was shut up—Collier had fetched the goods from my shop—I saw Quan<lb></lb>tock at Brook-hill, when I asked him whether he knew a man named Collier—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801010019"></xptr>
               <p>he said he did, perfectly well—I told him Collier lived in Northampton-street—I communicated to Quantock what Collier had stated to me—Quantock gave him a very high character—he did not give me a guarantee—I did not apply for any—in consequence of what Quantock stated I let Collier have the goods—I did not see Collier at my shop afterwards, but I saw Quantock and him pass my door intoxicated, but I should tell you when I found he had run away in the night, I went to Quantock's, and asked him whether he was aware of what had become of the man who he had given such a high character of—he said, "Yes, the rascal, I am looking for him, he has run away 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my debt"—and it was only a few days after that that I saw Quantock go by my shop with him, arm-in-arm, quite intoxicated—with the man he said he was looking for, who called himself Collier—I did not see Boone at all, till he was at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember Collier making his appearance at your shop with another person, and stating that the work most be finished? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was a second lot he wanted—instead of bringing the money on Saturday, as he promised, he brought a gentleman with him, they had a few words in the shop together, and that gentleman said he would not pay a halfpenny till the shop was finished.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What sort of a man is Collier? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very much like the defendant Boone, but it was not him—Collier applied to me early in April—I went once to the house, in Northampton-street, where he represented himself as living, to carry the patterns to be chosen, and I saw him there—I did not find out that he had moved from there to Fann-street—I did not take the trouble to trace him—the fact is, I have seen him once or twice since—I was not referred to anybody besides Quantock—I found Quantock's shop without any difficulty—Collier gave me a card of Quantock's—it appeared something like a broker's shop—I went into the shop—I did not make inquiry in the neighbourhood with regard to Quantock, before I took his word—when I found Collier was not in the way, and I could not find him, I went to Quantock—I could not see him the first day as he was not at home, but the next day I did—it was a few days after that I saw him and Collier arm-in-arm, both drunk—they passed my door in St. John-street—I told Quantock, when I went to him, that I lived in St. John-street—I went to Guildhall, but was not examined—Quantock was in the body of the Court, but was given into custody while I was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Bream's-buildings, Chan<lb></lb>cery-lane. A person who goes by the name of Leather applied to me to do some work for him, and brought the defendant Quantock with him—he said he could not pay ready money for it, but would pay it in a bill at three months—I said I never did business for strangers without I knew something of them, and could not do it unless somebody joined him in the amount—after some time he referred me to Clark of Kingsland-road, who signed an agreement to pay me the amount—about a fortnight after, I found that Clark had gone away from the place—I would not then proceed with the work, and Quantock said he would enter into a bill for £20, to be guarantee for Leather, which bill I have got—it has come to maturity, and a party came a few days before and wished to put it off, as he had a great many debts out—it has never been paid—I have not been paid any thing—Quantock came to my house one morning, and said he knew Leather could not pay the bill for a few days, bat that Leather hall a legacy left him, and it was to be paid on the 1st of January—he said he</p>

               <p>did not believe much what Leather said, but he went to an old sister of his, who was just on the verge of the grave, and he did not think she would tell a lie, and that she said the same—I renewed the bill on that representation—Quantock is still the guarantee—he gave his address on the bills omewhere about Brook-hill.</p>

I know the prisoner Boone—he came to me to take a house of mine, about three weeks before Midsummer-day, and referred me some where in the neighbourhood of St. John-street, or Goswell-street-road, to Wynyatt-street—I think my wife went after the reference—I do not know the name of the party he referred to—the house was occupied about six weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Cumberland-street, Chelsea. I went into the Admiral Keppel, Marlborough-road, yesterday fortnight—there was only one man there; I left the public house shortly afterwards with him, and he showed me a place to make water; he opened a gate for me, it was in the Brompton-road, six or seven yards from the Admiral Keppel—when I came out I was knocked down by the prisoner Lockyer; there were three others with him, Cogan was one of them—Lockyer then put his hand in my pocket, and then walked up the road; the others walked across the road—I never lost sight of Lockyer; I met a policeman, and gave him into custody—they took nothing from me, there was nothing in my pocket—I knew them well before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> driver, and live at Chelsea. On 11th Oct., I was at the Admiral Keppel, about a quarter past 11 o'clock at night, and saw Stott there; I went out to show him where to make water and opened the gate for him—he went in and came out again—I saw three men there; the prisoners are two of them, they knocked him down; Lockyer held him with one hand, and put the other in his right hand pocket when he was on the ground, but I did not see which knocked him down—I did not see whether they took anything from his pocket, but they all ran together towards College-street, on the same side of the road—I had not been drinking; I was perfectly sober—I had seen the prisoners before, but not to know them—I lodged in the same house as Cogan's mother kept some years ago.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoners' statements before the Magistrate were here read, as follow</hi>: Lockyer says; "I was standing at the corner of Keppel-street, about 11 o'clock—prosecutor came out of the Keppel, and was <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> with two girls; the man was never knocked down, he was never off his feet; the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> came out and asked who tore the prosecutor's coat, and put his hand in my face; they were both drunk. "Cogan says;" I was standing by the Keppel, about 11 o'clock, talking to a young woman—prosecutor came out; he was much in liquor; they all know him about the neighbourhood, and generally <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> with him; I saw one of them pull the tail of his coat; then be went and fetched the caiman; the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man wanted to fight Lockyer for tearing the prosecutor's coat, then sergeant and constable came up, and offered to charge me; I went to the station house.")</p>

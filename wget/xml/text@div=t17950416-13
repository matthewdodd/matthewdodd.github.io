             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live journeyman with Mr. Chandler, pawnbroker, in Holborn; the prisoner at the bar brought me the buckles on the 26th of February, I think it was about twelve o'clock; they were a pair of silver shoe buckles; he brought them to me and wanted a guinea? I told him I could not lend him a guinea, I would lend him fifteen shillings; he said it would do.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before? - I had known him about a twelvemonth, he has pledged several articles at our house, of wearing apparel, coats and waistcoats that I have seen him wear, I am certain of the man.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The buckles are mine for a certainty, I knew him about three months before he committed this transaction, he is a waiter I understand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These buckles I bought of a person whom Mr. Yeatman knows as well as I; the person came up to me one day as I was walking, and said, young man, will you buy a pair of silver buckles? I said I had nor money to purchase a pair of silver buckles, they would be too much money for me; he said I should have them for a guinea; I asked him if they were his own? he said they were his own, and I went in and asked that gentleman if he would lend me a guinea on them? and he lent me fifteen shillings; the person that I bought them of, was a waiter at the Paul's Head tavern, in Cateaton-street.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called on one of the Bow-street officers to give him a character.</p>
               <p>Officer. He has called on me to give him a character; I know he was a soldier and deserter, and his associations are very bad.</p>

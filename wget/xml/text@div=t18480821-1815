                  </hi>. On 12th August, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was in Blackhorse-lane, on this side of Whetstone, going home to my lodging—I had two bundles—I met three men—the prisoner is one—I had occasion to go to the ditch, and put my bundles down—the men <hi rend="italic">delayed</hi> opposite where I was—they were together—they shifted my bundle—I asked the prisoner about it—he struck me, and said, "How dare you accuse me with it"—I said, "I must look to my own"—as soon as I said that, the pri<lb></lb>soner caught hold of me and knocked me down twice—the other two ran away with the bundles, which contained a shirt, two handkerchiefs, and some meat—the prisoner remained beating me till I ran into my lodging, which was close by—I did not know either of the parties before.</p>

Hinds complained to me of being robbed—about half-past ten o'clock next morning I took the prisoner—he came up to me of his own accord, showed me his hand, and said, "This is what I got by being knocked down last night"—I sent for the prosecutor, who came and identified him.</p>

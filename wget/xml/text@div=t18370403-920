                  </hi>. I am a medical man, and h've in Sloane-squre, On Friday evening, the 24th of February, the male prisoner came to my house to engage me to attend his daughter Mary Ann, in her confinement, and said it might be that evening—on the following morning I was fetched at nine o'clock, and saw the three prisoners—the child was born lste on the Saturday night—there did not appear any linen, or any preparation for the child, and they made an excuse that she was confined earlier than was expected—in my judgment it was born in its natural time—I inquired who the father was—the grandmother told me he was away in the country, mi he was going to travel into Germany—she said she expected him that night or the next morning—I called again on Sunday, and asked if the father had arrived—the grandmother said he had been there and seen the infant, and he was gone out—I went there again next day, and the younger prisoner seemed to be doing well—she was crying very much, and seemed very much grieved about something—I noticed it, and the grandmother said she could not suckle the infant, and that a medical man in Ireland bid told her she must not, as she had a liver complaint—I said, it was all nonsense, she ought to suckle it—they then said the husband was going abroad, and she could not take it with her—on Wednesday, between three and four o'clock, I went again and saw all the defendants—I asked to see the infant—the grandmother told me it was gone to Wandsworth, to an old servant of theirs—I questioned them, and said I was going to Wandsworth, and if they would give me the name of the nurse and the place, I would call and see it—the grandmother said they did not know the name of tie person, nor the place, as it was a large place—I still pressed to see the child, and they promised it should be brought to my house in two days—I went again on Thursday, the 2nd of March, and repeated my desire an determination to see the child—the male prisoner was not at home then—the grandmother said repeatedly, in the presence of the daughter, that should be brought to me—I called again on Friday, and saw the mother</p>

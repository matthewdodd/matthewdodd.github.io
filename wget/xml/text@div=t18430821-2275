On the 8th or 9th of March, the prisoner came to me, and brought a bill—I believe it was the 9th of March—he brought this bill with him, and stated that he wished it to be discounted—he said it was the bill of Henry Bush, of Bristol, a most re<lb></lb>spectable merchant in that city—he mentioned Baldwin-street, or some such street—he said one of the partners was in the town-council of Bristol—I then asked him who had recommended him to me—he said his solicitors, Ford and Savage, of Henrietta-street, Covent-garden, who are persons I know very well—I asked him to leave me the bill, to make inquiry—he said, "I will tell you something, Mr. Samuel; if you like, I will take a cab, and ac<lb></lb>company you to Ford and Savage, to satisfy you what I have said is right"—this I think was between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning—I went with him up to Henrietta-street—we both went in—the clerks said neither of the partners was there—the prisoner said, "It is rather unfortunate; I want the money, as I have bought a lot of cabinets; will it do if I bring you a letter from Ford and Savage, to save you the trouble of calling again"—I said, "Yes, perfectly so," and we parted—he took the bill with him—in the afternoon I received this letter and bill from Ellis, my clerk—the prisoner came next day, and asked me if I had read the letter—I had the letter and bill in my hand—I said my clerk had read it to me, as I could not read English—I asked him why Mr. Ford's name was not to the letter—he said Mr. Ford was not at home, and he thought one of the partners would do—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>—"9th March, 1843.

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Samuel. I remember on the 9th of March seeing the prisoner at my master's, or the day before, I am not certain which—I was there the first day he applied about the bill—he gave me this letter some few days after his first calling—I had a talk with him the first time he came to our place, and he called on two or three occasions before he brought the bill—he saw me some days before he saw Mr. Samuel, and he produced the bill to me—he was an entire stranger to me till then—he said Henry Bush and Co., were respectable merchants, of Marsh-street, or Baldwin-street, Bristol—when he brought me the letter he told me he brought it from Mr. Savage, of Henrietta-street, Covent-garden—there are such names as Ford and Savage, attornies, in Henrietta-street—he said they were solicitors to him, Mr. Savage was his solicitor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you made inquiry, between first seeing the bill and getting the letter from him, as to who Henry Bush and Co., of Bristol, were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had done so, by order of Mr. Samuel to make inquiry respecting them—I heard they were respectable merchants—the prisoner brought the letter some few days after I had first seen him, and after he had had an interview with Mr. Samuel—he brought it a day or two after he went in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with Mr. Samuel—prior to the letter being brought, I told the prisoner the information I had got was, that Bush's was a very respectable firm, and Mr. Bush was one of the respectable town-councillors of Bristol, and he said those were the parties who had accepted the bill—when he brought the bill he said he was residing at No. 25, Hyde-street, Bloomsbury; that he had got a large cabinet factory, and it was for cabinet orders he had got that bill—I drew the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., check myself, and gave him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was you mentioned that Mr. Bush was a member of the town council of Bristol; that was the result of inquiry you made on the Subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did so—I inquired in London of parties who formerly lived at Bristol. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had not you communicated the name of this person, and the nature of the bill, at least twelve days before it was cashed, to Mr. Samuel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—the time I communicated about the inquiries I had made was when the prisoner and Mr. Samuel were present—it was not ten days before, that I was desired to inquire—I should think two or three days before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Stoat's-hill, near Bristol, sometimes—it is four miles from the town of Bristol. I know the prisoner—I have had dealings with him—I have carried on business at Bristol, in the corn trade—at that time it was in the name of Henry Bush—since then a relation has joined me in carrying on business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by "at that time?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some years ago—in Feb. last I was carrying on business in the name of Henry Bush and Co.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this bill, and tell us who is the drawer of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am the drawer of that bill—I have frequently drawn bills before—I rather think I drew more bills than this, in February.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where have you been in the habit of paying bills, have you made them payable in London? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at Robarts's one was paid—I know Prescott and Grote's—I believe I have not paid any money in to Grote's and Prescott to meet bills—the words "payable at Grote and Company, &amp;c." on this bill is my hand-writing—the whole bill is my writ<lb></lb>ing—I know there is such a firm as Bailey, bankers, at Bristol—it is called the Bristol Old Bank—I have not paid money through the Bristol Old Bank to take up bills in London, very lately—I sent this bill up to the prisoner—I have known him about two years—I expect he knew of my carrying on business there as a corn-merchant—I am a general dealer at present—this (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) is the letter that I sent the bill up with—I have seen the pri<lb></lb>soner in London—my acquaintance with him has been more in London than Bristol—I dare say he had the opportunity of knowing there are other firms of my name in Bristol—I cannot say I have not seen him at Bristol—when I sent the bill up to him I sent no communication with it, except that letter—I had had goods from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the bill in payment of goods, or was it to be discounted for your ac<lb></lb>commodation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had had part goods for it, before I sent the bill, to the amount of, it may be more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe it was—I am not related to the other Bush's.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are in the corn trade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been—I am a general dealer at present—I have no warehouse—I buy and sell—I have no shop or counting-house—I do not keep an account at any banker's—I have had dealings with a good many people in the general line, besides the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell us some; take care, and tell the truth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe that has nothing to do with the present question—I have come to prove my hand<lb></lb>writing—I do not recollect—what goods I had for the bill has nothing to do with the present question—am I to answer the question, my Lord?</p>
               <p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods you had? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had some bacon—I do not know from whom it came—I sold the bacon—I cannot answer to whom exactly, at present—the transaction was in Feb.—I cannot say the exact quantity of bacon I had—by what hands I got it, I be<lb></lb>lieve, has nothing to do with the present question—it was sent to me in the usual way, in carts or wagons, I suppose—it was delivered to me at different places—I cannot recollect one—nor the name of any person I sold any of it to—I do not recollect—I keep a memorandum-book sometimes—I did not enter the bacon in the book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where had you the bacon? tell the Jury any spot where you will pledge your oath that you was in possession of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect—there was an invoice, I believe—I had no invoice—the prisoner lodged in Hackney-road when I knew him—I believe he has lodged in other places—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184308210076"></xptr>
               <p>have seen him in Ormond-street—I never saw him in Whitecross-street prison or the Fleet—I saw him in the King's Bench—I do not know how long ago—I suppose he has been out seven or eight months—I cannot exactly say how long he was out before I sent the bill up to him—the bacon was sent to me—I was charged for it—I was in London when I bought it—I can<lb></lb>not say exactly where the agreement was made—I met the prisoner in the street, and made an arrangement about the goods—no mention of bacon had been made before, that I know of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Be cautious how you answer my question; did you ever allege or re<lb></lb>present, either in writing or by word of mouth, that you lived in Bell-yard, Fleet-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever (<hi rend="italic">handing him a paper</hi>) by word of mouth direct a sham invoice to be sent to you from London? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—this letter is my writing—I have been many times at No. 11, Bell-yard, Fleet-street—I never lived there—a person named Hawker lived there—he is a tailor—I do not lodge there when in town.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now you have read the whole of the letter, how came you to address this letter from No. 11, Bell-yard, Fleet-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I wished a letter to be sent to me there in return—I addressed the letter to Mr. Lorymer, who is a corn-dealer and starch-manufacturer—it is dated the 23rd of Feb.—I was then in the general way—I cannot recollect what business I did in Feb. or March, April, May, or June—I have not been almost shoeless and without 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the last month—I have been living by what I could get—I have earned my living—I have not been turned out of Stoat's-hill—I have not slept there for some years—I was never turned out and beaten for coming there—I have been discharged under the Insolvent Act, and been a bankrupt, a good many years ago—I was in gaol for two years, about nine years ago—that was not for defrauding the Excise, but on the Insolvent Act—I have been in prison for defrauding the Excise, but not for many years—it was not for two years—it was for two months—I was about getting a gentleman to join me in business in the grain line—it was my brother—he is at Malta—he went there six or eight months ago—I wished Mr. Lorymer to send to the Post-office, and receive any letter for me that was addressed to Henry Bush and Co.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this, is this the letter you wished him to receive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This is an invoice—I expected some letter—this is the invoice of the bacon—I believe this letter is the prisoner's writing—Mr. Lorymer sent me a letter back—he refused to return any letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You state here that you shall have some communication with the south of Ireland, what communication did you expect from the south of Ireland, from a gentleman at Malta? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I expected something in the grain-trade, perhaps wheat or barley—I was living at No. 42, New Compton-street, on the 23rd of Feb.—my landlord's name was Bailey—I always sleep there—I pay 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a night.</p>

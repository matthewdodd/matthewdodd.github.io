                  </hi>. I am barman at the "Duke of York" tavern, York Road, Lambeth—on the 11th of September, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in—I have known her four years, but I have been in my present situation two years, and during that time I have not lived with her, as I slept at my situation, but I have visited her—we had had words on this day, as for three or four weeks I had not visited her at all—I have provided her with money—there was a report that I was going to get married, and she was jealous—I did not pay any attention to what she said, as I was attending to my business—I was rather off-handed with her—she had something to drink, and stayed about a quarter of an hour, but no conversation passed between us—after she had drank it she threw something, which I believe was vitriol, over me—it went on my back, and burned my waistcoat, and some went on my neck, but that was very slight—this rag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in the bar, and this is part of the prisoner's dress—they are both burned—I did not see a bottle in her hand—I saw it at the station—I had turned my back on her when this took place.</p>

You had better go out, or I will kick you out"—you threw the bottle at me first, and then the contents of a cup.</p>

                  </hi> (L 88). I met the prisoner, and asked her what was the matter—she pointed to the prosecutor, and said, "Oh! that man "—the prosecutor was going away in his shirt sleeves—I do not believe he had seen me—I said, "Tell me what is the matter"—she said, "You had</p>

               <p>better ask that man"—he returned, and gave her in custody for throwing vitriol over him—she said, "I did, and I will do it again"—the prosecutor's waistcoat was burnt into holes, and there was a small mark at the back of his neck—the burning of his waistcoat was recent, and I could smell what appeared to be vitriol—there was a sulphurous smell—I got these rags from the female searcher—on the way to the station the prisoner said, "I have kept him for five years on my prostitution, previous to his going to his situation, and he has now turned his back on me, and I will serve him the same"—I produce the cup—it has the same sulphurous smell—this newspaper is also burned, and this apron too.</p>

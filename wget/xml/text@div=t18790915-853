                  </hi>. I own property on the Grove Estate, Leytonstone—there are some carcases of houses there not yet finished—on 16th January, 1869, I entered into this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with Sambell, and from time to time advanced him money for the completion of the premises on the certificate of Mr. Hunt, my surveyor—I could not get the work done as provided in the agreement, and on 25th June I went to the premises with Mr. Hunt, and saw Sambell there—he wanted me to make him advances before he had done the work, as he could not go any further, and I refused to do so—I had previously advanced him mow than 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did on another day advance 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay his men's Wages, and subsequently put Mr. Pratt into possession for me, and the building material then there is the property charged in this indictment—I gave no letter or authority to Sambell or Simmons to remove it.</p>

I had a previous lease with Mr. Crab<lb></lb>tree and advanced him 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he got into difficulties and I cancelled the agreement with his consent and bought him out, granted a fresh lease of part of the ground to Sambell, the money to be advanced according to the surveyor's certificate, and I advanced money on the surveyor's certificate from time to time—Sambell was introduced by a client of mine as willing to go on finishing the houses if I would grant him a building agreement, which 1 did—I have lent money on the building materials—I did know Sambell had other property close by at Leytonstone, and he did not tell me that for that reason he would not have a clause put in the agreement that the building materials were to be included—no one represented him as solicitor—I was the only solicitor in the matter, and I drew up the building agreement—I did not know that materials had been removed by him before them—I ad<lb></lb>vanced money on them and they became mine under the agreement—he did not give me notice that he was going to remove them—I did not know that he had said they were his and he should remove them.</p>

I have had no notice from Sambell—I said at the police-court "Mr. Sambell intimated on the 13th July he should remove my goods; I told him if he attempted to remove my goods I should give him into custody"—he did not tell me he should remove them—I think "intimated "would be wrong; he "inferred."</p>

                  </hi>. I am engaged on the Grove Estate—I received instruc<lb></lb>tions from Mr. Marsden to take charge of the building materials left on the premises after Mr. Sambell had left off building there—on 31st July, between 11 and 12, Sambell and Simmons came with a covered van and a timber trolly—I said, "What are you doing?"—they made no answer but went on loading—I said, "Do you know you are doing a wrong thing here by attempting to take these things off the ground?"—Sambell said, "That's all right"—I said, "Well, you had better not take them off the place—you had better leave them there"—he said, "That's all right; what authority have you in the matter?"—I said, "I will fetch you my authority," and I fetched the letter I had received from Mr. Marsden, and read it over to him—the purport of it was that I was to see that nothing was removed from the place—he made no answer—when they had loaded the van he ordered the carman to move on, and I placed myself in front of the horse and said, "If you move these things off the ground I shall use physical force;" with that the police came forward and said, "I perceive there is a breach' of the peace likely to occur here, and you had better go down to the station, all of you"—I said, "I shall not go to the station unless some one is here to see that the goods are not removed," and they left a man in charge of the goods—at the station Sambell represented that they were his goods, and pro<lb></lb>duced invoices—I said, "They are not receipted, and are of no effect whatever"—he said, "What is that to do with you?" and he stated that he had a letter from Mr. Marsden to purchase the goods—I said, "Produce it; it will stop all further bother," but he did not—the police then told me that they would not take the charge, but that I could follow the goods—I said, "Will you take his address down?" and they did so, and I copied it out; and Sambell gave me his private address and said he was going to take the goods to "Sambell, Varna Terrace, Blackheath Road, North Greenwich, near the police station"—I came back with Sambell and another man with him, and I engaged Dockerty to follow the goods; and I saw the goods going towards Blackheath—I went to the carrier's to make inquiries, and whilst there the scaffolding poles came into the yard and the other van also—Sambell was not there, but Simmons came in while this was going on—Simmons was on the ground at the building, but did not go to the police-station—when Dockerty came back I went to Satchel Street, Bethnal Green, on Saturday morning, and the people refused to admit me, but said that they had got the goods.</p>

                  </hi>. On 31st July the two vans came to the Grove Estate, and I received instructions to follow them; and I did so—they first pulled up at the Cowley Arms on the way to London, and thence to the Thatched House—the prisoners went on by themselves in a ginger beer van—they pulled up again at a public-house near Bow Church, and Simmons came in about half an hour after, and said to the carman, "You are here, my lads; have what you like to drink, have a pot of beer; I shall not go</p>

               <p>for an hour or two yet;" and on getting outside, within two or three minutes, he walked off with the horses—when I saw the van move and Simmons going away with it I asked the carman if he was aware the horse was going on, but he did not seem to take any notice—I then went out to look after the van—Simmons went on walking till he got under the railway arch, and then he took the horse's nose-bag off—I saw Sambell under the arch—he said, "Where the deuce is the fellow gone?' and I wad, "Here he is, and I intend following you"—he made a bit of a trot and I followed—afterwards he saw I was behind and said "Hallo?"—I said, "You thought of doing me, but here I am"—he said,' "Well, you may as well jump up; I only did it for a lark;" and I got up, and when we got to Bethnal Green Road, Simmons employed a man to look after the van;-and Sambell came up about half an hour after and asked where Mr. Simmons was—I said he had gone away for some time, and I stood outside the van till he returned; and they went up to another house—Sambell said, "What do you want to follow the van for?"—I said, "I believe it's my place"—he said, "You have no call to; if you like to lose the van I will give you half-a-sovereign"—I said, "Not for 40 half-sovereigns"—I went up several turnings at Bethnal Green Road, and sent a boy for a policeman, and two policemen came—I charged the prisoners with having unlawful possession of the goods—the police took them to the Bethnal Green Station, and the charge was stated—Sambell answered 'that he was very sorry his horse could not get farther that night; but he would 'travel on the road the following morning, between six and seven, sad that he wanted to go to Blackheath—the police would not take him—the goods were left unloaded at the place, and I went back and told my master.</p>

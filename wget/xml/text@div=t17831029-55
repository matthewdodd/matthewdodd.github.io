On the 19th instant, a quantity of lead was cut off the top of the house, and carried away. The next morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw two men looking about the fields, as if they had lost something. They had taken two lead stealers the night before, and one of them had impeached Clarke. I ordered the men to be brought, and soon after found I had lost some lead, which was found in the field, and compared by my servant: it was my property.</p>

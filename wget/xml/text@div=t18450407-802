                  </hi>. I am a Thames police-inspector. On the 11th of March, about two o'cloek in the morning, I saw two persons in a boat at the foot of these stairs, close to the coal-barge—I perceived something thrown into the river near that spot, and the two parties escaped to the shore—I afterwards found in the boat which had been occupied by the two persons, part of a copper funnel, which is claimed as belonging to the <hi rend="italic">Pearl</hi>—I showed it to the master, and he identified it next morning—part of the funnel Marsden picked up out of the mud fitted that in the boat.</p>

I said, "Collins and Warren," and I they rowed after them directly—they both got ashore, and got away that night—I saw the boat they were in—it was the same boat the funnel was found in, called the <hi rend="italic">Self Defence</hi>—it belonged to an apple-boy.</p>

I went down at six o'clock in the morning, and waited till the tide left the shore, and I found the copper funnels lying of the top of the mud—just as I had got them all into the boat, the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Antioch</hi> came ashore, and said, "You have got my funnel there; I know it by its being painted green"—as I I was going away from there I saw the prisoner standing at the stairs, looking towards the spot where I was getting the funnels—I went round on the tunnel-pier, and when I got round to the stairs he had escaped—I cannot say whether he hid himself from me; but I hid myself for a time, and then found him again close by the coal-barge—I went to him, and asked if his name was Collins—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Then I want you to go with me to the office"—I took him into the boat, and as soon as he saw the funnels in the boat he said, "Oh, I know nothing about these funnels."</p>

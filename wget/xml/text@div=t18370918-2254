                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of information I received from Williams on the 8th of September, I watched a house in the Maze, at South walk, from half-past nine o'clock till about half-past eleven at night, when I saw two men come out—we let them pass us, and a third person came out, which was M'Kew—we took him into custody, and went into the house, and found this property in a room there—the other two men did not answer the description we had received of the men—Flood was one of those two.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a steam-boiler-maker, and live in Queen street, King-street, Borough. On the 8th of September, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw two men and a woman come from under an arch of London-bridge—M'Kew was one of them—he had a parcel on his shoulder—I followed them down to the church, in Tooley-street, and lost sight of them by the side of the rail-road—I gave information to the officer—the paper round the parcel was torn, and I could see by the gaslight that it was bed-ticking—I cannot speak to Flood—he wore a cap similar to the other man, but I thought the man was shorter than him. <hi rend="smallCaps">SUSANNAH MULHEEN</hi>. One Catherine Flood lodged with me in the Maze. On the 8th of September, about ten o'clock, the prisoners came to the house—the woman was out at the time—when she came in she saw bundle when she went up stairs, and she said to the prisoners, "Who brought it here? it will do none of us any good, take it out, or I will throw it into the cart-road"—M*Kew had brought it in—I did not hear them make her any answer.</p>

            . I am one of the marshalmen of the City of London. I met the prisoner on the 30th of March, in the evening on Holborn-hill, this side of Field-lane; he had these wrappers on his shoulder, and seeing him go towards Field-lane I thought all was not right. I asked him where he got these wrappers, and where he worked. He said he worked for Mr. Stapp, the wrappers were is own property, they were perquisites. I told him I knew his master well, I would give him the trouble to walk back. I took the prisoner to Mr. Stapp's shop, and one of the clerks said they were no such thing as perquisites. The prisoner told a gentleman in my hearing where he lived, I think his apartment is in Cow-cross. I went to his apartment and found this cheese in a butter-flat, it weighs about eight pounds. One of Mr. Stapp's shopman asked him if he could account for that. He said he bought it of a young man in the street. I asked him if he should know the young man again. He said he did not think he should.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger on Snow-hill; the prisoner was my weekly porter; I think he had been so for near twelve months. The wrappers are all mine, they are not perquisites belonging to my porters. I had a good character with the prisoner, he has a wife and one child.</p>
               <p>ROBERT LEYIT. I am a servant to the prosecutor. I know the cheese by the figure 2 in the middle, it is a dairy mark. I have no doubt it is Mr. Stapp's cheese.</p>

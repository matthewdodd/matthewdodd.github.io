               <p>Mr. Furness. I am the father of the child. On the 17th of July I found my child dead about six in the evening, and was informed that it died about five o' clock; he had a bruise upon his head by the wheel, from which the brains came out up on his waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the consequence of that?</p>
               <p>Reith. It killed the child.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the Prisoner drive his cart?</p>
               <p>Reith. Very slow.</p>

               <p>Reith. I believe he was upon the shafts of his cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the child cry out?</p>
               <p>Reith. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the Prisoner saw it?</p>
               <p>Reith. I believe he did not see it.</p>
               <p>Furness, (the child's father) I really do think the Prisoner did not see the child, for if he had, I believe he would not have done it; I will speak so much in favour of the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was driving an empty cart with one horse, I had the misfortune to be lame at that time, and was riding upon the shafts of the cart. I am very sorry for what has happened.</p>

               <p>The Court reprimanded him for riding upon the shafts of his cart, and hoped it would be a warning to him for the future.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BISHOP sworn. - On the 6th of January, I was driving Mr. Millwood, and two ladies, in a post-chaise; I saw two men riding immoderately fast towards me, with black crapes over their faces, one was a stout man, the other thinner, much of a height, apparently to me as they were on horseback; when they came up to me, the thinnest said, pull up, young man, I was going at the rate of seven miles an hour, and could not pull up so soon as they wished; the thinnest presented a short pistol to me, turned it to a different direction and discharged it; he turned it away from doing any mischief to the company or myself, or the horses, or the chaise; after that, the thinnest rode up to the off-side of the chaise, and said, your money, your money; the gentleman made answer, and said, I have thrown my purse out of the window, in the road, that was the right-side; the thinnest alighted and looked for the purse, and not finding it readily, he got warm in his temper; I looked round, and saw the purse at the toe of his right-foot, I pointed it out to him; he put his finger and thumb to the crape, listed it up, and took up the purse, and mounted his horse, and said, farewell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the other man all the time? - A. Close by the side of me, he said, where is it, where is it, meaning the purse.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you take any notice of the men or the horses? - A. I inspected minutely into the stoutest of the men, and imagined, if I saw him again, I should know him; the prisoner at the bar does not appear to be the man that stood at the side of me.</p>
               <p>Q. What horse was the man on that stood next to you? - A. A dark chesnut horse; the thinnest was mounted on a bright bay horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take much notice of the thinnest, who came up to the chaise? - A. I saw no part of his face or flesh; I cannot take upon me to know him if I saw him.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you able to say, whether the bags that were taken from the prisoner, were the same that you found behind the chest? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This man is not a commodore yet? - A. He is acting commodore, though he does not receive the pay, he does duty.</p>
               <p>Q. For the good natured purpose, trying whether your messmates would commit a felony or not, you put them back into that place? - A.I was ordered so to do.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, before he would be suffered to go out at the gate, he would have been pretty closely rubbed down? - A. He would have been rubbed down.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner has, himself, been the means of detecting persons who have been committing those fort of depredations? - A. Yes, it was his duty so to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know that the nutmegs in that warehouse, belonged to the merchants who had purchased them, and not to the India-Company? - A. The nutmegs were in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do I understand you rightly, that he had denied having any thing? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. When they are sold in the sales, do they not remain afterwards under the care of the Company?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180009170062"></xptr>WILLIAM STINTON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an assistant elder in the India Company's warehouses; I took the prisoner to the watch-house belonging to the warehouses; I said to him, Tom, I am very sorry for you, I thought I could have trusted you, but you have got something in your pocket that you should not have; he immediately replied to me, I have not; after which, he seemed to wish to speak to me out of the watch-house: I told him, no, Tom, I must not do that, I must see what you have got about you; I said, come, it does not signify talking, you have got them; upon that I put my hand into his pocket, and pulled a bag of nutmegs out of each pocket; he was taken before the Lord-Mayor and committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there such nutmegs in the warehouses at the time? - A. We had such. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have been a long time in this warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And so has the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; he is a man that I always thought a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he has been the means of detecting some persons who have been committing depredations? - A. One person he has.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Stinton, the elder, told me, if I found any thing concealed, to let him know, and I should be promoted in the warehouse, and as he was not much liked in the warehouse for fear of a trap being laid for him, three years ago, I stopped a man with nutmegs, and it was dropped; I could not walk the streets safely after it, I was so ill used, and that was the reason why I took them to him in that private manner; I have been thirteen years in the warehouse.</p>

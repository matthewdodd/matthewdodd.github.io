                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, and live in Bryanston-street, Portman-square. On the 3rd of May, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I was walking up Holborn-hill, and felt my coat-pocket move—I turned round, and saw the prisoner close behind me—he ran down the hill, and missing my handkerchief, I ran after him, calling "Stop thief"—as I came up to him I picked up my handkerchief close behind him, in the middle of the road—I had not been in that spot myself before—there was nobody near me but the prisoner—he was four or five yards from me when I turned round—he ran as soon as he saw my motions—this is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. There were four or five men behind the gentleman—I saw one of them drop something—I took it up, the gentleman called "Stop thief," and I threw it down again. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. There was nobody near me besides him—it happened about Hatton-garden, and he ran to the bottom of the hill, about 100 yards—the handkerchief was close by him when he was stopped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to William John Clements, a hair<lb></lb>dresser, at Lewisham, about 150 yards from Mr. Dubois. On the 26th of December, about half-past eight or near nine o'clock at night, I came down stairs, and caught the prisoner at the sash of my master's window with one hand up to his right hand pocket, and the other hand in the window up to the elbow—I asked him what he wanted—he said, nothing, but held his head down, walked to the door, and ran—I ran after him, calling "Stop thief"—he got away—I missed about half an ounce of tobacco out of a jar, and some cigars from the window, also a pair of scissors and some razors—I found some cigars on the floor—I had seen the scissors at two o'clock that afternoon—the prisoner was in a situation to have taken the things—he did not ask to buy any thing, but ran out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not go into his shop at all—it was said that a person in a flannel jacket took the cigars—Mr. Dubois knows I was in his house all the evening. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I swear it was him—I am not mistaken—he ran over Lewisham-bridge, in a contrary direction to Dubois—he had a flannel jacket on like he has now—I knew him before by sight, but not by name—I am sure it was not Bevinstock—I am positive the prisoner is the lad.</p>

                  </hi>. My beer-shop is about 200 yards from Clement's shop—the prisoner was at my house on the evening of the 26th—I cannot say whether he went out in the course of the evening—he came between six and seven o'clock, and he was there when I shut up at a quarter to eleven o'clock—nobody could go out without passing my bar, but I should not notice a person going out—there were eighteen or twenty in the house—if he had gone out, I should not have missed him—if a person ran over Lewisham-bridge, he could not get to my house, without return<lb></lb>ing over the bridge again, without he went some miles round—I did not notice what jacket the prisoner had on—he has brothers very much like him in appearance.</p>

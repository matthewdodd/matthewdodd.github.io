I marked seven shillings and twenty-one sixpences, on the 29th of July, and put them into a till by themselves, at half-past ten o'clock at night; I locked it - the next morning, about three, I found only five shillings and nineteen sixpences - the till was locked, and a person to have got to it must have crossed a passage, and a sitting-room, and unlocked the passage door, which was locked the night before, and was still locked - the prisoners had lodged in the house about eight weeks - this sixpence was tendered to me by the woman on the 31st of July, and the shilling on the 1st of August - I knew them to be two of those which I had marked on the 29th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are you quite sure of the number you put in? A. Yes - the woman dealt with me for bread, but I had not changed any money for her before - I changed half-a-crown afterwards, but whether it was on the Monday or Tuesday I cannot tell - I did not take her into custody when she tendered me the marked money - I did not know I could till I had sent for the officer - no one served in the shop but myself.</p>

            . I received this sixpence and shilling from the prosecutor, on Monday, the 1st of August. I went to search the prisoners' apartments on Wednesday, the 3 d. I found two keys, wrapped up in a child's frock, between the bed and the sacking - the small key opens the till, and the large one opens the passage door at the foot of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you searched the place before you found them? A. Yes, at seven o'clock in the morning - the man was then in bed on the floor. I searched the clothes, and the sacking of the bedstead; but the keys were not there then.</p>
               <p>JURY to ELISHA BROWNJOHN. Q. Has your journeyman any access to the shop? A. No, he did not lodge in the house. My bake-house communicates with the passage, and there is no way of getting to the shop but by the passage, or the street door.</p>

            . I searched every place in the room the first time. I went down while the woman was being searched by a female, and I think the keys must have been placed then on the sacking.</p>

               <p>Had they any arms? - I saw a little bit of a stick, nothing else, they never offered to hit me nor nothing, nor never swore at me, nor nothing at all, my man was a little before me, his name is Charles Jordan, he drove my team.</p>
               <p>Could your man see when you was robbed? - I only said to the man when they came, halloo, what is the matter now, and he heard me.</p>

               <p>I know nothing further than when my master halloos out I goes behind, and I swore an oath, and I says, gentlemen what are you at, and the prisoner Roberts stepped off and said, if you make any more noise, I will cut you down directly.</p>
               <p>Did you see him take any thing from your master? - No, Sir, he kept me off, I am sure Roberts was the man that stood over me, and I do not know any thing of either of the other prisoners.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was the man over you! - The space of two minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him long enough to know him again? - Yes, when he stood over me, the same as I may look you in the face.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Roberts. My Lord, this man swore that I stopped him about twenty minutes before four, and he said it was a very dark morning, then he said he knew me by the buttons on my coat, and before he had sworn it was a very dark morning.</p>

               <p>Court to Jordan. Did you say so? - It is very false my Lord, what he says, I never mentioned four o'clock, nor no such an hour.</p>
               <p>Court to Finch. Do you remember that Jordan mentioned to the Justice that it was a very dark night? - I cannot remember that particular.</p>
               <p>Do you remember that he said he could distinguish the buttons of the prisoner's coat? - Yes, my Lord, he said he knew the buttons, he said that was the man by the buttons of the coat.</p>
               <p>Jordan. When I first watched these men, I watched to see whether they interrupted my master or not, they passed him, and I went after my horses, then I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100156"></xptr> my master halloo out, I ran back, says I halloo, what is the matter, and this Roberts came and said, if you say another word, I will cut you down directly.</p>

               <p>My Lord, here are three men that were present that know the words he swore, that it was about twenty minutes to four, and it was a dark night, and he could swear to the buttons of my coat; I have witnesses to bring to prove that I was at another place, I have witnesses both to my character, and in regard to my being elsewhere, I have proof to bring that I was at home in my bed at the time when this robbery is said to be committed.</p>

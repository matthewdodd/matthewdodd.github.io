            . We carry on business in the first floor of the Palladium Insurance-office in Cornhill; nobody sleeps in the house at night; on Saturday, the 4th of August, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I left the premises safe - there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130019"></xptr>a quantity of woollen cloth, kerseymere, jeans, and other things, to the amount of 200l. or 300l. - I was the last person that left our part of the premises; I closed the shutter, and locked the warehouse door - and on coming down stairs locked the street door; I was the last person who left the house; I returned on the Monday following, at nine o'clock - I was the first person there; I found the lock of the street door merely on the latch, merely slammed too - it would not open without the key, but it was not locked as I had left it on Saturday night; on opening the door I found on the stairs two rollers, which had silk on them, and were in a drawer in the warehouse on Saturday night; I found the warehouse door wide open, without any marks of violence on it; the warehouse was entirely ransacked, and every thing of value gone; the papers which had covered the goods were strewed about, and nothing material was left; most of our goods had fag ends to them - I have a book in which I enter the numbers of the articles in the warehouse - it is in my own hand-writing. The value of the articles lost is about 200l. On Thursday, the 9th of August, I saw part of the goods at the Mansion-house, in possession of the officer - they are worth 30l. 7s.; two fag ends of cloth were produced at the Mansion-house, which had been attached to the goods in the warehouse on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were the goods more than two women could carry? A. I cannot say; the cloth was not in whole pieces; the robbery seems to have been done with dexterity, and by somebody who knew the premises. I never saw the prisoners before, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How did the door appear to have been opened? A. The lock had been picked; the goods, I should think, would require a hackney coach or two to take them away - and it would take some time to pack them.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long had you left the premises? A. From eight o'clock on Saturday night till Monday morning; one person could have taken the goods in that time.</p>

             to No. 9, Paradise-street, Finsbury - there was a bill up to let the house; I knocked at the door, and saw an old lady; I looked over the bottom of the house, and in the yard saw Mary Anne Dove - she went up to show me the upper part; she showed me the middle and back room on the first floor; when I came to the door of the front room it was locked; I said "I should like to see this room"- she said, "You cannot, for I have let it to a young man, and he has got the key;" I said, "The fact is, I must see into the room, for I understand there was a coach unloaded here on Monday morning;" she said she would send for the key. I went down and waited in the back parlour with her - no key came; I said, "I had better break in, or get in at the window, as the key does not come;" she said, "Well, I will go for the key;" and while she was gone the prisoner, Elizabeth, went up stairs - I had seen her before - I heard a noise, followed her up, and found her with a towel in her hand, and something wrapped in it - and some dirty linen in her hand besides; I said,"What have you there?" she replied, dirty linen; I said,"Why, let me look;" she rather refused, and I took the towel out of her hand, and in that towel, among some small pieces of cloth, I found the fag ends of a black and blue cloth, with the numbers on them - I produce them; I afterwards showed them to Mr. John Hobson - Mary Anne did not return, and I got in at the window. In that room I found some remnants of various lengths of cloths of different colours, some a yard and a half, some two and three yards long - and here is one length of fifteen yards - some was on the bed and some in a chair. Mary Anne returned, and I secured her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. She returned with the key? A. I never saw the key, she had been gone about twenty minutes, when I got in at the window - I understand she is married.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Were there not some articles of female dress among the dirty linen which Elizabeth had? A. I never said there were articles among it which the parties might not like to exhibit; she had more slips of cloth, but only two were numbered; the towel was not tied up - I understand she is the cousin of the other prisoner's husband - I do not know whether she lived there.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Do you know any thing of Mary Anne being married? A. No - I do not know her husband.</p>

            . I am single, and live at No. 5, Stangate-street, Bishop's-walk. I know Mary Anne Dove; she has a husband: his name is Henry - I have known her for fourteen or sixteen years, and was present at her marriage; she always lived with her husband, to the best of my knowledge - I called on her in Paradise-street, about four months ago, when she was very ill; she was then living there with her husband; he was master of the house.</p>

No. particular part; she slept in the middle room over the first floor - I slept in the next room to her, and am confident she was at home all night, for I could hear her speak and walk; and if she drew her breath, I could hear it; she was at home on Sunday night also; she was only visiting there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am pay-clerk at the stone-yard of the workhouse of the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth, in Upper Kennington Lane—it is my duty to pay the men for the work they have done—the calculation is made between 4 and 5 o'clock—I pay each poor person half in money and half in bread—there are tickets given, marked from "1" to "10," and the amount of bread given is struck through the number—they are filled up with the name of the person to whom the ticket is given, and we strike out the num<lb></lb>ber which the person is to receive—there is "1," "2," "3," "4," "5," and so on, on the tickets, and if the person is to receive two loaves, you strike</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187105010063"></xptr>
               <p>out the "2," and leave the others standing—I also make an entry in this I book, at the time I deliver this ticket, of the amount of bread and cash paid to each person—when the order is delivered to the party entitled to receive it, it is his duty to take it to the bread distributor, at the work-house, and he gets the amount of bread marked on the ticket—I know the prisoner—he was at work in the stone-yard on 23rd March last, and he did work entitling him to an order for one loaf, and I gave him an order on that day for one loaf—I have an entry for one loaf in the book—I crossed I the "1" out on the order, and wrote the prisoner's name, and put my own initials on it, and gave it to the prisoner—I only intended him to receive one loaf on that order—on looking at this order I find that the figure "2" has been struck out instead of the "1," and the figure "1" nearly obliterated—I did not strike through the figure "2" at all—I struck through the figure "1"—on the original order he was entitled to receive one loaf—I can just see where the old mark is through the figure "1," it must have been got off when the mark was wet.</p>

I am bread distributor, and distributor of out-door relief at the workhouse—the orders given to the persons employed in the stone-yard would be brought to me, and the person presenting the order would be entitled to the number of loaves that were scratched out on the I order—I should give two loaves on this order—there is no doubt that it was presented on 23rd March—the prisoner is marked for two loaves on 23rd March—my clerk would make the entry—he would get the number from me—the tickets are put up in bundles each day—this order was tied up for that particular week—there was only one order presented by the prisoner on that day.</p>

I am clerk in the office of the bread distributor—the prisoner received two loaves on 23rd March—I know that by this entry "Thomas Baldock—Vince, 2 loaves"—that is made by me from the ticket—it would be handed to me by the last witness, and I should enter it—I can't say that that ticket was brought by the prisoner—his name is on it, but anyone might present it, very likely his children or his wife—I can't say who brought it.</p>

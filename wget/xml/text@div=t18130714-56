               <p>"Most excellent sir, from a genuine conviction of your humanity alone I implore your pardon, and hope you will have commisseration on my unhappy fate. By a deviation from my duty I have involved not only myself, but an amiable and heart-broken wife. This is the cause which makes me hope you will grant my request. Impressed with this hope I will be making reparation for the past by pursuing the paths of honest industry. I trust you will not be a sufferer by my error. Spare me from becoming an exile from my wife, family, and friends. You well know that I can procure respectable persons to whom you are no stranger, who will step forward and be security for the sum which you are deprived of, and if necessary for the amount for which you are bound over to prosecute, should it be in your power to withhold the prosecution, I and my family join.</p>

I said, No. She went on; I went in, and asked my mother, who was in the kitchen, if she had locked the garret door. She said, she had. I went up stairs directly, and found the door open: my husband's clothes were gone. I went down stairs, and made a hue and cry in the street: the prisoner was pursued, and taken.</p>

               <p>I live in Bury-court, Love-lane. Coming down, between eight and nine, I saw the prisoner in the first house in the court, with the clothes mentioned in the indictment, in her apron. A servant that lives next door to me, and a gentleman's daughter, asked her what she did there? She gave them some saucy answers, and I came down, and asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300035"></xptr> her how she came by these things? She asked me if the clothes were mine? I told her, no; but it was my opinion she had stolen them. I told her it was proper she should be detained till we could hear of somebody that had lost something of the kind.</p>

               <p>A young woman came to me, and asked me to hold these clothes, while she went to enquire for a scowerer, up the court. I waited a matter of a quarter of an hour; she did not return. I went into the court, and enquired if there was a scowerer lived there: I could not find one, and went and laid the clothes down, and stood by them. I was afraid I should have a noise for staying.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.)</p>

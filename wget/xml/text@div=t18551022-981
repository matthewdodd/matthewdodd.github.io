                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at No. 20, Bedford<lb></lb>terrace, Union-road, Newington, On Sunday night, 14th Oct., I was walking in Market-street, and saw the prisoner standing at the door of No. 9—she asked me to treat her with some gin, which I refused—I told her I had no money to spare, and was about leaving her, when she went up to a table, took something up, and as I was going from the parlour to the street door she came behind me, and I received a blow at the back of my head—I became insensible, and fell on the kerb stone—(1 had not gone further into the house than the parlour door)—I saw what it was done</p>

               <p>with, and believe it was a knife, but it was rather dark—I received assistance, went to St. Thomas's Hospital, and have been under treatment ever since—my head bled very much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical student at St. Thomas's Hospital I examined the prosecutor, and found a punctured wound above and behind his left ear, penetrating to the extent of an inch—it must have been inflicted by a blow with a sharp cutting instrument—a knife would be likely to cause it—I do not think it could have been caused by a fall—it was a clean incised cut—he was the worse for drink, but not to any great extent—I still dress the wound every other morning.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 251). On this Sunday night, about 11 o'clock, I met the prosecutor in the London-road—he appeared to have been drinking a little—he was bleeding from the head—I went with him to the prisoner's house, and he pointed her out as the person who had stabbed him on the head—she said that she did not do it; that three men came there, the prosecutor being one of them, and agreed to stand 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for some gin, but the prosecutor would not pay his 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and that was the reason he was <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> out.</p>

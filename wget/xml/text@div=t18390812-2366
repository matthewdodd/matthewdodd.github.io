                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, and live in Blue Boar-court, Friday-street. The prisoner was my warehouseman and town traveller—he had been with me about fourteen months—he was paid by a per centage up to Christmas last, when we settled, and I made a new arrangement that he should have a salary of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for carting—I paid him weekly—about the 22nd of June I discharged him—it was his duty, when he received money from a customer, to pay it to me or my son the same night—I have my books here—there is a piece of lasting booked as sold to Mr. Royston on the 16th of April, in my son's hand-writing—it is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner never accounted to me for that money—after he left, I went to his house about the latter end July, with an</p>

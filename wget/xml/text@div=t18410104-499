                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and live in Regent-street, West-minster. About five o'clock on the 29th of December, I was walking from the Serpentine river—when I got to the foot-path I was obstructed by some hurdles—the prisoner came up—I asked her how far the hurdles continued—she told me to go to a place where there was a path—she asked me to go with her—I refused, and then she asked me again—I refused—when I came to the path, I found the hurdles still continued—she put her hand in my left-hand trowsers-pocket, and took out 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were two half-crowns, and the rest in shillings and sixpences, in a linen bag—the money was found on her.</p>

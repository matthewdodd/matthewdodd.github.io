                  </hi>. I am outfitter and military tailor of 42, Jermyn-street, and also of Leadenhall-street—I was in partnership with my son—he managed the Leadenhall-street business, and I that at Jermyn-street—the prisoner was my clerk at the Leadenhall-street establishment only—on 6th May the partnership between me and my son was dissolved, in consequence of which I determined to make an alteration in the mode of conducting the business, and on Saturday, 7th May, I called the prisoner into my private room at Leadenhall-street about 11 o'clock in the morning, and informed him that I was about making alterations in my establishment, and should require no further services from him after the Monday following, in consequence of my son dissolving partnership with me on that day, and that I should bring my clerk from Jermyn-street, Mr. Scott, on the following Monday to take his place, and would give him a month's salary in lieu of a month's warning—he seemed very much confused and made no reply—I said, "Have you any question to ask me?"—he said, "Have you any fault to find with me?"—I said, "None whatever," and, in a very excited manner, he said, "There is nothing that I would not do to serve you"—I told him that Mr. Scott would come on Monday, and I should require him to go over the ledger with Mr. Scott and myself, and to point out the good, bad, and indifferent debts, and also to inform him what letters had been written in respect of the accounts—the prisoner assented to come on</p>

               <p>Monday morning, and I left immediately, leaving him there—I always leave after being there half an hour or so—on the Monday morning I went again—I got there about quarter to 10, earlier than my usual hour—the prisoner was there with a boy named Sowerby in the counting-house, and without speaking to him, I went into my private room to attend to a little matter or two—I then walked to the end of the large warehouse, and saw the prisoner leaving the front door—he had not spoken to me, or I to him—I directed Smith the warehouseman to go after him immediately—he followed him out, and returned in five minutes without him—Scott was not there, but he came over a few minutes afterwards—my appointment with him was 10 o'clock—I stopped very likely three quarters of an hour—before I left I knew of the ledger being mutilated, several leaves were torn or cut out, and there were several loose leaves in it—my son came before I left; that was after the prisoner had gone—a communication was made to the police afterwards, but I have never received any explanation from the prisoner with reference to the missing books or the mutilation of the ledger.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185907040012"></xptr>
               <p>an improved statement could throw no light upon it—I did not say "and my son would not give the accountant the particulars;" nothing of the kind—I said, "I repeatedly urged on my son the necessity of the accountant investigating the books to discover the error"—(this was at the interview on 7th May)—I do not recollect saying "My son objected, saying, he knew the books were correct, and the error must rest with the accountant"—I may have said something like it, but not that the error must rest with the accountant—I could not have said so with the knowledge I had of the accountant; I am sure I did not—I do not adhere to my answer that I might have said something like it—I did not say, "My son has been drawing about three times the amount of his share, and is a defaulter to an enormous amount," or anything with that import—I did say, "My son has overdrawn his account"—I did not say, "To an enormous amount"—I did not use the word "defaulter"—I did not go on to say, "I have been compelled, to save the house, to dissolve partnership;" nothing in the world like it—I did not tell him that as he did not know something of the military business I did not require him—I do not know whether he was paid his salary weekly—he said, "Mr. Nichols, during the time I have been in your employ have I ever given you cause to be dissatisfied with me?"—I did not answer, "Ever since you have been in this house your conduct has been most exemplary; you have been faithful, conscientious, honest, and everything which an employer could wish;" for I felt somewhat differently—I said that no doubt he would get a situation, but I said nothing about his talents—I did not say "I am very sorry to part with you, and had my son acted honestly with me you and he would both have been in the business now"—I never had the slightest reason to asperse my son—I believe I told the prisoner that I intended to discharge Hawkincloss the cutter—I do not think I said Sowerby the porter also—I did not say, "I do not like him; he has been very impertinent to me on several occasions, but you have always very willingly carried out any wish I have expressed"—I believe I did not say that I had determined on this course at Christmas, after the last balance sheet—I mentioned the amount I had expended on my house at Champion-hill, and assigned that as a reason—the conversation must have taken 10 minutes, or a quarter of an hour—it was a mistake when I said 10 minutes—my son and I balanced the accounts once a year—the prisoner and my son gave the items to me—the accountant made out a balance from my son's statement, which was furnished to him by the prisoner—the balance sheet will show the error on the wrong side—I found that out at Christmas, the year before last—there was an error for two years—I found out that my son had overdrawn by his stating it to me in his interview—he told me that since Christmas he had had about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than he was entitled to—I do not recollect the sum—he had not overdrawn his share, but he had overdrawn what he was allowed to draw—he said nothing about drawing more than he ought up to Christ<lb></lb>mas: the balance sheet shows that no balance sheet has been made since Christmas, none was made at the time of the dissolution—he had drawn very likely about 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether, but he was entitled to more than that—there was a sum of money due to him—we balanced, or took stock, at Christmas 1857, and it was on the face of the balance sheet that he had drawn about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than our partnership deed entitled him to draw—I never heard that he gave directions that the debts, good, bad, and indifferent, should be entered as good; it is impossible—the deficiencies are not made up—I found out the errors by the balance sheet, which proved a deficiency somewhere;</p>

               <p>each Christmas, when it was put it into my hands; I, could not tell in what way—I only got it from the balance sheet—I examined none of the books but my private ledger—the others were entirely under the prisoner's control—my son left them to him—my son was master there, and had the control of everything—he had a key to the safe in which the books were kept.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am now managing my father's business in Leadenhall-street—up to 6th May last we were in partnership—I had been principally managing the firm in Leadenhall-street—the prisoner was employed there as clerk and book-keeper—his salary commenced at 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, then it was 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, and then 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was his duty to keep all the books—he had charge of all the books—he did not make entries in the "bought" ledger—I did not keep it; it was kept with the other books—I made the entries in it—in the ordinary course of his duty he ought not to take any of the books off the premises—there was an iron safe for the purpose of keeping the books; it was kept in a private room—the prisoner had a key of it—I had the other key—there were only two keys—it was the prisoner's duty to put the books away—in the day-time all the persons in the establishment would have access to the books; they had no oppor<lb></lb>tunity of getting to them when placed in the safe—there are some books which still remain safe and unmutilated; they have no reference to the money accounts—the day-book and order-books have not been touched—the prisoner kept the ledger entirely, and he kept the cash-book on one side; I mean he entered all the monies received, I entered all the monies paid—there were money-lent books for entering the sums of money advanced to young midshipmen and others coming home, and who sign their name under the amounts—the money lent-books were exclusively dedicated to that part of the business, to monies advanced by us—there was also a petty cash-book to enter small payments and disbursements—the prisoner kept that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185907040014"></xptr>
               <p>book—the last petty cash-book in use was a long, narrow, white book, that had been in use from January last; the book in use before that was a short, thick, red book with a clasp to it—on the receipt side of those books he used to enter all small sums he received in the way of ready money sales; and on the payment side he would enter all little sums of money for petty cash matters, or sums of money which he had charged in the money-lent book—if 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been advanced to a midshipman it would appear as due to the firm in the money-lent book; it would also appear as a credit to him on the payment side of his petty cash-book—no one had access to the two last named books except the prisoner; he kept them entirely—those books were the property of the firm; I am able to speak to that positively; the last petty cash-book was bought by the prisoner, and charged for in his monthly cash, and allowed by us—in the ordinary course of business the money accounts were made up at the end of every month and submitted to me; if I found the entries in the book corresponded with the columns of payments or advances made by the prisoner, I initialled them as correct—if I found in his petty cash-book 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced to A.B. and also entered in the money lent-book, I initialled it as correct—I sometimes made entries in the money-lent book—in the ordinary course of things no one but the prisoner did so—in the great majority of cases it was the prisoner that made the entries—I occasionally made entries when it was a large sum of money—when I posted the advances from the money-lent books I posted the total amount, to the debtor and creditor cash-book, the monthly total—this is the book in which he entered on one side, and I the other (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner posted the accounts included in these different books to the ledger—he kept the ledger altogether—there is also a book called the rough red cash-book—that is only for receipts, money received from credit customers—we should treat a cheque as cash and enter it as such—either the prisoner or I generally kept the rough red cash-book—on Saturday, 7th May, I saw the prisoner engaged with some of the books—I saw him using the ledger the last thing that afternoon, about half-past 4—I was standing by the desk a few minutes—he was going over the ledger, carefully turning over the leaves—I saw no mutilation in the ledger at that time—I had not any occasion to look into the ledger that day, any more than observing him using it when I was at the desk—to the best of my knowledge it was not mutilated; I could not swear it—the prisoner made no complaint, nor did he call my attention to its being mutilated; he did not say a word—as far as I know it was not mutilated then—I made an entry in the cash-book that afternoon, about 1 o'clock—I can say that the cash-book was safe at that time—I made an entry of the wages—On 3rd of 4th May I went through the April account with the prisoner—at that time all the cash-books I have mentioned were safe—I left on Saturday, the 7th, about half-past 4, or quarter to 5—the prisoner was then in the office—I left him with the ledger—I went to the office on Monday morning, about half-past 10—at that time the prisoner was not in the office—Mr. Scott the new clerk had come to go over the books—the missing books were searched for; the others were all out when he came—we could not find them—the first book that we missed was the cash-book, and afterwards the other books were missed one after the other, the red cash-book, the three money-lent books for the years 1856-57-58 and the two petty cash-books—I did not examine the state of the ledger—Mr. Scott found that out in the afternoon when he wanted to make an account out; he called my attention to it—that was about 3 o'clock—the state of the debt-book was found out the same day, it was mutilated,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185907040015"></xptr>
               <p>and so was the ledger—I think the state of the ledger was found out before the debt-book—the debt book contained a list of the debts taken out of the ledger every 3 months by the prisoner—from the debt-book in the ordinary course letters or bills are sent to the debtors—about 20 folios were cut out of the debt-book; out of the last list made on 1st January—there are about 70 folios cut out of the ledger (<hi rend="italic">books pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—this is the ledger—some leaves are left in loose—the folios are missing from different places—in one place they are missing from 361 to 374—about 73 folios are gone altogether—a folio is one side of a leaf—the 73 folios missing begin with folio 2 up to 372—the folios missing from the debt-book are not consecutive, but cut out in the same manner—the names are not entered alphabetically, but with reference to the folio in the ledger; without the missing folios we could not tell what the reference was—since I saw the petty cash-book last in use the leaves have been cut out to the end of April—I cannot say what proportion of the book has gone—the leaf I that remains is the settlement of the last month on one side—there was an account in that book from January up to that date; that has disappeared—I spoke to the prisoner on the Saturday afternoon as I was leaving, I told him to get the cash accounts ready by Monday morning, and we would take them first before we went through the ledger with the new clerk—that would be the cash account from 30th April down to the date of the prisoner's leaving—he has not paid over or accounted to me for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received by him after 30th April—he has not accounted to me for any money received after 30th April; that was the account he was to render to me on the Monday morning. I have examined some papers that were found by the witness Richards in the water-dose, those were the "money-lent" books—I saw Richards take them out of the water-closet, I think on the Thursday after the prisoner had left on the Monday—the water-closet was choked, and it was in consequence of that that it was examined—they are portions of the money-lent books of 1856 and 1857 (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

               <p>100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was not 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that I swear—I can't, without my papers, swear it was not 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in those two years—I believe I was going on in both years, but I am not prepared with dates and amounts; it was only two or three months out of the year—I had some very small transactions at that time—I commenced again in the autumn of 1858—I was speculating in a new thing in the autumn, some of the new foreign loans that came out, the Turkish loan; I certainly lost an amount of money upon that—I lost all I had, nearly 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid a portion of it at different times, before the dissolution—I am not in partnership with my father now; I am managing the business for him at a salary—we were five years in partnership—we dissolved on the advice of my solicitor, on account of my having these time bargains—I told my father about it myself; that was the first intimation he had—I have not told him any particulars—I first communicated to him my losses on the Stock Exchange, either at the end of April or beginning of May this year—I did not tell him anything about my losses in 1856 or 1857; I did not tell him what I had lost: I swear that—I told him it was heavy—I don't know the amount I owed on the Stock Exchange at the time of the disso<lb></lb>lution—I have not bad an account rendered from the broker I do business with—I told you I had lost about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I mean altogether—I have paid two or three sums—I have paid 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't know what the amount is I owe now—I can't say; things may be different now—I don't know the amount I owed at the time of the dissolution; it was not 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or near it—the account is not closed now that I am aware of—I have not done anything in speculation since—I expect I have paid about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I lost about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but not having had any account, I cannot tell you what I owe now—I don't recollect the date of the last account I had from my broker—I suppose it was in the beginning of April; the dissolution was in May—I have not got that account here—I am not sure that there was not a balance in ray favour on that account; but you must recollect that this was at a time when some things went down 40 per cent, in a day—brokers send in their accounts twice a month, I believe, if you fetch them—the broker has not applied to me since April—I have not gone since April to see if the account was in my favour—I only know that since that last account things have gone bad, but I have never made inquiries since then, so that I don't exactly know what I have lost—I know I have not lost 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; you can see by the share-list every day what the prices of things are; you are not obliged to go to the broker to know that—I knew I was a defaulter at the time of the dissolution, but did not know the amount, nor do I now—I only know that things have gone down—whether it is 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I don't know—I left the onus on the broker to pay the difference—I was called on to pay and did not—the broker is carrying it on now—I have not troubled my head about how much he has had to pay—it is his place to apply to me, and he has not done so—I don't know how much stock I had open altogether, perhaps some 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—it was not 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I will not swear that it was not beyond 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my broker is Mr. Merton, of Bartholomew-lane, he is a broker's clerk—he does it on his own account—I do it through him—brokers' authorized clerks can go on the Stock Exchange—I should say it was not the clerk who was let in for my liabilities—I can't tell you who it was—I don't know their system, or the ins and outs of their business—the broker has not called upon me to pay—I swear that—I have not told him to close my account—I do not know whether the account is open now—according to the present state of the market I am a loser, not a heavy loser—I told my father I was a heavy loser—that was the reason the partner-ship</p>

               <p>was dissolved—I told you that my losses at that time were about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>: more or less—I did not tell my father that—there was not a deficiency on the balance-sheet from the first time of my becoming a partner—the two first years, '54 and '55, the balance was right—it came wrong when we had a change, and different parties in the place—I don't recollect whether that was in '56—there was a small deficiency the first 2 years—there was a deficiency in the '56 or '57—I don't recollect how much without the book—there was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficiency in the last account, or the account before, I believe—I believe it was in '58—I did not make out the balance-sheet.; an accountant did—he did it from what I or the clerk communicated to him—the clerk gave him most of the amounts—he did not look over the books—the last balance-sheet was made up in December last—Mr. Tyler, of the firm of Goodehap and Tyler, was the accountant—by the clerk, I mean the prisoner—the items were written down for the accountant, and from those he made up the balance-sheet—the accountant wanted to have the books—we did not let him have them—we did not think it necessary—I said I did not think it was usual—I did not think it was necessary for him to keep the books—I did not say that he should never look over them—he has never looked over the cash-books—he has gone through them, not inves<lb></lb>tigated them—I think it was in '57 that he looked over them—he did not look over the books to make up the balance-sheet of '58—I have no recol<lb></lb>lection of his asking to do it—I said it was not customary to have accountants to do our books for us, I considered we ought to be able to do our own books—I considered I could keep the books—I believe there was a deficiency of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in '57 or'58—the clerk and I tried to find out how it was, several times; we went through the books—that was not the prisoner; he was not there—we have had two or three clerks—one was named Dickens—that was before the prisoner came into the service—there was not a defi<lb></lb>ciency of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in '58—it was between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. end 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the books will show—I think the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficiency was the year before—I have no doubt, in order to find out that deficiency, I went over the books, but I can't recollect now—I did not go over the books with the accountant—the prisoner went over his portion, and I went over mine—I did not find out the cause of the deficiency—the accountant had figures given to him, and he made the balance from that—I told my father I could not see any good from the accountant's going through the books—I did not know of the deficiency before the accountant had made out the balance-sheet—I had no means of telling—I only furnished him with the amounts of cash, he put the different figures together—the prisoner and I were in the habit of settling every month—he was in the habit of paying out petty sums, and sometimes there was a balance against him at the end of the month—he, added up what he had paid and received, and I paid him the balance—I do not know that he was in the habit of making advances of petty cash from his own money—it was very seldom that there was any balance due to him—I never said to him, "If my father asks you what money has been received this month do not tell him"—I kept a petty cash-book in my private drawer—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it belongs to the firm, certainly—all the entries relate to the firm—it has some entries copied into it from the other petty cash-book at the prisoner's dictation—all the disbursements of petty cash relating to the firm are not entered from this book into the other, they are entered into the cash-book—it is only the small items, such, as omnibusses and little articles, that are entered here—this was kept in my drawer, locked—it was the only book I had to keep, and I kept it locked up,</p>

               <p>because there was no occasion for other parties to have it—I did not say to the prisoner, "If my father asks you how much money has been received do not tell him: if he wants to see the cash-books, say they are in my private drawer, and I am out and have got the keys;" nothing of the kind he and I used to take out the amounts from all the books—I gave him the amount of cash at the banker's and in hand; any drawing by the partners during the year, and any other disbursements not charged in the cash-book, such as rents and taxes—the cash-book was balanced every month—I wrote down my own amounts—I kept the banking account, drew the cheques, and had the sole management of the money—I took the account of the money that I wrote down at the time, and gave it to the accountant—I desired the prisoner at the annual balancing to put down all debts, good, bad, and indifferent, not as good, but as debts—there was no dis<lb></lb>tinction made, so that they would appear on the face of the books to be good—they were not all good—the distinction was not to be made, because some of our customers are out at sea—some debts were actually bad—I desired him to enter them in one sum, to make no distinction, because without the consent of my partner I was not justified in writing off any man's debt as good or bad—my father knew in balancing the accounts what were good and what were bad from my telling him—I told him that a great portion of these were bad; I believed from 2 to 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but not in one year—I cannot say how much in one year—the object of that was not that I might receive a larger share of the profits;—I should be entitled to a larger share if the thing was wound up or sold off-this is the debt book from which the leaves have been torn out; it is in the prisoner's writing—the debts would be rather more than 5 or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the year, on which amount there would be quite 5 or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bad—there was no object in the prisoner giving more than the total amount of debts here; he gave me the amount on paper—I knew the distinction between good, bad, and indifferent debts; they are all marked in the ledger.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I do not think any division of profits has ever been squared up yet. The accountant computed profits and all that; he made the balance sheet up from the figures which I gave him—I have talked these deficiencies over with my father—he might have asked me as a partner to get the accountant to go over the books to find them out; he did not desire me.</p>

               <p>proposition made to the accountant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He came once a month to go through the books; he was paid for it, and that was what I objected to—I did not refuse to allow him to look at the books when he was making up the balance sheet; my father never asked to look at the books, he left all to me—on my solemn oath I have never concealed anything from my father in reference to the firm—this cash-book was kept entirely by me—I paid the wages—it was my book and had reference to the business of the firm—it was for my information and guidance—this "C. B." means "Cash book;" being my book it was kept in my private drawer, and the prisoner had nothing to do with it—I employed Mr. Merton, who is a stockbroker's clerk, but generally without paying him money—I bought some Turkish stock, I don't recollect the amount; it was the new loan 6 percent.; it has fallen and risen twenty times since I bought it; it had fallen just before I dissolved partnership in April—I have owed Mr. Merton money once or twice; I cannot recollect the dates; it was all this year—on finding that the prices of this stock made me a loser in April, I told my father what had happened; I also moved out of my house, and went into lodgings, and reduced my expenditure—all my accounts are settled for 1856 and 1857, and I do not owe a farthing in respect of any transaction then—I am enabling myself to pay Mr. Merton what he has been called upon to pay for me by reducing my expences; it would not make a farthing difference to me, whether the debts were treated as good, bad, or indifferent, only in the case 6f winding up the partnership; then we should take the bad debts off—I think 10 per cent, was allowed by the accountant for bad debts; there were no deficiencies until there was a change of servants—the prisoner was one of the persons who then came into the service, and he had the exclusive care of the books from the time he came—the balance sheets were made up from March, 1854, to March, 1856, and there was a deficiency of a few pounds; we then changed to Christmas—I drew the checks; all the checks for the business appear in the books—I have never drawn money which my father did not afterwards know of; he did not require to know it before—I have given him an account of everything I have taken out of the firm—I have stolen nothing—I had nothing to do with secreting and mutilating the books—I have never had any ill-feelings against or quarrel with the prisoner—I have always been on good terms with him.</p>

I am a detective city office—I took the prisoner, on 10th May about half-past 8 o'clock, in Lorrimer-road, Walworth, about one hundred yards from his own house—a constable was with me—I had received information the night previous—I told him we were police officers; that we arrested him on the charge of stealing a cash book, and some leaves out of a ledger, belonging to his employers, Messrs. Price and Co., of 11, Leadenhall-street—he said he knew nothing about it—I told him it would he necessary to search the house—he said, "Very well; but am I to consider myself in custody"—I said, "Yes"—I then took him and went with Allen to search the prisoner's house—when in the front parlour, I asked him where the books were that he had brought from the firm on Saturday night—he said, "Which do you mean? I brought none away; but two were brought away by the lad belonging to the firm, and I think one is up stairs"—we went up stairs to a room on the second floor—the prisoner took us up, and we looked about, and in a minute or two, not being able to find them, he said that they must be down stairs—he called down stairs to his wife, describing a book, and she afterwards brought up one which has been produced, which the prisoner handed to me in the same state as it is now, with these leaves torn out—I said, "Some leaves have been torn out, what have you done with them?"—he said, "I have torn them up, it is only my own petty cash book"—I asked him for the other book, he said that he burnt that on Sunday morning; this being Tuesday morning—we went down into the kitchen where his wife was—I spoke about the other book, and the prisoner asked his wife with respect to it, describing it as a book with a red cover and a clasp—she replied," You burnt that yesterday evening"—he put it as a question to her, "What did I do with that book, or did I not burn that book?"—I saw some flakes of burnt paper on the hearth.</p>

               <p>giving him a month's salary—I cannot say whether anything was said about young Mr. Nicholls being a defaulter—a desultory conversation took place in the street between me and Mr. Wilmot, and Pope and Enefer, but I did not hear what the words were—Mr. Pope is Mr. Nicholl's attorney, and I believe Wilmot was sent by him—I did not hear anything said about a defaulter—I did not at any time-see the prisoner send away these two books from the place—I know Sowerby—I saw him on Saturday night—I did not see the prisoner give anything to him; I don't know that he did, or that Sowerby took anything away—I have heard from the prisoner that he did—Sowerby is not still in Mr. Nicholls' employment; he left about a week after the prisoner—I know that the prisoner had a book in his desk; this white book is it—there was a red book in use previous to this white one—he kept them locked in his own desk—I know that he made private memorandums in this book—I heard the prisoner say at the interview on the Monday, when Mr. Pope was present, that he had sent the two books to his own house by Sowerby—he also said that they were his own books—he has lent me money—that was a private matter—he used to enter it in one end of the white book—I can't recollect when he last lent me any money—sometimes he used to lend me some, and sometimes I used to lend him some—I have no doubt this is correct—if I was not there and anything came in he used to pay for it and charge it—here is "Dinner, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and "Cash, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that is correct—at the time he left I was indebted to him—I have paid him since—I believe the entry is in this book—it has nothing to do with the firm—a man named Brooks lives in the warehouse—I have a key of the warehouse, and so has Mr. Nicholls—I imagine he could get in at any time—when the prisoner came on the Monday morning he did not say that he had come to take away his private letters and papers; he said he thought of going a trip into the country—I knew he was going to leave—I believe he said something about Mr. Nicholls treating him rather sharply, after being there two years to send him away with only a month's notice—he did not say that he had come there earlier to get his privates papers; he did not mention private papers—I don't know whether he had private papers in his desk or not—he had a key to a drawer of the desk at which he sat—I saw him go away—I was so busy with my own work that I did not notice what he was doing or what he had with him—he said something about having a parting glass with him—he stated to Mr. Pope and the others that he had two books at home, and they were his own, and he denied all knowledge of the others—that was in Bishopsgate-street—an observation was made that somebody else might be interested in removing the books—no name was mentioned—I did not hear Mr. Pope say that he was perfectly satisfied with the prisoner's answers, and he should at once advise Mr. Nicholls not to adopt the course he had threatened—I did not hear anything of the sort—I am there still—I endeavour to do my duty—I was in the habit of going down to meet ships, and occasionally lending money to midshipmen for Mr. Nicholls—when I came back I gave the names to the prisoner, and he entered them in the money-lent book—sometimes it would appear as if the money was actually advanced by him—when I advanced it he invariably put my name against it—I have not known any mistakes made about that; I cannot recollect any; there might have been—I know Mr. Church—he advanced money as I did for some time—I believe there was a mistake of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. made in the money-lent book—it appeared in prisoner's name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's employment—on Monday morning, 9th May, I went to Leadenhall-street—I got there about 20 minutes before 9, when I got there the prisoner was there—I first saw him in the counting-house near the desk—I can't say what he was doing—I think he was looking over the books there—I afterwards saw him go into the private room, where the safe was kept, and saw him taking out some books—I can't say what books they were, or what description of books—he took them into the counting-house, and put them into his desk—after that I noticed him leave the premises; that was a little before 10—as he was going out I asked him if Mr. Nicholls came, what time he should be back—(Mr. William Nicholls had not arrived at that time)—he said he thought of going down into the country that morning, and returning about the Wednesday fol<lb></lb>lowing—it is part of my duty to receive cash for ready money sales to chance customers, and to hand the money to the prisoner—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my rough sale book, in which I enter the sales—I find in the order book an entry of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as a sale made by me—I handed that over to the prisoner on the same day—here is also an entry of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 3rd May, of a similar sale made by me—I handed that over to the prisoner—I handed the sums to him separately—on 4th May there is an entry of the sale of goods by me to the amount of 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I handed that over—on 7th May here is 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I handed both those over to the prisoner, and on 8th May here is 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the receipt of the money is acknowledged by the prisoner; he crosses it off in my book.</p>

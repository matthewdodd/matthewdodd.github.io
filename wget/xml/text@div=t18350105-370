                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Norholt, near Harrow. The prisoner lived in the village—he was a labourer—I had some timber in the barn of the Rev. Mr. Greenlaw, the clergyman—in November, the barn was broken open, and several times before, and a good deal of timber was taken—all the timber there was mine—it was six or seven feet long—it was elm—I lost about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth altogether, and the last time I lost three pieces—I was there on the Thursday, and on the 23rd of November, I found it broken open—and in about ten minutes after finding it broken open, I went to the prisoner's house, and found some timber there—it appeared, that one piece had been chopped up, and sawn into eleven pieces—it is worth about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not recovered more—I went there again, and found the prisoner at home—I knew the wood to be mine, and I accused him of having stolen it, and gave him in charge—he lived about two hundred yards from the barn—he made his escape, as the officer went with me to compare the timber with what was in the barn; and when we came back, he was gone—I can swear to my mark, which is on it.</p>

               <p>but the officer followed me down to the barn, and left him in the house, and he went away—the officer saw the mark on the timber when it was found—I had put the mark on it a week or ten days before—I had marked it with chalk in the barn—I marked all the top pieces—I found eleven pieces on his premises; but, when he took it, it was only one piece—they were about two feet long—he said his father gave him the timber, and he said he had it from Mr. Simmons—the upper part of the timber had a kind of limb, which ought to have been chopped off when the tree was felled.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Norholt. On the 23rd of No<lb></lb>vember, the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge for stealing timber—I saw the timber—I took it before the magistrate—I saw a chalk mark across it—the prosecutor and I carried the wood from his house—the prisoner followed us to the house, and we had the timber locked up—the prosecutor wanted me to go to the barn to see the mark on the timber there; and, while I was gone, the prisoner left—we had left him in the tap-room—I found him down at Limehouse last Thursday.</p>

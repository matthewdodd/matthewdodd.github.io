                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at Acton. On Sunday night, the 6th of Oct., I was in the tap-room of the Pack-horse public-house, at Turnham-green—I had an umbrella—I put it down, and a bundle on a seat, but I never sat down at all—I saw the prisoner there—I had never seen him before in my life—he asked for a drop of beer, and I gave him some—I missed my umbrella, and the prisoner was gone—no one else left but him—my sister went</p>

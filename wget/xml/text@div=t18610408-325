                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 121). On 11th March, about 9 o'clock, I was called to Liverpool-street, and, on reaching there, I found a van with two horses attached to it, abreast—it was laden with two or three very heavy casks, and a quantity of cork; it was a made-up load—the prisoner was standing leaning on the pole in front of the two horses when I came up—another policeman came up and I told him to take the prisoner to the station—the street was being repaired at this place; they were making a new sewer, and in consequence of that a bar was placed across the street to stop the traffic—it was a large scaffold pole put across the centre of the road, and very near to each end of the pole were two lanterns about five feet high—the deceased was there when I came up—I helped to take him to a surgeon—he had a very severe wound—the accident had happened before I came up—the prisoner was very drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 5, Elder-street, Finsbury, and am coachman to Mr. Norbury—I was walking up Bishopsgate-street on 11th March, about 9 o'clock, or a quarter past—I saw a van with a pair of horses abreast coming down Liverpool-street from Bishopsgate-street, at full rate; I should judge ten or eleven miles an hour—the prisoner was on the box driving—I saw the watchman standing on the off side, doing something to the lantern, I do not know what—the pole of the van ran against the bar that goes across the street; of course it was the coachman's fault, there was plenty of room for him to have turned round and gone into Broad-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The bar across the street was made with a pole, was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On three tressels—he could have avoided it if he had liked, if he had turned down Broad-street—unless he turned he could not have avoided it, because he was driving at such a rate—there was no room for him to pass except by turning round.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then going with that pace against the bar, what did you see done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He took the bar away with him with the end of the pole, about twelve yards from where the accident occurred, before the van stopped—I did not wait to see the man who was injured—I did not see how he was injured, or what became of him, because I ran and fetched the policeman as soon as I saw the van stopped—I saw the man standing by the lamp on the off' side—I saw the accident happen to him—the coachman had no power over the horses whatever when this occurred, and he took the bar away with the pole twelve yards, and then the pole dropped from it and caught the fore wheels, and that stopped him, or else he would have gone into the sewer—the man was run over on the legs—I saw that—he was knocked down by the bar—I saw him fall—it was through the furious driving—he was knocked down by either the bar or the van, I could not take my oath which—the bar was knocked down by the pole of the van that was between the horses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then you cannot tell us whether it was the bar or the van that killed the man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was the van caused the man's death by knocking the bar down—I was between forty and fifty yards from the bar at the time; I have had it measured—the deceased was standing by the lamp on the off side—whether he was snuffing the lamp or putting a fresh candle in I do not know—I was quite sober at the time; I had not been drinking at all—according to my judgment the van was going at the rate of ten or eleven miles an hour—he had no power over the horses when he ran up against the bar—I saw the van running about twelve yards before it was stopped—I did not see it for five minutes, nor hardly for a second.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say it was going ten or eleven miles an hour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I reckon if I drive seven miles an hour it is quite fast enough on London stones—that is the pace I usually drive—I mean to say the prisoner was driving faster than I usually drive—the horses were trotting—I did not see him get off the van—there was no one with him at the time of the accident—he was alone in a kind of chair on the van.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 123). I was called up on this occasion—when I came up the prisoner was drunk in front of his horses—he was off the van—I did not see him on the van—this was adjoining my beat—I observed this thing across the street—it was a pole resting on barriers with lanterns, and the man who is dead was a watchman there—I think he. had a box there—I am not positive—there is a gas lamp close to the barrier</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's-hospital—on 11th March a man named Michael Ahearne was brought to me—I examined him—he had a compound comminuted fracture of the right leg, and a simple fracture of the left leg—a wheel passing over it, or a blow from a barrier knocked down might produce both the fractures—it was considered necessary that amputation of the right leg should take place directly—the operation was performed about two hours afterwards—he lived for a fortnight, and died on 25th March—death was caused by the accident; it was such a serious accident to an old man, he died from exhaustion—he sank under it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Of course it would be much more severe to an old man than a young man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—he was seventy-two or seventy-three years of age, I believe. <hi rend="italic">The prisoner received a good character.</hi>

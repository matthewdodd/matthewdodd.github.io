                  </hi>. I live at Lewisham, and am a master drover—the prisoner was in my employ two years and four months.

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the Great Western Railway. I recollect some sheep and lambs coming up for the prosecutor—on Sunday night, 16th May, I saw the prisoner in the office—I knew him quite well—he said he had paid the money for some sheep which had come up on the previous Thursday night—he should have paid it to me, but he said he paid it to clerk named Ashdown, who was absent from illness—Ashdown was authorized to receive money—Henry Cook afterwards brought the prisoner in, and said, in his hear<lb></lb>ing, "He says he has paid the money"—I asked the prisoner who he paid it to, he said, "To the gentleman that gave out the papers for the sheep"—I said, "That cannot be, Mr. Ashdown is ill, and has not been here to-night"—the prisoner said he had paid it—I said, "Who gave out the papers?"—he said he could not tell; but he had paid the clerk who gave out the papers—I said, "I gave them to you myself;" no one gave out the papers for sheep but Ashdown and myself—I called two other clerks and showed them to the prisoner—he said it was not them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw him on Sunday night, when he came, and you gave him papers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; not a word passed about payment—I saw him again on Monday morning, when what I have stated took place—I did not see him again till Wednesday following, when he was in custody—there was not a good deal of confusion in the office—Mr. Ashdown had not been there for several days or a week—I believe the prisoner paid a sum of money in on that night, but not to me—he has not paid this money to me.</p>

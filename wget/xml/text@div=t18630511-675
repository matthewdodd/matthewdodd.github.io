                  </hi>. I am a coal merchant of 21, Denton-street, Somers<lb></lb>town—on 23d April I was walking arm in arm with my son-in-law, Mr. Alton, at twenty minutes past 12 at night—the prisoner and another man followed us, and suddenly turned and faced us—one knocked me down, and the other, I believe, made a grab at my watch chain, and gave me a black eye—they took away a portion of my chain, and left a portion on the watch, which was left in my pocket—I was down, and did not see them run away—I was either kicked, or injured by a fall on the kerb—one of the glasses went out of my spectacles from the blow—I feel pain in my hip to this day—I was rendered insensible—this was only six or seven yards from my house, and I got in as soon as I could.</p>

               <p>12 o'clock, I was walking with him, and when about 150 yards from home, two men set upon as from behind, made a blow at my father-in-law, and knocked him down—I got hold of one by the coat or waistcoat, and received a blow on the back of the neck, and was knocked down—a policeman came up as I was getting up—I could swear to both the men—they ran away, and I took my father-in-law by the arm, and led him home, thinking he was badly hurt—it was rather a dark night—the nearest lamp was perhaps ten yards off, and I could see the prisoner's features when he assaulted my father-in-law; but it was the other man that knocked him down.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, S</hi> 343). I was on duty in St. Pancras-road between 12 and 1 o'clock, and saw a man run down Denton-street—he looked up and down the old road—I followed him, and when I got within ten yards of him he cried out, "Look out"—at that time I saw the prisoner and another man leaning over something in the street—the prisoner ran by me down Denton-street—I spoke to the prosecutor, and, from what he told me, I pursued the prisoner, but turned back, went through Weston-street, and caught him at the top of Weston-street—I told him I wanted him for knocking an old gentleman down, and stealing his watch—he said, "So help me God, I have not been in Weston-street or Denton-street at all"—I had not mentioned Denton-street—he then threw something away—I took him to the station, and sent for the prosecutor, who charged him—I then searched with Brown to find what the prisoner threw away, but could not—it was found next morning, but not in my presence—it was thrown in the centre of the carriage-way—I noticed the spot, and pointed it out to Brown.</p>

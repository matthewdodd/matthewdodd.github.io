On Tuesday, the 22nd, I re<lb></lb>ceived information from Mrs. Salmon, that some stockings had been stolen—I made inquiries, and found Ford—she said her name was Shannon, and her father kept a tailor's shop in Cross-street, which I knew to be false—I then said I should take her for stealing some stocking—she said they were at an old woman's at the top of Bluegate-fields, where she had sold them for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked if she would show me, and she said, "Yes"—I went to the house and saw Mrs. Miller—I asked her if she had bought any stockings of the girl—she said, "Yes, but I do not know where they are"—I asked the girl how many stockings there were—she said she did not know, but she had given her 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—Miller then went into a little room, and stopped seven or eight minutes, she then came out, and I said if she did not produce the stockings. I should search the house—she went into the room the third time, and when she came out, she called Wilson, who was present, to give them to me—she gave me five stockings, which I pro<lb></lb>duce—I then asked Ford what she had done with the other pair—she said she had pawned them at Mr. Hawes' for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a gown for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked her again whether she knew any thing about Mrs. Dudley's table-cloth—she said she had pawned that for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

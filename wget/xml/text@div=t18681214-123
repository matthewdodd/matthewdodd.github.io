                  </hi>. I live at 14, Clifton Cottage, Clifton Road, Peckham, and am a licensed victualler, out of business—I was at that time keeping the Chequers Inn, Worship Street, Finsbury—I had supplied refreshments to the prisoner, who came to my house with a man named Duffey, and had supplied them at different times with refreshments, and lent them money, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had pressed them both for payment, but lost sight of them for some time—on 22nd August the prisoner came and handed me this cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), saying, "I am glad I am able to pay you"—I said, "Who is Henry West, the drawer of the cheque"—he said, "A brewer, in the Commercial Road"—I said, "Now, Cross, is this a genuine cheque"—he said, "Yes,"—I said, "Endorse your name and address on the back of it"—he did so—I deducted the amount of my account, and paid the prisoner the balance, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 24th August, I presented the cheque at the London and Westminster Bank, and they marked it, "No account"—I searched for the prisoner, and saw him two months afterwards, in Bucklersbury—I told him I should give him in custody—he told me he would pay me the money if he could; then he got away—I communicated with the police, and he was taken on another charge.</p>

            . I was the constable of the night. About a quarter before two o'clock, the prisoner was brought into the watchhouse, charged with stealing the prosecutor's watch. I searched her and found the watch in her shoe. She said, the prosecutor gave her the watch. The prosecutor was more confused than drunk; he walked very well and spoke tolerably well.</p>

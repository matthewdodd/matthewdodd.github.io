I went into a public-house in Whitechapel, about half-past eight that morning - I saw the prosecutor asleep, and the prisoner sitting beside him; the prisoner asked me if I would take a glass of ale, and I thought he knew me, but I had no recollection of him; I said I would have a glass of ale, and he then asked me to have a pipe the prisoner was then filling the glass and he broke it; he said to me "Don't say anything about this; I will tell him he broke it;" he then withdrew from the table, and said "I will go and feel in his pocket if he has got any money to pay for it;" I said "You had better not feel in his pocket but awake him;" he felt in his pockets, and took out some money, I do not know how much; he said the prosecutor was a great rogue; that he had a wife and five children, and he had not been home all night, and if he could get his money to take home it would be a good thing; he then counted the money on the opposite table to where I was; we should not have let him take it if he had not said that.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with ray parents at 11, Essex Road, Islington—they keep a confectioner's shop—last Friday five weeks, about a quarter to eight p.m., the prisoner came for one ounce of the best cough lozenges—I said that I had not got them in stock, and he bought something else, either three halfpenny worth or twopence halfpenny worth, and gave me a florin—I put it in the till and gave him change—there was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of small silver there, but no florin—he left, something was said to me and I found that the florin was bad two minutes afterwards—I could then see him on the other side of the way—we kept the florin till next morning, when my mother bent it and threw it in the fireplace—on Saturday, 31st August, about 9 p.m., the prisoner came again for some of the best cough lozenges, but I had none—a gentleman followed him in; he seemed rather confused and did not attempt to make any purchase, and when the gentleman went away he came back and bought an ounce of pear drops and an ounce of other drops, which came to three halfpence—he gave me a florin—I said, "This is another of the same sort you brought me one before"—he said, "You make a mistake"—I called my father, a constable on duty was passing, he was called in, and the florin was given to him—it had never gone out of my sight.</p>

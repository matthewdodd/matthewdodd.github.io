                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 69, Sun-street. The prisoner was in my employ—he slept at my house—on the morning of 2nd Dec. I received a note, and I went to Mr. Ehrenberg's house—he is a tailor, in the same street—he showed me a piece of cloth—I examined it—I knew it was mine—it had no business to be at Mr. Ehrenberg's premises—I never sell cloth, except cut out in coats, and that I do myself; I will not allow any one to cut but myself—I went to the station, and got an officer</p>

               <p>—I went and saw the prisoner—I said to him, "The piece of cloth we have been looking for six or seven days is over at Mr. Ehrenberg's; how came it there?"—I had missed a piece of the same kind and the same dimensions that I found—I had spoken to the prisoner about it—I missed a piece the day before, and I said "It is gone with the other piece; we must find out how this is"—the prisoner said, "I know nothing at all about the cloth"—I sent for the cloth—the prisoner said, "Yes, that is the piece of cloth that has been missing, but I don't know how it came to Mr. Ehrenberg's—the prisoner said I ought to send for him, and trace it to him, and I said to him, "Would you face it out to him if I send for him?"—he said, "Yes"—I sent for him—Mr. Ehrenberg said his servant girl was present when the cloth was brought—the servant girl was sent for, and she said, in the prisoner's presence, that she saw him come on the Saturday that was named, and leave a parcel—I then went into the back parlour, and fetched two other pieces of cloth—I threw them all three down by the side of her, and asked her which was the piece the prisoner brought, and she took out the one which I had found at Mr. Ehrenberg's—it cost 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—there is six yards of it—it is worth 33<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 25, Sun-street. I had known the prisoner—on Saturday, Nov. 19th, the prisoner came, and brought me a strip of cloth—he said he wanted a coat made for a customer of his, and he could buy the stuff at a piece-broker's, which was a length of six yards, but he only wanted two, and he asked me if I would buy the other four—he said if he had two yards cut off they would charge him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard, but if he took the six yards they would charge him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I have not got the sample that he brought; he took it away with him—I said I did not know—I did not mind having it, but I had not got the money at present—I asked if he would have the coat made by me—he said he would, and I agreed for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the make of the coat, provided he brought his own trimmings—I said if I had the rest of the cloth, and he would take off 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; for the make of the coat, I would pay the balance for the four yards—he agreed to that—he went away, and came back in half an</p>

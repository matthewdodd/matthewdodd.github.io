               <p>I was in the house at Golden-lane; I went up into the room which the other witnesses had before been in, I found all the things which are produced in a room in the upper story; after finding the instruments which are produced, and likewise a tub with sand and some flasks in; I found in a great coat pocket a quantity of counterfeit-money (The witness produced several shillings and half-crown pieces, which appeared to be finished, and two good half-crowns, from which the moulds were made.) I suppose the shillings to be worth about four pence half penny or five pence a-piece; the half-crowns, 13 or 14 d. a-piece. I found these counterfeit shillings which are finished, and these which have not been whitened since cast (producing them) they were in a bag up the chimney; I found a number of good shillings, which I suppose were kept for patterns; I found the good ones in one place and the bad ones in another; there were some counterfeits up the chimney also in a piece of cloth; they are cast, but they have not been finished: I found likewise a piece of get, which is what runs in the channel between one part of the mould and the other; I also found files, aqua-fortis, and a quantity of faceing, that is of a stronger body than the sand, and is put over it to close the pores of the sand and make it smoother; I found a quantity of copper and a quantity of silver in it; I found some shirts marked R W which I take to be the initials of the prisoner's name. Suspecting who it was, we went in search of the prisoner, and between Red Lion-market and Golden-lane, we saw him at a door; he went into a yard and I followed him, and found him in the necessary-house; I took him into custody, and carried him to the house. The things produced are a complete apparatus for the coining of silver coin; no other business was carried on in the house, and there was no one tool in the room but what was applicable to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was there any body in the room? - No; there was no person in the room, and I should think, there had not been any work done for two or three days.</p>

               <p>Did any body live in that room? - Yes; two men have been used to come up and down for better than three months; they came about once a fortnight, or three weeks; one was a short thick man, I have seen him often in a working dress, his name is Sam; and I have seen the prisoner come up and down, but I never saw him in a working dress. Sam took the lodging of me; he used to come mostly by himself; I never saw him and the short thick man together; the prisoner used to come by chance by himself, and did not stay long; I have seen him there within the last three months four or five times.</p>

            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner ever live at your house? - I have heard two people talk three or four times in the morning, but I cannot say that he lay there.</p>
               <p>I am to understand you then, upon your oath, you do not know whether this man lodged in your house? - Upon my oath, I do not know that ever he did; but I have heard two people talk in the morning, but who they were I don't know.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110065"></xptr>Did he ever pay you for the lodgings? - Two or three times; but the short man paid me the oftenest.</p>
               <p>You must speak the truth; you have been examined before a magistrate about this; I ask you again, upon the oath you have taken, who paid you for the lodgings the last time you was paid at all? - The last time, Walker paid me.</p>

               <p>There was a short thick man? - Yes; and there was another man in the house; at the time they did lie there, I never saw any harm, they paid me my rent; I cannot pretend to say which was the lodger of the two; the other man was most there.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you might know that this man lodged somewhere else? - No; I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>The shortest man did lie there? - He certainly must lie in the house, he was there continually.</p>
               <p>This man did not take the lodging of you? - No.</p>

               <p>How long before was it that you was paid? - On Saturday morning; and I heard the other man speak to him, as if he meant to borrow the money of him.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. You understood that he came from the other man? - I thought so.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. You was to have appeared the last sessions; the trial was put off because you was not here? - I was at the sign of the Three Sugar Loaves at Putney; a person came for me; I was washing; I had a message, that some reputable gentlemen wanted to speak to me at the Pitt's-Head in Old-street road; I said, my husband was not at home, and I did not chuse to come; a man came up, and liquor was called for in plenty; I not being used to liquor, drank too much; they carried me to Putney, and there I was from the Tuesday night till the Monday following; I had not a halfpenny to pay for a boat or a coach to come home in.</p>
               <p>COUNSEL. Then these reputable people, whoever they wree, kept you from the Tuesday in one week to the Monday in the next, at the Three Sugar Loaves at Putney.</p>

               <p>Now, I ask you upon your oath, who lodged in that two pair of stairs room? - There were two men; one was called Walker, and the other's name was Sam; they both used to be in the room; what their occupation was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner, and tell me whether that is the Walker you mean? - To the best of my knowledge that is the man.</p>

               <p>Did they ever lie there together? - That I cannot justly say; Walker was but very seldom there, but Sam was there almost every day.</p>
               <p>Who used to pay you the rent? - Sometimes Walker and sometimes Sam; one paid it one time, another another time.</p>

               <p>Were you used to come home pretty early in the evening? - I most commonly left work between eight and nine at night in summer, and worked as long as I could see in winter.</p>
               <p>Did you use to carry the candle up to bed yourself, or any body light you? - One time in particular, we were both drunk, a woman lit us up.</p>
               <p>Did not the woman use to light you both up? - Not very often.</p>
               <p>You used in general to be sober enough to carry the candle to go up to bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And sober enough to put it out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you was not used to be waited upon, to have a maid carry the candle up and fetch it down again? - No.</p>
               <p>Sometimes I suppose Walker would be in bed before you, and sometimes you before Walker? - That was but seldom, we commonly went together.</p>
               <p>When you went together, which used to carry the candle, you or Walker?  - Sometimes the one, sometimes the other.</p>
               <p>And you were both quiet sober men, there was no danger of setting the house on fire; you used to put the candle out regularly? - I was always thought so.</p>
               <p>And you used to put the candle out yourself? - Yes.</p>

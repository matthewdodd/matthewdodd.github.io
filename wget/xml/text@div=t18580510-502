                  </hi>. I am a hosier, of No. 21, Royal Exchange. On Saturday afternoon, 10th April; the prisoners came, and Little asked me to show him some silk neck handkerchiefs—I did so; he said that they were not exactly what he wanted—among them was one of blue gauze silk; he opened that, spread it out over the other goods, and said something to Wheelan which I could not hear—he then said, "I want something of the half-mourning sort, with a sprig or a spot upon it—my assistant went to the front of the counter, and accused Wheelan of having some handkerchiefs under his coat—Little immediately ran out of the shop, and I laid hold of Wheelan by the collar—after a short time, Little was brought back, and I asked him what he ran away for; he said that he was in a hurry to see Mr. Jones—they were taken to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to the last witness. I remember the prisoners coming—Wheelan had this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on his left arm; Little spread a blue gauze handkerchief, which is here, over the handkerchiefs on the counter, so that Mr. Goddard could not see what was going on under<lb></lb>neath—somecommunication then passed between the two prisoners, and Wheelan held the coat up which was on his arm, put his hand under the counter, dropped the gauze handkerchief with his other hand, and I distinctly saw one of the handkerchiefs in his hand—they then wanted to see some more handkerchiefs, but I went and accused him of having some under his coat; I wished to examine his coat, but he refused to let me—while we were struggling, Little ran out; I went out after him, and lost sight of him—while we were struggling, Wheelan must have dropped the handkerchief again among the others, because I distinctly saw him take it, and he tucked the tail of the coat underneath, so that it should not be seen.</p>

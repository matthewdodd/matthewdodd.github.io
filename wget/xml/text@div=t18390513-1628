                  </hi>. I live in Duke-street, Chelsea. The prisoner was in my employ—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week to go on errands for me. On Monday, the 13th of May, about eight o'clock in the morning, I sent him with a receipt to Mr. Crabb to receive 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he never returned—I was not to give him any thing for his trouble—I gave him a good breakfast before he went away—I was in the habit of giving him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week and a break<lb></lb>fast every other morning—he was in my regular employ for any errands I had—he was an inmate of the workhouse, and I am the steeple-keeper of the Church—he was employed to take care of one of the gates of the churchyard—the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week was for him to bring me orders every morn<lb></lb>ing what I was to do—I receive 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for ringing bells on ringing days—there arc ten of us, but I pay the money, and I sent him with a receipt to Mr. Crabb for it—he did not come back at twelve o'clock, and I sent my ser<lb></lb>vant to Mr. Crabb—in consequence of the message she brought me I in<lb></lb>formed the police, and about seven o'clock in the evening I found the pri<lb></lb>soner at the station-house quite tipsy—he said he would not give me the money he had left—all the money but 11 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on him—he had a sovereign tied in the corner of a handkerchief in his hat, and the silver in his pocket—I never employed him to receive money before.</p>

I went in search of the prisoner, and found him at a public-house in King's-road—I followed him into a house in Collingwood-street, and said, "Your name is Whitear?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "You have received a bill for Mr. Simmons"—he said he had received the money and spent, he believed, about half of it,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Sloane-street. I am churchwarden of St. Luke, Chelsea. On the 13th of May the prisoner brought a receipt—I gave him a sovereign, two half-crowns, and a shilling, for Simmons, the steeple-keeper—he is employed by me as a gate-keeper—he is not under the control of Simmons, but was taken off his duty to do this—he bore a very good character.</p>

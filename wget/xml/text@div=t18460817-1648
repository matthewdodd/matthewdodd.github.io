                  </hi>. I am an oil and colourman, and live at Bevoir-terrace, Vauxhall-road. On the 1st of Sept., between four and five o'clock, the pri<lb></lb>soner Kean came and asked if I made up colours—he handed me his card—he said he wanted a considerable quantity of paints, and that he had several houses-if I could supply him for ready money, at the lowest prices, he would give me another order—he ordered some whiting and size, and a quantity of other articles—he said I was to send them directly—I took them to No. 1, Trelick-terrace, and saw Mr. Keal, as the prisoner then called himself—he said he had no money in his pocket, and told me if I brought some more things there would be some money directly—I made up all the other articles on the following day; and the prisoner Huggard came to me and said, "Are not you making up some things for Mr. Keal?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Send them in directly, the gentleman is waiting"—a man then came for a pot of green paint, and told me to bring the other things—I sent them one after another, as quickly as 1 could—I took them myself to Kean—he promised to come and pay me for them at my shop—on the third morning he came and wanted some shoe-brushes—he asked me if I had made up the bill—I said I had—he took the brushes away, and told me to add them to the bill—I did so—he does not live in the house now—I have never seen him there since-neither he nor Huggard ever came to my shop again.</p>

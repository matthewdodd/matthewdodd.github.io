               <p>I am a waggoner to Mrs. Moore. I drive from Horton-mills to Barnaby-street. Upon the 15th of August, the two prisoners met me at Kensington, and asked me to give them a lift to Brentford. I took them up. When we came to the Pack-horse, on Turnham-green, they gave me part of two pots of beer. Soon after I went from that house, about 300 yards, I fell off the shafts, and fell under the wheel. I was very badly bruised, and insensible for two or three days after. When I was in St. George's fields, I saw the skins in the hamper, on the top of the waggon, and twenty-five shillings worth of halfpence. The skins and the halfpence were lost out of the hamper. After the accident, I was put on the top of the waggon, and carried home.</p>

He told me his father was a leather-dresser, and had sent him them out of the country. I measured him for a pair of breeches, and he went away. I saw him before the magistrate, and knew him again.</p>

               <p>I am a broker, at No. 17, in Long-lane, West-Smithfield. On the 15th of August,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120049"></xptr> I was at the Red-lion, in Piccadilly, between two and three o'clock. I saw the man in green (Jones) there. A countryman came in with three skins, which he said he had to sell. The prisoner asked him the price. He said he had them from his father, in the country: he said the price was 9 s. The prisoner said he would give him 7 s. if the breeches-maker would say they would make him a pair of breeches; and they went out together.</p>
               <p>To Bocock. What is the value of the skins? - About twenty shillings, or a guinea.</p>
               <p>Court to Morgan. What was you doing at the Red-lion? - Drinking a pint of beer. I had been at a bull-baiting at Putney. The prisoner was there before me.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - I had seen him before.</p>
               <p>Were you drinking together? - No; he sat in another box.</p>
               <p>How long before the countryman came in? - Not long; for I was not there above a quarter of an hour myself.</p>
               <p>Was any other person present? - I saw nobody else present, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>You were alone? - Yes; I was alone, and the prisoner was alone.</p>
               <p>And the countryman came in alone? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you three the only persons in the tap-room? - No; there were more people in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Did you see the skins? - I saw skins; I did not take notice of them.</p>
               <p>How did the conversation begin? - He said he had some skins sent him out of the country, which he must sell, because he wanted money.</p>
               <p>Who did he say that to? - To the company, not to any body in particular. The prisoner asked the price of them.</p>
               <p>From the Jury. How came you to be found out, to become a witness? - The prisoner know'd something of me, and desired me to come.</p>
               <p>Did he know your name? - I gave him my name. He pretended he had some stockings. I wanted some stockings. He had none with him that suited me. I told him I lived at No. 17, in Long-lane.</p>
               <p>Did he give you his name? - No; I did not ask him his name.</p>
               <p>To Green. Did the two prisoners come to you both together, or first one, and then the other? - Jones asked me first; then they both came together in company. Jones came first round the waggon. I did not see Rigby till they asked me to let them get up.</p>

             came in with me: we went to the bar, and had half a pint of liquor.</p>
               <p>You told me you and the two young women came in together, and that then the three young men came in? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. How old was you that day? - Twenty-one.</p>
               <p>After the young men, and those other young women came in, they all joined company together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you dine there? - No. Up stairs in my own room where I lived, we had the dinner brought from that house.</p>
               <p>You entertained these people on your birthday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you give them? - A roast leg of lamb, and French beans.</p>
               <p>Any thing else? - No; not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Had you no pye or pudding? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you give them to drink after dinner? - Only beer: I could not afford any thing else.</p>
               <p>How long did they stay after dinner? - The prisoner went out soon after twelve, as soon as he had eat his victuals; he had it on a piece of bread; he went away directly. All the others staid till between two and three o'clock in the afternoon; then they went away together, and left me at home.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was in a hurry, and went away at twelve? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him to stay, and have some beer after dinner? - He drank out of one pot of beer before he went.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him to stay longer? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor why he was in such a hurry? - No. It was no business of mine.</p>
               <p>Yes, if you asked company to keep your birth-day. - I did not ask him, I asked Ellis.</p>
               <p>This was one of the young women in company? - No. The landlady of the public house.</p>

               <p>My husband keeps the Roebuck, in Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner Rigby? - Yes. Upon the 15th of August, between the hours of nine and twelve, he came with two young men - at about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>How long did he remain in your house? - Very few minutes; while they drank half a pint of gin, and called for another half pint, and I draw'd it.</p>
               <p>Did he come in at any other time after that? - I did not observe any thing that passed after that.</p>
               <p>Was he there at twelve o'clock? - I can't say: I should not have observed it then, had not these young men been with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Who came in company with him? - Two young fellows that had been fixed, and imprisoned twelve months, and were that day released.</p>
               <p>Were any others in company with them? - A young woman that has been examined,

            ; she came in with Rigby and those young fellows.</p>
               <p>Do you know her very well? - Yes; they came with these two young fellows, and another young woman with them.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether they all five came in together, or came separately? - I could not say positively: I asked them to eat a crust of bread and cheese; she was then with them: I brought out the bread and cheese; they said they did not chuse any.</p>
               <p>Was there any more in company than those five? - I believe there was a gentlewoman in a black cloak, and laced bonnet; I did not take particular notice of her: there were three men, and three women.</p>
               <p>How came you not to mention the second woman, if she was in the company that came with Sharpe? - I did not know her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120051"></xptr>Did you know the other young woman? - Her name was Strickling.</p>
               <p>Did they come in with the young men, or did the young men come in before them? - I can't say: they drank the gin together; the two young men came together with Rigby, as near as I can say, between nine and ten.</p>
               <p>Did the three young women come in with them, or come in afterwards? - I could not recollect whether the young men came in first, or the young women, or whether they came in together.</p>
               <p>How long did they all stay? - Not more, I believe, than five minutes; no longer than while I served them; the young men and young women went away together.</p>
               <p>And that was in a few minutes, and you saw nothing of them afterwards? - I could not positively say: I have a young family: I was backwards in my own kitchen; afterwards in the bar at times.</p>
               <p>Did they come back and dine at your house? - That I could not positively say, for I am never present at dinner; my husband is generally in the way; I could not see what passed.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect their ordering dinner? - The young fellows had a leg of mutton, or leg of lamb, roasted at my house, but they did not dine at my house; it was carried home to their place of abode; I suppose, about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Where was it sent to? - One of the young women fetched it.</p>
               <p>What young woman? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What time was it ready? - A few minutes, I believe, past two o'clock.</p>
               <p>You don't know the young woman that fetched it? - Not particularly; I have a young family to attend.</p>
               <p>Were there any potatoes to it? - There was no garden-stuff of any kind dressed at my house.</p>
               <p>Were there no potatoes? - No: they said they had French beans, as far as I can remember, at home.</p>
               <p>Where was that home, where they had the French beans? - I forget the name of the court.</p>
               <p>At whose lodgings? - The young woman, Strickling's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Recollect, if you can, the name of the court? - I could not recollect the court.</p>
               <p>Do you know Strickling very well? - I know her by sight.</p>
               <p>At her lodgings they dined? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They had French beans there? - They said they had French beans there, in the morning, when they brought the lamb.</p>
               <p>Who paid you for this meat? - Nobody. They brought it to be roasted; they said the French beans they would do themselves.</p>
               <p>Who brought it? - The young woman I mentioned.</p>

               <p>Was you paid any thing for the dressing of it? - No.</p>
               <p>Had they their beer from your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And their punch? - They had no punch from our house.</p>
               <p>Who paid for what they had from your house? - This young woman, called Strickling.</p>
               <p>On what occasion was it they dined at Strickling's lodgings? - I can't tell: I asked them no questions.</p>

               <p>I keep a green-stall. Upon the 15th of August, I was coming home from market, with a load of goods on my head; Rigby and another person, were standing at the Roebuck door: I asked them to help me down with my load; the prisoner readily came and helped me down, then he went away: that was about ten o'clock; two other persons were with him: I went to my own apartment.</p>
               <p>Did they help you up again? - No. It was at my own apartment, three doors from the Roebuck.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner, after he helped you with the load? - Yes: I came in and out at the door, and saw the prisoner at the place where I asked him to help me down.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you lost him, so as to see him no more? - About twelve o'clock: I had a bit of a luncheon; I went into the Roebuck, and he and his wife were at dinner together, and two more men; but I can't say who they were.</p>

On Tuesday, the 14th of Sept., between seven and eight in the evening, I went with Thain and Russell to Bishopsgate-street Within—I saw the prisoners Madden and Griffith come out of the warehouse of the Mr. Silver of No. 4 1/2, Bishopagate-street—they went to the Marlboro' Head public-house—Griffith had a small paper parcel, partly concealed under his coat—he went to the public-house—in about ten minutes Colmer joined them, and about eight o'clock Jacobs joined them, and they all four sat in a box together—they were talking and drinking together—they all four came out together—Jacobs went towards Shoreditch church, Russell followed him, and I followed the other three as far as Farringdon-street—they were walking and talking together—Colmer there left the other two—we followed Griffith and Madden down Fleet-street to the Strand—they turned down Clement's-inn to New Inn-passage, which is rather dark—they stopped there, and I saw Madden take something from his coat-pocket, and give to Griffith, who kneeled down and untied a blue bundle which he had been carrying from the public-house—I passed by him, and saw a brown paper parcel in the blue handkerchief, and as I passed I distinctly saw a piece of cloth lying on the brown paper parcel—the parcel was then tied up in the handkerchief—they then separated—Griffith went with the bindle to Mr. Spencer's, in Stanhope-street, Clare-market, and Madden went to a small street opposite Spencer's shop—I looked through Spencer's window, and saw Griffith untying the parcel—I went into the shop, took possession of it, and now produce it—I asked Griffith where he had brought the cloth from—he made no answer—I</p>

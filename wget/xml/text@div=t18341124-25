                  </hi>. I am the son of James Muir, calenderer, of Long's-buildings, Whitecross-street. On the night of the 27th of October, I was in Whitecross-street, at half-past eight o'clock—some music was playing—I saw the prisoners standing by my side in company—Ashton had his arm on Turner's shoulder—Ashton snatched my cap off my head, and handed it to Turner—they had not been playing with me—there were five boys by at the time—Ashton ran away—Turner passed the cap to one of the other boys, and they all ran away—I met a policeman, went with him into an alley, pointed out the prisoners, and he took them—I had seen them often before—when I lost my cap, their faces were smeared with red ochre, and so they were when the policeman took them, which was in about ten minutes—when Ashton took my cap, I went to him and told him he had got my cap—he said it would hit me in my b—y mouth if I said so—they did not know me—I had never spoken to them.</p>

On the night of the 27th of Oc<lb></lb>tober, the prosecutor came to me, and pointed out the prisoners in Chequer-alley—their faces were smeared with red ochre—the cap was brought to the station-house that evening by a woman, who is not here.</p>

               <p>(The prisoners put in a written defence, stating, that several boys were pulling off each other's caps, but that they had not joined in the play, and declaring their innocence.)</p>

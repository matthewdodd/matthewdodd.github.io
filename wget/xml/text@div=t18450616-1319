                  </hi>. I keep the Duke of York public-house, in York-street, Stepney; the prisoner was my bar-man for about fifteen months, up to June; I had not suspected him up to that time. On Monday night,</p>

               <p>the 26th of May, I saw a shilling in a hole by the side of the till, and left it there—I saw it there again on Tuesday morning—I did not do anything with it, but on that morning, I marked two shillings that I found there—the prisoner had no occasion to put my money there instead of into the till, nor to put it there from the till—I marked two shillings on the Friday morning, and I marked 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—on the Sunday, at half-past three o'clock, I gave him into custody of the police—I was present when he was searched—a sixpence marked Z, and two marked shillings, were found on him—I after<lb></lb>wards saw the policeman examine his box, and a bag was produced with sone money in it—I found four shillings there marked—this sixpence and two shillings (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) are part of those I found on the ledge, and marked in the way I have described—these are the four shillings found in the bag—they are all marked—I will swear these are the marks I put upon them.</p>

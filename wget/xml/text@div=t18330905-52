               <p>Prisoner. I was coming from Piccadilly and I asked the servant of this house if I could go backwards; she said "Were you not here last week," I said "No, I never was in the house before;" she said, "Come in and talk to my mistress;" she then said, that I had been to the house with a gentleman, and she had shown him into the front room up stairs, for which she asked 2s., which he refused to pay; and she had shown him to the back room which was 1s. - she said she could swear to my make, but not my face; I never was in the house before - I ran out; she cried, "Thief, thief, thief," and I was taken.</p>
               <p>Witness. I knew her, and she had been in the habit of coming to the house frequently; I am certain of it, but I did know her name.</p>

             (police-constable L 38). I met the prosecutor on the 8th of August, and in consequence of what he said, I looked after the prisoner for three or four nights running, but I did not find her till the 17th - I charged her on suspicion; she denied all knowledge of the robbery; she told me where she lodged, and gave me the key of her door - I went there on the 19th, which was Monday morning; I found a duplicate of a watch in a tea-cup on the mantel-piece; I searched further, and in a work-box, I found this seal, and four watch-papers - I went to the pawnbroker and found this watch; the prisoner gave her residence at No. 4, Princes-court, Commercial-road.</p>

            . I am shopman to a pawnbroker in York-row, Kennington-road. This watch was pawned by a woman on the 9th of August - I cannot say who pawned it, but I remember seeing the prisoner in the shop about the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said at the office that it was at eight o'clock at night, but it was eight o'clock in the morning. Witness. I stated that to the best of my recollection it was between six and seven o'clock in the evening.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. It was in the morning; I go out charing; I was cleaning a person's room, who said to me, "What is the matter;" I said, "I have six dresses in pawn, and if I could get them out, I could make double the money of them" - she said she would give me her husband's watch to pawn, which I did; her name is Turner - I got my dresses out, and brought the duplicate of the watch to her; in a few days afterwards she said to me, "My husband died abroad, and I want to go abroad, if you can sell the duplicate of this watch for me, I should be much obliged to you;" I said, I would inquire of my friends - I had been out at work on the Saturday, and on returning home through<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050036"></xptr>Long-acre, I called at the house, and was accused of having been there with the gentleman, which I had not.</p>

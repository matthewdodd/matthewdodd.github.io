                  </hi>. I am a plater and brass-founder, and lived with the pri<lb></lb>soner in Nag's Head-court—I worked in Wylde-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields. On Thursday, the 22nd of June, I told the prisoner to come to the shop about one o'clock—she came about one, and asked for some money—she had had a little to drink—I did not give her any money, and she went away—I saw her next in the street, and she said she wanted some money—we had a few words, and I gave her in charge—I afterwards went to work, and she came to me again about an hour afterwards, a little the worse for liquor—she asked me if I was going to give her any money—I said, "Not yet," if she would wait a bit she should have some—we had a few words—she had a knife in her hand, which I worked with in my business, and in her passion she ran it into my side—I kicked her about three times till she fainted away—in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards I fetched a policeman, be<lb></lb>cause they were going to give me in charge for kicking her, and she was locked up—I found I was stabbed a little—it was about an inch deep—I had a bit of sticking-plaister put to it—the gentleman laughed at it, and said there was nothing the matter with it—I do not remember swearing that I had it "dressed"—this is the knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical student, and acted as dresser at the King's Hospital. In June last, in the afternoon, the prosecutor came there—I found a wound about midway between the crest of the ilium and the frontal ribs on the left side, about half an inch long, and an inch deep—I did not consider it dangerous—it appeared to have been inflicted with a knife—if it had gone two inches it would have penetrated the abdomen, and might have killed him.</p>

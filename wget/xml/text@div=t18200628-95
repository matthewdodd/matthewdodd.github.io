            . I am a constable of Clerkenwell. On Thursday, the 8th of June, about eight o'clock in the evening, I found the prisoners, and two others in company, coming up Bagnigge Wells-road, and coming across the fields. I followed them - Kirkman had the jacket with the trowels under his arm; and the one who ran away had another bundle under his arm. Griffiths was in company with Kirkman. When I came up to the Small-pox Hospital, I stopped Kirkman, and asked what he had there - he said they were his brother's tools which he had brought from the building. I asked where his brother worked - he said he would show me; when he turned round to go, he said, No, they were not his brother's, but that Dunn gave them him to carry. I said I should take him into custody. Griffiths walked away - I made no charge against him as I knew where he lived - I took him at his mother's door.</p>

             together on Thursday evening, a little before eight o'clock. He asked if I wanted to buy any plasterer's tools - said he had found some in a field, but he thought they had been stolen, and he took and hid them again. They asked if I would come and see them. Kirkman was standing by when I met them, and he asked if he should come and see them - they went and fetched them, and brought them to us. They told us to wait at the end of the field by Bagnigge-Wells, and they would fetch them. They showed them to us in that field, which is about a quarter of a mile from Harrison-street. When I saw them, I said they did not suit me, that my master found me in tools, and that I did not want to buy them. I have known Kirkman eight or nine years, and know Griffiths also - they live in the same neighbourhood. Kirkman carried the tools, and they asked me to carry the brushes for them, which I did, and gave them to Griffiths again, when we came into Weston-street, where he lived. I do not know what has become of them. I gave them to him before he came to his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280049"></xptr>mother's door.

I left Taylor with Kirkman while I ran after Vanderval, who ran away with something under his arm - it appeared to be some planes - he got away.

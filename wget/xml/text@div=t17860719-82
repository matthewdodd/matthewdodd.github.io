            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What relation was she to the prisoner and to Mrs. Hawkins? - Sister to them both.</p>
               <p>Give us an account if you can by what means the deceased came to her death? - I know nothing at all of it, I was gone of an errand.</p>
               <p>What day did she die? - The third of June.</p>
               <p>Tell us what happened when you came home? - I heard that Mrs. Ham was dead.</p>
               <p>What did you see yourself? - I saw her laying dead.</p>
               <p>Did she appear to have any marks of violence upon her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What? - Her throat cut in a violent manner.</p>
               <p>As you have lived servant to the house, in what state had the prisoner been for any time before, did she seem to be in the perfect possession of her understanding and senses? - She had not been sensible for a long time.</p>

               <p>From whence do you recollect that she was not in her right senses for some time before this thing happened? - Better than two months.</p>
               <p>What acts can you give us an account of that she did from which you so collect? - If you asked her a question she would not give you an answer; and if she did give you an answer, it would not be the proper answer but the question we asked her.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect any particular instance of that sort? - If you asked her how she did, she said when she got up she did not like to go to bed, and when she went to bed she did not like to get up.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any thing else particular?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190118"></xptr> - Yes, Sir; on the 30th of May I went up stairs to her apartment to ask her whether she would have any beer, and she sat with her hands before her, and never made me any answer, but looked very wild at me indeed, I asked her again, and she made me no answer; I was very much frightened; I turned round under a pretence to buckle my shoe because she should not see that I was frightened.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was she alone then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What did she say or do? - I turned round, because I thought if she thought I was frightened she would break out; she said nothing, but kept her eyes fixed, and looked very wild.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any other instance of her talking wildly? - Yes, Sir; she told me several times she would haunt me.</p>
               <p>How long was that before? - It was about a month.</p>
               <p>Then before the time that this accident happened, from all that you saw of her you took her not to be in her right mind? - I am sure she was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Counsel. I believe she complained once that you had been pelting her? - The deceased told me so, she was up in her room when she said that, and the deceased with her, and I below stairs, doing my work, and she said to the deceased, there is Nanny now a pelting of me.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ham was her sister? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they live in harmony? - They lived very happy ever since I have been there.</p>
               <p>I believe you was going away, you was so frightened? - I gave my mistress, Mrs. Hawkins, warning a fortnight before this accident happened, and she asked me why; I said, Madam, I beg your pardon, I hope no offence, but you know Mrs. Hughes, and I am afraid she should break out; I have seen her pick the skin off of her lips till the blood has run down over her chin.</p>
               <p>You had no other objection to your place? - No, Sir, no other; I was used very well, I have been there almost four years.</p>

               <p>How near do you live to the house where the deceased lived? - About twenty-five yards.</p>
               <p>Tell us what you know about the deceased's death? - I know very little about it; I was sitting at the door, at No 11. in Pater-noster-row, on half a hundred of potatoes; I was looking over towards Mrs. Ham's door, and I saw the sister hanging some meat out, I think her name was Hawkins, as she was hanging the meat out I heard something fall, I judged within myself it might be a sheep or lamb, Mrs. Hawkins cried out and knocked against the door with a knocker, and I thought it was remarkably odd; I crossed the street, and went in behind, and I said Mrs. Hawkins what is the matter; indeed Sir, says she, I do not know, but I am afraid there is a good deal the matter; says I, pray who is in the house, you have no thieves I hope; she tried to open the door of the back room, and she could not, she looked between the wainscot, and I looked over the glass, and I saw nothing but a little child sitting, and Mrs. Hawkins dropped down on her knees, the bottom pannell of the door was split from top to bottom, and I whipped my foot against the pannell and opened the door the value of an inch and a half, and I saw the breast of a woman covered with blood, with a black petticoat on; then I said to the man that lives at next door, for God's sake, Mr. Morgan, break the door open, I had not power, I was so frightened, then I came out of the shop; when the door was broke open I did not see into the back room, I only saw her lay, and I shoved her clothes to get into the room, I came away immediately, I did not see the wound.</p>
               <p>Was you often in the family? - I used frequently to be backwards and forwards, and joking with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190119"></xptr>Did you ever see any thing particular in the prisoner? - The prisoner has always had a remarkable wild look.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that she had such a kind of look as caused a doubt in your mind that she was not right in her mind? - I really thought she was not right in her mind.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you ever heard any of the neighbours say that there was any thing the matter with her? - I have heard the servant maid should say that her mistress had been very wild at different times before this thing happened, I believe a week.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you seen much of her the last two months before the accident? - I cannot say I had, but I saw her the Monday before, going into a green stall, with the same wildness, much in the same form as I have always observed.</p>
               <p>Who told you that the maid was going to leave her place on account of it? - I heard of it, but do not know who told me; I was informed that she was gone away.</p>
               <p>You know so little of the family that you did not know whether the girl was gone or not? - No, I did not mind the girl.</p>

               <p>I live next door; on Saturday the third of June, about nine, I was standing at the shop door, and I heard the sister cry out, and I went in to know what was the matter; hearing her in such distress of mind, I said, good God.! Mrs. Hawkins, what is the matter? she cried out, Betsey! Betsey! I looked through the window that looked into the room behind the shop, and I saw a little child sitting; I said there is nothing the matter with the child; I thought she meant the child Betsey; she was trying to get the door open; I went to the door and forced it open, and there I saw the body of Mrs. Ham dead; her throat was cut; Mrs. Hawkins desired I would send for a surgeon; I said I thought a surgeon would be of no service, for she was was quite dead; then she sent me for Mr. Hawkins; when I came back there was a great bustle about the place, and they got the body up stairs; but how she came by her death I know not; then after some time there was a rumour spread about, that there was a woman got out of the one pair of stairs window backwards, and was gone into an adjoining back place; and I and another neighbour got over out of my yard into this place to look for the person that was got out of the window, and we found in this place the prisoner Hughes.</p>
               <p>In what situation did you find her? - I believe she was sitting; she was in a kind of a shut up place that there is under the stairs in the slaughter-house; we asked her to come out, which she did; I asked her how she came to do such a thing as to kill her sister (supposing she had done it) and she seemed all of a tremble and twitter; she did utter some words; but I cannot be positive what they were, after she was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Have you been pretty much in the family to see much of the prisoner? - I have lived in the neighbourhood but a few months before, but I had often spoke with her.</p>
               <p>Had you made any such observation of the prisoner as might enable you to judge of her state of mind, whether she was sane or not? - Upon my word I can say nothing to that; I was once with Mr. Hawkins, and he said he thought his sister Hughes was in a very bad way; I said I was very sorry for it; but not knowing any thing of it, I did not enquire what way; I thought she might be going in a decline; she had bought things of me; I sell physical herbs; she had bought two or three times a pennyworth of valerian root to make tea, which is reckoned a very good thing for the nerves and lowness of spirits.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you forced open the door and saw the deceased did you see the prisoner? - No, nobody but the deceased and the child.</p>

               <p>I was going round Spital-fields market about nine, on the 3d of June, at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178607190120"></xptr> end of the street, and I saw several people run over to Mrs. Ham's, and I run, and went into the room where the deceased lay, and her sister Mrs. Hawkins was holding her up on the floor with her back towards her lap, and I said good God! Sally how came this done? did she do it herself? Mrs. Hughes was with her, and I said, do your think she did it herself? and she said no, it is Mrs. Hughes has done it, and nobody else, and God send she had not left them together; Mrs. Hawkins kept crying out for the doctor; I took hold of the chin of the deceased, and held up her head, to look at the wound, and I saw it was desperate, and I said, a doctor will be of no use to her, the body is dead, all the doctors in the land can be of no service; then Mrs. Hawkins said, call Mrs. Hughes down, I went up one pair of stairs, and that was fast, and the two pair was fast, I went into the garret, and looked every where, and out of the garret window, I came down stairs again, and told Mrs. Hawkins, and she desired me to go up stairs again; I did so, and burst open the door of the one pair of stairs; when I came into that room, I looked all round it, and into a little bedroom; I could find nobody; I went up two pair of stairs, and broke that door open, and in the garret I could find nobody; I came down and assisted to lift the dead body up; in moving her we saw the knife lay by her side, and I said, good God! Sally, did she do this thing herself? here is the knife; and she said, good God! so it is: then Mr. Try and Mr. Little came in and the doctor, and he said he could do her no good; then I went out of doors, and there was an alarm given of a woman going out of a one pair of stairs back window, over the tiles, after I had told them of it I came out of doors again, and me and another went into the slaughter-house, through Mr. Morgan's; he was looking over the wall into the back yard, and I jumped over the wall, and Mr. Morgan followed me; I saw a stick in the yard, I took it in my hand, and went round the slaughter-house and found the door on the double lock; it was a spring lock; I said, she is not gone out this way; I went to another little door underneath the stairs, and pulled it open and there I saw her fit under the stairs; and I said, good God, how could you do this wicked deed? the answer she made me was, she did not know, the devil had been very busy with her, and they had had a great many words; I looked at her to see if she had any thing in her hand to do me a mischief, being a dark place; I took hold of her by the hand and said, you must come along with me; Mr. Morgan was behind; she came out immediately; I asked her several questions, but to say what she answered me particularly I cannot; I said, God forgive you to take the life of your flesh and blood; only look at your hands and mine bloody with your sister's blood! whether she said, God forgive me! or what I cannot particularly say; people kept crowding in, and after that Mr. Reeves and I took her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Was you acquainted much with the prisoner before? - No, I was not particularly.</p>
               <p>Had you any sufficient opportunities of making observations of her? - I never heard any thing particular about her before, neither of the neighbours, or of the maid servants; I never asked.</p>

               <p>Was you with the last witness Pike at the time that he went over the slaughter-house? - Yes, I was upon the wall; I jumped over and laid hold of one of her hands and brought her out; she sat down on something in the yard; I stood before her and asked her how she came to do such a wicked deed; her right hand was very bloody just as if the carver had been in it; and the blood had traced from the carver to her apron.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by a carver? - A large knife which the butchers use.</p>

               <p>Well what did she say to your question? - She made no answer, she muttered a little to herself, but what I could not hear; the mob crowded in and we took her away; a little time after that I left her.</p>

               <p>I lived servant just by; I saw the prisoner getting out of window; I thought she was going to clean the window; and I said, Lord have mercy upon me, you will fall down and break your neck; and she got on the tiles, and jumped off.</p>
               <p>How many yards was it high? - I cannot tell; she went into the slaughter-house; I knew her before by sight.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you ever heard the neighbours say that she was out of her mind before this transaction? - Yes, I have.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was absent at the time it happened; I have known the prisoner's family for these forty years; I have known her ever since she was a child; I had recourse to the house daily; I saw the deceased before I went from the shop; I was gone about twenty minutes to Whitechapel; about six weeks before I looked upon the prisoner to be insane; moreover than that, that very day week she desired me to fetch her some water from the pump, which I did, she drank it very eagerly; I said to her sister Mrs. Hawkins, Sally, I do not think Mrs. Hughes ought to be left alone.</p>

               <p>Tell us if you can what particular observations you made that induced you to think she was out of her mind? - By rather being low in spirits some times, and her eyes just ready to burst out of her head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I believe these people lived very loving together? - Yes, Sir, as loving as any family.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the prisoner ever make any strange answer? - No further than what I tell you now; she appeared in that light to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever hear her talk wild, or talk at all? - She did not talk at all; she appeared low in spirits.</p>

               <p>I do not know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Was you in the house at the time? - No, I was at the door hanging the meat up.</p>
               <p>Tell the Court what you heard while you was at the door? - I heard something fall, when I went in I found my sister wounded.</p>
               <p>Did you get into the door without any difficulty? - No, Mr. Morgan pushed the door.</p>
               <p>Was your sister dead at this time? - I believe she was.</p>
               <p>At the time you left your sister who did you leave with her? - None but a little child.</p>
               <p>What age was the child? - Two years old.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Hughes come afterwards in the room? - No, she did not.</p>
               <p>What state of mind had Mrs. Hughes been in before this happened? - In a very bad state.</p>
               <p>For how long a time before? - For some months.</p>
               <p>What do mean by a bad state, do you mean as to her health or to her mind? - She was quite out of her mind.</p>
               <p>Had she given any instances of insanity either in words or in actions? - Very much.</p>
               <p>Tell us some particular instances that occur to you from which you

             that conclusion? - I was going up stairs into my own room about a month before; I heard her groan very much, and beg of the Lord to send peace to her soul; I went into my own room, and I came down stairs into the deceased's room from the prisoner's room, I heard something fall with a great force; I returned back hearing the fall; at my return into the room I found it was the bellows that fell down; I went to Mrs. Hughes and she immediately fell down on her knees; she foamed at the mouth and fell all along; after that I raised her up and put her in a chair; she beat her head against the mantle piece, and tore her hair, and begged of God to send peace to her soul; she afterwards beat herself, and pulled her handkerchief off her neck several times; I put her handkerchief on her neck, she said, she would jump out of the window; she got up on a sudden and took a candle out of a closet, and lighted the candle by a remarkable good fire; I asked her what she was going to do; she said, she was going to light the fire, I told her there was a very good one; she stared and looked very wild and put her hand all over the fire; she stared and I went to put the candle out, and as I put the candle out some of the hot tallow fell on the prisoner's fingers, and she asked me if I wanted to kill her; I said, no.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole from that time to this do you think that she was out of her mind? - Very much so.</p>
               <p>Down to the very time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, you have heard this evidence, what do you think of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. The woman is insane, there is no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Court. I have no doubt myself; I think it is very fit this woman should be taken care of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Mr. Mendez the governor of St. Luke's has got a ticket for her, and has reserved a place for her.</p>

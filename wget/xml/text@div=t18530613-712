                  </hi>. I am a pork-butcher and dealer, residing at Cavendish, Suffolk. On Friday, 3rd June. I packed a hamper containing twelve pieces of meat and four legs of pork—I in closed an invoice of the contents—I consigned it to Mr. Cotterell, meat salesman, of Newgate-market—the weight was 116 lbs.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Cavendish, in Suffolk. On Friday, 3rd June, I fetched a hamper of meat from Isaiah Farrance's house, and took it to the Eastern Counties Railway Station—I delivered it in very good con-dition, and got their signature to it—it had never been disturbed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of the Eastern Counties Railway Company. My duty is to load the vans—it was so on 4th June—I do not recollect the train coming in that morning—-we do not go near the railway-station—I merely went to the market to receive the vans—I recollect the prisoner coming with a van—he went to the market about half-past 3 o'clock—I saw the latter part of the unloading—ten minutes before we finished we parted from the van in different places; and as I was about fifty yards before the centre of the market, I wanted a horsecloth, took it off the seat, and found a leg of pork—unless I had wanted the horsecloth, 1 should not have seen it—I stood in the van, behind the seat; the prisoner was behind the horse's head—I did not speak to him, nor he to me—Mr. Byford was not there—I informed Mr. Benson, our foreman—I took the pork away, and handed it to Mr. Benson—the prisoner said, "What do you want there?"—I said, "I <hi rend="italic">come</hi> for something that Mr. Benson sent me for"—after I found it in the horsecloth, I left it there for about ten minutes, informed</p>

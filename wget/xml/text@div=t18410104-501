                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in Brewer-street, Golden-square. At half-past nine o'clock on the 29th of December, the two prisoners came to look at some brown holland—Perkins bought three-quarters of a yard—after that they both requested to look at some shawls, which the young man showed them—they objected to the pattern—he went to the farther end of the shop and got some more—they did not buy them, but wished to look at some mouseline-de-laines—Perkins purchased one dress, and re<lb></lb>quested</p>

I watched at the window, and saw Perkins with this dress in her hand—in a minute or two I saw her put it under her shawl—shortly after they left the shop—I went to Perkins and said, "You have stolen something from Mr. Roberta's coun<lb></lb>ter," and feeling under her shawl I found this dress.</p>

             sworn. - I am a plaisterer by trade: On the 21st of March, I was at <placeName id="t18040411-60-crimeloc354">the Sun on Addle-hill</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did he tend you the second one? - A. No, I saw another in his hand, he seemed to tremble; I told him I rather supposed he had more, and that I thought it was necessary to send for a constable, and search him; we found upon him two good shillings and two bad ones, a seven-shilling-piece, and two pence in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the bad shilling he tended you? - A. I kept it in my hand till the constable came.</p>
               <p>- PEDDER sworn. - Q. You are the constable, and searched the prisoner? - A. I did; I have got the two bad shillings here. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. (To White.) From whom did you receive that shilling at Mr. Barnard's? - A. From the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of those two shillings was tendered to you? - A. That is the shilling I took of the prisoner, (shewing them); and that is the one I took out of his hand; he had two good ones in his hand to pay if he chused.</p>
               <p>- HICKS sworn. - Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. About two or three years; I only know that he was in the habit of passing it, he has been in confinement for the same.</p>
               <p>- PARKER sworn. - Q. Look at these two shillings? - A. They are both counterfeited: they appear to be new coloured, they have not been in circulation since they have been coloured.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I went into this man's house I pulled out the silver, and a seven-shilling-piece, I called for a glass of pepper-mint; his wife that served at the bar, I gave her the shilling; she handed that over to the publican, and said, this here is a bad one; I would have given them the money I had in my hand to have changed, I had a seven-shilling-piece in my hand; that is the truth.</p>
               <p>White. My sister was not in the bar.</p>

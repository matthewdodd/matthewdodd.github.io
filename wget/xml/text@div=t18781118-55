                  </hi>. I am a barrister, and live at Morton Road, Forest Hill—on 1ST September I left the house unoccupied, and secured all the doors inside and out—the room where the jewellery was placed was locked up—I returned on the 5th and found everything safe—I went again on the 12th with my wife and her mother, and found the house broken open—this key is not mine.</p>

I wag staying in the next house to Mr. Clark's, and on September 11th about 10 a.m., I was at the closed front Window, and saw two men go by—one of them looked very hard at me, and then looked at the other man and nodded—the prisoner is the man who nodded—between 3 and 4 on the same afternoon I was at the side window on the landing which was open, and saw Mr. Clark come home, and shortly afterwards saw two men run up the prosecutor's garden, one of whom I recognised as one of those I saw in the morning—the prisoner is the man—I gave a description of him, and picked him out from eight men who I saw at the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant M</hi>). In consequence of information I received I took the prisoner on 27th September, in Newington, and I told him I should take him for being concerned with another man in breaking And entering a gentleman's house at Lewisham—he said, "I know nothing of it"—I took him to Stones End Station, placed him with eight or nine more—Sarah Bailey was shown in, but without me—I afterwards searched the prisoner and found four little keys on him—he gave his name George Roberts, but no address—I said, "You have been charged at Kennington Road Station in the name of McCaul, with robbing a woman and having skeleton keys upon you, and it is no use your giving the name of Roberts now, "and he said "Quite right."</p>

I have been a detective not quite six months—I do not know whether they put me up for my intelligence—I have studied the late Inspector Brennan a good deal, but never saw him—as far as I know the prisoner was living with a woman named McCaul, and there was a squabble between them at the police-court—four of these keys were found on him And one at Mr. Clark's house, but when he was charged at our place there were five keys on one bunch—the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> was found at Mr. Clark's house—it</p>

I am a hatter, of 178, Old Montague Street, White<lb></lb>chapel—on Thursday night, 3rd May, I went to bed at 12.30—I had shut and fastened up the house—about 5 a.m. I had occasion to go downstairs, and found that the window of the back door had been broken and an entrance effected—I missed three coats, a cloak, a shawl, and tablecloth, which I had seen safe before I went to bed—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them this coat belongs to Mr. Cohen, a lodger.</p>

About 3 a.m. on 4th May, I was on duty in Chicksand-Street, and saw the prisoner; he was carrying one of these coats on his arm and wearing the other—I stopped him and asked where he got them from—he said he had brought them from his brother's, in Gun Lane, Limehouse—not feeling satisfied I took him to the station, and there found on him several books and small things, and this tablecloth concealed in his trousers—where I stopped him was about 3 or 4 miles from Limehouse and about of a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>

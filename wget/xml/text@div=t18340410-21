             (police-constable N 170). I saw the prisoner on the 25th of March, by the canal in Kingsland-road - I asked him what he had got in his bundle - he said two candlesticks which he got of his sister, pointing towards Haggerstone, but he did not know the street - I took him to the station - he there pulled out another candlestick from his bosom - he then said his sister lived in the New North-road - I took him there - I found a person there of his name, but no relation - I made inquiry, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100025"></xptr>found these two candlesticks had been taken from the prosecutor at Haggerstone.</p>

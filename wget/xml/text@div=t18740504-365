                  </hi>. I am tune-keeper to Messrs. Siemens Brothers, tele<lb></lb>graph engineers, of Charlton, employing 3,000 men—the prisoner was an assistant time-keeper in my office—it was his duty to assist me in booking the workmen's time in or out—when a man is engaged he is furnished with a brass ticket with a number on it, and when he comes to work, his duty is to deposit that ticket in a box kept at the gate—6 o'clock is the usual time for the men to come to work, and these brass tickets are collected at a little after 6 o'clock and hung on hooks corresponding with their numbers, after depositing them on a table and booking them—the men take away the tickets when they go to their meals, and when they go home at night—the same course exactly is repeated when they return from meals—when a man leaves the employment his duty is to deliver his brass ticket into my office—if lost, it is paid for—when given up it would serve for another man who subsequently came into the employment—ticket No. 549 belonged to a man named Daniels, who left the factory on 31st January, 1874—I am looking at the memorandum in the writing of Foster, my assistant, who is here; this other book is in my writing, and they were both kept under my inspection—the name of "Kennington" appears first on 11th February, 1874, and it is in the prisoner's writing—ticket 579 belonged to Marshall, who was discharged on 25th February, and it is entered to "Thomas" on the same day in the prisoner's writing—ticket 589 belonged to Etherington who left on 12th December, 1873, and the name of "Bailey" is entered by the prisoner on 19th February—I am looking at my time book which is kept by me—Hunt, who held ticket 2,227. was to have been transferred from the wire to the cable department, but he was not transferred—he was</p>

               <p>supposed to have been transferred on 18th February, and the writing is the boy Butcher's, but the time is put in by the prisoner—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the paper upon which his name was originally entered, it is in one of the clerk's writing—ticket 2,300 is first entered on 18th February, 1874, that belonged to no one; it is in the prisoner's writing, and the name of Arm<lb></lb>strong is entered—ticket 2,397 belonged to a man named Crew, who was placed on the sick list on 21st February, and yet his name continues on till the week ending 4th March—this book is kept under my inspection; my night relieving man sees that it is right—I mark them and fill in the time, and leave the book there at night—I do not keep the book entirely but I and my assistants do—I correct it, and my night assistant gives me. a list in the morning, if there is any error—ticket 285 belonged to a man named Pointer, who was discharged on 3rd February, and on 6th February it is entered by the prisoner to a man named Wright—ticket 2,060 belonged to a man named Owen, who was discharged on 28th January, and the name of Johnson appears to that number in the prisoner's writing on 4th Febru<lb></lb>ary—all those numbers appear carried on with time and rate attached up to the week ending 11th March—after they are once entered they are carried on by the boy—when once the brass ticket appears upon the book, anyone can enter it except the boy—I don't allow him to do it—the pre<lb></lb>sence of the brass ticket indicates its owner's absence—I hare made enquiries for Kennington, Thomas, Bailey, Johnson, and Wright, but none of them have appeared—the prisoner as assistant time-keeper had access to those brass tickets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner has been in the employment probably six months—I always believed his parents to be respectable, or he would not have been in our employ—when a man left he would give his ticket up to me or to one of my three assistants, who are not boys—Mr. Claverhouse and Mr. Cook are two of them—one workmen could not work two tickets because there must be another name entered in the book—I am respon<lb></lb>sible for the book—this is it, and this is a copy giving the explanation of every mark—this is a short way of booking the time—this straight mark means from 6 to 8 o'clock, this "0" means not present, this means "after breakfast," this "after dinner," and this "<hi rend="italic">left</hi> his ticket at home"—the pay-tickets are made up from my book and the men are paid by paper, tickets—if an engine driver cannot <hi rend="italic">get</hi> away, he is allowed to send another person for him—this figuring against the name of Wright, No. "285" on 2nd March is in Mr. Claverhouse's writing on Monday and Tuesday, but it is not his marking—the figures correspond with the marks—these figures against Wright's name on 6th March are mine—on March 12th the lines are put down by the prisoner, but there is no time to them as that was the day he was taken—from the time-keeper's rough diary the names and dates are entered into another book, which is kept by me or my assistant—this "285 Wright" on this page is in Beales' writing—that is copied from my rough book which I am answerable for—this pay-ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) "285 Wright" is in the prisoner's writing, but the date I believe is Butcher's—the figures in the prisoner's writing are copied from my writing in the rough book—I am the person responsible chiefly for the time being pro<lb></lb>perly kept—the first entry of Crew's name after he was placed in the sick-list is in Butcher's writing, but the time is not—the first two days time is in my figures—the prisoner may have been in the employ a little longer than six months, but he came the last <hi rend="italic">time</hi> the day after Christmas Day—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187405040031"></xptr>
               <p>these brass-tickets are left in the office where my assistants can get them—I do not always check the pay-tickets with the books as we have been so busy—we had about 1,500 hands at the time the prisoner was there, and 1,300 in my particular office—the time-keepers office is open at all hours of the day and night—a night relief takes my place at night—they work day and night—I do not know of persons from the gutta percha side coming to my office and helping to book the men—not even on Sunday evenings—I will undertake to swear that it has not occurred on Sunday evening—there are three time-keepers on the premises and their assistants—I have some<lb></lb>times found men in the office with Claverhouse, and spoken about it in the morning—ticket 2,227 was got ready for Hunt, but it was not transferred to him—the entry is in Butcher's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The foundation of the system is the working of the brass-tickets, and if a ticket is being honestly or dishonestly worked the same entry would be made by me or any assistants, and the hieroglyphics in the time-sheet would go on on the assumption of the ticket being used belonging honestly to somebody—Claverhouse would not work with the prisoner—he said that people passed by him and said that he was a thief—it is the foreman's duty to fix the rate of a workman's wages when he enters the service, that ought to be reported to me as 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or whatever it was per hour—the rate per hour of the fictitious workmen is in the prisoner's writing—if they were real workmen the rate per hour ought to have been reported to me or to my assistant—this is the book in which he would enter and rate the workmen—this signature "H. W. W. Beale," is the prisoner's writing.</p>

"Wright," your original entry 7 <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; where it comes from is the question—it does not come from any book—the foreman says "I have entered such and such names, book their names," and we book them—no foreman brought this name—when a foreman brings them we enter the name of the foreman to their name—the foreman fixes the rate or anybody sent by the foreman, but he would bring a paper from the foreman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When the pay-tickets are brought up to mo I pay the sums—it is common for another person to bring tickets when a man cannot</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant time-keeper at Messrs. Siemens'—on Sunday, 8th March, about 6 a.m., I was in the office with Mr. Turner, and we both saw that no brass tickets referring to any of the cable depart<lb></lb>ment were there—the prisoner was not there at all that day—I had occasion to look at the time-book next day (Monday), and found entries in the prisoner's writing for work on Sunday from 6 a.m. till 5 p.m.—I referred to the numbers which you have before you, and after I found it out I made a communication to Mr. Turner, and looked into the matter—I have made entries in this time-book under some of those names—at those times the brass tickets were not in the office—at the time I made the entries I believed that those brass tickets represented genuine workmen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I claim the credit of finding this out at 3 o'clock in the morning—I am not there by day—when I say that the prisoner was not there, I go by the book—I was not there all day on the Monday, but I say the he was not there, because I inquired when I came at 6 o'clock—I go by what people told me—I once had a dispute with the prisoner—I did not like to work with him—I have never suggested bringing any fresh hands into the works, either to Mr. Turner or anybody else—that I swear—I have never suggested to Mr. Turner the name of any German to come into the works—after Beale left I told Mr. Turner that I knew a good man to come into the works, and he was a German, but not before—it is a fact that I have entered very few names in this book, because they did not under<lb></lb>stand my writing—the time diaries are made up from another rougher diary, and most of the figures in the rough books are in my writing at night time—I never heard any suggestion from Mr. Turner of my having men in my office at night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The reason I did not wish to work with the prisoner was because Mr. Shmidt and Mr. Turner had already put suspicion upon him—I was called at the Police Court for the defence, and gave the evidence which I have given to-day, which caused me to be called for the prosecution—the prisoner was defended at the Police Court by Mr. Hughes, the attorney, who called me as his witness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a job-master, and formerly lived at Lee, within three miles of these works—I know the prisoner—on 28th February I entered into this agreement with him—I knew him by his hiring ponies of me at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per hour, sometimes once, and sometimes twice a week. (<hi rend="italic">This was an agreement, dated February</hi> 23, 1874, <hi rend="italic">between the prisoner and William Harding, for the purchase by the prisoner of a pony, trap, and harness for</hi> 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">to be paid in three weeks, and if not then paid for, to be returned to Harding</hi>, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">having been paid in advance</hi>)—I did not know how young he was, or whether he had parents.</p>

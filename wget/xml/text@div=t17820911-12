The policy of the law in order to correct a mischief so extremely injurious to the public credit, has made each of these offences a capital felony; it will be the object therefore of your inquiry to judge from evidence whether the prisoners both of them, or each of them, have committed either of these offences imputed to them in the indictment: perhaps in defence of the prisoner

             it may be argued she is a married woman, and charged as the wife of the prisoner John therefore intitled in point of law to some privilege which will protect her from the guilt of which she is charged. It behoves me to state to you, subject to the correction of the court, what I conceive to be the law in that case; I take it that the extent of such rule, if there is any such laid rule down is this, where a married woman in company of her husband commits a larceny, and nothing more appears, than that she was in company of her husband, at the commission of that offence, there a presumption is raised from the humanity of the law, to suppose, that the woman committed that offence under the dominion and authority of her husband; but that, as well as any other presumption, can only stand till there is a proof to the contrary; for I take it to be equally clear, that if from the evidence it should appear, that the married woman was the active person, and acted without the controul or interference of the husband, it would be clear in point of law, that she was involved in the same degree of guilt; if it should appear that it was not in the presence of the husband but distinct from him, I take it to be clear, that a woman in that situation has no privilege whatever; this I conceive is the law on the subject, the forgery now charged on the prisoners is, that of altering a bank note which originally issued from the bank, a bank note for 15 l. and by that alteration producing the operation and effect of a note of 50 l. the manner in which that has been effected has been this, it has been contrived by some method or another, to discharge the double e, and n, from the word fifteen, both in the body of the note and in the black letters of the note, and to substitute in their place the letter y, by which these two words appear to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110020"></xptr> be fifty, the fraud on the public is just that sum between fifteen and fifty; I shall state to you very shortly what will be the evidence that will be laid before you, in order to satisfy you that the prisoners have been guilty of that offence. The prisoner has stated that from the number of council who appear against him, he has some reason to be alarmed, I would ease him of this fear, because every body knows, that the only use that is at this time of day made of council in criminal prosecutions, is merely to state with a little more accuracy, the facts, in order to shew immediately their connection to each other, and to disentangle them from that degree of obscurity which they would receive coming irregularly from the mouths of the witnesses, the jury ought to pay no attention to what is stated by council, but only to receive the evidence as it comes from the mouths of witnesses, on that they are to draw their own conclusions and to form their own judgment, therefore, I trust, the prisoner will be eased of any alarm of that sort; I shall discharge my duty simply in stating that evidence, and you will draw the conclusions.

In his judgment, this mode of fraud upon the public was the most easily effected: it being necessary in order to carry it into execution, that he should be furnished with letters of different sorts in order to compleat his forgery, for that purpose he applied himself to a Mr. Rayner, who was foreman to a Mr. Caslon, who is famous in this town as an engraver; Caslon recommended him to Mr. Hodgson who is an engraver on wood, and stated to be a person very likely to furnish him with such letters as he should want.

The prisoner said they were for a whimsical gentleman, and accordingly they were cut for him; he called and paid Hodgson for them and took them away; some time after he called again, and said these letters did not quite answer his purpose, and he wanted some numbers, as 2, 3, 5, 20, 30, and so on: respecting the letter y, I shall produce to you the papers marked by the prisoner, and the alterations he wished to be made by Mr. Hodgson in the cut of the letter y, a number of letters were cut and figures made by Mr. Hodgson, which were called for and took away by the prisoner

When you inspect the letter y. upon the note produced to you, and compare it with the letter y. produced to you, and the copy of that Hodgson's has engraved, supported by Hodgson's evidence, it will appear to you beyond doubt, that the alteration and the forgery in this bank-note, was made by means of this letter engraved by Hodgson under the direction and order of the prisoner: also that the prisoner John took away and had possession of this letter: shortly after this we find these notes so altered put in circulation; here there appears to be considerable art in John. In no one instance is he to be connected with the putting off these notes; the whole of that is left to the conduct and management of the woman: and there is no instance in which he can be connected with the putting off any of these notes. On the 8th of June, the note in the indictment was put off by the prisoner Jane; she went to the shop of a Mr. Alderson, Silk-Mercer, in Bridge Street, Westmister, where after having bargained for somethings,</p>

               <p>she put off to him one of the forged notes altered from 15 l. to 50 l. that note will be traced very accurately, so as to leave no doubt, and brought home to the prisoner Jane, negociated by her; in a very few days after it was discovered that this note was a forgery, and upon taking it to the bank it was found that a note of that letter, No. and date had been issued of 15 l. but none of 50 l. consequently from that circumstance, without more, they were perfectly satisfied that this was a forged note. There could be no such note issued from the bank; the inattention of the persons taking the note is wonderful, as there is such a space between the letter y and the pounds, that they must with a little attention have seen it: this caused an alarm as you may easily conceive, and the officers of the bank in endeavouring to trace the offender, had discovered that the prisoner had been observed to be full of money, and putting off notes, and buying goods; but though the most diligent search was making after him he was discovered by accident. A Mr. Wright fortunately saw the two prisoners alight out of a post-chaise at Winchester, and they were apprehended at Southampton. It will be unnecessary for me to state to you the number of notes, but I have proof it amounted to eight, as appears by the confession of the prisoner Jane on her examination. On the morning of their being apprended at Southampton, their trunk was opened and searched, on searching that, the sum of ninety and odd guineas, and a 15 l. bank-note was found; the money in the trunk, the 15 l. note in the pocket of the prisoner. In that trunk was also found a great number of experiments on thin paper, made to imitate bank paper, with letters of this kind of ground; and theimpression of the stamps cut by Hodgson the engraver; also a box of paste and a little brush, for the purpose of pasting these letters on, when the letters e e n were discharged from the real bank-note; they then pasted a thin letter y on this paper in their place: then they pasted a bit of thin paper as if it had been worn by carriage. On John was found a 15 l. bank-note, on which as it is stated to me, an attempt had been made to discharge the letters e e n in the body of the note, and it did not quite succeed; the paper seemed to have suffered in the operation and be made very thin; in the back of that note are figures cast up for the purpose of hiding the operation, which appears to be cut exactly in the same manner as these on the note circulated by the woman. From these circumstances you will draw what conclusions<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110023"></xptr> you think fit, this will be the nature of the evidence laid before you; on this evidence, in the first place, it will appear clear that there has been a forgery of the banknote committed by somebody. The question then is, By whom is that forgery commited? In order to satisfy you that that forgery must be committed by the prisoners, or at least by one of them you will have the evidence of Hodgson, who will state to you that the prisoner was put by him in possession of letters capable of effecting that alteration, and that that alteration was effected by means of these letters you cannot doubt, when I produce to you the pieces of paper in black and white, found in the box of the prisoners, in which these corresponding letters are found to be marked; I conceive that no doubts can remain that the forgery was occasioned by these letters, and by the possessor of these letters. Crimes of this sort are always committed in secret, where there is no eye to see; we can can only judge of them by probability. The forgery is as capable of commission by the woman as the man: there is no greater degree of ingenuity or art in this forgery, when you are in possession of the instruments that will make the letters, than to paste with great neatness the letter y where the letters e e n stood before. With respect to the other offence, the disposing and uttering these notes, you will observe, there is no evidence against John, except his being in company with this woman, standing to him in the relation of wife, having cohabited together as man and wife for many years, and going together to Southampton; you are to judge whether he is not to be connected with her in the crime of disposing of these notes. Gentlemen, these are the circumstances of this case, which I shall leave with you. I shall call my witnesses; and I trust, when you have heard them, you will be convinced, that the prisoners are both of them guilty of the offence charged in the indictment.</p>

            ? - He called on me from Mr. Caslon.</p>
               <p>What day was it? - I cannot recollect the day Sir, about the 16th of May.</p>
               <p>For what purpose? - He wanted two letters cut to stamp books for a gentleman in the country.</p>
               <p>What passed? - He came from Mr. Caslon to get two letters cut in wood, I said I did not think it would answer the purpose, being a single letter, as if there was a line round it, because there is some difficulty to stamp a letter perpendicularly by the hand, I do not think any man could; and I told him if there was a line round it, it would stamp better; but he said he was a whimsical gentleman, and it was to mark his books where the authors names ended with a y. I told him it made no difference to me, I would cut it as I was in that way of business. He called again and paid me 1 s. a-piece.</p>
               <p>What kind of a letter did he describe he wanted to have cut? - A text y.</p>
               <p>What were the directions he gave you? - He brought the second time a paper, he said he believed the gentleman would want some numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, if so be that they answered the purpose.</p>
               <p>Look at that paper? - The prisoner brought this as a direction for more stamps, he paid for the two marks, I believe about the 20th of May, and he came, I am not clear, but I think in June; and when he came the third time he brought these two papers, he wanted these numbers that are wrote; he said the gentleman did not understand drawing, but he left the body of the y to me; I said he had better send me drawings; he said the gentleman did not understand drawing, it was left intirely to me, only the body of the y was to be for the size of - the black letter that was to be cut. I cut these numbers that are written down, and I drew them according<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110024"></xptr> to my own fancy; I did not draw the y's according to that copy, as he said the gentleman did not understand drawing, I thought it was left to my judgment, and therefore, I drew them according to the common method of text letters. (The prisoner desired a chair for his wife which was granted.) I drew it according to my judgment of making that letter, there are many variations in the manner of making it, but I drew it according to my own judgment; I cut all thom numbers that he had written down, and he came and paid me 2 s. a piece for them, I made proofs of the whole that he had from me, there was 20.</p>
               <p>Look at this? - (paper with proofs shown the witness) These are the marks that he had from me, I made them with my own hand.</p>

               <p>Look at that? - This is what came afterwards, he had all them marks from me, and paid me 2 s. a piece; some time after he came again and said the gentleman wanted a set of marks a size smaller; it was some time afterwards, I cannot tell the date, and these that were to be done was marked underneath by a line, which may be seen, I fancy in the proof; the tails of the y's some of them were to be turned the other way as appears by this proof, when he gave me directions to do this, he was not clear which way the tails of the y's should be turned, and he said he would write to the gentleman, and desired me to leave the tails unfinished, he said he would call in two or three days; in a few days he called and told me how to finish them, and said his servant should call for them, he was obliged to be out of town himself; a woman called for them, whom I have seen since in New-Prison.</p>
               <p>Look if you see her now? - It is the prisoner at the bar, there was 14 and she paid me 24 s. for them, this paper is the second that was done afterwards.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Can you fix the time when you delivered him the first letter? - The 20th of May.</p>
               <p>The last May? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What were the letters? - Two y's.</p>
               <p>Which way were the tails of them turned? - The proofs are there.</p>
               <p>He came from Mr. Caslon to you recommended, I understand? - Yes; I do a great deal of business for Mr. Caslon.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether he said the gentleman he wanted them for, resided in England or Ireland? - A few miles out of town he told me.</p>
               <p>Was you acquainted with the prisoner at the bar before he came from Mr. Caslon? - Never saw him in my life that I know of, only he said he came from Mr. Caslon.</p>
               <p>You say the woman at the bar came for the last marks, did you ever see her before? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>You have not recollected to say, I believe what money was paid for them by the person that fetched them? - The woman paid me 24 s.</p>
               <p>I am inclined to think that you are mistaken? - I am not mistaken.</p>
               <p>Those that the woman fetched away, were the last that were done? - Yes; they were tied up in a bundle, she did not see them.</p>
               <p>You did not make any more? - No Sir; I never heard any thing about them afterwards.</p>
               <p>In all probability you never saw the woman again? - Not till I saw her in New-Prison.</p>
               <p>When you saw them in Prison, you went to look at this woman as a person that belonged to Graham taken up for the forgery of the bank-bill? - I was sent to see if I knew them, and then I knew her to be the woman.</p>

               <p>Look at that note it appears to be signed by you? - It was signed by me.</p>
               <p>What was that note when it was issued from the bank? - A 15 l. note.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Prisoner. How do you know that, Sir, you see the note is an incompleat note, there are other letters introduced, what means of knowledge have you, that the note there is not in its original state? - I issued fifty 15 l. notes, this is one.</p>
               <p>You have a paper in your hand with your name to it, it was not in the condition it is? - I can swear it was only for 15 l.</p>
               <p>Why? - It does not correspond with the entry.</p>
               <p>Did you see the entry made yourself? - No. I see it is a 15 l. the f's are not made in the same manner, they are double f's.</p>
               <p>Pray Mr. Boult I have not a doubt about the truth of what you say, but I would have you speak no further than your knowledge goes, do you see all the bills that are issued from the bank? - No, nor I did not see this issued.</p>
               <p>Can you upon your oath say, in the multiplicity of your business, that a 50 l. bank note never issued from the bank with such an f as that, can you say that positively, you can only speak to your belief Mr. Boult? - I believe it has always been customary.</p>
               <p>But do not you frequently alter your plates? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In order to make a variation, and to prevent forgery? - But never I believe with a single f.</p>
               <p>But you cannot take upon you to say, that the bank have never issued such notes? - They have not lately.</p>
               <p>But they might formerly? - Yes; but if you attend to the No. of this plate it is for the year 1781.</p>

               <p>You were one of the persons, I understand, that apprehended the prisoner? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110027"></xptr>Where did you see him first? - At the sign of the George at Winchester; on the 11th of July last I saw a post-chaise come in, I saw Mr. Graham come out and Mrs. Graham, she was in a scarlet riding dress, I saw a hair trunk like this, whether this is it or no I cannot say, (a hair trunk produced). What day were they apprehended? On the 13th.</p>
               <p>What occasioned their apprehension? - When I came to London, I mentioned to my master the governor of Tothill-fields Bridewell, that I had seen Graham at Winchester.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Do not tell us what your master said.</p>
               <p>You had orders to go in pursuit of them? - Yes; I apprehended them at the Coach and Horses at Southampton.</p>
               <p>Did you search the prisoners? - I searched Mrs. Graham, and found nothing particular on her, she had a guinea, and a shilling or two; and the man that was with me, Gregory, searched him and found a 15 l. note and some bits of paper, there was upon the table 31 guineas and a half in gold, that I swept off with me, and put into a purse.</p>
               <p>Where did you get that trunk? - I asked her after he was secured, what is become of your hair-trunk, that I saw with you at Winchester? says she, Sir, I have sent it away; I says to Mr. Gregory, Bob, you take care of them, and I will go and enquire about that; I found the trunk up one pair of stairs in a bed-room, and Mrs. Graham had the key of that room in her pocket, she gave me the key of the room, the trunk was shut, it was opened afterwards at Winchester; the key of the trunk was delivered me by the maid whom I sent to search Mrs. Graham.</p>
               <p>When the trunk was opened, what were the contents of it? - The first thing I found was a little gallypot of paste; she wanted sadly to put her hand in for a handkerchief, but I said she must not before Lord Banbury and all the gentlemen; I found a paper with 69 guineas and 2 half-guineas; searching further, my Lord, I found some paper and some stamps.</p>
               <p>Was there any wearing apparel in the trunk? - A great deal, I have half a dozen things.</p>
               <p>Were any of the things that were in the trunk claimed by either of the prisoners before the magistrate? - The shirts were claimed by Mr. Graham, and the money.</p>
               <p>Produce the other things that you found in that trunk. (Produced the gallypot that the paste was in, and the bottle that the ink was in, the cloth that the stamps were in, and some thin paper, with a number of impressions of letters on it, and particularly one paper with y's stamped on it, where some of the y's appear to be cut off, and a paper with great and little y's.)</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Where was you when Mrs. Graham was searched? - I was in the room with Mr. Graham, she was taken into a private room to be examined by women.</p>
               <p>So that all that you know of the key where the trunk was, is that the maid gave it you? Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>In whose possession has the trunk been? - In my possession mostly; these papers never were out of my possession.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My lord and gentlemen of the jury: we had seven witnesses here this day who would have spoken to many particulars that would have entirely proved our innocence; of these witnesses we are deprived, but by what means I cannot comprehend; they were a short time ago in the lord mayor's parlour, and were seen by Mr. Wilson; since which they have all been ordered to go away, contrary to our knowledge; the meaning of this manoeuvre heaven alone knows. They would have proved the meaning of the stamps, I had a commission to procure them for a gentleman, at Thames-street, to be sent to Mr. O'Hara of Dublin: I applied to the type makers, they directed me to the wood-cutters; I delivered the stamps, when made, to the gentleman, who if he had been called here would have acknowledged it. The notes likewise could have been accounted for by respectable witnesses, householders, two of whom met Mrs. Graham,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110029"></xptr> and the other came up in the course of finding them. Having been deprived of our witnesses we are sold, were it not for the honour of these gentlemen that are to judge of the whole matter, they are men of honour, they are men of virtue: our confidence therefore is in the Almighty God, and in them. You will please to recollect, that the date of the issuing of the first note is considerably before the procuring of the first stamps, therefore the impression on that note could not be the effect of the impression of that stamp; besides, upon a supposition that I had any hand in the matter, had it been necessary for me to make letters or y's, I could have done it with a pencil or a pen, and the jury will find that none of them do apply. Gentlemen, this is for the last stake of our lives; we are the parents of ten children, nine of whom are now alive, we therefore hope the jury will do us justice.</p>
               <p>Jury to Alderson. What day did you receive the note?</p>

                  </hi> I am a clergyman, and live at Trinity-square, Southwark—on 9th November I was in Farringdon-street between three and four o'clock—I was in Farringdon-street, and suddenly found my<lb></lb>self in a set of boys—I had a great deal of money about me and was doing my best to secure it, when I felt my watch-guard pulled, and detected the prisoner in great confusion—I said, "You have stolen my watch"—he said, "I have not got it"—I said, "You have it in your left hand"—he said, "I have not"—I tried to reach his left hand, having secured his collar with my left hand—he stretched out his left hand, and a dozen of his confederates held out their hands to take the watch—the prisoner dropped it into the mud—I never relaxed my hold of him, but took the watch out of the mud, and then delivered the prisoner to the police—my watch was worth 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found my guard cut by some sharp instrument.</p>

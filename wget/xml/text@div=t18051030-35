             sworn. - I live with Mr. Wrightson, he is a <rs id="t18051030-35-viclabel187" type="occupation">gun-carriage maker to government</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18051030-35-victim455 t18051030-35-viclabel187"></join>, he lives at Bethnal-green. I can only prove that the property belongs to him.</p>
               <p>- MAYHEW sworn. - I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street; I met the prisoner in the City-road, on the 26th of September, about a quarter before six in the evening, he had this iron on his shoulder, which I produce; I asked him what he had got there, he told me it was iron; he had got it from a gentleman's house, where he had been to work. I looked at the iron, and I asked him what kind of work he had been at work on, he told me that he had been cutting a vice for Mr. Spencer, a blacksmith, in Shoreditch; that he had given him this iron in lieu of wages; I took the prisoner, and two of my partners into a public-house to stay with him while I went to Mr. Spencer's to enquire; Mr Spencer came to our Office; he knew nothing of him; but by the size of the iron, he supposed it belonged to Mr. Wrightson, Bethnal-green; I sent there to inform him.</p>

            (To Watts.) Look at that iron, what do you say to it? - A. I believe it to be the property of Mr. Wrightson, I worked in the same shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300038"></xptr>Q. Is it such iron as any other blacksmith uses? - A. No, not in general, this was taken off from the bandages of carriages, it is worth a penny a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any mark upon upon it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Watts did not work for Mr. Wrightson at the same time I did; I was at work for a gentleman in Shoreditch; I took the iron in lieu of my wages; I mended a vice for him when I was out of employ; I sent for him, but he is not at home.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Watts.) Q. It is a very extraordinary thing that your master should have that sort of iron, and no other manufactory in London? - 
               <persName id="t18051030-35-person458">A. </persName>
            It is Swedish iron.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a great deal of Swedish iron imported into this country, how can you explain that is your master's iron? - A. It laid about the shop.</p>
               <p>Mayhew. I met the prisoner in the road from Mr. Wrightson's to his own home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a patent water-closet maker, and live in Ann's-place, Limehouse. The prisoner was in my service—I missed a quantity of brass work, some screw bolts, and gas burner—these are them—they are worth 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—here is more than one pound—I after<lb></lb>wards found them among some old brass, which was sold to me by a marine store-dealer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ten years old, and live with my parents, in Richard-street.

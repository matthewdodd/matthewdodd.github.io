On the 9th of April we lost a saddle and bridle from out of the harness-room, the property of my master. I lost an old great coat, and a pair of gloves. On the 10th I went off very early in the morning to fetch my master from Blackheath; I missed nothing when I went out. When I returned the things were gone, the saddle and bridle.

               <p>WILLIAM HUMPHREYS. I am a broker. On Saturday the 10th of April, the prisoner came to my shop; I bought the bridle and saddle of him, for twenty-three shillings; he said he came very honestly by it. He pulled out a pair of shoes, which he sold to another man, and the man went away with them. I then had suspicion that he had stolen them. I sent for an officer.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your lordship, and gentleman of the jury, the humble petition of Thomas Lane, most humbly sheweth that he is an honest, industrious, hardworking man, to support a small family. The smallest charge of dishonesty was never alleged against him before, and it is with a heart-felt sorrow that it now is; he has great reason to believe, that the prosecutor will interfere on his behalf to your lordship, that your lordship will be pleased to take into your consideration, a wife and small family.</p>

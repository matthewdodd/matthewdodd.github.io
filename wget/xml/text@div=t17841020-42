               <p>Had they arms? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were the pistols presented to you when you came up to them? - I believe they were, but I cannot be very sure.</p>
               <p>Did you seize their pistols? - I did not, I desired they would resign themselves quietly, and they should be treated well, upon those conditions they did.</p>
               <p>What did the prosecutor say when you brought them to him; did he know them again? - He did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did they surrender at once when they were told they should be well used? - Yes, from my persuasions, they resisted at the first, but after a bit of a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200086"></xptr> parley, about five minutes, they surrendered themselves.</p>

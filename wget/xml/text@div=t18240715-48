            . I was in Mr. Hutchons's service. On a Sunday evening, the 7th of June, while master was out the prisoner came in, and went down the yard; he called to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"If master comes in tell him I am in the back yard." Upon going up stairs I saw him come up the yard with an empty pail; he went into the wash-house - I thought him a long time there, and when he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150019"></xptr>came out I asked him what he had got; he said nothing; I said,</p>
               <p>"Let me look;" he refused. I took a loaf from him - and said,</p>
               <p>"How came you to take this;" he said he had taken nothing. I then went back to the safe, and found the ham was gone; he was then putting it into his pocket, but could not get it in for the knuckle.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She says very wrong; I had no ham, it was a red night cap I was putting in my pocket - Witness No, it was a ham - he had the night cap on his head.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 49, William Street, Limehouse, and am a porter at the Shadwell station—as the 9.45 train came up I noticed the prisoners—I did not see anyone else with them at the time—Pearson asked me if it was the Bow train, I told him it was—I opened the door of a car<lb></lb>riage and told him to get in there—he said, "Never mind, I am waiting for a <hi rend="italic">pal</hi>."—I asked him to get in and he still refused, and I started the train and left them on the platform—on the arrival of the Blackwall train two or</p>

               <p>three minutes after, the two prisoners with another man seemed to encircle two men round the carriage door—Pearson stood with one foot on the plat<lb></lb>form and one on the step of the carriage, in the doorway—seeing a crowd gather round I pushed through it, and I saw Fielding take the watch from the seaman's pocket—I took hold of him and said, "You have got that man's watch"—I made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at his hand, but he was too quick, and threw it on the platform, someone else picked it up and went away with it—Pearson was in the doorway when the watch was taken, and Fielding pressed up against the prosecutor—there was no reason why Pearson did not get into the car<lb></lb>riage—the door was open and only one person inside—after the watch was taken, I went and took Pearson out of the carriage, and told him he was concerned in robbing the sailor of his watch; he said he knew nothing of it—I took a ticket out of his pocket from Shadwell to Bow—that train did not go to Bow at all, but to Blackwall—he had no Black wall ticket on him.</p>

I saw the prisoner close before me; I saw him plainly by the gas light - nobody else was near enough to have done it but him; he immediately ran up Crown-court. I pursued, but did not overtake him, and turned into Hanging Sword-alley. I missed him in an instant, and did not see him again that night. I turned back, and found there was a court leading to the river. On the Sunday following I went to the public-house at the corner of that court, to see if there was any door leading into that court, and while I was there the prisoner came out - I knew him instantly, and am certain he is the man who snatched my watch. I could distinguish his features very plainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure him - A. No, my Lord, but I followed him across the road, and down Water-lane; he then turned up a court on the right side of the way, which goes into Bouverie-street - he went into a house in that court. He came out in about two minutes, and went into Bouverie-street; I still followed him close, and when he got to the open place he saw me, came up, and asked me why I followed him? I said,</p>
               <p>"I think I know you - I have seen you before. What is your name?" He said it was Dillon, and he could get a character; I did not wish him to know what I followed him for, and went away - he said something very impudent. I lost him for a short time, went into Fleet-street, and saw him coming up Water-lane - I did not take him then, as I was afraid. Next day I stated the case at the Mansion House, and Herdsfield apprehended him on the Wednesday. I have no doubt of his being the man, who snatched my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You saw no person in particular but the prisoner - A. He came against my side, and took by watch. I did not look for him in the week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to any one when you lost your watch - A. No.</p>

            . I am a constable. I had information of this robbery, and on the morning of the 1st of December, I saw the prisoner coming out of Mr. Mason's seed shop, in Fleet-street. I knew him before, took him as he crossed the street, and told him I wanted him for robbing a gentleman of his watch. He said he thought it very curious as the gentleman had seen him before, that he did not take him himself. As I was going down Ludgate-hill - I was walking by the side of him, but had not got hold of him, I saw the prosecutor, who immediately said,</p>
               <p>"That is the person, who robbed me of my watch" - I believe the prisoner said he must be mistaken. I found nothing particular on him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you tell him the gentleman had seen him since the watch was taken - A. I believe I did. He then said, if the gentleman saw me why did he not take me. I went to his house with him down a court in Water-lane; he lived there with his mother.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Sunday after the robbery I was coming up Water-lane, and went into a public-house with two young men - I met the prosecutor as I came out, he took particular notice of me, and followed me to my door. I came out in a few minutes, and saw him at the corner. I asked him why he followed me? he said he was not following me, and wanted nothing of me - he went away. I walked about there. He said he knew nothing of me and left. I met him again at the top of Water-lane. On the Saturday night after he was robbed, I was coming up Crown-court, he was talking to some persons, and said he should call it the thieving court as long as he lived.</p>

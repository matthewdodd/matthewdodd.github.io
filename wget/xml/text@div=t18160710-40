On the morning of the 29th of May, I was awakened at five o'clock, by my pot-boy. When I came down stairs, I found the doors were open; the street door and the bar door locks had been picked, and the lock of one of the tills was picked; the other till was not locked. I found no instruments. I missed three table-spoon, and four tea-spoons; two were marked J S B; one spoon was an old one, with a crest to it; that was some sort of a bird. I also lost one teaspoon marked J B three others marked J S A, they are mine, and the sugar tongs were marked J A B, and were belonging to my wife's first husband. I missed the money out of both tills; there was a great quantity of halfpence and farthings to the amount of nine or ten shillings. I saw these things the night before, before I went to bed. It was past two o'clock before I went to bed that morning, and I left these things in the cupboard in the bar. There was a silver mounted reading glass in the till, which was gone, and a patent cork-screw. I found a handkerchief, and a great number of things tied up in it, in the passage; among the things in that handkerchief, were two pieces of cheese, a piece of bacon, four pounds of currants, two pounds of tea, a shirt, and a waistcoat, and about a dozen pair of shoes, which were old, and brought down stairs to be repaired. There is a mark T C on the handkerchief. The prisoner had lodged in my house nearly a year and a half; he always went by the name of 
               <persName id="t18160710-40-person305">
                  Thomas

            ; he lodged at the top of the house. The shirt, waistcoat, and shoes are not here. In consequence of this, I took the bundle into the bar, and also the two bottles; there were about two pound of tea tied up in a silk handkerchief, and some tobacco twisted up in an old newspaper. When I took this back, I found the mark on the handkerchief, and I suspected by the T C that it was the prisoner's handkerchief, and I took a constable, and took the prisoner in the City.</p>



               <p>EDWARD BARNES. I am pot-boy to the prosecutor. When I awaked on the morning in question, in was about five o'clock; when I got to the bottom of the stairs, I heard a noise, and when I came into the passage a man struck me there; I saw his arm; but not his face. I heard the voice. He asked who I was; I could see the back of another man. I am sure there were two men; it was morning light, it was day light. I could not see who they were; I did not know the voice of the man; I don't think I ever heard it before. I had lived at the prosecutor's house about twelve months. I well know the prisoner's voice; I am sure he was not the man who struck me. I went up stairs, and called my master. When I came back, they were gone. I was not many minutes up stairs, as soon as we could get some young men up, we came out directly. There were people in the house when I went to bed the night before.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH ORCHIN. I am a washer-woman. I have washed for the prisoner. The handkerchief was brought to me to know if I knew it; and I said yes. They asked me what mark it had on it, and I knew it by the letter T; it was marked with T C; but I had always noticed the letter T, because it was marked so crookedly and badly. On the Sunday he had fetched away a shirt, a waistcoat, a pair of gaiters, and this handkerchief; I knew that to be it, because he had five handkerchiefs, and I had three of them, and he took away this one; I had had it three weeks. This was the smallest handkerchief he had belonging to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you positive sure that is the handkerchief he took away-A. Yes, from that T, and if it was not for that, I should not know it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The handkerchief was never mine; I never had a small white pocket handkerchief. I lodged with the prosecutor a year and a half, and I should wish to know if he knew any thing of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100022"></xptr>my character. I would wish to ask the lad whether he knew any harm by me all the time he was there?</p>

               <p>Richard Gale. I never heard any thing amiss of him.</p>

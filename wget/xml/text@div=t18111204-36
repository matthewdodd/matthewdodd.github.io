I missed a dozen of soldier's caps; I was ill at the time, I had the prisoner in my house, I told the prisoner that I had lost the caps, she confessed that she had taken them. About a week or a fortnight after I had lost them, I missed them on a Saturday, the latter end of May, she said she and another woman had cut them in pieces, they were cloth caps, and she sent a girl to Tothill-street; she sold them for three pence a-piece, and brought the money to her. I had a warrant for her, and took her up before the justice; the magistrate knowing her mother he wished to make it up; Justice Fielding asked me how much it would be; I told him I was charged twenty-four shillings; he then said she must produce two pounds, he allowed her till the Wednesday following; I went at the time appointed, and then he said, as she was not there I might take out a bill against her.</p>

            's mother sent for me, I went to Mrs. Sutty, I told her that I was come from Mrs. Steel in Gardner's place, concerning the caps; this was in October. She said she was charged twenty-four shillings; I said Mrs. Steel is a poor woman, do not charge too much. I am positive that she told me that she gave them to her to make up, that she had spoiled them and sold them.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to Mrs. Sutty. You say you missed your caps on a Saturday, the latter end or May - A. Yes, and the caps were completely made up at my house. I had seen them in my house a fortnight, they had no oil on them. When I first mentioned it to the prisoner, I said, you stole them out of my cupboard, she said, for God's sake Mrs. Sutty do not let my mother know it, she will go out of her mind. I shewed Mrs.

            . On the 9th of November I was at a public-house with the prisoner, and he took me home about half-past two o'clock; I got rather tipsy, but I had my watch when I came out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DUNN. Q. Was there a young man with him? A. Yes - I could have walked home if he had let me; I understand I got home about three o'clock - I certainly was very drunk; my wife asked what had become of my watch - I said somebody had got it; I did not say I did not know who brought me home - he stopped in my house about five minutes; I went to sleep, and in about an hour went to several houses to look for him.</p>
               <p>AUGUSTUS KIRBRY. I am a pawnbroker. This watch was pawned with me by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had you seen him before? A. No - I knew him at Hatton-garden, and should have sworn to him if he had not been in custody; I swear he is the man - he had a blue coat on; I will not swear whether it was black or blue - I described him as pockmarked; he had a hat on, and I believe it was a black one.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HALL. The prosecutor told me he had lost his watch, and I took the prisoner on the 16th of November; he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

             -I live at Baker's-place with the prosecutor; I remember him being brought home very drunk by the prisoner and another man - the prisoner was there but a few minutes; he said he was tipsy, and he had brought him home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not too drunk to get up stairs? A. He was drunk.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long address to the Court, stated that he and another man in a blue coat had gone home with the prosecutor, but he knew nothing of the watch - they had been to several public-houses; he was quite intoxicated, and they carried him home.</p>

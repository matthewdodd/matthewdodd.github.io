                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Turnham-green. I have been in the habit of attending Mr. Voller nearly twenty years—for some months since I have been sending him medicine—on Sunday" 12th Nov., a bitter tonic medicine was sent him, which he had been in the habit of taking—my partner made it up—on the next day I went to see him, and the bottle was shown to me—it was one of mine—I tasted it and smelt it, and discovered there was a large portion of laudanum in it—I put it in my pocket and took it home—this is it—there was no laudanum in the medicine compounded for Mr. Voller—here is a sufficient quantity of laudanum here to cause stupor—I attended him about two months ago in a very great state of stupor—he was almost insensible—that lasted for two or three days—that had not happened frequently to that extent—occasionally he has been in a state something similar, which I could not account for—he was to take three doses of this medicine in a day—from the quantity of laudanum which is in it now, the effect of three doses would have been death—if he had taken one dose it would have thrown him in a state of stupor, and I should have found him in that state the next day.</p>

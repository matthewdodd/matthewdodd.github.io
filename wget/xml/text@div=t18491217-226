                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, F</hi> 11). On 4th Dec, about six o'clock in the evening, in consequence of information, I stationed myself on the roof of the Model Lodging-house, Charles-street, Drury-lane, from whence I had a view of the front room of No. 48, on the other side of the street—there was a candle on the table—I saw the prisoner blowing the fire—I went again next evening, and saw the prisoner sitting at the side of the table with something like a mould in her hand—she took something like a small bowl from the fire, and poured something like metal into the mould in two places—she held it in her hand a few seconds, opened the mould, and turned out on the table what appeared to me to be two shillings—I saw her do that perhaps a dozen times, or more—two men and another woman, in a cloak and bonnet, were in the room—one man took something, and appeared to scour it, and then sent it across the table to another man, who appeared to file it, by the movements of his arm—one of the men then went to this pot (<hi rend="italic">a galvanic battery</hi>)—when they had done a certain quantity, and counted them over one man, who was without his coat, gave the other, who wore a cap, some money, two pieces, or more—he handed them over to the woman in the bonnet, who put them into a basket, I believe; I could not exactly see, but she had a basket—the man without the coat turned the money over, and put it into his left-hand trowsers'-pocket—he appeared to me as if he had</p>

               <p>purchased them—the woman in the bonnet and shawl, and the man in the cap, left the room—the prisoner stayed, still going on with the same process—in a few minutes the man without the coat turned down his shirt-sleeves, buttoned up his clothes, and went out of the room—he returned in a very few minutes, pulled off his coat, and sat down by the side of the table, and commenced rubbing some of the coin—I then left the parapet—I was gone about ten or twelve minutes, and returned with several officers and a ladder, which I rose to the window I had been watching—I went up first with a crow-bar—the prisoner was sitting at the side of the table with something in her hand like a mould—I forced open the window, and sprung into the room—she jumped up, threw down this mould (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with a piece of cloth round it, and two sixpences in it, and screamed out—the man was not there—she came towards me to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> me, I suppose, but I got into the room, and was followed by Sergeants West and Dunston—I dragged her from the fire<lb></lb>place to the table, and gave her into Dunston's custody—there was a bright fire, on which was this spoon, with white metal in it, in a fluid state—on the hob I found two moulds, one with two impressions of shillings, and one for half-crowns—on the table were twenty-three sixpences, and two in the mould she threw down; also this electrotype-battery, this spoon, and part of another spoon, this acid in a bottle, these thin pieces of silver, a piece of glass, which has the appearance of a mould of two sixpences having been made on it, and these six pieces of timber, which screw together over the door, and it was <hi rend="italic">shored</hi> up at the bottom; it would be impossible to get in; it was not screwed then—it is a frame made the exact height of the room, and pieces to go across (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked her where the <hi rend="italic">Doctor</hi> was—she said she knew nothing about any doctor; no one lived there but her—one of the men I had seen in the room goes by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Doctor</hi>—I knew him before.</p>

I accompanied sergeant Thompson and Dunston—we waited in Park-street—Thompson joined us, and we went to 48, Charles-street, and raised the ladder—I followed Thompson in at the second-floor window—Dunston was behind me—Thompson took the prisoner and delivered her to Dunston—I found this saucepan with white metal in it, cold—it had been melted—these five or six files were on the table—two of them have white metal on the teeth—I found some whitening on the mantle<lb></lb>shelf, in a piece of paper, with a tooth-brush without a handle, in it.</p>

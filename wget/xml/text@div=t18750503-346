                  </hi>. I live at the Kettledrum Tavern; St. George's Street, East—I assist my father—on Sunday evening, the 14th March, there were three sailors in the public-house when the prisoner came in and joined them and they called for brandy and soda—the prisoner was not drunk—I cannot say whether he had been drinking—he appeared to be sober—he spoke to the sailors, they appeared to know him and they spoke to him and addressed him by his name "Antonio"—I thought they had been shipmates together and they treated him on one or two occasions to lemonade and so on, and there were three sodas called for and brandy in each—at the time they were called for the prisoner had gone outside when put on the bar the prisoner came in and he took hold of one of the glasses and said "good health" or something of that kind—he spoke in English, and the man who called for the drinks said "You put that down,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187505030095"></xptr>
               <p>Antonio," that it belonged to him or Jack or somebody, and the prisoner looked very savage and dashed it down, and the party who called for the drinks then said "Call for what you like"—prisouer said "Come out, you b," and opened the door, and the party tried to laugh it off and said: "Nothing of that kind, come and have a drink"—the prisoner-didn't take any notice of that and kept on magging for twenty minutes at least—I thought it would be wise for me to go round and try. to pacify him—I spoke to him and said' "You must not make this raw here to night, Sunday night, these men don't want: to quarrel with you, they seem to be friends of yours," and he said <hi rend="italic">Vot do you want you</hi> b----—?"—I said "I want nothing, you must keep quiet"—while I was speaking one of the sailors caught hold of his scarf round his neck and up with his other-hand to hit him as I thought—put my right hand up before the prisoner's face and the other hand to release the prisoner from the other's grip—while—had my two hauds up and trying to keep order I felt the knife—I could not see him take the knife out—he thrust it into my left thigh and then into my right on the outside—I then put "my right hand up as I thought to protect myself from further violence, and he gave my hand a cut <hi rend="italic">here</hi> just outside the doorway—he made three or four stabs at me which ran through my side in four places—then, I believe, he made three or four more which did not strike me—the knife was afterwards picked up on the kerb by Collins-two customers came across the road and the prisoner made to go off, and got four or five doors further from our house and they ran after him and he was taken into custody—they met a policeman at 200 or 300 yards—he was taken to the statioin—was under the doctor's care for nearly four weeks, I believe, within three or four days—a fortnight last Friday I came out—I bad never seen the prisoner before—he was a perfect stranger to me.</p>
               <p>

I am a coal porter and live in Johnson Street, Shadwell—I was passing the Kettledrum on the night in question and saw the prisoner come out and saw Davis forced out—I saw the prisoner stab Davis in the right band with a knife—he afterwards made several other stabs at Davis, but part of the knife broke off and fell down by the side of the road—a friend along with me picked it up and gave it to the constable—the prisoner didn't appear to be drunk—he was jumping about in the road after ho stabbed Mr. Davis.</p>

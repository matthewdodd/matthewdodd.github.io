                  </hi>. I am a collar-maker, of 13, Brook-street, Holborn. On Sunday, 21st May, about seven o'clock, I went out, leaving no one in myapartments—I returned about half-past nine, and found the street-door open—I went up stairs, and saw a light over the top of my door; the first-floorroom—I called out to the second-floor lodgers to bring a light down—I triedthe door; it was fast—they brought a light—I do not know whether I or thepiisoner unlocked the door, I was so terrified, but I went in, and sawhim getting through the window, which was wide open—I had left it shut</p>

I was in the street, and saw theprisoner getting up—he had just dropped from the first-floor window—his hatwas rolling off the path—I pursued, and brought him back—he had this goldpin in his left hand, and this brooch in his pocket—I found a key on him, which opened the front door; a skeleton key, opening the front-room first-floor, and a latch-key.</p>

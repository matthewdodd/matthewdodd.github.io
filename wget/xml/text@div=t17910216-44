            , stating that he had ready to bring into court the whole of prints and books of the description of which he had been prosecuted, and found guilty of exposing to sale. And at the same time the Attorney General prayed the immediate judgment of the court on the defendant, informing them, that he had, by the desire of a very respectable description of persons in this kingdom, thought fit to bring several offenders before the court of that description; and as to the present defendant,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160087"></xptr>he was not an indigent offender, but on the contrary, in a substantial way of business; therefore an excuse of doing a crime of the magnitude this was, did not appear in the least to have any foundation with respect to him; and it must appear as a further aggravation of his offence, that he was a citizen of London, keeping an open shop in the heart of that city; and yet as such thought it no crime to poison the infant younger minds of the whole of that community, and that this was not by the open and bold attack of vice, which might perhaps put persons on their guard, and be resisted; but it was doing this - Inflaming passions in the young and tender mind, to an immoderate extent, when reason is not a match for them - inflaming those passions which the Almighty has planted in the human breast, for wise purposes; because he did not chuse that it should rest on the cold reason of man, whether he should have an everlasting succession of human beings, candidates for everlasting happiness; that was too great an object to be left to us; but was made to arise from stronger motives of our affections and passions. My lord (said he) to poison then the spring of human society, by thus contaminating the fountain, is a crime of so enormous a nature, that hardly any punishment I can call for can be adequate thereto; and to an offender of this sort, I publickly declare, I never will hear of any compromise in my chambers whatever: no atonement, or degree of atonement, shall be offered in my chambers: but as the defendant has made a full surrender of what plates and books of this description were left behind, I therefore, on his behalf, beseech the court, that he may have the full benefit of that surrender: let not that, in pronouncing judgement, be forgotten in his favour. I trust, therefore, that your lordship will instantly, if you shall so think fit, pass that portion of judgment, which, considering the atonement he has made, may be deemed sufficient for the crime of thus exposing to seduction the more younger part of the community.</p>

            , you have been convicted of publishing a very obscene libel, so gross that common decency will not permit me to repeat any article of what must give offence to all who are here; the tendency of such a publication to corrupt the morals of both sexes, is too manifest and too enormous to require any demonstration; if the print, like the one before us, can with impunity be placed into the hands of those, who would either contaminate their own minds, or for the vilest of purposes, corrupt and debauch the minds of others: in vain will parents, who with anxious solicitude watch the education of their children, hope to see their earliest endeavours to have their morals free from corruption, their conduct chaste, and their religion pure: in vain will parents hope to see their more laudable views for these good purposes crowned with success: because this work before us tends not only to inflame the minds of the ignorant and innocent, to their own destruction; but to make the conquest over innocence more compleat, it is endeavoured to be done by weakening the force of religion, in holding up to ridicule the most sacred characters. I cannot but take this opportunity of expressing my sentiments respecting those very distinguished characters, who have thought fit to bring conviction home to persons of your description, that they merit the thanks, not only of this court, but of the community at large; it shall therefore be the business of this court to give them effect; and as example is the primary object of punishment, and that your punishment may deter others from offending in the like manner, for that purpose I feel myself compelled to pass the judgment I am about to pass, taking into consideration that you have attempted to make some small reparation to society for the offence you have committed, by a surrender of all the books and prints which have been found in your possession; these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179102160088"></xptr>are circumstances that, before a court of justice, ought to have some weight: had you not appeared now so circumstanced, you would have been most indisputably sentenced to the pillory, and then God knows whether, with all the precaution that might have been taken, you might have come away alive: you have taken the most prudent part you could take, and that any man who hath offended the laws of society can take, by making reparation to the utmost of your abilities, in consideration of which your punishment hath been very much reduced, but yet not so much as to take away that impression which it ought to make on your mind, and on the mind of any tradesman who may attempt to do the injury to society that you have attempted, which God forbid any man should do: under these circumstances your sentence is, that you be <rs id="t17910216-44-punish281" type="punishmentDescription">

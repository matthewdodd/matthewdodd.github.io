            . I am apprentice to Thomas Darke Allen and Thomas Shepparson - Cooper was in their service - his duty was to shut up the warehouse, and keep the keys. On the 23d of November, as we were shutting up, he said he had lost one of the screw nuts of the door shutter, and must go into the lower warehouse, where he cleans the shoes, to a bag of straw, and look among the rubbish which he had put into it, to make it look larger - he went down, and I did not see him again that evening, and cannot say whether the nut was found. I kept the keys that night, and at half-past six o'clock in the morning I let him into the warehouse - he opened it, and I went into the lower warehouse. I saw the straw bag in the place where he cleans his boots and knives - he came down and fetched his broom, and went up again. I went away, returned in a short time, and the bag was gone. I suppose Cooper was in the upper warehouse; he came down to clean his knives - I did not speak to him about the bag; he could have taken it from the lower warehouse without my seeing or hearing him. I spoke to Wood about it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Where are the rough linens usually kept? A. In the warehouse below, a few yards beyond the bag.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. At what time in the morning did you see the bag? A. About twenty minutes to seven o'clock. There are five apprentices, one warehouseman, and Cooper. The bag is kept between the two lower warehouse; I was in one of them; the other apprentices were in bed. Wood came down nearly at seven o'clock, after the bag was moved.</p>

             On the night of the 23d I had the key of the lower warehouse, and gave it to Landale at ten o'clock. I was not up when Cooper came in the morning; he told me overnight that if Landale should ask for the nut to say he had found it. Landale spoke to me in the morning about the bag, after Cooper had been below - I had observed nobody else go below; persons might have gone down without my seeing them. Cooper was the porter - the straw was his perquisites; he used to sell it to Dimmock.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 24th of November I was desired to watch these premises, which are in Cheapside, and about ten minutes before seven o'clock! saw Coday go into the house; I could not see who opened the door - he came out in about a minute, with the bag of straw upon his back. I followed him to Noble-street, Falcon-square, and there stopped him, and asked what he had in the bag; he said, "Straw;" I said, "Have you got nothing else;" he said, "Not that I know of." I searched the bag, and found these two pieces of Irish, about the middle of the straw; he said he did not know they were there; I asked who, or where, he got it from, I do not know which - he said he did not know, but he would go and shew me. I took him to the Compter, and then went and took Cooper. The linen weighs 18 lbs. or 20 lbs., and the straw about 16 lbs.</p>

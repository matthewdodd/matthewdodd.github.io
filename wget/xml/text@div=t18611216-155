                  </hi>. On 11th December, from information I received, I went about 1 o'clock in the day, to 21, Mint-street, Southwark—the street-door was open—I proceeded upstairs to the second floor front room, and saw Davis coming out of the room—I stopped her on the landing—she held in her left—hand a florin, in this cloth, rubbing it, I snatched them from her hand, and another florin dropped, I believe, from the cloth—she was then seized by Sergeant Elliott—the florin was wet and partially covered with sand, and her hands were wet and covered with sand—I went into the room and saw Reid in his shirt sleeves at a table—he slipped from it, and threw away a large quantity of counterfeit coin, florins, half-crowns, and sixpences, and went towards the window—I pushed him away from it, and he was seized by Sergeant Brannan—a struggle ensued, and he was thrown on a bed in the room, and a large quantity of counterfeit coin fell from him—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Charcoal</hi>, your time has not expired, before you commence your mis<lb></lb>chievous practices again"—he said, "All right, Mr. Brannan, you don't know all"—I picked Hip fourteen florins, ten half-crowns, sixteen shillings, and, I think, thirteen sixpences, all of which I believe to be counterfeit—I went towards a chair' which stood by the window, and found this galvanic battery in full work, with eight counterfeit shillings on the wire, as they now appear, undergoing the process of electro<lb></lb>plating—there was a saucer on the table containing solution, which I believe to be cyanide of silver; several saucers containing sand and water, and a file with white metal in its teeth—in a cupboard was a small portion of plaster of Paris, in powder—we proceeded downstairs, with Inspector More and several officers, searched the cellars and the back kitchen, and in the copper flue I found five plaster of Paris moulds; one treble one, for two shillings and a sixpence; one half-crown one; a double mould for shillings, one for florins, and a double mould for sixpences—I returned to the room, and placed them on the table before Reid, who said, "You cannot bring them home to me, Mr. Brannan; you cannot prove I put them there"—I said, "That will be a matter of inference after they are compared with the</p>

The first of these moulds is a treble one, for making two shillings and a sixpence; but I find no bad money from that—the next is a double mould for two shillings, one of 1820, George the Third—from that mould here are eleven counterfeit shillings, six from that of 1820, and five from that of 1845—the next is a mould for half-a-crown of George the Third, 1817—it contains the obverse and reverse sides—here are ten half-crowns cast from it—the next is a mould for a florin of 1853—here are twelve counterfeit florins cast from it—the next is a double mould for six-pences of 1839 and 1854—here are thirteen sixpences, seven from the 1854 mould, and six from that of 1839—here are two florins of 1853, which ware taken from Davis—they are from the same mould as the other twelve—Elliott produced four counterfeit sixpences which the woman dropped—three of those are from the mould of 1834, and the others from that of 1859—he also produced eight florins; they are all counterfeit, and from the mould of 1853, the same as the twelve others—here is a half-crown, which has been struck in brass from a die—some of these came out a few years ago, but I have not seen any since—here is a battery with some of the coins in it, which are undergoing the process of silvering, and here is everything necessary for coining.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My mother sent me of an errand, and as I was going along I rushed against a drunken man; I was afraid of him, and went into that gentleman's house, he went backwards in the yard, and came out again, and said I had killed two of his hens, and brought a piece of carpet to wrap them up in; while he and his wife were talking together, some women came down stairs, and one of the women said it was her carpet, and then they sent me to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

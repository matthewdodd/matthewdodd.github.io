On the 27th March the prisoner did work in the stone-yard, and was entitled to one loaf, for which he received an order—I scratched the "1" out with my pen—this is the order—the mark across the "1" has been taken out, and the mark put through the "10" and "lbs." put in instead, which is not in my writing—that makes it an order for 10 lbs. of bread.</p>

On the 27th March the prisoner brought this order to me for 10lbs. of bread—I delivered it to him and made an entry in my book—when he came on the 27th I said I thought the figure "1" had been marked—he said that it had, but it was a mistake on the part of Mr. Baldock, and he had marked the "10" afterwards—I gave him the 10lbs. of bread, and the next day I showed the order to Mr. Baldock and we had some conversation.</p>

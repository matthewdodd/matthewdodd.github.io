                  </hi>. I am a barman, at 29, Cambridge-street, Euston-road—on 27th November, about 9 o'clock, I was at the Crown and Hand, at the corner of Arthur-street, New Oxford-street, with my brother-in-law and his wife and my wife—we took some refreshment, and remained seven or eight minutes—the prisoners came into another compartment, and they both asked me to treat them three or four times, but I refused—when we left they came out by the other door which we had to pass to go home, and Sullivan struck me on the side of the head, and knocked my hat off—he did not speak—he struck my brother, and then Donovan struck my brother, and Sullivan struck my wife twice on the breast, and knocked her down—nothing was said—my wife and another witness went for a constable—we were knocked down, and picked up again near Bloomsbury-street—Donovan afterwards caught hold of me, and I caught hold of his neck-handkerchief, and gave him in charge for an assault, as I did not know that he had taken my watch—the policeman said, "Loose him"—I did so, and saw a piece of my gold chain hanging from my waistcoat—I took hold of Donovan again, and saw a piece of my watch in his left hand—I got my fingers between his, and took the watch from him—I cannot tell where Sullivan was then—I did not see him again till I went to the station, half an hour afterwards, to look for my wife, and saw both prisoners there in custody—I have no doubt that Sullivan is the man who I saw with my watch in his hand—Sullivan is the man who struck me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you been barman at the house you went into? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was no quarrelling; I only told them I would not treat them—I did not tell them that I had not been in place since I left there—my brother did not take up a glass to throw at him; we had our glasses on the counter—no one offered to fight inside—he struck me in the street; I struck him afterwards, and we had a violent struggle—I was knocked down several times, and fought as well as I could to defend myself—we did not close, but he hit me in the wind and knocked me down two or three times—when he held me round my neck I closed with him, but did not see him fall—there was a crowd near us; they did not pat me on the back—I told the police-man that it was an assault; I knew at that time that he had taken my watch—I did not tell the policeman he had robbed me, because I could</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—on 27th November I was with him and his brother and wife at the Crown and Hand public-house—the prisoners afterwards came into another part of the bar, and Dono<lb></lb>van asked my husband to treat him—he said that he could not—Donovan asked him several times—none of our party treated the prisoners—we were there about ten minutes, and, as we came out and passed the other door, Sullivan struck my husband, and afterwards struck me, saying that if he could not him he would hit me, and used very abusive language—I lost a brooch, and my shawl was torn off—my breast has been very painful ever since the blow—I went to the corner of George-street for a constable ten minutes afterwards, and saw Sullivan in custody—I am sure he is the same man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

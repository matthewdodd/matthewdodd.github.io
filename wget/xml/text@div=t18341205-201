We live at No. 40, Pleasant-place, in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth—we rent the house, and live in it by ourselves—the prisoner lived in the same row—about ten o'clock on the morning of Sunday, the 7th of December, we left our house—I went out first—my husband followed about a quarter of an hour after—we went to Hammersmith to bury a child—we returned together about iten o'clock in the evening—my husband unlocked the street door—there it a front and a back door—he unlocked the front door, which opens into the shop—it was dark—my husband went round the counter to cut a can<lb></lb>dle, and kicked against the shop-till on the floor—that was just after he entered the shop—I had seen the till in the morning in its place—it slides under the counter—I had seen it shortly before I went out in the morning—I do not know how much there was in it—my husband gave me a candle—I went next door but one and got a light, and went from the shop into the kitchen, which is if behind the shop—my husband asked me for the light—he went to the door, and we found the top bolt of the back door of the kitchen, which opens into a small yard, had been forced—there is a bolt at the top and bottom, but only the top bolt had been fastened—I had fas<lb></lb>tened the top bolt myself just before I went out—I did not bolt the bottom one—I found the iron staple, which the bolt goes into, had the top screw forced out—it hung on the bottom screw—I went into a neighbour's, and he came in—as I came in at the door again, a policeman stood at the door, and he came in—there is a tree at the bottom of our yard—one of the branches was broken from that tree—it is close against the wall which separates our yard from Elliott's-row, which Pleasant-place communicates with—it ap<lb></lb>peared as if a person had stepped on the branch in getting over the wall, and broken it—it is a little yard—I went up stairs afterwards with a light with the policeman—the bed in the first floor room appeared as if it had been turned oyer—I had not left it in that condition—there was no bedding</p>

I left my house on the Sunday morning, soon after ten o'clock—I had not opened the back door after my wife went out—I locked the front door when I left—it goes on a spring—I turned it with the key, and took the key with me—the shop windows were fast—my kitchen window does not open—when I re<lb></lb>turned at night I found the front door as I had left it—I went into the shop and kicked against the till on the floor—I looked to see what was on the floor—there was nothing else on the floor—the till was empty—there was no money in it—there were a few farthings in it when I had last seen it—I cannot say exactly how many—I took the halfpence out of it before I left—I opened the till after my wife was gone, and left nothing in it, but the farthings—I went into the garden on Monday, and observed one branch of the tree split down from the trunk, as if a person's foot had been put on it in getting over the wall—I missed a telescope on the Monday evening when I returned home—that was the first time I missed it—I had not seen it for some weeks before—Sunday fortnight was the last time I noticed it—it was then on the first floor mantel-piece, in the bed-room—a child had died in that room, and we had not slept there for a week—I had not slept there for a fortnight—I have not seen the farthings or teles<lb></lb>cope since.</p>

             to meet that Evening at the Farthing Pye house, and accordingly about 5 a Clock she went and enquir'd for him there, but was told by Elizabeth Rawlins, that he was with her Son at the 3 Fighting Cocks in Bunning-Fields; That she waited some time for him, and as she sat, a Boy came in to light a Link, and the Daughter went to Bed; so that no Body was left in the Room but her self and Mrs. Rawlins; that at 7 a Clock she heard a Whistling, and at that time Web Rawlins and Johnson brought in the Deceas'd with a Hankerchief about his Mouth, and Callow and Huff were with them: They carried him into a Room adjoining that wherein she was, and they all went in and shut the Door. That she heard a scuffling Noise, and ask'd Mrs. Rawlins the Reason? Who answered, it was nothing but a drunken Man; but the Noise encreasing, she with Mrs. Rawlins step'd to the Door and look'd in, and saw the Person that was brought in, upon the Ground all Bloody; that the Blood gush'd from his Nose and Mouth, and he was dead. That she saw his Peruke, a Spying-Glass, and a pair of Scales upon the Table; that then Webb Rawlins rifled him of what he had in his Pockets, took out a silver oval Tobacco Box, a Tooth Pick-case, a Tobacco Stopper, a Watch, and 50 s. in Mony, and gave them to Callow; that there was a bloody Handkerchief, which Callow brought her afterwards to wash for him. That Elizabeth Rawlins cry'd out (when she saw the Deceas'd Murdered) to her Son, what have you done? My Son will ruin me, At which her Son and Huff presented two Pistols at her, and bid her hold her Tongue: That between 8 and 9, when they found the way clear, Johnson took him upon his Back, and carry'd him cross the Field, and threw him in a Ditch; that she bought a 2 d Cheese Cake, and gave a piece to her Bedfellow. This Evidence was supported by abundance of concurrent Circumstances, as first, That the Deceas'd went from Aldersgate-street between 6 and 7, was met about 7 within 30 Yards of Rawlins's House; that about that time 4 Men were seen there, and 1 came up to a Person going by, look'd him in the Face, and told the rest, It is not him; That the Woman at the next House, heard a noise of Scuffling, and (as she express'd it) one Sqwal; that about 8 a Man saw a Person looking pale come out of Rawlins's House to him, and in a great Consternation stamp'd upon the Ground, and ask'd him, whether he was going this way, or that way? That Miller upon her Examination describ'd the Room where the Deceas'd was suppos'd to be Murder'd, and said that in such a part of it, there was Blood upon the Boards; and upon viewing the Room as she describ'd, there was a place in the Boards had been scrap'd as with a Knife, and some brown spots remaining, suppos'd to be Blood: It was proved that the Deceas'd us'd to carry those things about him, which Miller mention'd were taken from him; and particularly Millers Bedfellow depos'd, that Miller gave her a piece of a Cheescake, and she saw the bloody Handkerchief; and that Webb Rawlins came the next Day being Sunday, and pull'd out a silver Tobacco Box, and beat it to pieces with a Poker, and pull'd out a Spying-glass; which this Witness<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="17081208003"></xptr>looking upon, he swore she must not see it; and Mr. Hampson had such things about him, when Murder'd; with many other Circumstances too large to incert in this Paper. The Prisoners in their defence deny'd the Fact and Huff produc'd several Witnesses, to prove that he was at Home from the Morning till he went to Bed, and was that Night at Supper with some Friends at his own House, which was at Old-street, it being St. Crispin's Day, a remarkable time: Webb and Elizabeth Rawlins produc'd Witnesses who depos'd they had not been from Home that Day, neither had there been any Company at their House from the Morning till their time of going to Bed, except one Man for a Quartern of Brandy in the Morning, and a Woman in the Afternoon for a 2 d Cheescake: Upon the whole, the Jury <rs id="t17081208-23-verdict103" type="verdictDescription">

               acquitted
            </rs> the Prisoners. They were a 2d time Indicted with one James Callow, for feloniously stealing Goods from the Person of Jacob Hamson. But that Tryal depending upon the Success of the other, the Court did not proceed to the Examination of Witnesses.</p>

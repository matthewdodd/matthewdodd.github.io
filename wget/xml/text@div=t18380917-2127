                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>.) I live in Sun-street, Bishopsgate. On the 6th of September I was at a public-house at Ux<lb></lb>bridge—I saw the prisoner there—he laid hold of my arm and led me into the back room, and asked me what I had to sell—he asked for a pint of porter, and then told me to open my box—he took out a ring, and asked what price it was—I told him it was a common ring, the price was only a penny, and he gave me a penny—he then took five thimbles out of N box, and began to toss them about—I did not know what the meaning of it was—another person then came in, and betted with the prisoner—the prisoner said he would bet a sovereign, as I understood; after that the prisoner asked me how much money I had, and showed me a sovereign—I thought he wanted change for it—I pulled out my purse, in which were four half-crowns and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner took four half-crowns and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said "This will do"—I then asked what he wanted—he said, "Don't be afraid; I will give you the money back directly"—he began to toss the thimbles about again, and said to the other get leman, "it is all right," and they went out together—the prisoner had my money—I went after them, laid hold of the prisoner, and said, "Give me my money," as well as I could—in the evening, a person who called himself the prisoner's brother, came and persuaded me to take 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back again, on condition that I should leave the town the first thing in the morning.</p>

I saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor with the prisoner by the arm—he cried out "You have robbed me," and just as I came up, the prisoner said, "Come along with me, I will make it all right"—this was between six and seven o'clock—I took him to the station-house, and the prosecutor described to me, as well as he could, the way he had robbed him—a person came to the prisoner to see him, between seven and eight o'clock, and the prisoner said to the man, "You go up and make it all right."</p>

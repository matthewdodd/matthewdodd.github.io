               <p>Q. Was there any room over the stable - A. Yes, where I slept.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it any communication to the house - A. The stable has not; it joins to the house, but the door is nailed up.</p>
               <p>COURT. That will do.</p>
               <p>Q. On January the 12th were you there - A. At half past four I unlocked the stable; I was then in the stable ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the stable then - A. No; then I locked it up, and came again about a quarter before seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark or light when you left the stable - A. Just getting dusk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to distinguish one man's face from another - A. Oh, yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then there is an end of the burglary.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back at seven o'clock, how did you find the door - A. When I came back the prisoner at the bar was at the door; I asked him what business he had there; he replied, it is my premises; he

             a pistol from his left breast and cocked it in my face; he held his right hand out in this manner, as much as to defy me from touching him; he said to me, you b - stand clear; he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed him, did not you - A. Yes; he ran along Chapel street, Portland chapel, up Edward street into Foley place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen while you pursue I him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you overtake him - A. Yes; before I took him I came up close to him twice, first, he said you b - , I will give it you; he snapped the pistol in my face, at which I saw the fire very plain; he proceeded on again about fifteen yards, to the corner of Duke street, till

             stopped him. I cried out stop thief all the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Gower and you ran and secured him - A. I helped, and secured him of course, and staid by him till he went to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see your great coat last - A. About half past three I saw the coat before I went out; I left it upon a box between the carriage; it is a box that I keep things in, and I saw it when I came back, about twenty minutes after seven.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you been from the stable, from the time you first saw the prisoner, and the time you saw the coat - A. About half an hour; I found the great coat in the place where I had put it; here is a witness will tell about that.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner the first time - A. About a quarter before seven, in my stable. When I went to the door he opened the door and came out of the stable; I asked him what business he had there, he told me it was his premises.</p>

            . I heard the coachman cry stop thief, up the yard; I immediately ran down, and almost met the prisoner; the coachman was close after him, running; in the mean time I ran after the coachman; between the watchbox and the pump in Chapel street he threw that crow down; I immediately went and picked it up; I went immediately to a person that was standing back, took the lanthorn out of his hand, and found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the stable that evening - A. When the man was taken, the boy and I went to the stable, the boy pushed the stable door, the great coat laid against the stable door; he was afraid somebody was there; I went in and there was the great coat, it laid close to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that place from the box in the stable - A. I cannot rightly say.</p>

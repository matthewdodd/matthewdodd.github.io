                  </hi>. I live at Chelsea. On Saturday, 1st September, about half-past ten in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Knightsbridge, and went with her to a public-house—I had a watch in my pocket, which I left at the public-house, and went and got it again and put it in my fob-pocket—the prisoner was then with me—we had some gin, and I was not very sober—I then went with her to a house in Queen's-buildings—I did not get home for an hour and a half after that, and then 1 missed my watch, and a little silver from my waistcoat pocket, and this handkerchief—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>) <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE LAWES</hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Attenborough, pawnbroker, of Pimlico. On Saturday afternoon, 1st September, the prisoner, who Iknow by sight, came and asked 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on this silver watch—I asked if it belonged to her—she said it belonged to her husband who was in trouble—she gave her name "Ann Leary."</p>

            . I was called on the 9th of March to take the prisoner for stealing a sovereign; her husband was there, and thrust his finger into her month - he said she should give it up; he made her month bleed, but no sovereign was found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the White Hart, and the prosecutor came and asked for me; I said, "I am the person - have you come from Scotland?" he said, "There is a friend of your's wants you at the Ship and Shears;" I went - the other woman was there, and some liquor was on the table - the woman asked for a room; I took them to see one: they left 1s. on it, but said they did not like it - we then hadsome more liquor, and on coming out of the dancing-room this woman, who was dressed in black, fell on her back - she then said, "Go and fetch a pot of ale, and we will stop till we have a room;" the prosecutor gave me 1s. to pay for the ale, and when I returned I saw two sovereigns under a table - he and the woman were stooping; I took up the two sovereigns and the silver, and gave it into his hand; but I am innocent of stealing any.</p>

I had a child in my arms; she asked me, whether it was my child; I recollected having seen her and Goddard the night the robbery was committed; but I said nothing of it then, because I did not hear at what time Mrs. Lovelace went out of the house; but hearing next day that she went out about nine in the morning, and knowing that it was after that time that I saw her come out of the house; I discovered to Mrs. Lovelace that I had seen her there.</p>

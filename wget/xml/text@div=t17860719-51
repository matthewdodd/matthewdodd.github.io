My shop-man was in the shop, he is here; the mark is 8 yards 5/8; they are my young man's figures; I can swear to them; I am sure of them; the mark was put on when I took stock.</p>
               <p>What quantity is there of it? - I believe two yards seven eights; it is worth about seven shillings, that is what it cost me.</p>

                  </hi> On the 2nd of Sept., between one and two o'clock in the morning, I went out to get three pennyworth of brandy for my sister's child, who was ill—I met a policeman and asked him where he could get it—he said there was no place open—as I turned away the prisoner came up</p>

               <p>and said he could show me where I could get it—he showed me a public-house, where I got the brandy—I came out and was returning home, the prisoner put both his hands on my shoulders, and pushed me up into a court-way and threw me down violently, so that my head came against the kerb<lb></lb>stone—he then put his knee on my stomach—I called out bitterly for the police upwards of a dozen times—no one came—the prisoner then put one hand on my month, and the other on my throat, and tried to choke me—a man opened a bedroom window and called out to me—the prisoner then jumped up, caught hold of my shawl, and ran away with it—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

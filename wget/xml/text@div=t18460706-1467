On the morning of the 4th of July, I heard a cry of "Police!" in Goswell-street—I went, and saw the driver of a cart—he complained to me that the prisoner and another, who were there, had jumped into his cart with the intention of driving away with it, tad that was the reason he called me—he said he had not time to go to his station—I said, "As he don't choose to charge you, I wish you both to go away"—the other one went away, but the prisoner said he would go away then he thought proper, and he would mark the driver another time—I said, I certainly should lock him up if he made use of these threats—the carter then said, "I don't know whether I won't charge him, if he makes use of that language, and of those threats"—I then took the prisoner by the collar—he said, "Let go"—I said, "I shan't till I hear whether he will charge you"—the carter then said, "If you will go away, I don't wish to charge you"—I let go of the prisoner's collar, and said, "Now you go away"—he immediately up with his fist, and struck me in the mouth, which made it bleed, and loosened two of my front teeth—he then ran away down Bell<lb></lb>alley—I followed him, and <hi rend="italic">G</hi> 151 stopped him—I came up and he had him in cus<lb></lb>tody—I got hold of him again, and he pulled me down upon him, and kicked me under the chin—that was not more than two minutes after the first blow—that kick made my chin bleed very much—there were four constables then—we proceeded from Goswell-street, along Arthur-street, to Golden-lane—when we got there, he was very violent, and kicked me again in the back, which I have suffered from ever since—he then took hold of my * * which tare been very much swollen, and in pain ever since—he was at that time on the ground, and I was down with him—we strapped his legs, but another constable came up whom he knew, and he then said he would walk quietly—I could not follow to the station, I was so much hurt—I was forced to draw my staff—the doctor examined me, and said there was a small bone broken in my back.</p>

On the morning of the 4th of July I was in Goswell-street—the first I saw was Amos holding the prisoner's collar—in a minute or so afterwards the prisoner struck him full in the mouth with his fist—I think Amos had relinquished his hold of him then, and was persuading him to go away—the prisoner ran after he struck, and we all started in pursuit of him—another constable stopped him in a few minutes—I came up directly, and Amos came up the second—directly Amos took hold of him he kicked him under the chin, and blood flowed from it—we all grappled with him, and Amos received another kick about the cheek—after we got to Golden-lane we had a desperate struggle with the prisoner—he was on the ground, and I saw his hand on Amos's * * *—I cannot say whether be grasped them or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 18, Stacey-street, St. Giles's. On 5th December, 1847, I was married to the prisoner at Christ Church, Blackfriars-road—I was a widow at the time—the prisoner stated that he was a widower.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Was I lodging at the house at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; you were lodging with your father—you never lived with me till after we were married—you slept downstairs in the front room, for about a week before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that the first time you knew him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had lodged in the house for some time, for more than a year—his father left before we were married—it was on that that the prisoner changed his room, a week before we married.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I find the money for the marriage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You gave me the money to keep for you—I returned it to you on the morning of the marriage—you are the third husband I have had—your mother-in-law said nothing to me about it—your father said you were a widower.</p>

On the 23d of April, about four o'clock in the morning (it was just dawn of day,) I was disturbed by Edmonds, my lodger, knocking at my room door; I got up directly, went down, and found the cellar flap broken open - I had fastened it myself the night before, by a chain put over a strong iron staple; I found the staple drawn out of the wood - it must have been forced by some iron instrument: my spirit cellar door was also opened; it had only been fastened with an iron bar and wooden pin. I found that brandy had been taken from one of my vats, and have since ascertained that about six gallons were taken - it cost 24 s. a gallon. I missed about three dozen of Sherry, and a basket from the wine-cellar.</p>

            . I lodged at Wordly's, and am a labourer. On the 23d of April, about four o'clock in the morning, I got up, and was going out to work - it was then light; as I came out of the house I discovered two men coming up the flap, out of the cellar; Smith was one of them - I could not see that either of them had anything: they saw me, and ran down King-street. A third man (Mills) came up before them, with a can and basket in his hand; I saw all three come out of the cellar: I collared Mills with the can and basket, and tussled with him - we both<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190023"></xptr>fell into the kennel, and the liquor was spilled. I heard the bottles in the basket break, and the liquor flew out of the can over me; we both got up, and at that instant Smith returned, and gave me a violent blow on the side of my head, by my ear and cheek - it appeared to be done by some weapon, but what I could not tell; it was not with his fist: the blow knocked me down again, and I let go of Mills. I am sure he is the man who scuffled with me and had the can.</p>
               <p>Q. What man went down King-street with Smith? A. The other who escaped. I let go of Mills when Smith gave me the blow; it stunned me: I cannot say whether I received more than one blow. When I came to myself I found several marks about my face, and my nose bled very much. They left me in that state. The prisoners were brought back by the watchman in about ten minutes.</p>

            . I lodge at this house. I got up a few minutes after four o'clock, being awoke by the noise; I heard another scuffle, opened my window, which is nearly over the flap, and above fifteen feet above it, and saw three men in the street, Healy and the two prisoners; I saw Mills running up King-street, crossing the road; he had a milk can on his arm: Smith was beating Healy (who was down on his hands and knees) with a stick thicker than my thumb, over the head and shoulders - I thought them very heavy blows, and called out, "For God's sake don't kill the man;" I called the watchman four or five times - he kept repeating the blows for a minute and a half I suppose - Smith then ran away - I hallooed Watch! all the while, and saw them brought back in about ten minutes, and knew them again. Healy had blood flowing from his face, nose, and eyes. I still looked out of window, and called Wordly.</p>

A great deal of liquor was spilled on the pavement. Day begins to break about half-past three o'clock in April. Healy said positively that the prisoners were the men - that one struck him, and the other was the man he took hold of, and Edmonds said they were the men.</p>

On the morning of the 23d of April I heard a rattle spring - I came out of Bryanstone-mews, across George-street, and saw the two prisoners come out of Brown-street, both running towards me; one had a milk can: when they came up to me they looked very pale, and much out of breath; I held my stick up, and stopped them; they asked what I stopped them for - I said I had heard a rattle spring; they said they were going about their business, and I had no right to stop them, I sprang my rattle; they started from me, and ran off; I followed, and Robinson stopped them, before they got out of my sight; we took them to the King's Head, public-house; Healy immediately said he could swear to them: he was bleeding very much, on the stones - it was rather a damp morning.</p>

               <p>EDWARD WORDLY. This basket was in my cellar the night before - I have no mark on the bottles: I have tried the strength of the brandy left in the can; it corresponds exactly with mine: the can is not mine. I lost three dozen of Sherry, worth 8 l. 2 s.</p>
               <p>SMITH'S Defence.

               <p>MILL'S Defence. I was going to work at Mr. Gardener's - I turned into the corner for a necessary purpose - this man seized me, and said, "What are you doing here?" he began kicking me; my shins are not well now. Smith knew nothing of the robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. I live on my means, at 4, Maria Terrace, Stratford—early in January, 1878, I purchased a plot of land at Wellington Road, Forest Gate—I employed the prisoner to negotiate the purchase for me and paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his trouble—about the middle of January I had a verbal arrangement with him to do the building for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I said "If you can do it for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you shall have the job to do; how much shall you want a week?"—he said 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "I will give you 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you are to buy the building materials for me in the cheapest market, and if you can build the houses for anything like 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will sell them and give you half the profits; you are to buy everything, but nothing in your own name; I will pay ready money for everything"—he entered on the ground and began opera<lb></lb>tions immediately—he was to engage the men, and I was to pay them every Saturday, but I told him I was not allowed to—I visited the work some<lb></lb>times three or four times a day, and sometimes I did not go for a week or a fortnight—he used to come to my house on Saturday morning for money for the payments if I did not take it to the works—he never gave me any account—he would never let me know what he had spent—I said on several occasions "Let me know what you want and what you are doing with it," and that I was not going to part with hundreds of pounds in that loose way without looking for an account of it—I paid him every week the money he required, which included the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his wages—about the middle of March I got this account-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and took it to him and wanted him to enter the men's wages, but he said that that was such a bothering affair of Proctor's—I next saw the book on 27th April, when he gave it to me filled up as it is now—the last date is 20th April—it is made up from 29th Jan., and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is put down every week against Nicholson—every bricklayer and carpenter's name is down—April 20 is the last date I gave him money—I gave him a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque on that day at my house on his word, without seeing the book—I knew that he was working on Mr. Proctor's property, adjoining mine, at the same time—I believe I was on the premises on 26th April, and saw a quantity of timber and flooring boards both inside and outside the premises—the prisoner had bought that timber for me of Messrs. Carter, these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the invoices—I had paid all these accounts but this one, which I have paid since—they are made out in my name—the last time I saw that timber on the premises was Saturday, 27th April, and also some slates, which were stacked against the wall at the back of the premises; they had been purchased of Mr. Alfred Braby—this is the invoice with my cheque attached (<hi rend="italic">For</hi> 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—I paid that on 4th June—the prisoner was not at work on 27th April; I was there a little after 5 a.m., and waited till about 6.20—I saw him about 7.30 over the railway bridge, and asked him what sort of a game he was up to—he said that he should put the shutters up at 11 o'clock—I told him he was not master yet—I saw him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060095"></xptr>
               <p>again about 4 p.m., but not at work—I had employed him to work—he was in the bar of the Tower Hamlets Arms—I had been to my premises and could see by looking through, that the materials were there, but the doors were barricaded up to keep any one from going in, there were no shutters—he said "My men are waiting over the other side, and want paying"—I said "There have been no men at work for me there," and there would not be above three or four men at work that week, it being Easter week—he handed me the book and said "Here is your book;" he was beastly drunk—I did not give him any money that day, and he never did any more work, but I saw him on the premises—I employed another man—on the Thursday, which was the next time I visited the premises, Nicholson's labourers were carrying bricks and mortar off my premises to Proctor's; I had sold Proctor the bricks—there was not a foot of timber left and not a slate, except four or five broken ones—the scaffolding was all gone; Nicholson had provided that as arranged between us—the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week was for the use of the scaffolding and his wages—I then went to see my solicitor and charged the prisoner with stealing the timber—I did not charge him then with stealing the slates—he had authority to use the bricks at Proctor's but not timber, because I could measure the bricks—I gave Proctor authority to use the bricks, not the prisoner—I decidedly did not give the prisoner authority to use on Proctor's premises the timber I had bought</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I did not swear before the Magistrate "I was drunk also as the others were"—Mr. Yelverton said to me "Perhaps you were drunk as the others were," and I said "Perhaps I was"—I will not say whether I was drunk or not—I was landlord of the Tower Hamlets up to 27th December, 1877—I was there ten years and eight months—Mr. Proctor succeeded me—he bought the house of me—I have known Nicholson six or seven years—I know he has had practical experience as a builder—we had no written agreement—I did not say before I started "Fred, I have 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to speculate with, and I will do the building if you will buy the ground cheap"—I called him Fred, so does everybody else—I said "I will have them built as cheap as I can"—I may have said "We will build them as cheap as we can," but I have no recollection of it—two plots of land were bought of Mr. Paul for 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Nicholson bought them for me and was paid for his trouble, and there was a society in my name—nine other plots were bought of Mr. or Mrs. Cook—I sent Nicholson inside while I was out of the house and he bought them in my name—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Mr. Reynolds's office for his trouble—I have got no receipt for it—I think I gave him half a sovereign for his trouble in respect of the Powell plots—on the nine plots I bought of Mr. Cook I am erecting two cottages and a shop for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was to divide the profits with him after he got it done for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I said if he got them done for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I would sell and give him half the profits—he got his 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week besides—on my oath the 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week was mentioned before we started—I know a man named Tayler—he was not employed by me to make up the accounts between me and Nicholson—the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week was not suggested by Taylor as a fair charge for the use of the scaffolding and plant—there was not to my knowledge a piece of ground in the Woodford Road bought of a person named Haws for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know the name—know nothing of a piece of ground in Woodford Road bought of Haws for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and sold to Bartlett for 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not agree that 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. should be knocked off for expenses,</p>

               <p>and that 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. should be for me and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Nicholson—one Sunday morning Nicholson came into my house and said "Just put down on a piece of paper what money I have had of you," and I began to put it down on a half-sheet of note paper—while I was doing so, he said "There is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. half profit"—that was the first I ever heard of half profit; but he asked me to put it down, and I did so under his dictation; but I knew nothing of Haws' transactions, and I never received 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from anybody—I went into the cellar to get him a glass of ale, and he took the paper away—I know nothing of Bartlett's transaction for 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or that with Haws' transaction for 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there was 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. profit to be divided between us—this paper pro<lb></lb>duced is my writing decidedly—I did not hesitate to say so before the Magistrate; but part of it is not my writing—my attention was called before the Magistrate to this, "Half profits, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," in my writing—I did not say a word before the Magistrate about the story of the Sunday morning which I have just volunteered, or about the prisoner's taking the papers surrep<lb></lb>titiously—I did not tell the Magistrate I did not know what "Half-profits, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." meant—I did not expect to see my own writing; it was stolen out of my house—this is all money lent on I O U' s—I will not pledge my oath that I had I O U's for every 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. put down—some of these items are identical with what I call payments of wages, it is what he had of me to pay the men with—this is all put down as money lent—I made it out simply from Nichol<lb></lb>Son's dictation, and was not aware that it was going out of my house—I do not know whether the sums on this paper are identical with sums in my ledger advanced for wages—it is not the same in my ledger as it is on this paper—here is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down in February, and on the paper it is 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not find 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, making 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I find 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 22nd in the ledger—there is in my ledger a sum of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 16th February; but it is on the 9th on this paper—the next to that on the paper is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 22nd, and in the ledger I have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 22nd—on the 23rd I find 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the ledger and on the paper—those sums added together make 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not given I O U's for that—that was in April—I lent him a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque at Peckham and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after<lb></lb>wards, and he gave me an I O U for 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I hold a mortgage deed for—no doubt the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the ledger on 15th March is the same as 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the paper on the 10th March; but I wrote it at his dictation—this account written at his dictation, was not compared by Taylor in my presence—I did not make all these entries in the book at one time—here is "January balance, due to me on settlement up to this date, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I have not got a receipt for that—that is the money I lent him to pay Isbrook, who he was building for, who went away without giving him the money, and I have never received it back—Taylor said to me one day "Nicholson has got a paper in your writing"—I do not believe Taylor ever saw my ledger—I know he is here—there is no entry in the ledger "Half profits, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>"—I have not torn it out from this very book: I could not—this represents all the money I have let him have on the buildings—the 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a portion on 122<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was money lent him on a mortgage deed—it has nothing to do with this—some property was sold, so that Randall should make out a list to a man named Kitson, and afterwards he sold it to some one—I took posses<lb></lb>sion of the deeds, and handed them all over to Mr. Harling, of Fetter Lane except the mortgage deed to Blackdon for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mr. Harling gave me the letter of acknowledgment—I did not say one word to Mr. Harling or Mr. Capper about the mortgage deed—I told him that I wanted very nearly all</p>

               <p>the money—I directed Randall and Son to write this letter to Mr. Harling. (<hi rend="italic">Dated 29th April</hi>)—he used his own discretion as to what he wrote—I told him to write "There is a mortgage for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which Mr. Randall paid off"—I paid Blackstone 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then I stood in the position of Blackstone—when disclosed the mortgage I demanded 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lent him 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. one day to pay Pavitt for the stock on his place—that 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not there at all—I make up the 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up in this way; he bought a lot of furniture, and he came hack the same day and asked me to let him have 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay Pavitt, which I did—that is how I say I am entitled to 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is made up of 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which I hare an <hi rend="largeCaps">IOU</hi>, and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay Pavitt—that leaves the other untouched—I have sold a portion of those three plots to Mr. Proctor, and received a deposit from him of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I do not know on what day—I did get 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him—Nicholson did not point out to me that it would be disadvantageous to part with the piece I was going to sell—he pressed me to sell it to Proctor, or else I should not have done so—he said Proctor was going to build a stable—I then sent Proctor back a cheque for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not say to Proctor that my partner had pointed out that I had done wrong in undertaking to sell that piece of ground—I did not say to Proctor in Smith's presence "I have done wrong," as I did not know what my partner would say—Smith is a man I never was in company with, but he used to go in front of the bar—I sold Proctor 15 feet of land—he never had more nor less than I sold him first—there was an arrangement to build half of a wall 7 feet high—that was not at the same time as the sale—when I sent his 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back he came to my house and I was lying on a couch—I sent it back because he wanted me to build a 9 Inch wall 7 feet high, and I would not—I agreed to build half of it, and said he should have the bricks at what they cost—I had nothing to do with the labour—I knew nothing about a coach house and stable going to be built, but it is built—I did not promise Proctor to build a coach house and stable at the cost out of my own pocket—I did not speak to Nicholson to get his consent to that arrangement—I do not find the bricks charged in this book—here are 3,000 old bricks charged at 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the bricks charged in this account were not Fruend's bricks, nor were they used in building this very wall and stable for Proctor—I took criminal proceedings against Nicholson on the Monday after 1st May—he came to me one Sunday night when I was going to bed, and I would not see him—he could hear me tell the servant to say so—that was the Sunday before he took the things away, and on the Monday I went to Mr. Handall, a solicitor, and we took the summons out on the 6th May—I attended on the first occasion of the summons being returnable—it was dismissed—it was put down to be called on at 12 o'clock, and it was called on at 11, and we therefore had a fresh summons granted, free of cost—the slates were not charged before the Magistrate—I do not think we had missed them—I have seen a gentleman here who supplied the slates—I called to pay for them because they were put on my houses—they said they did not know Lancaster—I then said, "Nicholson is building for me," and they referred to the ledger, and found that Mr. Nicholson's name was entered, but they did not even know him—that was on the 4th June—it was headed 26th April—the invoices were sent to my foreman—I never had it till the day of the receipt—the slates had no business to be supplied in Nicholson's name—I had never seen the invoice—they were put on the houses before the invoice was sent in, and that is how</p>

               <p>they knew how many slates were used—the houses were roofed in on 26th April, bar the back kitchens, and there were slates on the ground—I went to pay my debts after Nicholson was committed lor trial, and found that he was charged by Mr. Brady with the whole sum 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not charge Nicholson with having unroofed my houses—I went on 4th June, and paid the account entered in Brady's ledger to Nicholson, and then I charged Nicholson with stealing the slates—I know nothing about this account of battens, gutters, and other articles, or whether Mr. Fruend supplied those goods to Nicholson—if they were used on Proctor's job, that has nothing to do with me—I have not got these things on my property—no such materials have been used—this is for ironmongery—no nails had been used, as none of the flooring in my houses was done at this date—those nails were used on Proctor's job—he was doing the job for Proctor—I have not said in the presence of witnesses, George Baylis being one, "I and Nicholson are doing the work at Proctor's at cost price"—here is a bill of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on this file, not one item of which has been on my premises—it is for ironmongery—here are two or three more of them—I did not say in Baylis's presence, or to him, that Nicholson was going to build the place as cheap as he could, and that he and I were going to divide the profits, nor did I say in his presence that I had 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to speculate with in building, and was going to make a man of Nicholson, or words to that effect—Baylis was not employed to do the plumbing of the houses—he fitted some gas up, and charged 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and here is the receipt—I did not complain of his charges—he did not lay on the water that I am aware of—I know of no other plumber than Baylis being employed—about the time of the sale of the land to Proctor for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I did not say to Edward Barritt "I shall get into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with my partner Nicholson, and I do not know what I shall say to him for letting him have the land so cheap"—I know Thomas McGovaran, landlord. of the Pigeons, Stratford—I cannot say what I may have said in a public-house bar—it may have been that McGovaran put the question point blank to me "Who is going to build?" and that I said "Fred Nicholson," but I don't think that he asked me, because he well knew—I did not say to McGovaran "I and Nicholson are going to sell the house when they are up, and then divide the profits between us;" I should say "I shall sell them"—I said "I shall give him half the profits if he does it for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I did not say to McGovaran that I had given Nicholson instructions to do the work at Mr. Proctor's—I have been served with this writ (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to wind up a partnership which was never in existence; to have the accounts taken, and there never were any accounts to take.</p>

               <p>he did not hand me this book—I made the entries about January or February—the whole of these entries down to "Miller 1—7 1/2;" must have been made at different times—I went to Nicholson's to make up the book once a week or once a fortnight—I pledge my oath that the entries were made at dif<lb></lb>ferent times—he gave me the materials from which to make them—Mr. Lancaster knew I was making a book up, but he did not know anything about the 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. till I told him what I was charging—I said at the police-court" I received the instructions to make up the book as regards the charges, from the defendant"—Mr. Lancaster did not know anything about it till he had the book—I said "Fred, Mr. Lancaster is charged 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for scaffolding," and he said "I do not think much of that"—I have seen Nicholson since his committal for trial—I told him months before about the scaffolding—Lancaster knew nothing about the charge except the 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I wish to add that to what I stated at the police-court—Mr. Yelverton cross<lb></lb>examined me there—it was not my business to remember everything there—my deposition was read over to me, and I signed it; but there are lots of other things I remember now—I did not notice that I had omitted saying any<lb></lb>thing about the 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I tore the pages out of this book, it was an old book of Mr. Pavitt's—I do not say that the page was torn out of Mr. Lancaster's book, but what I saw in it I do not see now—it was Sunday morning—I cannot tell whether it was the 30th February—I hare seen that book on more than one occasion that I have been at Lancaster's house—I cannot say whether I made this alteration on February 25th, the date which it bears, it was in in cold weather—it was on the date whenever it was that I compared this slip of white paper—I compared the accounts up to the 16th March, but all I know is that it was on a Sunday morning—I was not asked a single word about the half profits—I was sworn to tell the whole truth—if I were to tell you all that passed, it would take 12 months—I said I always supposed the claimant and defendant were to share the profits—I never saw this white paper till Saturday—I was not asked by Mr. Yelverton whether there was not an agreement to share the profits—I did not say that there were, because I could not remember everything—no question was put to me as to the page being torn out of the ledger, and I did not say a word about it—I will swear that that paper was not put to me in the police-court, IIford—I know the solicitor instructing you—I will swear this paper was not shown me at the police-court—I was not asked questions about it</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Braby, of Bangor Wharf—I wrote this letter of 9th April, and sent it to Mr. Nicholson. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he ordered a truck-load of slates to be sent to Stratford station on Thursday morning</hi>.) I also wrote this letter of 10th April: "Dear Sir,—I enclose order to the station-master for truck-load of slates as arranged"—on 17th April I wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the slates had been delayed in consequence of the illness of his wife</hi>)—this invoice was sent from my firm to Nicholson about 26th April, and on 4th June Mr. Lancaster called—he gave his name—I said "I do not know the name"—he said "Perhaps you know the name of Nicholson?"—I said "We have a customer of that name on the books"—he intimated his wish to pay the amount for the slates—I referred to the ledger and found that Nicholson was charged, who was our customer—we knew nothing of Mr. Lancaster till that day—a copy of the account was made out, and I drew out this cheque for Lancaster, which he signed, and a day or two afterwards I got the receipt altered to his own name, but I was not present—he got one of the clerks to alter it when I was not there—I gave a proper receipt, which has been suppressed—the other one was destroyed at the time, so our ledger-clerk told me—Lancaster called some days afterwards and claimed the return of 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the carriage and cartage of the slates, in answer to a note sent him by one of our clerks—there was no doubt about it in our minds, because he had already paid the account, and on 15th June we signed this note and sent it to the prosecutor with the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.: "Please receive herewith 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. carriage and cartage of slates.

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Nicholson had to cart them to the ground, but that was included in the price—all the work was done before 26th April, when we completed it—it was taken at so much per square.</p>

I am a dairyman and market gardener, of Forest Gate, near the Tower Hamlets public-house—I have kown Lancaster seven or eight years, and Nicholson about four years—I was at Nicholson's house on a Sunday in January when Lancaster called—he and Nicholson both came in together—Lancaster said "Well, I have sold a plot of ground to Proctor for him to have a stable and coach-house built on—what do you think of it?"—Nicholson said "Well, as you have done so it will alter all our arrange<lb></lb>ments, and we shall not be able to build the five cottages as we were going to"—they were there together most of the afternoon, during which time Lancaster said "Well, Fred, if you are not satisfied I will send the deposit back; I have given no receipt for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Nicholson's boy afterwards drove Lancaster home in the pony trap—one evening I was at Nicholson's house with my wife and my sister-in-law and a cousin, when Nicholson said to Lancaster "I have bought a plot of ground"—I cannot remember the name of the person who he said he bought it of, but he said "I have sold it again for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. clear, free of conveyance"—that was the profit—he said "Fred, that will do; there is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for each of us; that will be 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for you, and the odd 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you can have for your expenses"—I was in Procter's</p>

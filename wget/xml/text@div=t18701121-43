               <p>told my husband it would come to that; I was compelled to pledge it, by his orders"—I said "You will be charged with stealing it"—she said "I did not steal it, my husband stole it"—she gave these pawn tickets to Sherwood—we each took part, and I said that he had better take possession of them all—there are thirty of them, seven of which refer to this material.</p>

I am in the employ of the London and South-Western Railway, as a detective—on 22nd October I went, with Woodrow, to Mid<lb></lb>hurst, in Sussex, to Waller's house—we walked into the shop, and I called out "Mr. Waller"—he said "Come in"—we walked into the parlour, and Woodrow said "Have you sent any Post Office order lately to London?"—he said "Yes, I sent one to Godley"—Woodrow said "Where if the stuff he sent you down?"—he said "There are two small pieces there," pointing to the doorway—Woodrow said "I want two large pieces"—I took the candle from the table, and opened a door leading from the parlour to the stores—Waller and Woodrow followed me—in toe first floor front room, on a box, by the bed, I found these two pieces of stuff (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with a num<lb></lb>ber of other things on them, cotton print dresses, and two or three parcels of men's stockings—I said "Oh, here it is"—Waller said "Yes, that is it"—Woodrow asked him where he bought it—he said "Over Westminster Bridge"—I said "Where there?"—he said "In a soup shop, where I met Godley"—we asked him how long he had known Godley—he said "I knew him when he was a porter at Elstead Station," which is near Midhurst—we said we should take him to London—he said "I wish he had been at hell, and the stuff too, before I had seen it"—he sells crockery and picture frames, and china and earthenware pans—I was present when this hawker's licence was found on Waller—he was taken in custody.</p>

I am Police-Inspector of the South-Western Railway—the porters are under my directions—Godley was employed at Guildford as porter in 1858—he was afterwards removed to Elstead, which is about six miles from Midhurst—he was at Elstead eighteen months—that was in 1846, and went from then to Virginia Water—he ceased to be porter in the service on 10th October, 1868—his wages were 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week at Elstead, and 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at Virginia Water.</p>

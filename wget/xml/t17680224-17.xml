On the 15th of January I was out; when I came home, my wife told me she had been robbed of the things mentioned, and described the boys at the bar. Buller was taken that night for another offence, the other was taken the next morning; I went to Buller and asked him about the things; he owned he took them, and that they had sold one buckle for a penny, and that Cox had the other in his hat; he denied the brass weight then.</p>
               <p>Q. How old do you take Buller to be?</p>

We took him to Clerkenwell; he gave us an account where Cox lived; we called upon Cox's mother in Bunhill-row, and found him in a cock-lost; his mother told me he was but 11 years old; he owned to being with Buller in taking the buckles, but would not own to the weight; we found at last where that was sold, and the person that bought it is in court.</p>

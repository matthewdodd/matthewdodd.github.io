On the morning of the 27th I had occasion to go down stairs; I left no one in my room. I left two watches without cases in my drawer. I did not go out of the house at all. There are eight single men lodgers in the house. The prisoner was a lodger in the house; he was in the house at that time, but not up. He lodged in the back room, on the same floor with me.</p>

            Whether he was dressed or not he could pop out of one room into the other - A. Exactly so. When I came up I had occasion to go to the drawer. I missed one of the watches, and afterwards the second. I wrote the description of the two watches on the back of some cards of my address; I went round to the pawnbrokers. I saw both the watches at Marlborough-street office. I took the prisoner in custody; he acknowledged to the fact. When I took the prisoner, I said, you have stolen two watches from me; he said, he had, without any promise of favour or threat whatever. On the prisoner being taken to the office he was searched; the two duplicates were found upon him by the officer.</p>
               <p>THOMAS STANTON. I am shopman to Mr. Lowther, pawnbroker. The two watches were pawned with me at one time, I believe by the prisoner; I advanced one pound two shillings upon them. I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are the watches that I lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to George Lynes, a clothier of High Street, Stratford—on 15th July, about 6 p.m., I was called into the shop and saw the prisoner there—I saw a bulk under her shawl; she said Please show me some trousers to fit a boy about six years old"—I showed her several pairs, but nothing would suit her—she said that she would call again, and was going towards the door; I put my arm before her and said "Did you come in with the intention of buying a pair of trousers?"—she said "Yes"—she came back from the door to look at a coat and dropped these trousers from under her shawl folded in half—I had not sold them to her—I said "You see what you have dropped there"—she said" Do let me go, I have got six dear children at home—I sent for a constable and then found—she had dropped three pair of trousers and a pair of knickerbockers, value 25*., which I missed from the counter.</p>

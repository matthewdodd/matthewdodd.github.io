I am a bombardier in the Royal Artillery attached to the Military Police—on this Saturday night, in consequence of information I went with Carter to the coffee-shop—I saw the prisoner come, and he stopped her—I went up and told her she was accused of stealing the gunner's watch, and asked if she knew anything about it—she said, "I know nothing about his watch, nor yet about the man"—I said, "He tells me he has been in your company a short time ago"—she still denied it—I told her I should hare to detain her till I found a constable—I saw her trying to change something out of her hand into a muff that she had, and told Carter to seize hold of her hand—he did so, and took the watch out of her hand, and handed it to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I was shopman to the prisoner, at his shop in Upper Whitecross-street. I entered his service on 11th June, 1851—he had not another shop at that time, he had afterwards in Chapel-street, Islington—I remember a fire happening at the shop in Whitecross-street on 24th June—previous to that fire the prisoner had spoken to me about a fire being likely to happen—it was four or five weeks before, I cannot exactly say—he talked about his wanting to get some money, and said he was in difficulty—it was something to that effect, that he wanted to get some money somehow or other, and he thought it would be best to fire the place and get some money from the Insurance office—he conversed with me on that subject more than once; he used to speak very frequently of it—I do not remember exactly the words he might have used, but he was frequently speaking that he intended to fire the place, and they were making preparations for it—he directed me to pull down some of the ceiling in the front cellar—that was the portion of the cellar under the end of the counter, near the back of the front cellar—that was the night before the fire—no one was present when he gave me that direction—I pulled down the ceiling that same evening, and put it into a bag and carried it away, and shot it behind Pickford's wharf in the York-road—while I was taking down the ceiling I saw Betteridge, and he said I had not pulled down enough, I was to pull down some more—he told me where to place the rubbish—he told me he required the ceiling to be removed to put some empty barrels and boxes underneath, in order that the fire might get through the shop quicker than it would if the ceiling was not removed—I <hi rend="italic">eased</hi> a board under the counter, I mean I wrenched it a little up—it was not loose before I loosened it; it could then be lifted up and down—Betteridge directed me to do that—Mr. Betteridge had an errand boy of the name of William Warner at the shop in Whitecross-street—Warner was not on the premises on the night of the fire; he was sent into the country on the Tuesday before—Betteridge told me that was because he had better know nothing about it—a dog was kept at Whitecross-cross street—it was generally kept in the cellar—he was loose, and could go into either cellar—there are two open doorways between</p>

               <p>the two cellars—the dog was not at Whitecross-street on the night of the fire, it was at Islington—I took it there on the Thursday, the day before the fire—I also took some goods and a coffee box—there was some tea and two boxes that were taken from the house—what they contained I do not know—they were not stock from the shop, but something from the house—there were two boxes of tea, the coffee box was empty—it is a box which stands on the counter, with three partitions in it for ground coffee—I believe it was a japanned box—it generally stood on the counter, or somewhere where it might be seen—it was a very good box—there was another coffee box at the shop in Whitecross-street that had been there from the Tuesday night before—it came from Mr. Rose, in Old-street-road—I went there by Mr. Betteridge's direction to fetch it—I paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he had told me how much I was to pay—the time I took the coffee box to the shop at Islington was the last time I was there before the fire— Betteridge directed me to pile up the boxes and chests in the cellar under<lb></lb>neath where I had taken the ceiling down—I did so—I placed several empty barrels, and tea boxes, and sago chests, that I fetched from the yard, and some chest lids from the shop—I did not place anything else there, besides the boxes—there was no paper there; after the shop was closed, I put some paper near the cellar door—the shop was closed a little after 10 o'clock—Mr. Betteridge and his housekeeper Charlotte Webber were present when I placed the paper there—Mr. Betteridge told me that it was put there for whoever went down to light it—Webber was present, but she might not have heard that said—we all had supper together that night; and I went to bed a little after 11 o'clock—Mr. Betteridge told me I was to go to bed, and he would call me before the fire got dangerous—I mentioned to him about my clothes—he said there was no chance of its going so far as the top of the house where I slept—I do not know whether either of the prisoners went to bed that night; I went to bed and left them up,—I was called up by Mr. Betteridge, I should think between 12 and 1—he had on his trowsers, shoes, shirt, and braces—I also saw Webber; she was in the same room with Mr. Betteridge; that was the second floor front—she had not her gown on, but she had some underclothes on; what they were I do not know—I went down into the second floor front room, where the prisoners were—the engines had not arrived at the time I entered the room, nor had the fire escape—before they came, and before any one had given the alarm, Mr. Betteridge said to Webber, "Had we not better give the alarm?"—she told him not to be a fool, to let them find it out—I believe the police gave the alarm, there was no alarm from inside the house; the fire escape after<lb></lb>wards came, and by that left the house—we went over to Mrs. Seward's, on the other side of the street, for a time—Mr. Betteridge came there, but did not stop there—we went back to the shop; it might have been an hour after, I cannot exactly say, it was as soon as the fire was put down-next morning Webber told me that she lit the fire because Betteridge was a coward—she told me the fire was lit about 12—since the fire Betteridge has conversed with me about it—he said it was put out a quarter of an hour too soon—on the Wednesday after the fire I went to the Monarch Insurance Office—Mr. Humphreys, the surveyor of the Company, was at the shop; and said he wanted me to go with him and Mr. Fogo—the prisoners knew that Mr. Humphreys had asked me to go there—I saw Mr. Jay, Mr. Humphreys, and Mr. Fogo there: I made a communication to them—on my return to Whitecross-street, the prisoners asked me where I had been to; and I told them: and what was said, and I told them—they were both present—I told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185208160033"></xptr>
               <p>them that the people at the office knew nearly all about it; and Webber said they did not, they had only been <hi rend="italic">pumping</hi> me—she asked me if I had said why I was to take the ceiling down,—I said, "Yes,"—and she said, if I had not said why I was to take that down, she could have got us out of it by saying that the ceiling fell down into her washing, while she was washing—I know a boy of the name of Ensor—I did not give him anything the day before the fire—I saw some books given to him by Mr. Betteridge; they were the shop books; I believe one was a ledger, what the others were I don't know.—(<hi rend="italic">A plan was here produced, and the witness pointed out to the Jury the different portions of the premises, and the position of the fire.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there any lodgers in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the place where I pulled down the ceiling was in the front kitchen, underneath the counter—we generally sat in the kitchen, except on Sundays—the kitchen is behind the store room—the store room is the front room first floor, and the kitchen is behind the store room up one pair of stairs from the shop—then there is the sitting room and a bedroom behind it, where Webber slept—m y master's bedroom had been the store room until the day before the fire; then he removed into the sitting room on the floor, that is a story higher—when I first went into the prisoner's service, Webber was in the country for two months—I was not an apprentice.</p>

               <p>was required? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, the one that was at our place would not touch a rat, or go anywhere near it, to my knowledge—I have seen him run away from a rat—I only knew Mr. Cook from his being with Mr. Betteridge—he had been with him about six weeks, or it might have been more—it was four or five weeks before the fire that Mr. Betteridge first began to speak to me about it—I was not in the habit of going out with Cook; I assisted in clean<lb></lb>ing the shop at Islington with Cook before it was opened—I did not take my meals with him then, I came down to Whitecross-street to meals—I was there nearly all one day, and I think I was there a little time after that—I was not in the habit of going out with Cook at any time, not to my know, ledge—I do not remember that I have been out with him—I have never been out with him of an evening, nor of a Sunday—I have certainly walked with him little way towards his house; the way I was going—he lived in River-street, King's-cross—I have been to his apartment there—I do not know who he used to go and see there—I have been there two or three times; he did not invite me, I think I called upon him; I do not remember that he invited me—I have never spent the evening with him there, merely called for a short time—I have not been there with him on a Sunday, not at all that I remember—I have never spent the Sunday with him—there was a woman living in River-street, I do not know her name—I have not, to my know<lb></lb>ledge, been there with Cook, except the two or three times that I called there—if I had spent a Sunday with him I could not have forgotten it—I have been with Cook since this matter was investigated at the Police-court—I was with him at Islington, in the same shop where he was—that was after Mr. Betteridge was taken into custody—I think I was in the shop with him nearly a week—he and I were carrying on the business with a young man named Chalmers, who came there on the Saturday night—I have been at Cook's house since that, I do not know how many times; it might have been two or three times perhaps—it has not been a dozen times, I swear that—I went there to visit him; I used not to spend the evening with him, nor the day—I went there merely to speak to him, to see him—I might have had business with him—I went to see him—perhaps I had not any business with him—I do not remember that I had any particular business with him, perhaps I had not any—I went to see him as a friend—I have not spent any Sunday with him since, or taken any meals with him—I have had a cup of coffee at his house one morning—I was there about 10 o'clock, not to breakfast; I had had my breakfast—besides that, I do not remember that I ever drank with him before or since—as near as I can recollect, I think it was between 12 and I when I was roused out of my bed on the night of the fire—I am not able to say whether it was nearer 1 than 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever been spoken to by Mr. Betteridge about going down into the cellar with a candle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, not often; perhaps I have more than once—he has not blamed me for that—he has blamed me for doing things in the shop, if I did anything wrong—that has not been very often of late—he told me after the fire, that I was to say that I went down into the cellar with a candle—he told me to say that—I have mentioned that before—I have not told it to the attorney for the prosecution—I do not remember that Mr. Bet<lb></lb>teridge has complained of my going down into the cellar with a lighted candle—I went to bed on that night, knowing that the fire was going to happen, I undressed myself, and latched my door—no one could get in from the outside without forcing the door open—I went to sleep, and was roused out of a genuine sleep; I did not sham sleep, I could not help going to sleep; I tried to keep awake—some of my clothes were in the bedroom.</p>

                  </hi>. I formerly lived at 46, Chapel-street, Islington. I was employed there, as shopman to the prisoner, from the commencement of May—that was about the time the prisoner took the shop—we were not doing the trade we expected we should do—about the 10th May the prisoner told me that he contemplated setting fire to his house and premises in White-cross-street; that he should do it for the sake of claiming a greater amount from the Insurance Company than he was insured for, or the goods that would be destroyed rather.</p>

               <p>that—there is no mistake about that—I know River-street—I lodged at 23, River-street, previous to going to Chapel-street—I was not in the habit of sleeping there while I was in Chapel-street—I used to go there to get something for dinner next day, and come back to the shop and sleep—I might have a bit of supper there, and go back to my own place to sleep, because I had no one to cook for me at the other place—Judge has been to River-street to see me since this occurrence; he knew where to find me—I have no recol<lb></lb>lection of his calling on me there whilst I was at Islington—he might have called on a Sunday—I would not swear that he has or not—he has perhaps called on me three or four times, or perhaps more, since the investigation at the police court—he had no particular business with me—he merely called as a friend, I suppose he is a stranger in London, he has no relatives here, nor have I—a Mrs. Cableton lives at 23, River-street—Mr. Betteridge never complained to me that I had let her have some tea without paying for it—he never said a word to roe on the subject, I can explain the circumstance you allude to—the party I had appartments with was in the habit, from the first commencement of our business, of ordering a few things every week, which was regularly entered—I believe hers was the first order in our book—she gave an order for two quarter pounds of tea to be sent in one parcel—she brought the tea back in the afternoon, and said, before the parties in the shop, "You have made a mistake with my tea"—she took it out of a basket and I did it up in two quarter pounds, and she carried it home—no com<lb></lb>plaint was made about that, but a person called that night and said that he had followed Mrs. Cableton from the shop, and tried to make an accusation against me in the presence of Mr. Drew, who is sitting there, it was about 12 o'clock at night, I do not see the person in Court who made it—Mr. Betteridge did not make any complaint—he was then in custody—Mrs. Cableton is a married person—her husband is away at present, and is expected home soon—he has been away for some months—I am not married—before I came to Mr. Betteridge I lived in the Gray's Inn-road, with a Mrs. Palmer, managing a business—I was there rather better than twelve months—I have been for a short time on the Croydon and Epsom railway—no other—I was discharged from there in consequence of a reduction taking place in the number of hands for the winter months—that was the reason given me—I had been there about four months—I have been at Exeter—I was there perhaps a month or six weeks—I was never on the Great Western line, or any branch of it—it was about 10th May that Mr. Betteridge made use of the expressions to me about contemplating the fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You never communicated with the fire office until it had happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know what office he was insured in till after it had happened—I made an inquiry the week before, but did not find out—when I say I made inquiry, allow me to explain, the shop in Chapel-street was about being insured, and the policy was sent back in consequence of the name being spelt wrong, and some other errors in it, and I merely asked if the policy had come from the same office—that had no reference to the fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But at that time you knew the fire was going to happen, according to your account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew the prisoner had spoken of it, but I never thought be would have nerve to do it, and I have said so before—I have lived at Brighton, in Weston-street; I carried on business there—I left suddenly without paying my rent, but I left stock to pay it, and the rent was partly paid when I left, if not nearly all paid—my creditors inquired after me, and I instructed one to sell the goods and to pay themselves, and they were paid as far as it would go—I left early in the morning, by the 6 or 7</p>

               <p>up train; I do not know which it is, three or four years ago—I took the key of my shop with me as a matter of course—I cannot say what amount of dehts I owed at that time—I do not know how much was paid—I never had any account given me, and never inquired for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have any proceedings been taken against you for the recovery of anything beyond what you left stock for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; on the other hand I have since done business with one or two of the parties, they gave me credit, and would be glad to do business with me again—they know where to find me; it is no secret—no proceedings of an adverse character have been taken against me—one party who supplied me in Chapel-street knew and recognised me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand you to say that you did not believe the man would set fire to his house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought he never would have nerve to do it, as I said before—I first learned that he was insured at the Monarch, on the Satur<lb></lb>day after the fire, and either on the Monday or Tuesday I made a communi<lb></lb>cation to them of the facts—I had a communication with Mr. Jay—I was lodging with this Mrs. Cableton; I had the use of a room, and she cooked for me, and attended to my linen and so on, previous to my going to Chapel, street; there is no other connection between us whatever—her husband is a petty-officer in Her Majesty's service, so I have been given to understand, and at present on service—I believe she was the first person who opened an account with us at Islington—at the time of the transaction about the tea, which has been mentioned, Mr. Betteridge was in custody, and I have never seen him since—Mr. Drew was in the shop at the time the person came and made the complaint—Mr. Drew was acting for Mr. Betteridge, as he told me, and had his affairs assigned over to him—he gave me my discharge from Chapel-street—I think he is acting as attorney for Mr. Betteridge, that is the gentleman (<hi rend="italic">pointing to him</hi>)—when I was discharged from the Croydon and Epsom line the inspector told me that those who had been the last taken on were the first to leave when a reduction took place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you keep on the lodging in River-street, after you went to Chapel-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but I paid Mrs. Cableton for washing and cook<lb></lb>ing for me, and I used to go there on a Sunday to meet her brother, and drink tea and dine with him—if Judge came there he would find me there, but I have no recollection of his spending an hour or two with me—I do not recollect ever giving him any coffee there—I might if I was having breakfast, but no invitation ever passed that I am aware of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the district A, of the fire-brigade. I went to the fire about 2 o'clock in the morning; it was out then—I was with Alfred Wilson, and John Crampton, who have since met their death by being crushed in a fire—I examined the premises with a view to ascertain how the fire originated—(I had not then heard any account from the boy)—I considered it originated in the front cellar—there was an aperture in the floor of the shop, at the end of the counter; and the flooring was burnt at that part—the end of the counter was burnt off about two feet each way—the aperture appeared to have been opened purposely for the fire to go up—the boards appeared to have been loosened by some parties, and they were loosened by the fire as well—it was burnt through in one portion—those boards formed part of the fabric of the house—there were boxes and things piled up under the aperture; not immediately under it, but a foot or so from it—the fire would pass through the hole as through a funnel, which carried it into the shop—one board was burnt through, and the adjoining board was loosened, as though it had been prized—I concluded that the fire came from the boxes—the boards were not burnt immediately over where the fire was—if there had not been a hole, it would have burnt immediately over the fire, instead of burning where it did, which was a foot and a half or two feet on one side—the opening caused a current of air to carry the fire into the shop—I was led to suppose, by the end of the counter, that there had been two fires—at that time I did not know that a portion of the board had been prized; that would account for all the appearances which presented</p>

               <p>themselves—the fire had burned the basement of the shop, and the house was severely damaged by heat, and it had burnt all the goods in the shop—the flooring'of the shop forms the ceiling of the cellar; it was burnt through, the joists were charred—six or seven feet square of the flooring and joisting were actually burnt—the fire must have arisen in the cellar, at the staves, tea-boxes, and chests, immediately under where the greatest action of the fire ran—there were no combustible materials there which could have caught light; it was merely kept as a lumber place—most of the boxes were lying under where the fire was, or within two feet of it; but there was a vast deal of water from the engine, and that might have washed away some—there was a copper in the back cellar; it had not, in my opinion, been recently used for washing; the flue was broken down—there was a ceiling to the back cellar; a portion of it was broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had the engines been playing before the fire was extinguished? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I got there at 2 o'clock, it was extinguished then—the water injured the stock in the shop, but it was not displaced—Judge and Mr. Cook were examined at the police court before I gave my evidence—it was my opinion originally that two fires had taken place—the flooring at the back of the counter was entirely burnt, about two feet square I should think—some portion of the board which was prized was burnt—it was lifted up—it was near to the aperture at the end of the counter—I did not notice any nails in the board that was lifted up—I looked at it without touching it, because I would not displace it—from the basement, the joists over your head were very much burnt—the fire would have gone up between the joists which go through a party wall, and up at the end of the counter, which caused a thorough draught, and the fire would rush to it—that is my opinion—there was no other draught, and no other trapdoor open—I do not think there was any window—I saw no light through—there was no trapdoor that I am aware of—I did not examine to see if there was one—I had no occasion to do so, in my opinion—I saw there was no place to see daylight through—there are open iron gratings under the window, but it appears to be filled up, as no daylight can be seen when you are in the cellar—I did not examine it at all, I had no occasion—I was there two hours, or two hours and a half.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said your opinion originally was that there were two fires; where do you suppose them to be, one in the shop and one in the cellar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; one at the end of the counter, in the shop, and one in the cellar—I did not find the boxes piled up, they all appeared to have been burnt more or less—there were no boxes immediately under the hole, they were about two feet and a half or three feet from it—there were marks of fire immediately above the burnt boxes, but it did not penetrate through there, but seemed to have gone towards the hole—the ceiling was not burnt through until the hole was reached—the loosened board was that nearest the burnt boxes—I account for that by the fire going up and passing over a wall which is between the two cellars, crossing the house parallel to the street—the fire did not go into the other cellar at all—the joists rest on the wall, and formed a kind of funnel for the fire in passing over the wall—the floor comes across the reverse way, and a current of air goes across the wall, to where the board was loosened, and where the hole was—there were marks of the fire as if it had gone through there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing there had been no air admitted by the board being prized up, then the natural action of the fire would have been in the cellar? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but as it was, it burnt into the shop, the aperture would let in the air, and the fire would go that way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surveyor to the Monarch Fire-office, and live at 61, Leaden hall-street. I produce a claim made by Betteridge; I saw him afterwards upon it—he claims 164<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—among the things claimed for I rind 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. charged for a coffee box—I first saw Betteridge about the matter on Friday morning, 25th June, the morning after the fire; I asked him if he could account for the fire, and he said, "No;" he supposed it might have been from the gas, a gas burner being over one end of the counter, which was burnt—that was the only way in which he could account for it—I asked him to let me have his claim on the following day—he promised to do so, but. I did not get it from Churchill, his agent, till the Monday following—on the Tuesday I went to assess the claim—I did not examine the premises, I examined the stock; the insurance being on the stock, fixtures, and furniture—I think clothes were not included in the insurance; there is no item in the claim for clothes—I noticed the remnants of a coffee canister, and gave it into the hands of a policeman, who now holds it—on the Wednesday morning, in consequence of information I received from Mr. Jay, I asked Betteridge where he had purchased that canister—he said he had purchased it of a hawker that came into his shop about three or four months previously—I asked if he could tell from whom—he said he could not; it was a stranger, who came into the shop hawking goods—there is only one canister charged for—as far as my recollection goes, I think he said he purchased this because the former canister was worn out, but I will not say positively—I went down into the cellars to examine them, that was after we had received the informa<lb></lb>tion</p>

               <p>—I observed the hole that had been spoken of by the fireman, and like-wise the board (<hi rend="italic">referring to the plan</hi>)—this represents the basement story—this is the front cellar, and this the back—the great body of the fire seems to have been near the centre of the front cellar, the under side of the joists of the flooring boards were here severely burned—the two deceased firemen and I were in the cellar, and our first impression was, that there had been two fires, because it was so very much more scorched in one part than another, and we could not account for that, except upon the principle that there had been two fires—then it was afterwards revealed to us that this board on the top step had been prized up—I could see that—the fire had actually burned away the boards in the lower part of the floor—here is an area of about 4 feet 6 inches—the burning away here covered an area of 2 feet 3 inches by 1 foot 1 inch, or 2 feet by 1 foot; making a superficial area of about 4 feet 6 inches upon this area that was burned away; but the intensity of the fire had evidently been here—this fire had not been set alight in a very <hi rend="italic">professional</hi> way, because there was no exact funnel, no draught for it—these casks must have burnt for a considerable time, and then have burned the under side of the ceiling; but without that board being raised up, most likely the fire would not have extended into the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there any nails attached to this board? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was burnt away—the nails remained, and are there now, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> They were there, were they? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say that my observation was drawn to the nails exactly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would this board being prized up account in your opinion for the fire having reached the counter and shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I do not think the fire would have reached the counter, but for the board having been prized up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you think that the fire would have gone to the hole first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did—the great body of the fire is here—the fire had not gone through any of the sound boards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It burnt the adjoining board to the one that was raised up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I think the fire first burnt up, and then burnt down again, having acquired a hold here—it burnt through the board that was prized up—this is the board (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out on the plan</hi>)—I saw no marks of anything being used to force it up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If I understand you, you do not think the fire would have got at all into the shop by its own force? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not unless a draught of air had been made by raising the board.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any other mode by which a draught could have been created except that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; all the other apertures in the walls, both front and back, seem to have been closed by brickwork—there was no window, nor any trap door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you draw this plan? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, for the office—before I drew it I did not give any notice to the prisoner or his solicitor to attend with any surveyor to watch—I had no instructions to do so, it was ray own impulse to do it; at least I had no instructions from the office to do it; I thought it would render the matter clear—it is customary, if a surveyor has to survey premises that are to be purchased, to give notice to the other side, so that two surveyors may go through the premises, one on each side —I should do so in an ordinary transaction—I did not do so on this occasion—if it had been thought of, or desired, I should have been very glad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you think it would have been but fair to have done so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185208160043"></xptr>
               <p>am not conscious of having done anything unfairly in this matter, my atten<lb></lb>tion being now drawn to it I should have been most happy to have met another gentleman—the casks that are put in the plan are merely sketched in, not for the purpose of ornament; they represent what I saw at the time—I cannot say that these casks were there; there were eight casks there on the Saturday morning when I was there; a portion of them were burnt, very considerably, and some not—they were knocking about the cellar—they are put together in the plan, as nearly as I could do it, to afford information—there was a funnel formed by the joists of the ceiling between the cellars and the shop, through which a current of fire would pass rapidly—that funnel led towards the part that was burnt—the flooring was burnt to the extent of four foot six, superficial—I am sure there was no window to the front cellar—I examined for the purpose of seeing, and there was none—there had been an aperture, but it was bricked up, both back and front—I should think from there being no other aperture the fire would pass through this funnel with the greater rapidity—there was no trap door, or any iron grating, through which a light could get into the cellar—I examined on the Saturday, with reference to that—if there was any iron grating it must have been bricked up, it was not visible—I do not think that great heat could cause wood to bend, there is not much expansion in wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not known instances in which there has been a severe fire on one side of a street where the shutters of the houses opposite have actually been bent by the heat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have seen the paint blistered, but here where the great portion of the fire was, the floor was intact, it was not injured on the upper surface—the aperture is under the counter—the fire does not appear to have ascended through the ceiling, except by this aperture—I should say that heat does not bend wood—I have not known the shutters of a house opposite a fire bent by the heat without being burned—I do not know of any such instance—I do not believe it could be possible, except it was unsea<lb></lb>soned wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We have heard a good deal about a funnel; if there had not been some aperture in the floor, would there have been any draught in the cellar at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, is it possible that the action of the fire could have raised up that board? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I think not.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner Betteridge received a good character.</hi>)</p>

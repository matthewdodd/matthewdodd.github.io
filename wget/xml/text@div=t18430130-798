                  </hi>. I am a plumber, and live in High-street, Deptford. On the 23rd of Jan. my servant placed four coppers outside my window; two of them were taken—I have examined these two, and have no doubt whatever that they are mine.</p>

I was on duty—I saw a man resembling the prisoner with a copper on his head—I followed him down Old King-street—in coming near to Fishing Smack-alley I lost sight of him all at once—I returned and met the prosecutor, who said that two coppers were stolen from outside his shop window—about half an hour after the prisoner came out of that alley and down King-street—I took him into custody, and told him I suspected him to be the man that stole two coppers from High-street—he said it was not him—I asked his name—he said Williams, and he lived in London—I went to his house, and on Tuesday the 24th found these two coppers in the cellar under the apartment where he lived.</p>

On the 6th of April, I received a letter, containing a five-pound Bank of England note, from my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge with you - A. Yes. The postman came to the door; I was ill; this woman offered her service; I have a large family. In the time I looked out the money, she took in the letter of the postman; when she delivered the letter to me, the seal was broke, she said, the note was not in the letter, and the other said, she broke it open; it had been in no other hands but her's and the postman's; I heard the note in her hand, it was a five-pound note; she said, Mrs. Ford, if you will give me your key, I will lock it up safe; I had two keys to the drawers; I gave her one of the keys directly, and I retired into a little room, to answer this letter of my brother's.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the letter mention its containing a five-pound note - A. It does. I expected, as she had offered to mind my family, she would not go away.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when the letter came - A. About eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the note in her hand - A. Yes. I see her put it into a drawer, and lock it up, before I retired to answer the letter. I left the key with her. About half after four I got up, intending to have tea; I came out of the room, into the other; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181505100030"></xptr>missed the prisoner; I asked my children, where was Mrs. Simms; they said, she had given them a penny-piece to spend, she was gone out. I immediately went to my drawers, I looked them over about two hours, it was a large chest of drawers, in hopes of finding the note; I did not look into the drawers until I missed the prisoner, and then I missed the note. I had a man lodger of the name of Thomas Spencer, he went in search of box; he found her on the 13th of April, and brought her home, it was on the 6th of April, when she took the note. I asked the prisoner how she could be so cruel as to take the note; I told her, she was a most base, ungrateful, woman, to take it from me; she said, she was very sorry, she had never had an hours peace since; I should have six pounds for it, in the course of a day or two. I sent for a constable, and she was taken up.</p>

            Might not she have put it into her pocket, without putting it into the drawer - A. No; I watched her carefully; I could not walk; I saw the note go out of her hand, put up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When the postman brought the letter to the door, Mrs. Ford, did not I call you - A. Yes, and while I was looking the money out, the letter was broke open.</p>

            . I lodge with Mrs. Ford. I was sent to seek after the prisoner; I found her between twelve and one o'clock, in Fore-street, on the 13th of April, I tapped her on the shoulder, and asked her what she had done with the money she took from Mrs. Ford; she said, she had spent it, and was very sorry for it; I took her to the watch-house first; she wanted to make her escape from me; I left her in charge at the watchhouse; I went to Mrs. Ford, and brought her to the watchhouse, and then we all went together to Mrs. Ford's; she told Mrs. Ford, she was very sorry, and in the course of a few days she would give her six pounds for it.

I had an execution out against me, and I broke into the money to pay it, and if Mrs. Ford would have shewn me mercy, I should have made up the whole five-pounds.

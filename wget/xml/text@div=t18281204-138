On the 30th of October I was at a wharf in Tooley-street, looking at some potatoes; the prisoner came and recommended some to me, and I bought four sacks - he asked me to let him take them to my house, to which I agreed - he got a truck, put the sacks on it, and I assisted him part of the way, then gave him my address, and agreed to give him 1s. 6d., which was to be paid at my house: I parted with him between twelve and one o'clock- I got home about half-past two; he had not been there: I found him the next morning, at the next wharf to where I bought them - I asked him what he had done with them; he said he met a person who gave him something, and got him tipsy, and then he insisted that he should sell the potatoes, which he did, and spent the money; he shewed me the house that he sold them at, and the persons shewed me the potatoes, but would not deliver them up - the Magistrate would not grant me an order to get an officer to take them.</p>

I bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040061"></xptr>three sacks of potatoes of the prisoner, for 11s. 5 1/2d.; I asked where he got them - he said he bought them of Day, and he shot them down: the prosecutor came the next day, and claimed them, but I thought I would not give them up, as I gave the full value for them - I recommended him to give charge of the man; I attended before the Magistrate, who told me it did not signify if I kept a sample of them, and brought them here; the prisoner appeared to be drunk, but he could walk with them quite steady - I sold them at a loss; they were very bad ones: I am no great judge of them-I have been but three months in the trade: I had mixed them with some others, as I had no place to keep them separate.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my door a little after four o'clock, and I bought the other sack of potatoes of him; he had been drinking, but was not very drunk - he brought them into the shop very well; I paid him 3s. 4 1/2d. for it; they were very indifferent potatoes - I mixed them with some others in my cellar, which I sold; I have not been long in the trade: he told me they were his own - I heard afterwards they were not, but I sold them; no person told me I must not sell them - he swore by all the powers above they were his own, and thought they were.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I agreed to take the potatoes home, and he told me he was coming; he went with me to the top of the street, and then gave me his direction - I cannot read; I pulled the truck into Smithfield - I met a man, and asked him to assist me; I gave him the direction, and he said it was not Saffron-hill, but some street in Cheapside - I went there, and it was not there; I then went back again: the man gave me a glass of gin or two - he took some of the potatoes, and shewed them to the woman first - she sent her boy, and said she would give me 2s. 6d. per cwt.; I left it, and said the sack should go back - I said,"I shall have to make the money good when the man they belong to comes down." I took the sacks back to the wharf.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you any other Christian name? A. No; nor any partner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How had they broken into your house? A. Into the cellar, and then through the partition into the shop; the underneath part of the shop was secure the night before - we never open it; we had only been in the house four weeks - the partition was safe; I lost property amounting to 23l.; it is my dwelling-house.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. In consequence of information on the morning in question, I went to some lodgings, in which I found the female prisoner, and the male prisoner was sitting getting his breakfast; my brother officer went into the room first, and said, "Halloo, Joe! your name is

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It would fit any box? A. It might; I was never at the woman's lodging before; the man behaved remarkably civil and quiet - we told him he was a prisoner, and he went without resistance; I did not know him before, and cannot say whether he lodged there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Bishop, who keeps the Grange public-house, Grange-read, Bermondsey—On Thursday, 15th Jane, the prisoner came in and asked for a pint of half-and-half—she gave me a shilling which I put in the till, there were no other shillings there—the pri<lb></lb>soner went out and about ten minutes afterwards I went to the till and took out the shilling and found it was bud—I had not served any one in the mean<lb></lb>time—I gave it to ray husband and he broke it into four pieces, and threw them at the back of the beer engine—on the following Saturday I was at the bar and the prisoner came in again, with a man—she asked for a pint of half-and-half—I served her and she gave me a bal shilling—I broke it with my teeth and threw it on the counter—the man took it up and threw it away and the prisoner then paid me with a good shilling—my husband came down</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186507100066"></xptr>
               <p>and gave her into custody—the man went away—the prisoner said I was a wicked woman, it was a good shilling she had given me first—the next day a little boy, Benjamin Cole, brought a shilling to our house—my husband showed it to me—this is the shilling I broke the piece out of—I recognised the prisoner when she came the second time, I am quite sure of her—one of our customers found three pieces of the first shilling at the back of the engine where I threw them—I saw him pick them up—these are the pieces (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 35, Model Buildings, Streatham Street, St. Giles', and am a carpenter—the prisoner is my son—on Saturday afternoon, 7th August, between 5 and 6 o'clock, on ray return home, I found him in my bed-room, trying to extinguish a fire, which was at the end of the mat<lb></lb>tress at the foot of the bed—the mattress was filled, with shavings, and I could see them on fire—he appeared to be putting the bed-clothes over the end of the mattress, and was lying outside of the bed—I had to get through the window into the room, in the same way that he had done, the door being locked, and the key at a neighbour's—I ejected him as soon as I could open the door, when he threw a flower-pot at my head—he had been drink<lb></lb>ing, but was not drunk—I had had no quarrel with him—4 did not see whether he was smoking—I afterwards gave him in custody—the mattreses was not much burned; the blankets and sheets were singed—the prisoner is a carpenter, and has worked for the same firm as myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Is it a fire-proof room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The buildings are fire-proof, and are on the model principle—there were flames to be seen—you have not quarrelled much with me, but you have with your mother, most awfully—you were not at work that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 38, Model Buildings, and am a pianoforte-maker—I know the prisoner and his father—on Saturday afternoon, 7th August, I saw the prisoner break the window of his father's room, and enter it—he remained inside for a short time; then he came out again, but pre<lb></lb>sently re-entered the room—I saw smoke come out, and I looked through the window and saw that the room was full of it—I called to a neighbour, and said that the prisoner was setting fire to the place, and it was time for us to interfere—Martin and I spoke to him, and whilst doing so his father came up—I saw that the shavings in the mattress were en fire—the father opened the door, pushed the prisoner outside, and we all three then ex<lb></lb>tinguished the flames.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner live in the house at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—after he had broken the window I saw him look at his finger, as if he had cut it—he had been drinking—his father asked him what business ha had there—I know that he smokes tobacco, but I was not aware that he had been smoking that afternoon the father drew the burning shavings from the mattress, and trampled them on the ground—I believe there was powder and ball in the room, belonging to his brother, who is in the rifles—as soon as I looked in I saw the smoke—that was after the prisoner had gone to the second time.</p>

I live at 36, Model Buildings, and am a labourer—on the day in question my attention was called by the last witness to the pro<lb></lb>secutor's room, and on looking through the window I saw the prisoner sitting on the bed, apparently on the left side, and with a pipe in his left</p>

               <p>hand—the mattress was on fire, and with his right hand he was in the act of putting out the flames, which were not high—I said, "For God's make, what are you doing?"—he said, "Nothing"—after his father had pushed him into the street, he said, "If the old woman had been there, the whole lot would have gone."</p>

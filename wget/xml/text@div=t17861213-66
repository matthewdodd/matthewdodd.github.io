               <p>I am a patrol of Mary-le-bone parish; at two in the morning I heard something fall, about twenty yards off; and I made up to the report; it was by James-street; and I seized the prisoner at the top of the iron rails; I saw a man coming with something under his arm; he saw me, and turned back into Gray's mews; I followed him, and saw this lead standing up against the wall; he then turned down Grey-street; I followed him and kicked this hold-fast before me; I waited to see who came for it; and in half an hour after the prisoner came past the end of the mews, and stopt the space of a minute: then he turned into the mews and caught hold of the lead; for a minute I stood against a door way; I caught hold of his collar, and we took him and the lead under his arm to the watch-house; we took the lead to Mr. Evans's and it fitted exactly; it was taken from the top of the door; it weighs twenty-five pounds.</p>

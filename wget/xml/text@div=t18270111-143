On the 26th of December, about nine o'clock in the evening, I went to the barn, and gave my horses about a bushel and a half of oats, barley-meal, and bran, mixed, and in consequence of suspicion I laid down in the barn; in about ten minutes I saw the prisoner come in with a candle - he looked round, then went up to my horses, fetched a tub, and took out all their food from the trough; he was taking it towards his own horse - I jumped up and said he had been robbing me in that way for a month - he said he never took any but once before; he set the tub down - what became of it afterwards, I do not know, but he says he put it into the trough again - I went away, leaving him there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You have the barn between you? A. Yes, he has one end and I the other - he only has one horse; I never gave him corn - I quarrelled with him about two months ago; I did not threaten to get him turned out of the barn - I never gave him leave to use my corn - I did not take him that night, as he was a strong man, and I knew him - I was afraid to collar him.</p>

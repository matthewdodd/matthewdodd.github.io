            . On the 23d of December, about eight in the evening, the prisoner came into my brother's shop, and asked to look at some children's ribbands; our journeyman served her with a yard, or a yard and half, which she paid for. I was marking some ribbands I had bought that morning; she came and looked at them, and desired me to cut her a yard and half off a piece she fixed on. While I was cutting it off, she took up two pieces which were lying on the counter, and dropped one of them into her apron, which was tucked up; her stays preventing it falling into her apron; she was obliged to shrink her belly in to let it fall in; I saw it in that situation; she paid me, and went out. I called to my man, who was then shutting up the shop to stop her, which he did; the ribband being not found upon her, I ordered her up stairs into the kitchen; my mistress and the servant searched her, but the ribband was not found. We had no other piece of that pattern.</p>

               <p>I did not take the ribband. I was searched; I had only the ribband I bought.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Camberwell—on Saturday night, 22nd February, about 12.15, I was in Victoria Street, Westminster, with Isaac Golding—we passed two men at the corner of Strutton Ground, and directly afterwards met a woman carrying a can of beer in her left hand—she deliberately knocked the can against Gelding's leg—the beer was spilled, and the two men ran up, caught hold of Golding, pulled him into the road, threatened him, and demanded 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the beer—I was then standing on the pavement, and just at that time the prisoner ran up out of Strutton Ground—he is not one of the two men—he said, "This is my wife, and if you do not pay for that beer, I will pay you," and put up his hands to Golding in a fighting position—I stepped off the pavement, in front of him, and said, "Do not do anything too rash, my friend, for I have seen all that took place, and my friend is not to blame"—the prisoner said, "You are a witness, are you, you b——?" and took the can out of the woman's hand, and hit me a deliberate blow on the head, the scar of which still remains—it did not stun me, but it knocked me back nearly three yards; and at the same time he grasped at my watch, which was in my waistcoat pocket—the two men then said, "Let the b——have it"—I tried to get away—the others kept hold of Golding—the prisoner had got away a few yards when I missed my watch—it was quite safe before; I had looked to see the time, a few minutes before in Victoria Street—the woman was on the pavement, and said, "For God's sake, do not go back, you will get murdered;" and they all three ran into the Broadway, three men and a woman—that was not the woman who told me not to go—there was a lamp close by, at the corner—I was smothered in blood, and did not give information till next morning.</p>

I am a horsekeeper, of 54, Page Street, Westminster—I was with Harding, in Victoria Street, on the evening of 22nd February—I have heard his evidence; it is correct—I saw the prisoner strike him with a can, and follow him up and grab him by the waistcoat, where his watch was; but I saw nothing in his hand—I was robbed at the same time, and lost twopence from my trousers pocket.</p>

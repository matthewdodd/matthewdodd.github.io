                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 179.) On the evening of the 6th of December, I was on duty on Sydenham-common, near a beer-shop—I saw the prisoner come out of the beer-shop—he was not so drunk but he knew what he was about—he used bad language to the landlord and land-lady, and threatened to smash the windows—the landlady came out and gave him in charge—I took him—he struck me three times, and then he turned, took his knife out of his pocket, and said he would rip my b—y guts out—I prevented that by knocking his hand back—the blows which he gave me hurt me.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the beer-shop on Sydenham-coramon. The prisoner came in several times, and wanted beer—I would not serve him, and he threatened to break the windows—I went out and called the police-man—Brett came—I saw the prisoner strike him several times, and they had a long struggle, at last Mr. Wren assisted the police in taking him.</p>

I came to Brett's assist<lb></lb>ance—he had got the prisoner on his back, and he was violently kicking and fighting, as he laid on his back—when I came up, the assistant left him—we were obliged to hold the prisoner on his back till we got the handcuffs on him—he kicked me several times as I was taking him—I have got the marks on my legs now—he said several times that if he had his hands at liberty, he would rip our b—y guts out.</p>

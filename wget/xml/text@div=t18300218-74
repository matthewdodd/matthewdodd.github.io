On the 25th of January I saw the prisoner, who was a stranger, about five yards within the warehouse, with two copper measures in his hand - he was going out with them, and got out before I stepped him; I laid hold of him in the street - he said he had picked them up, and was going next door to see if they belonged to them; I had seen them on the premises not a minute before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had rang the bell before he took hold of me. Witness. He had not rang master's bell - I am positive I saw him take them out of the warehouse; they had been about five yards from the door.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CHAMBERS. I am a wine-merchant - I have no partner. I know the measures to be mine - they were kept in the warehouse, on the ground-floor, and are worth 35s.</p>
               <p>JAMES WEBB. I received the prisoner in charge - he said he had picked the measures up. and was going next door to inquire if they belonged to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I can only say I picked them up. and took them up the passage - I saw a person take them out of the warehouse, and turn down Walbrook with them- he put them down; I went and rang the bell to take them into the house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

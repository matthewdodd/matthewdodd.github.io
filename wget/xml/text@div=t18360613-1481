                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward William Kemble Turner, who kept the White Hart, Clement's-lane, Strand. This copper was taken from the wash-house there, on the 7th of May—I did not see the prisoner in the house that day—I went out about six o'clock or a quarter after, and was not at home when the copper was taken—I saw it the last thing before I went out—it was fixed in the kitchen—I set a basin on it—I returned in three quarters of an hour and it was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the public-house on the 7th of May, between six and seven o'clock in the evening—I was sitting on the bench when the prisoner came to the bar and said to me, "Will you favour me by changing seats with that female?"—I said, "Why?" but I took my seat and the prisoner went from the bar towards the stairs, where the kitchen is</p>

               <p>situated—I took my seat, and the female, in a few minutes after, who was sitting by my side, said, "There he goes with the copper"—I turned my head round, and saw the prisoner go out of the front door with a copper.</p>

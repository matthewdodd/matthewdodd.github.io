               <p>I am servant to a cheesemonger in White-hart-court, Bishopsgate-street. On the 24th of February, a little after eight in the evening, I saw the prisoner and another man come out of <placeName id="t17790404-11-crimeloc63">White-hart-court</placeName>

I went after the prisoner, and asked him where he got that linen. He said, what is that to you? I secured him, and brought him back, till I made an enquiry whether there had been any robbery committed. On enquiry, Mrs. Holbrook came and owned the linen: A constable was sent for, and he was carried to the Compter. When he was examined, he said he found them.</p>

               <p>I was at a neighbour's house; I was called, and told that a man came out of my bedroom window. I came home and found two drawers quite stripped. I went to the cheesemonger's and saw my things. I have seen the prisoner before, he sold cutlary ware in Bishopsgate Church-Yard.</p>
               <p>How long after you lost the things was it before the prisoner was stopped? - Not a minute I suppose; the servant said he heard somebody jump from the window.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it? - Eight o'clock at night; it was quite dark. The window is not above seven feet from the ground; I suppose one got upon the other's shoulders, and put up the sash and got in; there were the mark of footsteps in the room.</p>
               <p>(The things were produced in Court by the constable, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>As I was going along, I stopped to make water under an arch-way; I saw something lying there; I thought it was a woman; I went to see, and found these things lying loose; I took them up, and as I was crossing the way this man stopped me.</p>

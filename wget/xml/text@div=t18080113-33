               <p>Q. Is the warehouse part of your dwelling house. - A. It is; I built a warehouse in the yard from the shop, between the two buildings; I have a plan of the premises here. (The plan produced).</p>
               <p>Q. Is the warehouse built in one, or part in one and part in the other. - A. It is built in one.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you go into the warehouse from either of them. - A. Yes; you must go into the wareroom, which was once a yard, to go from one house to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that they were two houses, and that you built a wareroom in the yard; are both the houses that you speak of in Russell-court. - A. No, one in Russel-court and the other house comes into White Hart-yard, Drury-lane; there is a door comes out of each house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this warehouse that you speak of being built in the yard, lie between the two houses. - A. It does.</p>

               <p>Q. A door opening from either, it comes into the warehouse. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of these houses do you and your family live in. - A. Occasionally in both, but our chief residence is in White-Hard-yard; we have a better sitting room in Russel-court where on particular occasions we go.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Evans's family, where do they reside. - A. We eat together and sleep in the same house; Mr. Evans's room adjoins mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I understand you, both the houses are connected by this warehouse, and are entirely used as one house. - A. I would observe to your lordship, that our young women sleep in Russel-court house, and the other part of my family in White-Hart-yard house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar in your service. - A. She was; but I hope your lordship will let me give testimony of her good character.</p>

               <p>Q. How many parcels are there in all. - A. Four yards and a half of sprig leno, No. 971, and five yards of lace work, No. 943, there are three yards of satin<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130029"></xptr>work spot, and seven sixteenths, we call it bird's eye, spot; that is the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the four yards and a half of leno. - A. My lord, am I to give the value it cost me - I hope not, I would wish to allow them of less value, if your lordship would permit me.</p>

               <p>Q. You now exercise your judgment of the moderate value of the articles. - A. I would value the leno at three shillings a yard, admitting for the change of the fashion; the lace cost me ten shillings a yard, I would value it at five shillings a yard, one pound five shillings; the three yards of satin work I would wish to consider it not more than six shillings now; seven sixteenths of bird's eye pattern, I cannot reckon of any value, they are cut in such a sort of a way.</p>

            . Q. You are warehouse woman to Messrs. Morhall and Evans. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the 27th of December discover a parcel under a sophy in any of Mr. Morhall's rooms. - A. I did, in the front room up two pair of stairs in a drawing room, about six o'clock in the evening; it was under the sophy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it concealed under the sophy. - A. The flounce of the sophy concealed it, the cover of the sopha hung down, and till the cover of the sophy was removed it could not be seen; upon discovering it I brought it down stairs directly to Mr. Morhall, he opened it directly, and put his marks on it, then he gave it me and desired me to put it where I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it made up in a parcel again. - A. Yes, just as it was before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do so, and put it where you found it. - A. I did, almost directly as soon as it was done up.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she then going to leave the house entirely. - A. No, she would have been coming again because her clothes were not gone.</p>
               <p>Q. However she was going out with it. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon her attempting to go out with these things what did you say to her. - A. I said, that Mr. Morhall desired me not to let her take any thing out without<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130030"></xptr>letting him see it; she said very well, and turned up the stairs; as she came down she went up Russell-court house stairs; she said she had got something to shew Mrs. Morhall, I said if she had any thing to shew Mrs. Morhall, she was in the dining room.</p>

               <p>Q. At which house is that. - A. In White-Hart-yard. She came down stairs again directly, and went to Mrs. Morhall in the dining room, with the parcels.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that all she said. - A, Yes.</p>

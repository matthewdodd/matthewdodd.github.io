            . I was in the palace-court at the time. We were talking about Lutwicke that was taken some time ago, who broke out of prison. A person said, here are many of the family-men here, they do not seem to do any business. I said I would observe them. Just as the prince's coach came, I saw them hustle Mr. Planch up against a place, and saw Turner's hand under Mr. Planch's waistcoat; after which I said to him, have you lost any thing? He said, Yes, I have lost my watch. The prisoner was then making off; we took him and Turner, and searched them, but found nothing upon them.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is Turner?</p>
               <p>James. He is bail'd out. I observed the prisoner at the right-hand of Planch, and Turner at his left.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to them?</p>
               <p>James. I was within two yards of them, and nobody between us. They were on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in the prisoner's or Turner's hands?</p>
               <p>James. No; I did not. I observed they endeavoured to slip away. This was all done in a minute's time.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Fisher, a cutler in Leicester-fields. On the 29th of August I went to see the royal family go to church. The duke<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176210200006"></xptr> York's coach came up. I was with the croud to see it. Mr. Planch was at my back; he called out he had lost his watch; some men were laid hold on; one of them took out his handkerchief, and said, earch me; I have got no watch. I put my hand into my pocket to see that I had not lost my handkerchief, and felt a lump in it. I had my wife with me, and my child in my arms. I said to her, They have put the watch into my pocket; let us go home. I went and asked advice what to do in it, and the nextday I advertised it. [He produced the paper in which it was advertised. The watch produced in court.]</p>
               <p>Q. to Planch. Look at this watch. [He takes it in his hand.]</p>
               <p>Planch. This is the watch I was robbed of; it is Mr. Hart's property.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say who put that watch into your pocket?</p>
               <p>Macloclane. No; I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing about it to any body in the palace yard?</p>
               <p>Macloclane. No; I did not, only to my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not?</p>
               <p>Macloclane. Because I was a stranger, and was affrighted, and did not know but I might be used ill by the people.</p>

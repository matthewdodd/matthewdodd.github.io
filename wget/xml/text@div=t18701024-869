On 23rd September, at 5.30 in the evening, I was on duty at Nunhead Cemetery, and saw the prisoner with a sack oil his back—I followed him three-quarters of a mile to Oliver Road, Peckhara, where I stopped him, and said "What have you got?"—he said "A sheep"—I said "Where did you get it from!"—he said there had been an accident at Bromley, and it had been run over by a waggon and killed, and he gave 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I said his statement did not satisfy me, and I should take him to the station—he said "Very well"—I found in the sack the hind quarters of a sheep, wrapped up in a skin, and tied round with rope; this is the skin.</p>

I am a butcher, of Lewisham—I believe this skin to have come off one of my sheep—I saw this mark in red ochre on it when I bought it—I count my sheep every day—I missed none Wednesday morning, and the prisoner was stopped on the Friday—there is a foot-path through the field and the Ravensbourne River runs at the bottom—the sheep was worth about 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner was in my employ some years ago.</p>

On Saturday morning, 15th Sept., I was on duty in Oakley-street at half-past 2 o'clock—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner coming along with this bundle—she was walking slowly—she came up Gloucester-street in a direction from Charles-street—I stopped her, and asked where she got those things from—she said she had had a quarrel with her mother, and she had brought these clothes away from Fleet-street—I took her to the station and found the bundle contained these things—some of them are men's clothes—she said her husband had gone to the Crimea, and these were his property.</p>

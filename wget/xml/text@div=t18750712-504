                  </hi>. I am an accoutrement maker, and now reside at Arundel Street—early in the morning of the 7th June I, with my wife and friend, were proceeding towards Waterloo Bridge—we came up Waterloo Steps and were going towards the bridge, when Rolfe pushed up against my wife and she turned round and said "Where are you pushing to?"—I said "Come on, take no notice, let us go home," and with that we walked up towards the bridge—I sent my friends through the tell-tale and paid the toll with 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and was taking my change, when Rolfe calls me towards him and says "I want you"—I said "What do you want of me?" so I goes towards him and the moment I went towards he hits me in the mouth and makes a snatch at my chain and run off—I ran after him—he turned round Waterloo Steps and waited, and the moment I turned round the steps he had hold of me just by the ankles and threw me on the back of the head and then he got on me—I was partly stunned then, and he hit me with something over the eye—I could not tell what with, but I could feel something like going into my flesh—it did not seem like a blow with the fist—I knew no more until I found myself in Dr. Farris's surgery opposite—the constable brought the prisoner in there—I recognised him immediately—I fainted twice from loss of blood going to the station—I suffered very much from it—I never laid a hand on him, never said a wrong word to the man, much less struck him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 64, Bond Street, Lambeth—I have been threatened by some of the prisoner's friends if I gave evidence—I was going home one Sunday night when I heard a hallooing—I ran up the steps, and there was the prisoner a top of the prosecutor punching him in the face—as I was running up the steps the prisoner went to run down and nearly knocked me down the steps—prosecutor's face was in between the steps and he was bleeding very much from the face—I went with the lady and her friends and the sergeant, and we found the prisoner in Chamberlains Yard, Belvedere Road—he ran past me, and straight down into the Belvedere Road.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman L</hi> 15). In the early morning of 7th June I heard a cry of "Stop him?"—I heard some one running very fast—I went towards where he was coming, and heard some one turn in the Chamberlain's Yard—there area great number of stables and workshops there, and in a small stable behind a workshop I saw the prisoner behind a manger and a horse in front of him—I caught hold of him and told him I wanted him—he said "What for?"—I said "I do not know"—I brought him out and from what I heard I took him to Dr. Fair's in the Waterloo Road—he had no coat on, he was in his shirt sleeves, and he had blood on his shirt—I found the prosecutor at Dr. Farr's and he said to him "Why did you serve me like this, what have I done to you that you should serve me in this manner?" or words to that effect—the prosecutor's wife was there and a friend and two or three females and they were crying and making a great noise and I could not exactly catch all the prisoner said, but he said to him "She pushed me against the wall and <hi rend="italic">bashed</hi> my hat in," or "crushed my hat in"—I could not exactly catch the word—I then took off his hat which is a hard felt, and there was no bruise on it, none whatever, and then at the sugges<lb></lb>tion of Dr. Farr I took him into the surgery, where the prosecutor was being dressed, and there Br. Farr examined his hands—on his way to the station he said "I would have fought them all if they would have come one at a time"—he made no answer to the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in practice at Waterloo Bridge—the pro<lb></lb>secutor was brought into me early on the morning of the 7th June—there was a large cut wound, a scalp wound, at the back of the head about 1 1/2 inches long—there was a gaping wound over the right eye which it was necessary to sew up, and there was a similar wound over the left eye, besides other bruises about the face, and on the day following when be came to have his wounds dressed there were distinct marks on the throat, bruises, giving me the impression that this must have been caused by a grip of the throat—the wound at the back of the head would probably be caused by a fall,</p>

"Count us going through"—the prisoner came up, making use of disgusting language towards the friends, and as the prosecutor was coming round the prisoner <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> his coat on a seat and turned round and knocked him down on his back—the pri<lb></lb>soner was making use of filthy, disgusting language all the way up from the Steps—filthy and disgusting language, I never heard such language in my life—I did not hear anybody else using any bad language.</p>

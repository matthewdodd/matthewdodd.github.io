I then cried out to the watch, and people came from the Wells to my assistance. I told them I was robb'd, and almost murdered, I was afraid to go home, so I went to Clerkenwell round-house, there I staid till 4 o'clock next morning, and then went home into Silverstreet. I advertised the stockings, but could hear nothing of them. The prisoners were taken up for another robbery, I went to see them in Bridewell, there the evidence Bullock said he knew me, and that I was the man they robbed of the stockings.</p>

            . On the 26th of September, the two prisoners at the bar and I met the prosecutor up by the Water-works, it was about 11 at the night, we follow'd him down till we came to the Dog-and Duck, there the prisoner Clark knock'd him down, then he took a bundle of stockings and went away. In about an hour after, I went to his lodgings, then we went and pawn'd the stockings at several places, and shar'd the money, which amounted to about 9 or 10 shillings a-piece.</p>
               <p>James Brabrook. (He produces some stockings;) I had these stockings from several pawnbrokers, all but one pair, which I took off from the legs of the woman that lived with the prisoner. Jackson said that Clark knock'd the prosecutor down, and took the stockings from him, and that he had part of them. Clark would not confess any thing.</p>

He said he had been guilty of divers robberies, especially of knocking a man down in the fields, and stealing several pairs of stockings. He told Brabrook where he might go and find one pair, which was pawn'd for 18 d. we went and found them. ( Produc'd in court, and depos'd to by the prosecutor, by the mark B. O upon them.)</p>
               <p>The prisoners had nothing to say in their defence, but Clark called the following witnesses to his character.</p>

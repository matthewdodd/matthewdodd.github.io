I am manager to Mr. Ensoll, a hosier, of 160, Fulham Road—the prisoner was in his service six weeks—he lived on the pre<lb></lb>mises, and I slept at No. 146—these four chains, three handkerchiefs, and locket, are Mr. Ensoll's property—I know them by a private mark in my own writing—the prisoner was paid by salary and commission; he had no right to take these things off the premises—I saw him last at the breakfast-table on Sunday, 20th October, about 20 minutes to 9—the articles would scarcely be missed from the stock.

On Sunday evening, 21st October, I was "' on duty at Charlton police-station, when the prisoner was brought in—I searched him, and found a pocket-handkerchief and purse in his pocket, and these four chains and two lockets inside the front of his trousers—after he was committed I searched his boxes and found some other articles—he said that his name was Johnson, and he was assistant to his father, a hosier in Goswell Road.</p>

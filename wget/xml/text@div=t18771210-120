                  </hi>. I live at 124, High Street, Whitechapel, and am the prosecutor's son—I went out on the evening of 23rd November, about six, leaving the place secure—there is a store room in the back yard with a stout window frame, but no glass looking into the yard—there is no<lb></lb>thoroughfare through the yard—any one getting into the store-room can get into the house, as there is a door from it.</p>

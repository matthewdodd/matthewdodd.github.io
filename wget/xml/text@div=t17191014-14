               the Murder of her Female Infant Bastard Child
            </rs>. and throwing it into the House of Office. She was indicted a second time on the Coroners Inquest for the same. The Landlady of the House deposed that the Prisoner's Sister brought her to her House and ask'd for a Bed for her, but she had none to spare; however she made a shift to let her lye there that Night: the next Morning the Prisoner enquired for the Vault, which she shewed her, and went out to fetch something she wanted; that when she came back again the Prisoner was not come from the Vault, which made her wonder why she staid so long there, and as she was going to see after her, she met her on the Stairs, when the Prisoner complained that she was sadly Griped and that her Body was coming down, and a little after that it was come down; that she advised her to take half a quartern of Geneva, and went to call her Sister; that when she came back she went up Stairs to her, and perceiving something on the Ground and in the Chamber Pot, she had a suspicion of her, and went down to look in the House of Office, where she saw the Child; that when she came up again she charged the prisoner with it, who owned that it was hers, and that she put it there. Sarah Holiday confirm'd her Landlady and the prisoner's going down to the Vault together, her having half a quarter n of Geneva, and her complaining that her Body was come down again into her Hand: she deposed also that she saw the prisoner go down Stairs with the Chamber-Pot in her Hand, cover'd with her Gown; that it was a pretty lusty Child, and she owned it to be hers. Mrs. Wade, was present at the taking the Child out of the Vault, that they took up the Boards and took it out with a pair of Tongs; that she belived it came before it's time, and saw no Hurt upon it but what might be done by the Tongs. The Midwife was of Opinion that the Child was not at its full time. The Prisoner in her Defence said, that she came 5 Weeks before her Time, and that the Child was still born, that she had provided Linnen for it; that she was ill of a Fever at that time, and had rid the Day before 10 Miles in the Coach-Box, which might occasion her coming before her time. It appeared that the Child was born in the Chamber while the two first Evidences were there, who did not hear it cry, nor know of it's Birth till it was found in the Vault, and that it was not full grown.

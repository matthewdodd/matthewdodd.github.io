                  </hi>. I am a widow and housekeeper, at No. 37, Old Broad Street. On 18th Aug., about 11 o'clock in the morning, I was going up stairs to my room, and saw this bundle on a slab on the third floor landing, and the prisoner by the side of it; he drew back when he saw me, and I called for assistance, and a gentleman came, and caught him coming down stairs—he was held till the police came—the bundle contained two blankets, five sheets, one bolster, one night gown and cap, one quilt, one cape, two curtains, two window blinds, two dresses, and one candlestick, which are my property, and were in my bed room, the door of which was not locked—he had got over a gate which separates the staircase from the rooms—the street door was open—the prisoner said that a lady and gentleman in the passage below had told him to go up for a bundle—there was no lady or gentleman there—his face was familiar to me, and I am sure I have seen him before.</p>

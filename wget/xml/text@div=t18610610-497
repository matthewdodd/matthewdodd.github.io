On Tuesday, 14th May, I was in the road at the Hide, Kings<lb></lb>bury, Near Edgeware, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw the prisoner in the road near the Red Lion—he said, "Boy, go and fetch me a half-quartern loaf—he told me to go up to the Baker's shop—he did not point out any particular shop—there was only one Baker's shop there—he said he would give me a halfpenny—he gave me a half-crown—I went to Mrs. Jennings' shop, asked for the Bread, and put the half-crown on the counter—Mrs. Jennings said it was Bad—she kept it—I left the shop and went to look for the prisoner—I did not have the bread—I found the prisoner stooping down standing in Mr. Sowden's garden, peeping—I told him it was a bad half-crown—he went with me to Mrs. Jennings' shop—I asked him to go there—after having some conversation with Mrs. Jennings he left the shop and went towards Edgeware.</p>

My husband keeps ft Baker's shop at the Hide, at Kings Bury—the last witness came to our shop on the afternoon of 14th May, and asked for some Bread—he put at half-crown on the counter, and I saw directly that it was Bad—I took hold of it, told him so, and asked him where he got it, and he told me—upon that he left the shop and came hack with the prisoner about ten minutes afterwards—he could not find him at first—I said to the prisoner, "Why did you give the boy this bad half-crown?"—I had it in my hand—he said, "I did not give him the Bad half-crown; I have not been the Boy Before"—I said, "I believe you gave him the</p>

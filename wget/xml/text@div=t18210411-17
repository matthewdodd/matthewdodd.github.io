            . I am the landlady. Taylor came down on Sunday morning, and said his clothes were lost. On Saturday evening, a little after eight o'clock, I was serving in the shop, the prisoner came in, took his candle, and went up stairs - he left his candle on the stairs, alight, and went out afterwards. He did not come home all night, nor did I see him again until he was in custody.</p>

             BURCHALL. I am an officer of the Refuge for the Houseless, in Bishopsgate-street - the prisoner lodged there about ten nights. On the 7th of March the prosecutor came in, and said he had seen a man come out who had robbed him. On the 8th I sent for the prosecutor - he said the prisoner was the man, and claimed the shirt which he had on. I gave him in charge, and took the shirt off, when his friends supplied him with another; I produce it. I also produce a shirt which I got from the pawnbroker, in Drury-lane, he gave it up before the Magistrate, and a handkerchief, which I had from a pawnbroker's, at Brentford. The prosecutor gave me three duplicates.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About three days after I gave up the duplicates, upon condition, that if I got the things out of pawn, nothing was to be said about it.</p>

I had the chain in my right hand when I sat down on the grass. I met with the prisoner in Holywell-lane, Shoreditch; I went with her from Holywell-lane to a public-house. She said she had been out all night. From there, I went to a public-house in Spitalfields; I called for a pint of beer and a pipe of tobacco; I asked her to drink; she said she could not drink beer; she would have a glass of gin. I called for a glass of gin for her; I gave two-pence for it. I called for another pint of beer, and asked the prisoner to drink; she said she could not drink beer; she called for a glass of gin. I came out. She said she was hungry, she wanted something to eat. I gave her a penny; she bought two cakes of a woman with a basket. I went to another public-house to get a pint of beer; I had another pint of beer and a pipe of tobacco. We had a glass of gin each. I went from there to Shoreditch, and from Shoreditch to Hoxton-square. I set myself down in Hoxton-square, opposite of the houses: with my right hand I had hold of my watch chain. I fell asleep, and when I awoke Mr. Giles asked me if I knew who the person was I was with; I said I did not; he said that woman had taken my watch.</p>

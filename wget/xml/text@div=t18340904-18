             - I was present at her marriage with the prisoner, at the parish church of St. James, Bristol, in February, 1821- my father was present - he is since dead - I saw my sister yesterday morning alive - they lived together as man and wife for some years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I am obliged to put question which I am sorry for. - How long did you know the prisoner and your sister live together? A. I cannot exactly state the length of time; seven or eight years, I should say - they lived together seven or eight years without separation - she was in a good state of mental health all that time - I think it was about seven years ago that she was ill, in consequence of a fright - she had a kind of fever - her mind was alienated at the time for a short time - I knew her constantly; after her marriage she was in an asylum for a short time; about two months, I believe - her family never considered it necessary - she was not confined by medical advice, and that I know of - she was never but once in an asylum, and that was for six or eight weeks - I did not go to visit her during that time; other branches of the family did - I never saw her; I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040025"></xptr>four miles from her - my other sister went to see her - I cannot tell in what state she was - I believe my sister that did go to see her is in London - I saw her five minutes ago - I have more sisters than one, and I am not quite certain whether it was the one who is here, or the one who is at Bristol - I think it was my sister Louisa, but I am not certain - she was dismissed in health - the prisoner afterwards travelled with her.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you go with them or know any thing about it? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Which of your sisters are here? A. Louisa; I have a sister who is not here - I think the prisoner and my sister lived together as long as seven or eight years; as far as my belief goes, that was, uninterruptedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear her mental aberration did not frequently separate them in that time? A. Never; I was acquainted with her all the time - they were living near Bristol for seven or eight years, I think - I was living in Bristol - my sister went to Foxhill, I understood, on a visit - I know nothing more of it - I know she went to his mother's - I had no home to take her to; our family would gladly have taken her.</p>
               <p>Q. After she travelled, did any of her family claim the care of her to relieve her health? A. She was considered well when she returned from travelling, and managed her own house - I saw her a day or two before she went to Foxhill - I think that is about six years ago - during the last six years she has been under the roof of her father and mother - she was not separated from her husband in consequence of her mind - she came to our house by invitation, to spend six weeks, and she has remained with us ever since - I really cannot say how long she was living with the prisoner's mother after her confinement; I know she was there; I cannot recollect how long.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you form a belief whether she was there a month or a year? A. I cannot state any further - I did not go to see her, but other parties did - I was about forty miles from her, and could not leave - it might have been two years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where were you when she was with the prisoner's mother? A. At home with my mother and father - she might be there twelve months, I could not positively answer that question - I have written to her during that time, and answers have come - I cannot say I have received answers, but my mother has - I have not received answers myself to my letters.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Your sister was ill seven years after her marriage, and went to an asylum? A. Yes; she was there six or eight weeks - it was her own husband placed her there - I had nothing to do in it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What were you? A. I was living with her as servant - I first became acquainted with her in July - I was very much in her confidence about the courtship - she saw him at Leamington - I was not sent after the prisoner - I do not know where he lived - she saw him at IIfracombe, in Devonshire - I was with her there, and that was the first I knew of it - I only saw them together once or twice before that - he left that place, and I rather think he travelled - he did not live at IIfracombe, nor did Mrs. Wells - I do not know where he went - I saw him at Leamington - I went there with mistress, but not after him; she went home to Cheltenham, where he lived - she went to Leamington on business, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, do not you know that she went there for the express purpose of meeting the prisoner? A. I do not know - she went there, and I went with her as her servant - the marriage took place perhaps three or four days after that - they were married at Charlton Kings, near Cheltenham - Mr. Heywood returned part of the way from Leamington with us, and three or four days afterwards he married my mistress - I think she was about forty years old- I do not know how long she had been a widow - I should think ten or twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know that Mr. Heywood had a wife living at that time? A. No; I will swear I never heard it mentioned - he called himself George Heywood, widower, at the church, and where he bought the license - I have heard a conversation between him and my mistress on the subject - many letters passed between them when he was in different parts - he was a traveller - he has been living in London lately, and carrying on business - I have not known him six or seven years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any reason to know Mrs. Wells knew he had a wife? A. To the best of my knowledge she thought him a widower.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. A. What was Mrs. Wells? A. She kept a ladies' school in Cheltenham, and had the appearance of respectability and property - I have heard the prisoner say he was a traveller - she gave up her establishment at Cheltenham, when they were married - her goods and effects were sold after the marriage - I am not living with her now - I rather think she is in Wales, with some friends, but I cannot say- her father is in London - her brother is a clergyman of the Church of England - I have heard her ask the prisoner how long ago his wife died - he said about five or six years - I heard her ask him where she was buried - he desired her not to say any thing on the subject, for it was a very disagreeable one to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. And on that did she make any more inquiry? A. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you know your mistress's handwriting? A. I could not swear to it - this is very much like hers (looking at a letter).</p>

            . I am a clergyman of the Church of England - I have two papers, one a copy of the marriage register of the parish of Mary-le-port, Bristol, which I examined myself, with the register, in a room annexed to the church - I have a copy of the register which I examined with the marriage register, in the parish church of Charlton Kings, in the vestry-room (read).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You are the brother of the second wife? A. I am - I first heard of her marriage about March or April - I recollect I went to Cheltenham at Easter, and received a letter from my father on the subject - I do not live in London - when I heard it from my father, I was staying at my brother-in-law's house - I do not know whether my father wrote to me or him - it was about Easter - I do not know when my father knew of it - it was not above a day or two before I did, to my knowledge - the match did not meet with the concurrence of my family, for I have seen a letter from the prisoner to my father wishing his consent, and a letter from my father refusing it - the marriage was not known to the family at the time it took place - Mr. Heywood afterwards went to my father's house, and was received, because the marriage had taken place, and could not be prevented - whether he carried on business I cannot say - no complaint was made to any of the family of any ill treatment towards my sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the prosecutor of this indictment? A. I hardly know how to answer that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the prosecution is not conducted at your sister's instance? A. It is not, but she has told me, since it was commenced, that it was with her approbation and consent.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Tell me if these letters are her handwriting? A. This I believe to be so - this, and that I believe to be so - but it is more regularly written than she usually writes. It was in my father's house at Highgate, that she told me she was consenting to the prosecution, the night before we last appeared before the Lord Mayor; in the presence of my eldest married sister - I will not be certain whether my mother was present or not - she was not sent away from my father's house - she has left the house for a very proper reason.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The unhappy insanity of my first wife deprived me of her society - I provided for her by putting her under the protection of my mother, with whom she lived till her own friends desired she might live with them - I was separated from her in consequence of her malady for nine years past, part of which time I certainly received her back, and took a house for her at the sea side, and took her about in the hope of restoring her; but the malady came on to such an extent, I was obliged to separate from her. I accidentally met with Mrs. Wells on board a steam-packet - a reciprocal attachment was formed, and being advised that seven years' separation from my first wife would justify me, we were married. Mrs. Wells was acquainted with my first marriage and its result, as she would unhesitatingly tell you if she was here - I have continued corresponding with her in prison for the last month or five weeks, and at this moment I have a letter from her from North Wales, which I do not bring forward, it not being evidence - if her letters were read you would be fully aware that the prosecution was not at her instance. It has been supposed that I formed the marriage from sordid views - this I solemnly deny. Mrs. Wells honestly informed me of her situation, and since I have lived in London I have paid several of her debts - she informed me her family were not rich, and I must not expect property, for her father had failed some years ago, and though she had relations of fortune, I might think they were a lucrative family, but it was not so, and she would not deceive me - if, however, there remains a doubt in your mind as to the affectionate terms on which we lived, her letters would convince you of the attachment between us - the prosecution is entirely against her consent, and by those from whom other treatment might be expected. I had just taken a school for her in the Hackney Road, and employed myself as an agent in London - we had a prospect of a good school - the afternoon before I was taken, I found she had been taken away clandestinely by her brothers, as she informs me - they promised that she should return that night, and only wanted to see her on family business. Though I acted erroneously, I hope you will do me justice, and deal to me a merciful consideration, bearing in mind the disgraceful situation this prosecution has brought on me, being dragged from my employer's counting house at an hour's notice. I have a little family entirely dependent on my exertions.</p>

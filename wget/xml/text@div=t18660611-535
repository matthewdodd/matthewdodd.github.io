                  </hi>. I reside at 9, Chapel-place, Cavendish-square—I was living there on the 7th of May—I never resided at Highgate—I am clerk to my father, who is a tailor—on Monday afternoon, the 7th of May, I went to the Spaniards Inn at Hampstead—that is across the Heath—I remained there about two or three hours I think—it might be six or seven o'clock when I left—I was intoxicated at that time—I could only just walk—I had a bull-terrier with me—it had on a collar with raised letters on it, all run into one another—the letters were S.M.R.C., South Middlesex Rifle Corps—I took them off a belt; it was in a monogram; the collar was black leather, with a lot of German-silver bars—the letters might have been German silver, but being worn by the dog, they had turned, and looked like brass—after I left the Spaniards I went into the Black Boy and lit my pipe—I believe they refused to give me drink there—one man got into my company there—being drunk, I would not swear positively, but I believe Briggs to be that man—I can't say how long I remained at the Black Boy—I went with one man from there to the Yorkshire Grey public-house in the York-shire Grey yard—at the time I entered the Yorkshire Grey I recollect one man being in my company, but being in a stupid sort of state, I think there was another one—after coming out of the Yorkshire Grey I remember perfectly well a policeman speaking to me—I believe at that time the person whom I believe to be Briggs was in my company—I don't think he could hear what the policeman said—I think I inquired for the dog at that time—I afterwards found myself in the Belsize Tavern—I don't know how I got there, but I have a recollection of being pulled there by some one—after leaving the Belsize Tavern I recollect the same man who was with me at the Black Boy being with me—I heard a whistle, and found myself seized—a knee was put to my back, and my throat was pressed, and I received a blow—the voice sounded to me to be the same as that of the man who had been with me all the evening—it was a short man that held me—when I awoke I felt stiff,</p>

I am stationed at Hampstead—on Monday morning, 7th May, I was on duty in High-street, Hampstead, and saw the prosecutor outside the Black Boy and Still, lighting his pipe—the prisoner Briggs was standing in front of him, as though in conversation with him—the prosecutor was the worse for liquor—he appeared to be able to walk very well—I saw him go away up the passage towards the Yorkshire Grey-yard to the Yorkshire Grey public-house—Briggs followed him—about twenty minutes after I went into the Yorkshire Grey—it was the way of my beat—I heard a disturbance, and found the landlord endeavouring to turn the prosecutor out of the house—he called me to assist him, which I did—he was turned out—there was a dog inside the house—I persuaded the prosecutor to go home—he said he would when he got his dog—the dog was brought out—it had a collar on—the landlord then called me to assist in turning Briggs out—he was sober—I have known him for years—I am quite sure it was Briggs—I asked the prosecutor, in Briggs's hearing, if his watch and chain were all right—he felt for his watch and said, "Yes, it is all right"—I saw the chain on him then—I did not notice his scarf-ring—he threw his tobacco-pouch down to the door for the dog to pick up—it would not touch it—I afterwards saw the pouch in the prosecutor's hand—Briggs said he knew the gentleman, he would take him home—I told him to go home about his business and let the gentleman alone—there were a great number of people there at that time—I noticed the prisoner Martin amongst them—I took hold of the prosecutor's arm to lead him down the Yorkshire Grey-yard, and then the prosecutor took held of Martin's arm, and Martin said, "All right, Mr. Hill, I will take him home"—I knew Martin very well—up to that time I believed him to be a respectable lad—I allowed him to go away with the prosecutor—they went towards the Conduit-fields, arm-in-arm—Briggs followed—I did not see anything more of them that night—I saw Briggs in the town the following day, the 9th, about eleven in the</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Bradley's-buildings, Hampstead, and am single—I have known Briggs some time—on Monday evening, 7th May, at half-past 9, I was walking from Hampstead up Haverstock-hill—I passed the George public-house, which is near Belsize-lane, and looked at a clock</p>

In consequence of some communi<lb></lb>cation made to me I took Briggs on Wednesday evening, 9th May—he came with me to the police-station quietly—the charge against him was stealing a gold Albert chain and a silver watch, and other property, from a Mr. Butler, on Monday evening, in Belsize-lane—Briggs said he was in company with a gentleman, but he knew nothing of the robbery; he was innocent of it—he said, "I left Martin and a gentleman in Belsize Tavern, and I came home to Hampstead about half-past 9 o'clock"—he said he saw Martin again in the town of Hampstead afterwards, that night.</p>

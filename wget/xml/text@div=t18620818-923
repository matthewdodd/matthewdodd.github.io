                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Jones, a pipe mould maker, of Kent-street, Southwark—on Thursday, 24th July, Barry came for a quarter of a pound of wire—I served him, and he gave me a shilling—I tried it, bent it, and found it was bad—I then spoke to my husband, and a constable was sent for—I told the prisoner it was a bad shilling, and he gave me a good one—I gave him the change, and we allowed him to go—two policemen afterwards came in—I saw my husband break that shilling that I took—I should know it again—it was given to one of the constables.</p>

I went to Mrs. Jones's shop on this Thursday morning, and saw Barry there—some conversation took place about a bad shilling—after Barry left I followed him—he went into Napier-street, about forty or fifty yards from Mrs. Jones's shop—I saw him go up and speak to Coghlin—I was then within about six or seven yards of them, and heard Barry say, "They found it out to be a bad shilling"—Barry was at that time carrying the wire—this was just a little after 6 o'clock—they went away, and I did not see any more of them till they were in custody—I am positive Coghlin is the man—I picked him out from among five men.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband keeps the Butcher's Arms, in Long-lane, Bermondsey—on the night of 24th July, about half-past 10 or 11, the Prisoners, I believe, came into my house—I cannot swear to Barry—he called for half-a-pint of beer and half a screw of tobacco, and gave me a shilling—I put it in the till and gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I did not see anything of Coghlin at that time, he came in about two minutes afterwards—Barry went outside and looked through the side window—the one who came in first went out, and the other came in about two minutes afterwards, and while I was serving him the one I had served first looked through the side window—Coghlin gave me a bad shilling, and I then went to the till—I had only fourpenny pieces and half-crowns in the till—I had no other shilling there, and had not put one in—I found the other shilling that I had put in to be bad also—I said to Coghlin, "This is a bad shilling"—he said, "I have taken it in my day's work "—I said, "Your mate succeeded so well, you</p>

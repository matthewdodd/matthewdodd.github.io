                  </hi>. I am the daughter of John Cross<lb></lb>thwaite who lives in Thavies-inn. On the evening of the 26th of April, my father and mother were not at home—my sister, I, and the servant, and Miss Van Beuren were in the house—I went, down and found the street-door open—I closed it, and the servant knocked in about ten minutes—the keys of the drawing-room were in the doors that evening—they were afterwards found on the mantel-piece in the back drawing-room—we heard a noise on the stairs between eleven and twelve o'clock—I went down to the servant, and asked her to go up with me—I was certain there was some one in the bed-room—she would not go—I went up-stairs, looked under the servant's bed, and saw a man's hat, his shoes, and feet—his shoes were off—I screamed out to the servant, who had gone with me at last, with my sister, and Miss Van Beuren—we called the watchman from the inn—he took the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist, of 5, Norwood Terrace, Tulse Hill—I received the larger of these bottles from Mr. Sutcliff on the 21st of October—it was sealed—there was four ounces of liquid in it—I applied chemical tests, and found it to consist principally of coffee, and one-eighth to one<lb></lb>fourth part of tincture of opium and syrup of squills, or over half an ounce of laudanum—that Was quite sufficient to destroy life—the small bottle also contains laudanum—it is usually sold at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>). an ounce, but you may possibly get half an ounce for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>). in some districts—that might account for the quantity there was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I put it in the cup in the window-sill to take it away with the breakfast things. I went on with my work ad usual, and in the evening my mistress took me to Dr. Suteliff, who asked me something, and I do not know how I answered him. After I had left Mrs. Edwards a policeman in private clothes asked me to go to the station. I was charged, and taken the next morning to Lambeth. There was nothing in the cup but grounds and one or two bits of bread. I did not know what I was doing, I Was worried so, and did it in mistake, and the breakfast things had to be washed up. I did hot intend to do any harm whatever.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You are a nail-manufacturer? A. Yes; I used to send goods to the prisoner's orders; you may say he was my agent if you like - he was at that time; when I was in town he came to my inn two or three times, but he never went with me to the place where the bill was made payable, to see if Mr. Busby was to be found; I went with Mr. Harris to No. 35, King-street, Goswell-street, to make inquiries - the prisoner went with us part of the way, but did not go there; he went within a street of the place: the endorsement on the back of this bill is my hand-writing - it has passed through my hands.</p>

            . I was appointed agent to Mr. Hipkiss, in November, 1827. The prisoner still continued to sell nails for Mr. Hipkiss - he was still a commissioned salesman for Mr. Hipkiss, but I had the bills in my hands, and the list of the stock was left in my hands, with orders to the persons at the wharf not to deliver any nails but to my order - this bill for 20l., and another for 18l. 5s. 6d., I received from the prisoner at the same time; I am not quite positive when; but I am satisfied in my own mind it was on the 5th of September, the day the bills were drawn, or just thereabout; it was for the purpose of paying for nails -I remitted them with three others in a paper parcel to Mr. Hipkiss; when the first became due, which was no the 8th or 9th of December, it was returned - Mr. Hipkiss received notice of it; I heard of it soon afterwards; I wrote to Mr. Hipkiss, and requested him to come to town, and he came very early in January - I saw the prisoner soon after I heard of the bill being dishonoured, and he told me it would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090148"></xptr>be paid in a very few days; I took no steps, but waited for Mr. Hipkiss to come.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the prisoner still continued to be agent for the sale of these nails? A. He still continued to sell nails for Mr. Hipkiss - he did not cease to sell after November, 1827; I saw him very frequently - I have seen him with a person, whom I supposed to be his brothere, but he never told me it was his brother; I met him with him two or three times - I do not know that he was in the habit of assisting him in business; I have never seen him when I have gone on business - I think he used to go out to solicit orders for his brother; I fear he did - I never knew he had a brother till Mr. Hipkiss told me; he had a brother, who was a very indifferent character, and he was fearful of any nails going to him; his name was John; I do not know that he has absconded.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you make this inquiry? A. Some time after the bill was due; I saw a female - I did not know at that time who lived in the house, but I find the name is Williams; I do not know who lodges in the house - bills are frequently made payable where parties do not live; I inquired if there had been any nails delivered there, and they said No.</p>

I lived for four years and a half at No. 35, King-street, Goswell-street; I left there on the 25th of March last - I never knew of a person of the name of Busby living there at any time; I believe there was a bill presented there five or six months ago - I cannot say exactly when.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written) My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I beg leave to assure you that I am entirely innocent of the charge imputed to me by this indictment. The prosecutor, Mr. Hipkiss, and myself, have been long acquainted, and in the habit of doing business together, for a long period. He is an iron-merchant in considerable trade, at Dudley, in Worcestershire, and I am an agent for the sale of ironmongery goods in London, selling for the country manufactures on commission. With regard to the transaction in question, I have only to state that my brother, John Green, Jun. who has been in the habit of obtaining orders for me, and transacting a great part of my business, told me. about the month of July last, that he had received an order for a quantity of nails to the amount of about 38l., from one James Busby, whom he represented was living in King-street, Goswell-street; and having had a similar transaction shortly prior, to the amount of 25l, with the same person, through my brother John, I felt no hesitation in executing this order, and accordingly I proceeded to Mr. Harris, the town agent of the prosecutor, and obtained orders for the delivery of the goods from Snell's and Whitehouse's wharfs, in the City-road, which I delivered over to my brother John, together with two bills of exchange for the amount, which I had drawn at two and three months. according to agreement, and directed him to get them accepted by Mr.

            ;" and having no suspicion whatever of the genuineness of the signatures, I paid them over to Mr. Harris on account of the prosecutor, Mr, Hipkiss, for the goods in question. On the first of these bills becoming due, I accompanied the prosecutor and Mr. Harris to where it was made payable, and waited outside whilst they proceeded to the house; on coming away from which they said no such person as Busby lived there. Gentlemen, I am sorry to add, that, at this period, my brother John, upon whom I had entirely relied, not only in this transaction, but in others in which he has also deceived me in a similar manner, had absconded, and has been out of the way ever since, so that I could obtain no information of Busby, although I have devoted days and nights in endeavouring to do so, a fact both the prosecutor and Mr. Harris are, I apprehend, fully aware of. On the second bill becoming due, that also was, from the same cause, dishonoured: and not being able to take them up, I was, after the expiration of a considerable period, taken into custody, and committed for trial Had I been conscious of having committed any crime affecting my life, it is manifest that I had ample opportunity to escape if I had thought proper to do so.</p>

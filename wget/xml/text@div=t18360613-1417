                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Sarah Adkins; she is a widow, and carries on a baker's business. On the 31st of May, in the forenoon, the prisoner came in for a penny biscuit—I served him, and gave him change for a shilling—there was no other shilling in the till at that time—in about a quarter of an hour another person came in for a penny loaf—I gave him charge for a shilling, and put the shilling into the till—there were none there but these two—I took the two shillings up to the room where my mother was ill—they were laid on the mantel-piece separate from any other money—they remained, I think, till the next morning—my mother remained in the room all the night—I then took the shillings and put them in a drawer in the secretaries in the parlor—they remained there till the officer came, on the 4th of June—I then gave him the two shillings—the prisoner came again in the evening of the 4th of June, and asked for a penny biscuit—he gave me a shilling—I made a communica<lb></lb>tion to the policeman, and he was taken—I gave that shilling to my mother directly I took it.</p>

I was in my bed-room on the 31st of May—she brought me two shillings—I saw they were bad, and they were put on the mantel-piece—I saw her take them off again on the Wednesday—on the Saturday I was down stairs—I saw the prisoner pass the window, and, from the description my daughter had given me, I recognized him—he came in—my daughter gave me a shilling, and said, "Is not this a bad one?"—I said, "Yes"—the prisoner said, "I will take another biscuit"—I said, "No, you shan't; this is a bad one"—I called my man, and the prisoner ran out—I gave the shilling to Bryant.</p>

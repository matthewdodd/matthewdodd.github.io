Yes; the prisoner was employed by me, she worked in my house, her business was to put the colour on the beads to imitate pearl: In consequence of information I received, I applied to Mr. Carter on the 25th of January; Mr. Carter produced two bags of beads which I had every reason to suppose were mine, they are in an unfinished state; I told her I had been robbed so much, I thought it my duty to make an example of her; she begged for mercy, and told me she had sold the beads to Mr. Carter, and that she had been in the habit of selling to him for about four months.</p>
               <p>- CARTER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a bead-maker; the prisoner came to my house and sold these beads to me, which I produce; I shewed them to Mr. Southall, he said he had every reason to believe they were his; I gave her eight shillings for them, they are made of blown glass to imitate pearl.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What did he say to that? - A. He said he would not, he would make an example of her; I searched her room where she lived, I found three parcels more in an unfinished state, which I produce.</p>

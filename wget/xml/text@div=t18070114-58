From information, I missed nine cotton handkerchiefs from the door, on Thursday the 15th of January, about three o'clock. I hung them at the door a quarter of an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180701140055"></xptr> hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that they were not sold. - A. They were not; I pursued her, she dropped down on the pavement just by White-hart court; whether it was for concealing the goods or by accident I cannot say; when she saw me she jumped up and ran away. I caught her with the goods upon her, and when I caught her she threw the goods about a yard and a half from her. I took her down to my employer. Mr. Thwaites ordered me to take her to Hatton Garden.</p>
               <p>- BAKER. I am a single man, I lodge at the Broad Arrow, Grub street, I am a smith</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in Holborn on Thursday last. - A. I was, about three o'clock. I saw the prisoner fumbling about the handkerchiefs at Mr. Thwaites' door, she unpinned the tickets from the handkerchiefs; I was across the way, I had suspicion that she was going to take them, she rolled them up in a bundle; then she put them at the back of some more linen that was at the door; she stopped about a minute and a half, till the people passed, until she had an opportunity of taking them; then she put them under her blue apron, crossed the way, and went up White Hart court. I came over and acquainted Mr. Thwaites of it, and I saw her taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the bundle then. - A. Yes, it was rolled up.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know no more of it than you do at this moment; I was very much in liquor when this gentleman laid hold of me. I have got this child, and I work very hard for my living.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

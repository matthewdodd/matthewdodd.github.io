The Prisoner had been a Lodger in my House about a Fortnight before the Fact was committed . On the 25th of September I went out to work in the Morning at 6 o'Clock; I returned between 6 and 7 at Night, and was told I was robb'd. I advertised the Things I lost, and the next Morning the Prisoner, and part of my Goods, were brought me by a Pawnbroker to whom she had offered them. The rest I fetch'd, by the Prisoner's Directions, from another Pawnbroker.</p>

            . I went out between 6 and 7 o'clock that Morning, and left the Prisoner and another Lodger in the House. I double lock'd the Door, and came Home at 7 in the Evening, then the Key turn'd but once, and the Door flew open. Upon looking into the Kitchen, I found I was robb'd of the Things mentioned in the Indictment: I charged the Prisoner with taking them, but she said she was not guilty of it; so I advertised them, and she was stopped with some of the Goods, and brought to our House. The rest she owned she had pawn'd to a Man in Wych-street .</p>

            . I am constable of Hackney. I was in the Hackney-road on the night of the 15th of January, and passed the prisoner and another man, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house. I was going to Hackney - I knew the prisoner before - He had the broom on his shoulder, and swore that the first that stopped him he would knock them down. I returned towards town; I met them again, and asked them what they had got-the other man said it was some pickles that they had got from a relation, at Whitechapel. I told them they were coming the wrong way, and I must detain them. The other man ran away, and left the pickles on the ground, and I took the prisoner - He had the broom on his shoulder.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Wigginson-common, in Hertfordshire, and am in the service of my father, who is a farmer—I have been in the habit of dealing with the Ramoneur Association for soot, for about two years—on the 15th of July I purchased some soot from them—I received it from the prisoner at Bentinck-mews, Marylebone, where the store is—I paid him 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for sixteen sacks—one sovereign, and the other in silver—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back for my perquisite—I have no doubt that that was the amount I paid, and the sacks that I received—I recollect the soot being weighed, and it weighed just one ton—I should say that is about the weight of six<lb></lb>teen sacks—I was with my father about a week afterwards, when he bought eighteen sacks more at the same place—36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were paid for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 15, Seymour-street. I am one of the owners of this soot, and there are two others—the prisoner was in our employ as foreman—he lived at the place where we had this soot, and kept the key of it—it was his duty to sell the soot—on the 15th of July he accounted to me for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., stating it was for selling nine sacks of soot, and that 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were deducted for expenses—the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were handed to me, and I handed it to the secretary, Mr. Chapman—it was the prisoner's duty to bring money in as soon as he received it, and account to the secretary or to me—there are positive orders that he was to account to no one else.</p>

               <p>he had committed twenty or thirty other robberies on me, the secretary called him one Saturday, charged him with these various robberies, and dismissed him—we had ascertained he had committed a variety of rob<lb></lb>beries, and that was the reason he was dismissed—we did not charge him with them in the circulars, but merely with improper conduct.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your principal charge against him that he had done work on his own account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that was one of the charges, not the principal—he had done work, and employed our men, and received the money afterwards, and put it into his pocket—he took our bills, and sent in—we never offered any money for any information against him—we did not offer 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we never offered anything to Arnold—we never said anything about any reward if information was given—we have a patent, which is enrolled.</p>

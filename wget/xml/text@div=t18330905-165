My wife takes in silk to weave for Mr. Mears, of Spitalfields - I left my house at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, my wife was in the house, and this silk was in the loom; I returned at half-past one o'clock in the morning; I was in Union-street, Hackney-road; and my wife came to me there about a quarter to nine o'clock, and we came home together at half-past one o'clock - I opened the door with a key, and the dog was inside, chained to the staple of the door; I had left him so - there was a light up stairs; and when I entered the shop, I saw a roll on the ground, and the silk gone off it - the back window was wide open - I gave information to a police officer - the premises were examined, and in consequence of information from my son I went to a marine store shop in Bethnal-green-road, and left my son there, in care while I got a policeman; and when I was within a short distance of the marine store shop, I saw the prisoner come from the corner of Waterloo-town, which leads from the shop; he went round another turning, and came up again, and then I saw him with the silk in his hand; he came out of a gateway; he had it tied up in a handkerchief, half out and half in; he saw me, and ran away, and chucked the silk down at my son's feet - I am confident he is the man - I picked the silk up, and gave it to the officer - the prisoner ran away; he was taken afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Did you see it picked up? A. I took it up myself - when I left my house, I left my wife in it; I did not fasten it myself - it was five o'clock in the morning when I met the prisoner; it was not very light - I was in a flurry when I got my property, I was thankful to get it - I have seen him once or twice before, coming to whisper my boy away from his work; I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you leave anybody in the house? A. No; I had seen the prisoner once or twice; I don't know of his being acquainted with my son; he came once or twice, and called my son out; my son has gone and spoken to him at the door - my son went out that night about half-past six o'clock.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I came home at a quarter to two o'clock in the morning, and in consequence of what I heard, I went with my father to an old iron shop in Bethnal-green-road; he left me to watch there, and in about two or three minutes I saw the prisoner coming out of the gateway; I knew him; I was two or three yards from him; the instant he saw me he was very much confused, he looked very much flurried - I told him my mother had been robbed, and then he was still more confused; and then I told him I thought he must know about it, or he would not be confused; he made no answer; and a little time after he said, "If I had not wanted money I would not have done it;" I said I would give him all the money I had about me if he would bring it back, and I gave him 1s.; he said he knew I would tell, I said I would not - the policeman was then coming after him, and he ran away faster than I could run, and I lost him, and then I met him again, coming out of the gate with the work in his hand; I and my father pursued him, and he threw the silk down in Bethnal-green-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he not the silk the first time? A. No; I said he had better tell me all he knew about it, it would be better for him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell him that before he said he would not have taken it if he had not wanted money? A. He said that first of his own accord, and after that I said he had better tell me all about it; he made me no answer at first - he said he was now done; I am quite sure he said he was done, and should not have taken the things if he had not wanted money, before I promised him 1s. to bring it back, and to keep it secret.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Where were you all this evening? A. I had been after my father and mother, but could not find them; I walked about from eight till eleven o'clock - I had a pint of beer at a new beer shop - I went to Hackney-road, but they had left there, and gone somewhere else - I got home about eleven o'clock, but could not get in; and walked about again from one place to another, and got home at half-past two o'clock; I had been home three times before I could get in.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to suppose the silk would be at the marine store shop? A. I had heard the prisoner dealt with that man two months before - he has been in the room the silk was in - I had no hand in taking the silk - I had heard the prisoner had said he should not go home all night - I had met him that night, and he told me so.</p>

             (policeman H 138). The prosecutor applied to me early on the morning of the 3rd of September - I observed that the silk was cut away from the loom, the window open, and the shutter down - About five o'clock I was called to the neighbourhood of the marine store shop - the prosecutor and I went one way, and a few minutes afterwards I saw the prisoner and got the silk - I did not know him before; I am sure it was him I saw - he was taken in five minutes, about one hundred yards from the spot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go into the room? A. Yes, and examined the window, it appeared to have been opened by a square of glass being taken out, and undone inside.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search him? A. No; my brother officer did, and found one shilling on him, but no housebreaking implements.</p>

About 1.30, on the morning of 16th October, I was on duty at Forest Hill, and met the prisoners coming in a direction from Forest Hill—Deviney was carrying a parcel on his head—I stopped them and asked what he had got—he said, "Books"—I said, "Let me look at them"—I looked at them, and saw they were weekly numbers of books—I questioned him respecting them—he said he had just lost the train at Forest Hill, and had to walk home—he had been to try to sell them—I asked who he sold them for—he said, "For a firm in Paternoster Row"—Tyler had a small cage with two young rats in it; he also had two larger rats in his pocket, which he took out, and he had another cage with a linnet and a canary in it—they appeared respectable, and, believing their statement, I allowed them to pass—I afterwards saw the books at the station, and they appeared to correspond with what Deviney had—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them.</p>

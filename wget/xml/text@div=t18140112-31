               <p>Q. Who was up last on the 3rd of December - A. I was up last; about eleven I went to bed. I examined the house to see whether the doors and windows were fast; they were all fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came down first in the morning - A. The prisoner; he lodged with me at that time; he went down to go to his master's work.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was in your house that night - A. Yes; he went to bed and came down first in the morning. On the 13th of November twelvemonth, his master came to me and engaged to rent a stable of me; he introduced four horses to his stable, and once or twice he changed his carter; at last the prisoner was his carter.</p>
               <p>Q. He lodged in your house on the night in question - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The doors and windows were all fastened - A. Yes. When he came down he knocked at my bedroom door, and asked me for the key of the stair-case door; I gave it him. In consequence of my having suspicion, and I had been frequently robbed since he had been in the house; I followed him down; when I came to the stair case door, the key that I had given to him to open the stair-case door he had kept to let himself into the larder, which larder is part of my dwelling-house, all under the same roof. I found in the larder he had helped himself to a slice of cheese, which he had cut off and laid on his smock frock, on the ground. The cheese weighed about eleven pounds, or better. He was in the act of turning to help himself to another piece; or something else. This was about five o'clock in the morning, three hours before day light nearly, within a few minutes. I then tried to lock him in the larder by way of security. I found the key in the door, and with my turning I could not make the key set upon the lock. I told him to go and do his horses, or what be pleased, he should not go out. I secured him in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him in the larder, and you secured him at five o'clock in the morning - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the cheese - A. I valued it at three pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your larder locked the over night - A. I am positive of that myself, my wife locked it. At eight o'clock the prisoner made his escape out of the yard by getting over a coal shed. We then traced him to Putney Heath; we found him at a public-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>

On the 25th of October I lost some property out of the stables - I had seen the stables about nine o'clock in the morning, before the things were stolen; I cannot say whether they were locked - I was at the stables again in the evening, about seven, but did not go up stairs: the room I sleep in is not generally locked - I had seen the clothes a day or two before: I found the prisoners in custody on Monday morning, the 27th of October, and some clothes were produced which I thought to be mine - I had bought them old; I saw some coats, but cannot say whether there were four -I believe they were mine; I have a doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had some coats been taken from your room between the morning of the 25th of October and the time you saw them at the office? A. I should not like to swear that - I could not swear it: it was dark when I got up; I cannot swear I left any clothes there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they there the night before, when you went to bed? A. There were very few things there when I went up at night; I lost things from the stable, because the things I had seen there and worn before were not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, I ask you whether the things you had there were gone in the morning? A. Yes - I did not understand you; I lost a box-coat, and saw a box-coat at the office - it did not look so fresh and so well as mine, when I saw it last; I thought it was mine, and swore it was mine to the best of my knowledge - I might have had it four months; it was of the same colour: it was very large, and would fit almost two of my size - it was very much tumbled about- I thought it was mine; I should not like to swear to it: I saw some breeches at the office, and supposed them to be mine - I had had them about the place for a week; I should be sorry to swear to them: I thought the boots mine, but cannot swear to them - there was a hat, which I believe to be mine, but there is no particular mark on it; there was a pair of new shoes - I had never worn them; they had no mark on them - I never fitted them on; I lost a pair, but should not like to swear to them - a piece of baize was produced; I suppose it to be mine, but should not like to swear to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SMITH. Q. Are you sure your name is not Davis? A. Yes; I have passed by the name of Davis when I was in a gentleman's service, but it is Davison.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 25th of October, about eleven o'clock at night, I was on my beat in Princes-street, Mary-le bone, about one hundred yards from these stables, and saw three men going along Princes-street; one of them was some distance in front of the other two - one of them was Ayres: I suspected they had something, as Ayres and another had bundles on their backs - when they had got about one hundred yards I went after them; they were walking very fast - I came up to them; they had just put their bundles down: I asked Ayres what he had got there - he said, "It is nothing to you, I dare say;" I said, "If it don't belong to me, most likely it belongs to some person - I should like to look at it;" he said there it was, I might look at it if I liked: I stooped to examine it, when he and the other man ran away - I sprang my rattle, called Stop theif! and Ayres was stopped; I saw him in five minutes, and was certain of him - the bundle he had contained a box-coat, three body coats, four waistcoats, a pair of breeches, a pair of drawers, a white neck-cloth, a pair of boots and shoes, a hat, and a piece of green baize; he was taken to Mary-le-bone office, and the things were produced: I saw Davison there on the Monday - Ayres told me at the watch-house that he was employed by two men, named David Evans and Richard Kenney, to carry these things, and they were to give him 6d. for his trouble; Kenney was taken the same night, for assaulting a watchman - I could not identify him as the man who dropped the other bundle, for he hung down his head; what he dropped was a box-coat; it was taken to the office, and seen by Davison.</p>

            . I am a baker. At a quarter-past eleven o'clock on Saturday night I stood at my shop-door, which is about two hundred yards from this stable, and saw the prisoners pass by me, in company - I am quite certain of them; Kenney was carrying something, which appeared to be a box-coat, over his shoulder - the watchman passed me just then; I saw Kenney in custody on Monday, and was quite certain of him - I did not a third man with them: I called the watchman directly they passed me, and he questioned them; Ayres ran away; and came just by me; the watchman sprang his rattle - I pursued them both; Kenney turned round Salisbury-street, and escaped - Ayres pulled off a hat, and threw it into a pond of water; the place is not a thoroughfare - he turned back, and I took him: I am quite certain of him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Sunday morning, the 26th of October, I went with Davison to No. 10, Nightingale-street, Lisson-grove, as Davison<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040122"></xptr>said he was robbed the overnight, and suspected Evans,(who had been in his service) was concerned; I took Evans - I found Kenney at the watch-house: he had been taken overnight - Evans saw both the prisoners at the watch-house; Ayres said, in the presence of both of them, that they were the persons who had employed him to carry the things - I said to Kenney, "Then I shall detain you;" he said nothing to it; he neither denied nor admitted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Ayres gave this account the moment you asked him? A. Yes; I took the two men by his description; Kenney was brought in on another charge.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor being again examined, looked singly at the articles produced, and refused to swear to any one of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. (Shewing him his deposition.) - Q. Look at this name of William Davison, is that your writing? A. Yes, I believe it is - I cannot say whether it was read over to me before I signed it; I was so frightened, so flurried, I did not know what I was doing; to the best of my knowledge what I swore was true.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sworn "The box-coat, three other coats, four waistcoats, a pair of kerseymere breeches, and other articles now produced by William Westby, are my property, and part of the articles stolen from my room;" that is what you have sworn - now you cannot swear to any one of them? A. I might say so; I beg pardon; I was so much frightened at the time, and the things were so tumbled about.</p>

               <p>now in the London Hospital—on the 31st of October I was going to work with two mates—I had put a stage into the boat, to go to work—there was a stool at the water side, which it was necessary to get on—I had got one foot on the stool and one foot on the boat, and the prisoner came and pulled the stool from under me—I had given him no provocation what<lb></lb>ever—it was not done in play—I fell into the water—when I got out, I was coming towards him, to know the reason of this, and he came towards me, and struck me with an iron hammer on the left side of my face—it was an iron hammer which he used in his work—I fell from the blow, and he struck me with his fist afterwards on the eye—I got up directly, and he struck me on the nose—I did not fall then—my comrades came to my as<lb></lb>sistance—I have been in the hospital a month last Tuesday—there was no wound on the outside of my face—my jaw was broken in two places.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-whipper, and a mate of the prosecutors. I was at the stairs on the 31st of October, and saw him getting on the stool, which he brought from the prisoner's barge—it was about two yards from the barge when he took it—the prisoner and his brother were not standing on it—the prosecutor had one foot on the stool and the other to-wards the boat, and the prisoner pulled the stool away—I saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor on the bow of the boat, but did not see him fall—they seemed to speak together—I did not hear what they said, and saw no blow struck—I was in the stern of the boat, with my back towards them when I heard a bustle—I asked the prisoner why he did not strike him with his fist in<lb></lb>stead of the hammer, and he told me he would serve me in the same way—I had seen him at work at the barge with the hammer in his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined, Q.</hi> Do you mean the stool was two yards from the barge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—on the causeway—I saw the prisoner pull the stool away, but did not see the prosecutor fall into the water, as I was in the stern of the boat, and the stage was in the bow—after the prosecutor came ashore, the prisoner was standing by the water's edge, where he had dragged the stool—I did not hear what was said—they had their faces to<lb></lb>wards each other—they seemed to be talking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 31st of October I went to the stairs, and saw the prisoner standing by the steps with the hammer in his hand—I followed him up to his wharf, and into his kitchen—his clothes and face were muddy—I asked him if he had been down in the mud—he said no, he got it in his work—he had the hammer in his hand when he went up the steps, and I saw him lay it down—his brother took it up, and gave it to me—this is it—there were eight or ten persons there—I only noticed four coal-whippers—the witnesses were two of them, the prosecutor and another—the others appeared barge-builders.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a pupil in the London Hospital. The prosecutor was brought there on the 31st of October, and I examined him—his lower jaw on the left side was broken in two places—the skin was broken internally, not externally—there was not a great deal of blood—one fracture was near the chin, and the other near the ear—that injury could not have been inflicted without considerable violence—I should not think a blow with a fist would cause "such a fracture—such a hammer as this would be likely to produce it—if it had struck the head with the same vio<lb></lb>lence, it would probably have fractured the skull.</p>

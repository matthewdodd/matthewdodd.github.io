            , the deceased, were at my house - the prisoner and a friend brought in some steaks, which were cooked, and the witness Young, who had come in with the deceased, wanted some of it; the prisoner said, "Take it all," but he afterwards wished a particular piece, which she had put her fork into - Young called the prisoner a great many disagreeable names, and abused him - the deceased then got up, and struck the prisoner with his fist, twice in the breast, before the prisoner struck him; the prisoner was very hungry, but wished Young to share in the steak - he then got up, and hit Williams on the breast - he then fell backwards on the fender - the edge of the fender cut his head, which bled profusely - I wished to send for a doctor, but he said he was doing very well; the prisoner did not attempt to strike him again, and had done nothing to offend him - Young took him away - I afterwards saw him dead.</p>

            . I was at this public-house. I saw the prisoner and the deceased there, but did not know them before; the prisoner sat having some steaks; the deceased sat on the opposite side with Young, and some more friends - Young went over and asked him for a piece of steak; he told her to take some; she put a fork into a piece, which he wished to keep; he shoved the plate forward to her, and said,"Take it all;" the deceased and Young then both called him names, and the deceased struck him; somebody said,"You are big enough to take your own part; why don't you have a fight?" the deceased then struck him again, and the prisoner fell back in his seat; he got up and struck the deceased in the chest; he cut his head against the fender - I did what I could to stop the blood, and left him in the care of Young - the deceased was certainly the man to blame.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and knew the deceased. He came in for some beer, sat down with me, and we drank together; the prisoner came in, and was eating - there was a bustle - I saw Young there; Williams jumped up: I said, "For goodness don't interfere, you have nothing to do with it;" he struck the prisoner twice over the table: the prisoner said he would forgive that, if he could get his dinner comfortably; I said, "Oh, he is tipsy, don't take any notice;" he said, "I won't - only let me eat my dinner:" somebody said he was big enough to take his own part - Williams struck him again; the prisoner then struck him once with a sort of shove, and he fell with his head against the fender - it bled very much; the deceased was the person to blame.</p>

            . I had seen the deceased several times - the prisoner was eating his dinner; I asked him for some - he allowed me to take it; after he had done, he said I might take it all; I went to put a fork into one piece - he took it away, and put it into a piece of paper to put into his pocket; and while I was gone up stairs, words occurred between them - I saw Williams strike him twice; the prisoner then gave him a push, and, being intoxicated, he fell - I attended him to the hospital; he died on the Monday: he did not think himself at all in danger, but said he should soon be out, for no material damage was done.</p>
               <p>-. I am a surgeon. I attended the deceased at the hospital; the injury he received produced erysipelas, which caused his death.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the witness, Young, had thrown the steak at him, and afterwards three pewter pots, and used disgusting language, to induce the deceased to interfere.</p>

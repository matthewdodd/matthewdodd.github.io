                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Piccadilly—I have three other partners. The prisoner has been our porter for some time—on the 24th of December a box was produced to me, containing 6lbs. of raisins, and a ham—I believe the ham to be mine—I had had eighteen sample boxes of raisins sent the day before, and put into the warehouse—I did not miss this box till the prisoner was brought in custody by a policeman—he said the raisins and ham were given him by a person named James, in our employ—each of the sample boxes had a particular mark on them—this has that mark, and I have no doubt it is mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Museum-street, at a quarter past twelve o'clock in the night, and saw the prisoner coming up the street on the opposite side, carrying under his arm a parcel wrapped in a bag—I crossed, and asked what he had got—he said, "A box of raisins"—I asked where he was going to take them—he said, "To No. 26, Bedford-place"—I said I thought it was a late hour for goods to be sent home—he said their house worked very late, and he bad got to take them home, as he lived that way—I said, "You will have no objection to my going there"—he said, "No"—I went with him towards Bedford-place, and met a policeman, who I asked if he knew who lived at No. 26, Bedford-place—he said, Mr. Gibbs, but he was not living there now, but the house was taken care of by the prisoner's mother, and the prisoner lived there with her—I went there, and then took him to the station—I then went to the prosecutor's, and afterwards took the prisoner there—he said it was given him by James, the carman, and he was going to take it to the wine-man's.</p>

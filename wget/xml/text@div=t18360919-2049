About a quarter before eleven o'clock on Monday night, the 29th of August, I was on duty at Pimlico—the prisoner passed me with a bonnet and shawl in her hand—I did not perceive the box—she went into Vauxhall-road to a hackney-coach, on the stand—I suspected her, and followed her to the coach, and saw the corner of the box under her shawl—I asked her what she had got there—she said it was nothing but a box of papers—I asked where she came from—she said, from No. 31, Palace-street—I asked where she was going to, she said, to No.31, Palace-street, and asked if I should like to look what was inside the box—I said, "Yes"—she said, "Then I'm d----d if you shall"—I then told the coachman she might ride to No. 31, Palace-street, but I should go with him—the prisoner got into the coach, and I on the box—we had not gone far before I heard a noise as if the box was thrown out of the coach window—we then got down, and the coachman delivered the box into my hand—we set the prisoner down at No. 31, Palace-street—I got another constable, who assisted me to the station-house with her—this is the box—it was not locked at the time—it had been broken open.</p>

On the 20th of October last, a boy, named Mansfield, came to our house with apples, I bought a shillings-worth of him, and gave him a 3s. piece, the prisoner was with him, and gave me the change. In about ten minutes after I saw the boy again, getting out of our parlour window - He asked me if I wanted any more apples; as soon as he was gone I missed a pair of table spoons, and several things were removed, but left in the room - I did not see the prisoner at the time I saw the boy at the window. I had seen the spoons safe and the window shut about an hour before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Gee's-court, Oxford-street. The prisoner is my husband—he is a boot-closer—on the morning of the 17th of Sept., about nine o'clock, I went out on an errand, leaving my husband in bed—he did not send me out—I went to fetch some tea for breakfast—I remained out</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184410210035"></xptr>
               <p>about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes—when I returned, he was sit<lb></lb>ting by the fireside, eating some cold giblet pie—he called me a b—w—, or a b—, and said I had been out drinking—I said I had not—several words occurred—he asked me for a shilling, which he said I had got, belonging to him—I said I had only got sixpence—I put the sixpence on the table—with that he got up, and hit me on the right side of the head, and then on the left, with his hand—I made towards the other end of the room—he followed, and hit me on the back of the head with his hand, and I fell on my little girl's bed—I got up—a candlestick which he uses in his work was standing on the floor, and I took it up, and said if he hit me again I would mark him—I did not hit him—he took the candlestick out of my hand, and hit me on the top of the head with it—it bled profusely—I turned towards the door and said, "O, do pray let me out"—he said, "No, you shall not go out, for you look like a b—stuck pig, and you shall not go out"—he fastened the door—the room is on the first-floor—I opened the window, and screamed out for assistance—no one came for some time—I lost my recollection—I afterwards saw the room full of people, and have some confused recollection of giving my husband in charge—the blow was given wilfully—I believe I retained the top part of the candlestick in my hand—I did not strike or touch him with it—I lost all re<lb></lb>collection after he struck me the second time with the candlestick.</p>

On Tuesday morning, the 17th of Sept., I was in Gee's-court at about a quarter to ten o'clock, and heard a boy crying "Murder! policeman, come this way, there is a woman with her throat cut!"—I saw the prosecutrix at the window, with blood running down each side of her face—I went into the room, and saw the prisoner standing with the long part of this candlestick in his hand, and his wife with this other part in her left hand—there was a little girl in the room at the time—she said, "I give him in charge"—I took him to the station—she was bleeding very much—her hair, and all under her throat was smothered with blood—she could stand, but could not walk to the station—she did not appear in the slightest intoxicated, nor smell of drink—when I entered the room, the prisoner was standing with this staff part of the candlestick in his hand—he said, "The b—b—has been out drinking this morning; she has come home and abused me, and don't know what to kick up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> about"—at the station he said, "She has wanted to get me into trouble a long time, and I suppose she has</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Great Marylebone-street. On the 17th of Sept. I was called to the station about ten o'clock, and saw the prosecutrix—she was bleeding very much from a cut in the head, and I had great difficulty in stopping it—she was very weak and exhausted—the wound was about half an inch deep and an inch and a half long, cut down to the pericardium or covering of the skull—if she had been a woman of dissipated habits crysipelas might have come on—she did not appear to have been drink<lb></lb>ing in the least—I attended her ten or twelve days—that was necessary—she complains even now of the blow.</p>

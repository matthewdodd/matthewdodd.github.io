                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 84). On 24th Nov., between four and five o'clock, I was on duty in Deptford Broadway with another constable, and saw the prisoner Smith loitering about a linen-draper's shop window which adjoins Mr. Armitage's—after she had been there a considerable time Gates came out, and commenced cleaning the door-plates—Smith went up to him, and they were in conversation some time—she then left, and was loitering about for nearly three-quarters of an hour—she came again, and loitered about the front of the shop, passing up and down, and looking in, and at last, when the shop was clear, she went in—I immediately went to the window, and there saw Gates supply her with some rashers of bacon—she did not pay for them—Gates opened the till and gave her a piece of silver, which I believe to be a shilling, and some coppers—she had not given any money for which that could have been change—she then came out—I saw her go into the shop five different times that evening, but I only saw her get something on the first and last occasion—she cot some cheese the last time, which she did not pay for; I am sure of that—I was within three yards of her—the counter was between us—I saw the till opened distinctly—Smith went into two or three public-houses during the evening, where she got some spirits and water—after she was supplied with the cheese she came back again to the shop—it was then shut up—she walked about a considerable time,. then stooped down and looked through the key-hole, and then walked away for about sixty yards, and then ran towards Deptford Railway station, from where she went up to London by the last train—I followed her in the same train, and when she got out at London-bridge she crossed the road, went through the Borough-market, Bankside, across Blacfriars-road, to Cornwall-road, Lambeth, went into 68, and up into the back bed-room—I followed close after her, and asked if she lived there, and what her name was—she said that was no business of mine—I said, "I am a police-officer, and I wish to know"—(I was in plain clothes)—she again said it was no busi<lb></lb>ness of mine, and she should not tell me—I said, "The fact is I have been watching you for some considerable time; I wish to know what you have in your basket"—she said it was no business of mine—I said, "I insist on knowing'—she said, "What I have got there is my own; I bought and paid for them, "and she produced some bacon, butter, cheese, and eggs—I asked where she got them—she said the bacon and butter at the Marsh-gate, and the cheese and eggs in the New-cut—I said, "You did nothing of the sort; the fact is you are charged with stealing these articles from the shop of Mr. Armitage, a cheesemonger, in Broadway, Deptford"—I then asked if she knew a young man living there—she said she did not, and she did not get them from Deptford; she did not know where Deptford was—I said, "Why you have just come from Deptford by the railway"—she said, "You are a Use speaking man: I was never there in my life"—I then took her to Green<lb></lb>wich station, went and took Gates, and at the station put them together, and said to Gates, "You are charged with stealing these articles; do you know this woman?"—he said, "I do; I have served her with these things"—she said, "Is is false"—he said it was not; that he had supplied her with goods before.</p>

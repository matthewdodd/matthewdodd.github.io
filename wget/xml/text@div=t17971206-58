             sworn. - On the 3d of December I apprehended the prisoner, in the parish of St. John's, Wapping; I had heard of his being transported, and I thought he was come back before his time; I asked him if he had any thing to shew why he was at liberty before his time; and he said, no, he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. A Trinity-officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any reward in this case? - A. I never had any; I have heard that there is.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his answer when you asked him how he came at liberty? - A. He said, he had been taken prisoner in his passage to South Wales, and carried by force to a French prison; and he said, he had made his escape from there to America, and from there he had come to England.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire whether it was true? - A. No; I did not know that that was a duty incumbent upon me; I heard that he had been here five or six weeks, I did not enquire any further; I took him to the office in Lambeth-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. In 1795, I was pardoned upon condition of serving his Majesty King George, in the sixtieth regiment of foot, to go in the capacity of a soldier; I embarked the 14th of April, 1795; I had the misfortune to be taken by the French, and carried into Guadaloupe; they wanted to force me to serve against my country, and rather than be a traitor to my country I was determined to get my liberty, or die; here are two shots in my neck that I got as I was making my escape.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Vanheiners, and live at Pope Street Farm, Eltham—on Monday, 19th October, I was in a carriage on the Eltham racecourse—my sealskin jacket was lying in the carriage—I saw it there a little before 3 o'clock, and missed it some time afterwards—I gave information to the police—this is the jacket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant R</hi> 4). On Monday, October 19th, I was on duty on Eltham race course—in consequence of information I received I stationed myself at a turnstile, and saw the prisoner coming towards me with a bag with something in it—he went behind a refreshment booth—I followed him, and he went in amongst a lot of betting men, and opposite the grand stand he laid down the bag—I asked him what he had there—he said "Nothing"—I took him into custody, and he said then there was a coat inside, and that it had been given him by two men on the race course to mind—I took him to the station, and there found the sealskin jacket, wrapped up in this coat in the bag.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He said the bag and its contents had been given to him by two men—I have known the prisoner as a hawker of fruit for three or four years, and never knew anything against him.</p>

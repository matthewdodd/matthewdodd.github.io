            . I am an officer. On Saturday the 9th of May, I searched the prisoner's lodgings, Mr. Smith was with me; I found the prisoner at home. On searching the drawer in the prisoner's apartment, I found a petticoat and pocket, Mrs. Smith said they were part of her property. I asked her what she had done with the rest of the property, she began crying, and said she had pawned them; she directed me to Mr. Morrits, and to Mr. Dry's; I found the shirts at Morrits's and several articles at Mr. Dry's, which Mr. Dry's man will produce. Mr. Morrits's gave the shirt up. The shirt has been in my possession ever since, and the petticoat.</p>

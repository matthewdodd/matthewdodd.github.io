On the 4th of January, I was at the <placeName id="t18210411-175-crimeloc1082">Compasses public-house, Brick-lane</placeName>

Bank notes, with the landlord and about 7 s.; I asked him to return them - the prisoner was present. The landlord gave me two 1 l. notes, two half-crowns, and two shillings in silver - the prisoner said Wilcock, have you got your money safe. I said Yes, I have got it in my hand, he instantly knocked it out of my hand, snatched it up and ran away with it - the landlord saw it and went after him with me to different public-houses, but could not find him. I did not see him for a month after, when I met him in Cannon-street, and asked his reason for doing it, as he knew I had a wife and family; he said he did not mean to run away with it, but he would make it up if I would take a trifle at the time, as he could get it. I said if he brought it all I did not mind making it up, he said he could not do it, but would meet me on the Saturday night following at the Osborne's Head, Princes-street. I went there at seven o'clock, the time appointed, and stopped till nine. He did not come - he was taken on the 5th of March. I could not find him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long had you known him - A. Twelve months - I knew where he lived, and that he worked at Romford - there was two or three girls in company, but not with me. I paid for part of what they had - I was perfectly sober. I received 10 s. from the landlord when I gave him the notes - the reckoning was 13 s. I took none of the girls out, I went to the prisoner's lodging next day, and saw his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell her you had been in bad company and lost your money. and if her husband did not make it up you would prosecute him - A. I did not. He proposed something about subscribing to make up my loss. I took an officer to find him, but did not go to Romford.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did you go to the public-house - A. Between three and four o'clock; this happened about seven o'clock - I paid the landlord 3 s.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Compasses, public-house, the prosecutor came to my house and called for some beer, he had only 3 l. and no change; he gave me the notes about seven o'clock, which was the time he came into my house, and asked me for them about eight o'clock. I gave him two notes, with two half crowns and 2 s. wrapped in them; the prisoner was in the tap-room, I do not know whether he saw it - I gave him the notes just before the bar. I saw him and the prosecutor bustling together, and immediately went and told them to be quiet. I then went into the bar; there was a dispute among them about seeing whether he had the notes, the prisoner said, let us see whether you have got the notes; the prosecutor put his hand in his pocket, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here they are," producing a bit of paper; the prisoner tore it in pieces, and said, that is not a note; the prosecutor then produced them from his pocket, he knocked them out of his hand on the floor, picked them up and ran away with them. We went after him to several houses, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many girls were there there - A. My brother's wife and another married woman - there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110085"></xptr>were no girls of the town; he was quite sober - he came about seven o'clock, as near as I can guess.</p>

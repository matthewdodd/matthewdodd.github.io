            . I am a glassman, and live in Saffron-mews. On the evening of the 22nd of May I was in White Lion-street, and saw the prisoner walking up and down with another person - I saw them try several doors and windows; I saw them at Mr. Locker's house - the prisoner went to the door, but did not at that time succeed in opening it; it is a half-hatch door - he went up and down two or three minutes, then returned, and looked through the window; he then went to the door, and put his arm over the half-hatch door; it appeared to be fast, as he had pushed against it before, and it did not open, but when he put his hand over he appeared to undo something; there is a spring lock inside; the door then opened, and he went in; the other person waited for him at the corner of the street - before he went in he had but one coat on, and when he came out he had two on; I crossed over very swiftly -I collared him, and charged him with taking the coat; he said he had bought it for 10s. in that street - I pushed him into a public-house to secure him, and then took him to Mr. Locker's house; he appeared to have a difficulty in opening the door at first; it was fastened with a spring latch - the street door was open, and the half-hatch door shut - the street door was within the batch door; I took him into the house, and sent for a constable, who came.</p>

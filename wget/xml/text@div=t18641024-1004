I am a fire-wood merchant, of Bridge-wharf Lower-road, Deptford—in November last, the prisoner was working for me—his work was to twist and tear yarn into tyers, which are used in my business for tying up wood into bundles—he continued his work in that manner up to 18th August, at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a chain—on that day I gave directions to my head man, Mr. Hope, that he should be supplied with a quantity of yarn to work up for me in the same way—they were to be delivered as soon as he had manufactured them.</p>

               <p>EDWARD JONES (Police-constable D 16.) On Sunday night, the 8th of April, I met the prisoner in Orchard-street, at a quarter before twelve o'clock - he had a bag; I asked where he was going with it; he said to Leadenhall-market, and it had some rabbits in it, which he brought from Oxford-buildings - I asked him how he knew what was in it; he said a man told him so, who gave it him to carry - I made inquiry, and found the prosecutor.</p>

These rabbits were mine; I gave the description of them - they correspond exactly with what I lost; I had seen them safe in the kitchen on the Sunday morning - the prisoner must have got through some bars which I had put up.</p>

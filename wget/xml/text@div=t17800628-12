I had been in the city to carry a gown home on the 21st of June, and as I was coming home at about half after ten at night, in a place called Little Britain, I missed my way, and asked the prisoner and another woman who was there, my way to Ratcliffe-Highway. The prisoner said, O, my dear, come along with me, and I will shew you the way. We had not got a great way before the prisoner asked me if I had any money. I said I had none about me, but if she would go along with me I should be ready to satisfy her for her trouble; upon which they took me to <placeName id="t17800628-12-crimeloc72">Saltpetre-bank</placeName>

The tall one came and took hold of me by the throat, while the prisoner took off my hat; it was a black silk hat; upon which I cried out. The prisoner said, d - n you, you bawling bitch, if you had not balloo'd out I would have done for you. She then put her hand into my pocket and took out my handkerchief. She held it up and looked at it, and said it is not worth a Tonick.</p>
               <p>What does that mean; - I do not know. She threw it into my arm, and knocked me down with her first, and then she and the other woman ran up Saltpetre-bank. Soon after a man came and took me up. I was stunned with the blow.</p>

               <p>On the 22d of June, an information having been brought to the office I belonged to, that a woman had been robbed of her hat on Saltpetre-bank, I went there to enquire. I knew the prisoner lived there, but did not particularly know her lodgings. The neighbours informed me where she lodged. Then I went in, and on the lower floor I saw the prisoner and another woman, and there were two hats, lying upon the table. I asked them whose they were; the other woman said one belonged to her; and the prisoner said the other belonged to her. I left a person below stairs in care of the prisoner. Then I went up stairs into the lodging room, there I saw this hat lying upon the bed; I brought it down and asked the other woman whose it was; she said she could not tell. I asked the prisoner whose it was; she said she could not tell. Then I took the hat and the prisoner away to the publick-house where the prosecutrix was. I asked the prosecutrix to describe her hat before I produced it; she did describe it by some spots which there were in the lining. She immediately knew the prisoner. She said that was the woman who took off her hat and knocked her down.</p>
               <p>A Witness sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prosecutrix very well. I sold her this hat about a month before.</p>

               <p>I lay in this lodging-house two nights; a strange young woman was put to bed to me; they took me up in the morning before the justice. This young woman has never been seen or heard of since. I know nothing about the hat, but its being found in that lodging.</p>

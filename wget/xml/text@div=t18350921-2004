                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Delaney, who keeps the Red Lion, Great Windmill-street, Westminster. On the 11th of Septem<lb></lb>ber the prisoner Clements came in for a pennyworth of gin; she offered a bad shilling' I threw it into the till—there was no other shilling there—I gave her change—she went out of one door and the policeman came in with the other prisoner at the other—I gave the policeman the shilling which I had taken of the woman—he told me to mark it, which I did.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant C</hi> 2.) I was at Brewer-street, on the 11th of September, at half-past two o'clock—I saw the two prisoners walking arm-in-arm, with an umbrella over them—they went into a cheesemonger's shop—they then went down into Great Windmill-street—I saw the man give Clements a shilling, and she went into the public-house at the corner of Archer-street—the man walked down the court; I followed him—he was going to put his hand to his mouth—I seized him—he struggled—I threw him down, and took from his hand a bad shilling, and a penny-piece—I took him into the Red Lion—I got this other shilling from the prosecutor, and then pursued the prisoner Clements, and found in her hand this good sixpence, and five-pence in copper—I searched Hendry at the station-house, and found on him a piece of bee's wax, ano<lb></lb>ther bad shilling, and one shilling and five pence in copper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hendry's Defence.</hi> I had not had them in my possession a quarter of an hour—I had taken them for some steel pens, and was looking at what I had got under the court, as it rained—I knew no more of the money being bad than a child unborn—I think it was a planned thing to take me—I had sold my box and steel pens for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the Haymarket—I never saw this young woman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Clement's Defence.</hi> I received the shilling at the cheesemonger's Shop, which I took to this public-house, and got the gin and the change—I came out again, and saw the crowd—they said it was a young man taken for stealing a coat—I then went into the public-house again—this officer came and took me, and said I had been with this young man—I do not know him, and had not seen him.</p>

               <p>was to be done—that was with Mr. Constable, the senior clerk of the works—I did not say to the prisoner, "I shall have some old bricks in a few days, you may as well have them; they will suit you"—he did not say to me, "I don't require them; my buildings are nearly completed"—I did not say "You may as well have them as anybody else, and put a pound in my pocket"—nothing of that kind occurred at the gate of the engineer's yard, near to the Arsenal—I had no conversation with him near the gate of the engineer's yard—he did not say "How many have you got?"—I did not say, "I shall have a great many in a few days;" nothing of the kind ever passed—I know Turner; I never saw him take any bricks to the pri<lb></lb>soner; I never saw him at the clothing store at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not Turner on one morning, about twenty minutes before 5 o'clock, come out of the clothing store with a load of bricks in a cart, and did not you come out immediately afterwards with a five-foot rod in your hand, and did you not walk before the cart to the guard-house, and there stop, look up and down the road, and then make a sign with your hand to Turner to come on with the bricks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never did—I know Scott, and I am sorry to know him, because he is quite capable of taking any man's life away; I did not see Scott that morning; I am not aware that he has had to report about some misconduct—I don't know about a cart with a load of battens; they were not found in a covered store; Mr. Whitaker has never complained to me about it—there was not any mistake about these battens, nor did I say that my man had taken them without my orders—I am not aware that there was some mistake about battens that were taken to a wrong place, about which I was charged, and that I said my man Jenkins had taken them by mistake—I don't recollect saying that my man had taken them without my orders; I will not be positive—I went in company with Rowe to the Wool<lb></lb>wich gardens; there were six in company altogether; there was a man of the name of Marsh there—I had no conversation with Rowe about the bricks, nor any altercation with him—he did not give me any money that day—some of us went in one part and some in another; I was some time with Rowe; we had a shooting match—I swear he did not give me any money.</p>

I live at No. 6, Fitzroy-place; I know Mr. Hoskins—I saw him come out of the clothing store one morning, and walk down towards the guard-house; and I saw Turner come out with his horse and cart, and turn his horse towards the wall—the cart was loaded with bricks and stocks—Mr. Hoskins walked down towards the guard-house, and looked up and down, and lifted up his hand with one or two five-foot rods in it—and then Turner went down—I went and had some half-and-half; I was going home, and I saw Turner tipping up a load of bricks on the ground where Rowe was building two houses; and I said he was shooting them up; he said, "All right master;" and I passed on—I missed some battens, and I went and made some inquiry about them of Mr. Hoskins; he said he knew nothing about them—I told him I had found them in a shed—he said they were taken there by Jenkins, and he did not know anything about them.</p>

               <p>JOHN HEMERY. I keep the public-house. I saw the witness place a sovereign on the counter, and ask my wife for change; the prisoner was standing on his right-hand; he gave my wife a shilling - she put down a sixpence and 3d.; she then said to the witness, "You have not given me the sovereign;" he said he thought he had, be searched his pockets, and found he was a sovereign short; I had suspicion of Snape, from the sixpence being left on the counter - I called him, and said I wanted to speak with him; I accused him of it, and he denied it - I sent for the Police-man; as soon as he saw him he stooped down, and I heard a sovereign fall near him - the Police-man said,"Here's a sovereign;" I had known the prisoner for seven years - he has been a very honest industrious man, and I believe bore a good character.</p>

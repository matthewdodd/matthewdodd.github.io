               <p>On Monday night, the 19th of February, I was robbed in the <placeName id="t17870221-41-crimeloc211">Hay-market</placeName>

               <p>Was the crowd still about the Opera door at that late hour? - It was an early hour; it was the night of the masquerade; one person I felt take hold of one pocket,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210090"></xptr>and one person of the other; and one laid hold of my hat, another pulled my watch out of my pocket; I caught hold of the seals; I retained the seals; the watch was taken and the chain; I had hold of the chain; I felt the chain as I walked with my hand on my pocket which I endeavoured to secure; after they got the watch, the chain remained in my hand; I saw three or four men picking up some guineas which had fallen from my breeches pocket; which they had turned out; the next day I advertised my watch as having been lost at that place; I was fearfull of taking any of the men surrounded as I was.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of the persons by sight? - No, there was no lamps at the door.</p>
               <p>Did any of them shove you or strike you before the watch was taken? - No, nothing more than the pressure of the crowd; I had hold of the chain all the time.</p>
               <p>Did it require any considerable degree of violence to break the chain? - I defended it as hard as I could; and the man pulled as hard as he could.</p>
               <p>Was there any struggle? - Only pulling at the chain; I perceived him take it, and I endeavoured to retain it, and he pulled it from me.</p>
               <p>It was then by the force of his pulling that it was taken from you? - It was.</p>
               <p>You endeavoured to retreat? - I did; I found it was too late for that; when they closed in upon me there was a hustleing as much as might be expected upon such an occasion.</p>
               <p>Was the pressure of the crowd occasioned by the concourse of people, or was it occasioned by these people? - I felt no crowd till these people came up.</p>
               <p>It was then apparently a crowd of their own making? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you by advertiseing ever find the watch again? - On Wednesday morning after a constable came and informed me that a person had been stopped with a watch upon him, which answered my description; in consequence of that, I went to the office in Litchfield-street; a person was brought to the bar on whom the watch had been found; that was the prisoner; a watch was produced, which from the maker's name I believe to be mine; the case was out, and the glass was broke; it was in a mutilated state; when I lost it, it had a glass upon it, and a green fish skin, or a shagreen case; as the outside case.</p>
               <p>Did you before you lost the watch know the maker's name and number? - Number there was none; the maker's name I knew; I believe it to be mine, but I cannot positively swear to it; if the maker's name had been out, I think I should not have known it; the prisoner said, he found the watch in the street, at the Justice's; the maker's name is

               <p>From the view of this watch what remains of it have you any doubt whether it is, or is not your watch? - (Looks at it.) - I think it to be my watch.</p>
               <p>Have you any recollection from the general appearance of the watch, or the dial plate or any thing; have you any recollection but from the maker's name: suppose before the watch had been produced to you the maker's name had been rubbed out and defaced, is there any thing that would have enabled you to say it was your watch? No, certainly.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner at the bar in company with several others, and I heard he was wanted for several other matters; I went to Young to get his assistance; Young came to me, and we took the prisoner; he was in the room where I saw him before; in searching him, I found that watch; it was in the same condition it is now, without a case; we asked him how he came by it; he said, it was his mother's; he was committed; when he was examined, he said, he found the watch in the kennel opposite the Opera house at twelve o'clock the night before.</p>

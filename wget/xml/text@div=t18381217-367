               <p>of retreat—I confess my conduct was ambiguous—it was designedly so—I told Mr. Kendall I would not give up the idea which I had of prosecuting; and that, even if I did excuse him, it would be impossible for him to do any thing in the coal trade, and the only chance he had would be the drapery—I did not tell him I was sorry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Dill you tell the prisoner's wife's sister that the prisoner might con<lb></lb>duct the linendrapery business, but you must have the coal connexion—he must never afterwards trouble himself with that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not believe I did—I carefully abstained from making any promise not to prosecute—I said all I could not to commit myself—I offered a reward for the prisoner—my intention was well known—if I made any remark to Mrs. Copsey's sister, it was to the same effect as to Mr. Kendall—I did not tell Mr. Kendall, that if the prisoner would come and put his accounts to rights, I would not think of proceeding any further—I wrote a letter to the prisoner, and in consequence of that he came, and I had him taken.</p>

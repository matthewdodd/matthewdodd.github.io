             keeps the house. I had three boxes in the attic, containing this property; it was all safe on Saturday the 15th of November, in the morning - I missed them at eleven at night - I told the patrol, who got out of the window, and immediately under the window, outside the house, found a hammer, which exactly fitted the marks on the window which had been broken open - the house must have been entered that way - my boxes were found in the next house (which the prisoner had the care of for Mr. Bagshaw), broken open, and every thing of value taken out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Does Jones reside on the premises - A. Yes; she is the lessee - nobody slept in the adjoining house; it is used by Bagshaw to deposit vases in.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was on duty at twelve o'clock at night, and heard of this robbery. I went to the next house, knocked at the door for some time, and the prisoner let me in; he said he was in care of the house; I told him the next house had been robbed, and I must search that house: he appeared confused; I asked if any person was in the house with him; he said there was a boy, who he hired about a fortnight before, and he believed he could find that boy by going with us to his house; and then said he thought he could not find the house. We proceeded to search; he took a candle, and went on before us up stairs, and on the landing place in the attic floor are two closets - he opened one, and said, "Gentlemen, I suppose that is what you are looking for;" and there were the three boxes. I searched all over the house, and could find nobody but him - there were other empty houses in that range of buildings - the trapdoor of this house was shut - but I do not know whether it was bolted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you mention to the Magistrate about his being confused - A. No. The prosecutor accompanied me over the house. A boy was afterwards apprehended and discharged.</p>

            . I received the prisoner in charge at the watch-house, and produce the hammer, which I received from the prosecutor. I compared it with the marks on the window, and found it corresponded. The prisoner had a bundle. I asked why he had his things tied up; he said, because he was going to leave the premises to-morrow. There was a piece of Indian ink in the bundle. I asked if Mr. Bagshaw knew he was going to leave; he said, he had no occasion to let him know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was anything said about the Indian ink before the Magistrate - A. Yes; he said he used it to practice drawing - he is a painter. I took Warne next morning by his information.</p>

            . I am shop-boy at the house in Regent-street. I left there a little before five o'clock on the day of the robbery, and went to a public-house in Leicester-square with the prisoner; staid three-quarters of an hour, and then went away. When I went to dinner, he told me to bring a hammer, to open some casks which had come out of the country. I did so; and a porter was there who opened the casks with it. I thought he might want it again, and did not carry it back. It is my father's, and is the one produced. I was to have gone on Monday, as usual. I was not in Regent-street after five o'clock. I did not go into Jones's house. The prisoner told me, in the course of the week, that he meant to leave on that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did the porter leave - A. He and the prisoner left together at five o'clock, and went to the public-house. He did not desire me to leave the hammer. I told him I was going to move to No. 42, Monmouth-street, and he wrote it down. He was employed to paint this house. He kept the key, but I did not know that he slept there. He lodged at the Sun, public-house, in Haydon-street. I never knew him stay all night. There was no bed there.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW to DOYLE. Q. Did not you see a light in the shop when you knocked at the door - A. I saw a glimmer of light before I knocked, but it was three or four minutes before anybody came. He had a candle and fire in the parlour behind the shop, and said he had slept there two or three nights on some saw-dust, which was scattered about the shop. He was dressed when he let me in.</p>
               <p>MR. IVYLEAFE. Here is the hammer I found on the parapet. I cannot swear to this Indian ink, I had several pieces in my box, and some of this size. Nothing but papers were left in my box.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long defence, stated, that he was going to leave the house next morning, and was sitting up for the purpose of writing letters and arranging accounts; that he had slept there several nights, by laying sacks on the saw-dust. The reason of his not opening the door immediately, was on account of having put a desk against the room-door to barricade it, and he had to move it before he could get out.</p>

Mrs. Malone asked my husband to lend her two shillings? He sent her to me, and I pulled out my purse and gave it to her, that was between twelve and one o'clock. I believe I had in my purse a guinea in gold and four shillings in silver, besides the two shillings I gave Mrs. Malone; when I had given her the two shillings I tied up my purse and put it into my pocket; there was a chair at my back; I sat down in it. Mrs. Malone carried the two shillings to her husband and returned to me. I said I was very indifferent, and wished I was at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180016"></xptr> home. She said, I had better have some peppermint. I asked for the prisoner Mrs. Murphy who was in company.</p>
               <p>Was she present when you pulled out your purse? - I cannot say; she was present when I pulled it out in the parlour to give my husband two shillings to pay the reckoning.</p>
               <p>You say you was a little indifferent , was you at all in liquor? - No. I said I wished Mrs. Murphy would go into the parlour to tell my husband I wanted to go home. She said here I am my dear; Mrs. Malone and Murphy both asked for some drops, and Mrs. Malone went to get a glass of water, and Mrs. Murphy put her hand in my pocket to feel, as I thought, for a smelling bottle; after I had drank a little water I fainted away. I was not in that situation above three minutes by the account of the company. Mrs. Murphy went into the parlour to call my husband , and did not come in again; the bar was very small; there cannot above three persons stand in it; when I came to myself my husband came to me and asked me to go into the other room, and I did. I was very cold; my husband ordered some hot punch for me to have some before I went home. He said, as he called for the liquor, it was right we should pay for it. I felt in my pocket for my purse and missed it; some of the people went to look in the bar for it but could not find it. I knew Mrs. Murphy's hand had been in my pocket, but I did not think she could do such a thing; I had not the impudence to charge her with it; in about a minute after the bar had been searched she asked for one

             a young man, who was in company with us, and went out. I then went and looked in the bar myself and found the purse dropped in the corner of the bar. I catched it up in hopes the money was in it, but found it empty; when I returned into the room she was in the room offering to lend my husband a shilling to pay for the liquor, telling him not to make any more fuss about it. I went up to her and said Mrs. Murphy you are the woman which took my purse out of my pocket. She looked as red as scarlet, and said, me! Mrs. Lorder, and down she sat; then Mrs. Malone and the other woman began to pull off their things to be searched. Mrs. Murphy untied her apron and pretended to unlace her stays, but she was not searched.</p>
               <p>Did you see her hand when it came out of your pocket? - No. I felt it in my pocket; it could be no-body's but her's; when I felt it it rather roused me; she stood by me; I saw her hand in my pocket.</p>

               <p>When she gave you the 2 s. did you observe what she did with the purse? - No; I saw her doing it up; I did not stop to see what she did with it; I asked her if she would have a glass of peppermint; she said no; she said where is Mrs. Murphy; she was behind me, and said here I am; she said she wished she would call her husband; I said stay a little, she will be better presently, it is a pity to disturb Mr. Lorden; she said to Mrs. Lorden here I am, my dear, and went and laid hold of her hand; Mrs. Lorden laid her head against her breast; I asked her to have a drop of water, and took a bason down off the shelf , during which time she said the prisoner put her hand into her pocket; I did not see it. When the purse was missed the landlord, the landlady, and a young man, and I, went and searched the bar; the prisoner was then gone out; she went out immediately on Mrs. Lorden saying she missed her purse; we looked round the bar, but could see nothing of it; the prisoner came back into the room; I said there was nobody but she and the landlady in the bar, and insisted on having her searched.</p>
               <p>Was that before or after Mrs. Lorden found the purse? - Before.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner searched? - No, by nobody but herself. I insisted upon Mrs. Lorden searching me. After this Mrs. Murphy went out, asking for George; while she was gone out Mrs. Lorden said, do not let us be too positive, let us go and have another look in the bar. I went with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178010180017"></xptr> her; she picked up the purse just as she went in on the right hand.</p>
               <p>Had you looked before in the place where she found it? - Yes, I am very clear I had, and that then it was not there.</p>
               <p>How long was this after the prisoner Murphy went out to look for George? - Not above eight or nine minutes.</p>

I went to a publick-house , and saw her drinking; she went with me to her lodgings; she put her hand under her pillow, took out a white rag, and put it in her pocket; when she came to the justice's the justice asked her how much money she had in her pocket; she pulled out the rag, with five guineas in it; she said she knew nothing of the charge; the justice delivered a guinea and 4 s. to me, which was what Mrs. Lorden said she had lost.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of it. I was at this house-warming when the purse was missed; the women pulled off their things; she searched me, made me pull off my stays; she pulled my hat off, and searched in my mouth. I do not know why she should charge me more than any body else with taking it. The constable has got three guineas of mine. They used me very crookedly.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I was sent to inquire about the property. In consequence of information I went towards Hatchett's house, in High-street, Kensington, on Tuesday, the 23d of November, with Chester, the waiter at the hotel. In the way we met

            ; Chester asked her where she had been? She said to Brompton. I asked her if she had not been to her son, Mitchell, at Kensington? She said, No. I asked her again - she denied it a second time. I then asked her who she had been to at Bromptom? I said I must know the person's name. She refused to tell. I took her into custody, and took her to her son Mitchell's. Before we got there she acknowledged she had been to him. She went to the door, and entered the house. She first went up stairs, and met

He said it was. I asked for his wife? He said she was out, and he did not know when she would return. I asked him if he had been that day to Mr. Kimber's, the pawnbroker, at Knightsbridge? He said he had not, and never was there in his life. I said that was not true, and I must search him, which I did, and found nothing about him. I proceeded to search the room, and on my putting my hand upon a tin box which was on the mantle-piece, he made a snatch at it, and said there were notes in it. There was some little confusion, and on his endeavouring to get it from me the candle was knocked out. I procured another light. While I was examing the contents he escaped out of the room - it is a narrow staircase. I pursued him; he threw a garden-pot off the window, which fell between him and me. I fell over it - he got out and shut the door; I could not get out.</p>

I took the woman to Marlborough-street, in the first instance, and asked how her son came by the property? She said,</p>
               <p>"You may find my son, and find it out as you can." I asked her if she had not a daughter living at Chelsea, who went by the name of Alderson? She said she had, but refused to tell me where.</p>

She opened the door when I knocked. I asked her where her husband was? She said he was not at home. On my looking round the room she burst out crying, and said,</p>
               <p>"I know what you are come for - the things are all here, they were brought here by my father and mother this morning before it was well light" (pointing to a large chest and bundle). The sheets on the bed were marked</p>
               <p>"E. S." I asked if they were her's? She said,</p>
               <p>"No, they are your's, they were brought here by my mother." Chester was with me I found several napkins and towels, with the same initials. She said they were not her's, but were brought by her mother. Chester looked round the room, and found a quantity of earthenware corresponding with the other. She said,</p>
               <p>"That is your's too, they were brought by my mother, with the exception of one dish." There was a tin candlestick there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find in the boxes and bundle - A. Twenty-two sheets, fifteen of them marked</p>

               <p>"E. S.", and four without marks; thirty-four table-cloths, twenty-four marked</p>

               <p>"Hatchett's Hotel;" thirteen pillow-cases, three marked, four with the marks cut out, and three marked</p>
               <p>"E. S."; six blankets, four of them marked. There were seventy ends of sheets cut off, most of them marked</p>
               <p>"Hatchett's Hotel;" fifteen ends of towels, some of them marked; six pieces of stair-carpet, seventeen dishes, twenty-nine plates, a cup and saucer, twenty-four knives, and eight forks, all of which Chester claimed. I asked her again where her husband was? She said he was afraid to sleep at home, for fear he should be apprehended; at last she told me where to find him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of her information, go to No. 15, Gray's-buildings, Duke-street, Manchester-square - A, Yes, about one o'clock at night, and found Alderson in bed there. I awoke him, and asked his name? After a little time he said it was Alderson. I asked if that was his lodgings? He said Yes. I said, Have you any other lodging? He said No - that he always slept there, and was not married. I asked him if he had any lodgings at No. 6, Cumberland-street, Chelsea? He said No, he did not know it. I then said,</p>

               <p>"You have a lodging there, and are married. I have found a great deal of stolen property in your room, and you must dress yourself and go with me to account how you came by it." He said,</p>
               <p>"Well, that is the truth; I have a lodging there, and live with a woman named Swatman. I know the property you mention was there - it was brought by her father and mother this morning before it was well light; they knocked at the window; I got up and helped them in with it. I am sorry I did not tell you the truth, but my reasons for leaving the lodgings was, I thought if you came and found me and the things there I should be apprehended." I put him in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you proceed anywhere else - A. About three o'clock, Chester, Whales, and I went to Mitchell's mother's house, in King's Road, World's End, Chelsea. Whales placed himself at the back of the house to prevent an escape, and I knocked at the door; the mother looked out, and I told her my business, but she refused to come down and let me in. I then said I must break in. I heard a noise at the back, got over the rails, and found Mitchell in the custody of Whales - we took him into the house through the window. He then wished very much to be forgiven, and said he had told me what was not true, and that he had been that evening to Kimber's, the pawnbroker - she also said,</p>
               <p>"You found other property of Mr. Hatchett's in my room, and all I have pledged, and all you found there, was brought by my wife's mother." His wife,

               <p>"Father, it is no use denying it." I put him into a separate watch-house from them, and the next morning on my fetching him to the office, I told him what I had found at his daughter, Alderson's, in Cumberland-street. He said,</p>
               <p>"It is no use my denying it any longer. I did help to take the things there, but did not know what they were." I said,</p>

            . Her mother asked me several times if I was inclined to marry her? I said I was, but I was not able to get her decent lodgings. She said,</p>
               <p>"Don't mention that, you shall never take my daughter into bare walls." I thought she meant to furnish a place, agreed to marry her, and took a house next door to Mrs. Swatman's, for her to put the articles in - I thought it was improper to ask her where she got them. I took the things as a present. We were then married, and at different times various other things were brought, which I thought was to set us decently in order - this is how I came by the things. I call the Omnipotent to witness that I did not know they were stolen. I took their boy, to learn him to read and write to prevent him from wandering about the streets, and the mother said all the broken victuals that she got from Mr. Hatchett's should be sent for him. It came at different times wrapped in table-cloths.</p>

            'S Defence. On Saturday fortnight, between five and six o'clock in the morning, a knock came at my window - it was Mrs. Swatman. I went to the door, and Mr. and Mrs. Swatman stood there with a large chest. I asked what was the matter? She said,</p>
               <p>"We are going to move, let me put this in your passage" - they took it into the parlour, and said they would fetch it. I went to work. In the course of the day I understood she brought two bundles, and begged of her daughter not to let me know. In the evening her daughter came to me, and said the things had been stolen, and they were all ruined. We went home, and they told us two gentlemen had been there - Esther said I had better sleep out. I took her advice, and slept at my father's. Just before Esther laid in, her mother sent the sheets and table-cloths.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, do you know her. - A. Yes, she lived in my service, she only left us last Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of May last year, did you miss any thing. - A. In July I missed three yards of black lace; in the course of the summer I missed a coral necklace.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss at any time any silk - A. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was in your service at the time you missed the lace. - A. She was, she was at that time at Brighton, I wrote to her about the lace; she was wrote to, I am not confident that I wrote to her; she wrote for answer, that she believed the white lace went home to the person to whom it belonged to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the letter directed to you. - A. It was, and the black lace was in the house amongst some other things I had the house searched by my family.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come to find out where the lace was. - A. From her late conduct I suspected she was the person; I sent to Bow-street, and had papers sent round to all the pawnbrokers; in consequence of that I found out where the white lace was; I engaged an officer to meet me at my house when they came from Brighton. The whole of it is in the hands of the pawnbrokers now in court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. This young woman had lived with you a long while. - A. Near a year and five months.</p>
               <p>Q. She had the management of your business at Brighton. - A. Yes, for three weeks; I left her at Brighton in the management of my business.</p>
               <p>- AVERY. I am servant to Mr. Baxter, a pawnbroker. I produce three yards and a half of black lace, the prisoner at the bar pledged it with me on the 23d of May, for two pound. I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>THOMHS BURTON. I am a pawnbroker;</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, do you know her. - A. I do not. I produce thirteen yards of silk.</p>
               <p>Q.to prosecutrix. I think you said you did not miss any silk. - A. None at all of that description; I had silk of that description, but it is plain silk, I cannot, swear to it, my books have not arrived from Brighton, I have not refered to them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Mrs. Lacomb's house on Sunday last, about six or seven o'clock at night; when I saw the prisoner, I told her I was an officer of Bow-street, I had come to take her in custody on suspicion of stealing some white and black lace, and other things; she made answer and said, what on a Sunday night, I said yes; I told her the lace was found at the pawnbrokers, I knew where it was; I asked her what she had done with the duplicates, she said she had got them in her pocket; she gave me the duplicates of the property which I have related to you.</p>
               <p>Q. How many duplicates. - A. Eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. One of the duplicates turned out to be the duplicate of the three yards and a half of lace. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The others were of separate property. - A. Yes, one of a coral necklace.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of receiving the duplicates you went to the pawnbrokers. - A. Yes, I went to Mr. Baxter's, the black lace was at Mr. Baxter's.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the other ten, were they for property of the same kind. - A. I believe some of them were her own.</p>
               <p>Q. The black lace you got from Avery. - A. Avery has brought it here.</p>
               <p>Q. When you shewed him that duplicate he produced that black lace. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Did not she say she meaned to restore it when she came to town. - A. She said she meaned to restore it, she was distressed when she pledged it.</p>
               <p>Court. She said a temporary embarrassment had induced her to pledge it, and she meant to replace it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That lace is mine, I know the lace, it was hemmed at one end, and not at the other; and when in my possession, it had a custom house mark, but now it has not; I have not the least doubt that it is my property.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you ascertain the fact, so as to say whether this lace might not have gone to Brighton, and so to be taken by her there. - A. I am certain it was not, this was never sent down to Brighton.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you make an entry in your book of every<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020025"></xptr>thing you send down to Brighton. - A. I do, but I recollect this was never sent down to Brighton.</p>
               <p>Court. Mrs. Lacomb, look at that lace, and tell us what is the value of this lace. - A. Six or eight pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give her this lace. - A. No, it was given in charge of the working milliner, I never gave it into her hand; it was in the work shop where she was.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish is your house in Berkley-square. -

            , Hanover-square.</p>

            , you and your husband rent the house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, all the circumstances in evidence are clear against the unfortunate prisoner at the bar; I have once more told you, that in cases of this sort, I would not wish you to strain the point, but on the other hand, where the property is worth six or eight pounds, meaning to put it very low, it is laid in the indictment ten pounds; she meaning to be quite within bounds, she puts it at six or eight pounds; you will look at it, and I think it would be straining too far to say it is worth less than two pounds; whatever is the consequence, we must do justice. It comes out in evidence, that this woman did tell the officer it originated from a temporary distress.</p>

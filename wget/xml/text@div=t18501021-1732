                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Banks Hardiman, of Southampton-street, Caraberwell. On 14th Sept. the prisoners came to our shop about three o'clock—Jones asked for a bottle of pickled onions—I served her—she then asked if I had any mixed pickles—I said, "Yes"—she asked me to pick out a bottle that had most onions in it—I took down the pickles; they chose one bottle—Jones then said, "I suppose you can't give me change for a sovereign, can you?"—I said, "O yes, I can;" and she put a sovereign on the counter—I went up into the parlour to fetch the change; I took out 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver—I counted it before I brought it down, and then counted it down on the counter—there were three half-crowns in it—there was the full change—Jones moved it with her hand, and said, could I oblige her with more half-crowns instead of silver—I then went to the till and took out two half-crowns—I went to the counter and put them down, and went to take five shillings from the silver—I counted it over, and there were with the two half-crowns twenty-two shillings—there were three shillings gone—they had taken up the sovereign; I never saw it after I came down from the parlour—I counted the silver once or twice, and said, "It is very strange, here ought to have been twenty-five shillings, and here are only twenty-two"—Jones said, "You have got your own change, and two shillings too much"—I said I had not, I had three shillings short—Stone said it was quite right—I said it was not, I ought to have had three shillings more—my husband came into the shop, and Stone shuffled her hand beneath her shawl and took out of her pocket a handful of peppermint-drops, and some shillings mixed with them; she shook it in her hand, and she said, "I suppose this is your money?"—she said it as if she meant, "I suppose you will say this is your money"—I cannot say bow many shillings there were, there were more than three—we sent for the constable—after we had sent for him, Stone told Jones to give me the sovereign, that I might take the three shillings out of it, that they might not be detained.</p>

Between Hermitage-street and Burr-street, Weyland,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300048"></xptr> who was on my right hand, made an attempt to get my watch, by catching at the chain; I secured it, by putting the chain in my fob: while I was doing so, White got her hand into my left-hand breeches pocket, and snatched out my green silk purse, in which were thirty-five guineas, or more, and one moidore; I felt her hand about my pocket, and missed my purse; I did not perceive her take it, but I suppose she must have taken it at that time; she ran off, and I pursued her; the other endeavoured to stop me; she got round the corner, and got out of my sight; then I went back, expecting to find the other, but she was gone. After looking some time after them, and going twice down Wapping, I saw two girls with a watchman at the Hermitage-stairs, and by their direction I found the prisoners at a house in East Smithfield. As soon as the door was opened, I saw them, and challenged them; they denied knowing any thing of me, or my money. White had an old night-cap in her bosom, with nine guineas and a half in it; one was a particular one, an old one, which, with the moidore, I took for two guineas, it being light, and being a King

The constable was then sent for; he questioned them about the remainder of the money: they both denied having any more; I took them up stairs, and searched the apartments above, but found nothing there. Weyland had only one stocking on; being asked for the other, she said it was below stairs, and part of the money was in it; she came down, and told us that the stocking laid under the table; there were ten guineas in it, and one guinea upon the floor; they declared that was all they had; I took them to the watch-house, and they were committed: I observed them, and I am sure the prisoners are the persons.</p>

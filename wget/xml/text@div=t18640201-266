                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a black</hi>). I was steward of the <hi rend="italic">Lady Eyre</hi>—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 18th November, we were between St. Helena and the Cape, and the captain sent me to get a cup of tea for him and his lady—I got it, and was then told to go and give the chief officer a cup of coffee—I went and asked the prisoner for it—he was the cook—he told me to take the coffee myself—I said, "It is not my place to take the coffee"—a dispute arose be<lb></lb>tween us, and he struck me first a back-handed blow on the forehead with the handle of a knife, and I struck him with my fist—he was peeling onions for breakfast—the mate had taken his coffee, and was gone from the galley, but he returned and parted us, and I was ordered to go an to my duty—I went to the cabin, and then went back to the galley, about my breakfast, and we began to have words—I said, "You know very well it was not a fitting cup of coffee to give to the chief officer; "and said, "You audacious fellow! how dare you treat me in that way! I have treated you as a gentleman;" and I picked up the empty water-bucket, pitched it at him, and went away—I intended to hit him with the water, but the bucket went out of my hand—he then threw a knife at me, which struck me in the shoulder and wounded me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am captain of the ship <hi rend="italic">Lady Eyre</hi>—on 18th No<lb></lb>vember we were rounding the Cape—I sent the steward for some tea, and told him to get some coffee for the mate—some time afterwards I saw the prisoner on deck running after the prosecutor with a large knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)</p>

               <p>—I went forwards and cried to the steward to look out, but before I could assist him the prisoner had inflicted a wound—when I first saw the prisoner running after the steward, he had the knife in this position (<hi rend="italic">With the handle reversed</hi>)—I and the chief officer seized him, and had a job to take it from him—I then put him in irons, dressed the prosecutor's wounds, and he was laid up—this is a certificate of the ship's register (<hi rend="italic">By this it appeared that the ship teas British-built, that ten of the shareholders resided in Liverpool, and that the master had twelve shares.</hi>)</p>

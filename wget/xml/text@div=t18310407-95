            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. On the 19th of March the prisoner was sent to me by my father-in-law, respecting some lodgings - I gave him 1s. to give him, which I believe he did; I could not go then to see the lodging, but I said I would when my husband came home; the prisoner said he would wait at the Grapes- I went there, and saw the prisoner and my father-in-law; we were going out, and the prisoner said, "Your father wants to go into the hospital;" I said, "I don't understand getting a person in there;" the prisoner said, "I do, and if you will pay for a coach I will get him in;" I said I should be much obliged to him - we got a coach; I followed them to the gate, and saw them go in; I waited some time, but the prisoner did not come out - he came to my house on the Sunday, and said my father wanted a shirt; I said I would give him a new cotton shirt on Monday - he said he was going back to him, and he did not like to go without a shirt; I then took one of my husband's shirts out of the drawer, and gave it to him - he took it, and went away; he came again on the Monday, said my father was going on well, and I need not make myself uneasy about him; on the Thursday he came and said he was very poorly, and was removed - on the Monday following he came and said he was dead and buried; I went with a friend to know the particulars, and the nurse told me that the prisoner had had the body away, with

               <p>ISABELLA KING. I am one of the sisters in the accident ward of St. Bartholomew's-hospital. On the 19th of March the patient Thomas Gardner was brought in there, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, by the prisoner, who stated he had slipped off the curb, and hurt his loins; he was removed from that ward on the 22nd - the shirt which was brought to me was a very old one, and had been worn once.</p>

            . I am one of the sister. I remember the patient being under my care - he died on the 25th of March, at two o'clock in the morning; the prisoner came to me, and said he would take him out and bury him - I said he must go to the beadle; the patient had a very old shirt on, quite a rag.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EAST. I am one of the beadles of St. Bartholomew's-hospital. I remember removing the body to the dead-house; it was taken away by the prisoner on the Friday evening - I do not know what became of it afterwards.</p>

A linen shirt, with a full bosom, small-plaited with the fingers, and it had a frill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183104070059"></xptr>on it - it had never been mended, only darned; I believe the prisoner has not buried my father.</p>

I have been in business as a French polisher—I know Burnett, otherwise Bill Day—I first became acquainted with him eight years ago, but lost sight of him till fourteen months ago, when I met him in the New-cut, I again lost sight of him till August last, when I saw him one Sunday morning, and he invited me to go round and have a cup of tea with him—I afterwards saw in his possession two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes joined together, not printed, but there was "Five" on it, and "Bank of England" in the wavy mark in the paper—in consequence of what he said to me I introduced him to the prisoner—we went over on Monday morning; and I left him at the Feathers, in Orchard-street, and went to the White Horse, in pursuit of Cummings—I gave him the piece of paper which I had previously received from Burnett, and asked him if he knew any one who could print it—he said, "Yes, by going down to Birmingham; and it was arranged that I and Cummings should go down to Birmingham with the paper on Saturday morning by the cheap train—there was one sheet joined together, it was two notes—I met Burnett on the Saturday morning in Broadwall, and we proceeded over Waterloo-bridge to where we had pre<lb></lb>viously arranged to meet Cummings at the corner of Wellington-street, Strand—we met him there, and proceeded to Euston-square station—we went into a public house there, and partook of some bread and butter and coffee—I then went and ascertained that the train, fortunately for me, did not start till the evening—we all then walked back to Wellington-street, where we left Cummings, and Burnett, and I walked over Waterloo-bridge</p>

               <p>again—it was arranged that I should see Burnett to the corner of Short-street, and we went into the public house on the same side as the pit entrance to the Lyceum Theatre—I gave Cummings a roll of paper with 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I bad received a sovereign from Burnett—I do not know what sort of paper it was, but I was given to understand it was bank paper—I gave it to Cummings to take down to be printed, but I never mentioned anything about bank paper at all; he knew what it was given to him for—he knew that it was given to him to take down to get printed—Burnett said that he was to take it down to be printed—I am not going to say that be said so to Cummings, because I do not know whether he did or not—I had given him the roll and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Burnett told him if he wanted any more, to send up to Angel-place, and give him a paper with the name of Jackson upon it—he was to write up to Jackson, 2, Angel-place, Blackfriars-road—that was where Burnett lived then.</p>

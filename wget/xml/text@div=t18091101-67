               <p>Taylor's Defence. As I was coming along Bishopsgate-street, there was a crowd on the pavement by St. Helen's. I saw the book on the pavement I took it up; this gentleman and two more followed me, and accused me of taking the pocket book, in the flurry I dropped it.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I was going to the West India Dock, I had a newspaper in my hand reading of it, and when I got into the court I was reading of it. I immediately turned round my head, I saw three men lay hold of this young man; I was fifty yards a head, I turned back with the newspaper in my hand, and when I came to the people that had hold of this man, Steven's laid hold of me, and said I was one of them. He snatched the newspaper out of my hand; he asked the gentleman if it was his newspaper, the gentleman said it was not, he gave it me back again.</p>
               <p>Stevens. I did not snatch the newspaper out of his hand, I asked Christian if it was his property. There were three of them together going down St. Helen's, one of them got away.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 7th of September, as I was walking along St. John's-street with one Mr. Saunders, about eleven or twelve o'clock, I met with the prisoner at the bar.</p>


               <p>Had you ever seen him before? - Never to my knowledge. I was going about my business, buying of clothes. Saunders is a clothes-man. The prisoner came up to me and asked me to buy some whites?</p>
               <p>What answer did you make? - I told him I did not know the meaning of whites.</p>
               <p>When he asked you to buy some whites, what did you say to him? - I did not say any thing to him.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner asked you to buy some whites, what did you say to him? - I said yes.</p>
               <p>Then you did not tell him that you did not know the meaning of whites? - No.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you on your saying yes? - He took me through an alley, and desired me to go into a public house, and call for a pint of beer, and that he would come back again in about ten minutes; Saunders and me went into the ale-house, and Saunders went backwards, mean while the prisoner at the bar came to me.</p>
               <p>How long after? - About six minutes afterwards, I can't say justly to a minute, then the prisoner wanted me to go out of the room with him, and as I was going out with the prisoner, Saunders followed out of the yard; the prisoner said, there is no occasion for you both, one is sufficient; so I went with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Who desired you to go out of the house at all? - Nobody desired us to out, we went together, me and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Why? - We had no business to do in the ale-house further.</p>
               <p>Do make yourself more intelligible, when the prisoner came to the alehouse,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120047"></xptr>what did you do? - He asked me if I had any beer, I told him yes, and he paid for the beer and changed sixpence, and the landlord gave him the change, then I went out with the prisoner by his desire.</p>
               <p>Then when Saunders was going to follow, what did the prisoner say? - He said there was no occasion for us both, there was no occasion to do any thing under four eyes.</p>
               <p>What more did the prisoner say? - The prisoner said I should go with him, and he asked me if I had got the money ready to buy the counterfeit shillings?</p>
               <p>Court. Did he make use of that expression, tell us exactly what he said, and what the words were that he made use of? - That I should go with him to the alehouse, and if I had the money to pay for the counterfeit shillings -</p>
               <p>Were those the words he made use of? - He did not make use of the words counterfeit shillings.</p>
               <p>Tell us the very words he made use of, his own words? - We were walking along towards Cow-cross to the ale-house.</p>
               <p>What did he say to you? - He asked me how many I wanted.</p>
               <p>Saunders was not with you then? - No, he staid behind.</p>
               <p>He asked you how many you wanted? - Yes; I told him I would go back to my friend Saunders, and ask him how much money he had, as I had not money enough to pay for them; I went back to Saunders, and he sent me to the prisoner, and said I should bargain for three guineas worth.</p>
               <p>Then Saunders waited for you at the publick-house? - Yes.</p>

               <p>And you left him to go back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What house did you leave the prisoner at? - I think it is the Red-Lion in Cow-Cross.</p>
               <p>Now had any thing passed in the way to the first publick house in Cow-cross, had the prisoner said any thing to you about what whites were? - No, I do not recollect that there had.</p>
               <p>You came back to the <placeName id="t17870912-22-crimeloc110">Red-Lion, Cow-cross</placeName>

               <p>Did you order any? - Three guineas worth; I went back again to Saunders, and Saunders told me that the man ought to be apprehended before Sir Sampson Wright; we went up to Sir Sampson Wright, and we met Mr. Clarke, and we related the business to him, he ordered me to go back and buy a guinea's worth, I told him I had not money, and he said I will send an officer with you, who shall give you a guinea.</p>
               <p>Did he give you that guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who gave you that guinea? - Mr. Ting.</p>
               <p>Then you went back to the publick-house? - Yes, I went and found the prisoner there to his time; he took me behind in a parlour, and called for a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Did Saunders go back with you? - Yes, and the officer.</p>
               <p>But you did not all go in to the prisoner? - No; I went in alone, I left them in the street, two or three doors from the publick-house; the prisoner took me backwards into the parlour, and he bid me to stop a few minutes, as he had them not about him, and he would send out for them.</p>
               <p>Did he ask you how many you wanted then? - Yes, and I told him a guinea's worth, and he sent out for a guinea's worth.</p>
               <p>Who did he send out for the guinea's worth? - That I can't tell, he came in about two minutes into the parlour, and he brought me them tied up in a paper, and he said there is thirty-two shillings for the guinea, I gave him the guinea, and he gave me the counterfeit money; he told me there was no occasion to count them, they were very right, for fear any body should come into the parlour, he said I might count them if I pleased, but there was no occasion for it.</p>
               <p>Did you take them without counting? - Yes, and then he made me a present of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120048"></xptr>six sixpences and a shilling for my trouble, that I should come to him again, if I wanted any more.</p>
               <p>What else did he say? - He said I should be sure to find him at that same publick-house.</p>
               <p>What did you do then with the money? - I kept it in my pocket till I came to the officers.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the money? - I gave it to Mr. Ting, and then they went into the house to apprehend the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You thought you was buying some white cloth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The thing he asked you to buy was some whites? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he said here is thirty-two for a guinea? - I do not know what it was at first.</p>
               <p>Those were his words, thirty-two for a guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he say, here are thirty-two for a guinea, or thirty-two shillings for a guinea, or thirty-two shillings-worth for a guinea? - Thirty-two shillings-worth.</p>
               <p>How much money had you in your pocket when you first met him? - Two shillings.</p>
               <p>You were going about purchasing old clothes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was your whole stock in trade? - No more.</p>
               <p>That had been your whole stock ever since you came from the other side of the water? - I was there that very day.</p>
               <p>I don't mean in the Borough; you know that little story which you went abroad about? - I went never abroad out of England.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you have never been abroad? - If I have been abroad, I have been abroad for no harm, I came from abroad.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you first came to England? - I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Is it nine years ago? - Nineteen.</p>
               <p>Do you want to swear that you have not been out of England for the last nine years? - I have been.</p>
               <p>Where did you go to when you took a jaunt over the water? - About my business.</p>
               <p>Where did you happen to go, whereabouts? - I went where I had business to do.</p>
               <p>Where did your business carry you to? - I have been at Ostend.</p>
               <p>How long is that ago, honest Mr. Simon? - I can't really tell you.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you went? - It may be four or five years.</p>
               <p>How long have you been come back again? - About four years and a half or thereabouts, I can't tell.</p>
               <p>You staid longer than that abroad? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did not you stay till the witness died? - That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Has there not been a story about some stolen goods since you came home? - I never bought any stolen goods.</p>
               <p>I do not ask you that, but has not there been a sly story about stolen goods? - That was all wrong.</p>
               <p>Tell me what it was, this little matter about stolen goods? - It was wrong or I should have suffered the law.</p>
               <p>Then there was such a thing; do you know

            ? - No, I can't recollect her.</p>
               <p>Try a little, because I will shew her to you? - I should be glad to see her?</p>
               <p>You shall see her; do you know her? - I cannot tell, there is many Barnets.</p>
               <p>Let us into the secret about the stolen goods, that is, since you came from Ostend? - I never bought any in my life.</p>
               <p>When was it they said you bought some? - I never said that.</p>
               <p>But somebody else has. - They could not prove it.</p>
               <p>How long is it since they said that? - I don't keep an almanack in my head.</p>
               <p>When did the people swear you did? - I don't know what people swear.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120049"></xptr>Do you mean to say that? - Men will say any thing</p>
               <p>We have an instance of that to-day; did they say any thing, and what? - I don't know what they say.</p>
               <p>Don't you know whether you were charged with receiving stolen-goods? - I was charged.</p>
               <p>How long is it since the charge was made? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Try without the almanack; it does not happen every day you know, how many weeks is it ago? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How many days before this buying of the white cloth was it, that you were charged with receiving some stolen goods? - I cannot really remember the time.</p>
               <p>Who was the officer that searched your house, and had you in custody? - Mr. Meecham.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - At the other end of the town.</p>
               <p>What part? - One Treadway was in my house.</p>
               <p>How long is it since Meecham and Treadway were at your house upon this business? - I cannot say, about a twelvemonth perhaps.</p>
               <p>Have you had no charge about stolen goods later than a twelvemonth? - Never before that, nor ever since.</p>
               <p>Has no body charged you with receiving stolen goods within this twelvemonth? - I cannot swear that.</p>
               <p>You never knew what whites were before? - Never.</p>
               <p>How came you to go to Bow-street to see Ting? - To apprehend such a man as him.</p>
               <p>For what? - For selling such things.</p>
               <p>What, for selling white cloth? - It turned out to be counterfeit money.</p>
               <p>But when you went to Bow-street, you thought it was white cloth? - He told me he would sell me thirty-two shillings for a guinea.</p>
               <p>That was after you came from Bow-street. - No.</p>
               <p>You met Mr. Clarke accidentally, as you went to Bow-street? - No, I met him before the door of the office.</p>
               <p>Did you know Mr. Clarke before? - No.</p>
               <p>Why then did you speak to Mr. Clarke first or did he speak to you? - I spoke to Mr. Clarke.</p>
               <p>You did not know him before? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you say to him? - I told Mr. Clarke that such a man had got such things to sell.</p>
               <p>Let us hear plainer than that, what was your expression? - I told him that a man wanted to sell thirty-two shillings for a guinea.</p>
               <p>That was what you said as soon as you saw Mr. Clarke in the street; you said, Mr. Clarke, there is a man wants to sell thirty-two shillings for a guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Clarke took you into the office? - No, he sent Ting with me.</p>
               <p>He would not trust you with the guinea? - But Ting did; the officer gave me the guinea.</p>
               <p>You did not know Mr. Clarke before? - No.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, I ask you whether till you went to Bow-street, you did not think you were buying white cloth? - My friend Saunders told me so.</p>
               <p>Did Saunders tell you were to have thirty-two shillings for a guinea? - The prisoner at the bar told me so.</p>
               <p>When did he tell you that? - He told me that in the way we were going to the Red Lion public-house.</p>
               <p>Before you went to Bow-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, what did he say? - He told me he would let me have thirty-two shillings for a guinea.</p>
               <p>How much had you in the whole? - I did not count them; the officer counted them.</p>
               <p>How much had you? - Thirty-two.</p>
               <p>Thirty-two what? - Thirty six-pences and sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Had not you more? - No more.</p>
               <p>Had not you thirty-six? - Twelve six-pences and a shilling he made me a present of.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120050"></xptr>What did you receive in the whole? - Seventeen shillings and thirty-six sixpences.</p>

               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was in the paper that he sold you? Yes, I saw them counted by the officer.</p>
               <p>Was not there a small story of your receiving a Sun-fire-office bag which had been stolen from a fire? - I never received any such thing.</p>
               <p>Were you not accused of it? - I was accused of it; I was not the man convicted of stealing it.</p>
               <p>I don't know that; did you yourself go to amuse yourself at the fire? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take any out of the paper before you gave them to the officer? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never count them? - No, I never counted them.</p>
               <p>Then he cheated you of a shilling; are you sure that the paper counted contained the precise number that the prisoner gave you? - I never once opened it; it never was opened in my hands; I delivered all I received into the officer's hands, without even having opened the paper at all; I am sure of that.</p>

            ; he asked me where I was going, and I told him I was going to seek clothes; we walked together as far as St. John-street, as we was walking along St. John-street, I was the space of twenty yards before him, I missed him, and I turned myself round, and I saw him standing at the corner of an alley with the prisoner at the bar;

             gave me the wink to follow him; I did, they went through the alley, and I followed them; Simon stopped at a public-house, and the prisoner at the bar went towards Cow-cross.</p>
               <p>You had reason to suspect something, and you went to Bow-street? - Yes.</p>

             went in and purchased the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you see him purchase it? - No, I did not; I was standing on the outside of the door.</p>
               <p>What did he do with the money he purchased from the prisoner? - He gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>Then you and the officer went in and took the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is all you know? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You and Mr. Simons had not been in company together that morning? - Yes, we walked together, and I got before him.</p>
               <p>Then he gave you the wink to follow him? - Yes; I did not hear him cry clothes, and that made me turn about.</p>
               <p>You are in a sort of partnership then? - No.</p>
               <p>How much money had you in your pocket that morning? - I had about fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Did you know Simons before he went abroad? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you are but lately acquainted with him? - I know the man as far as we all know one another.</p>
               <p>All honest men know one another? - I am as honest as the world will let me.</p>
               <p>This is a pretty good job for you, is it not? - I think it becomes every man to do justice to his king and country.</p>
               <p>When you first met Simons after the man had been talking with him, what did he tell you he offered him? - I asked him what the man had to sell; says he, he has got some whites; says I, do you know the meaning of whites? no, says he; well then, says I, it is counterfeit money.</p>
               <p>You knew very well what it was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So you told him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Ting gave you the money to pay for this? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What did you understand by the wink? - That is very often among our people, very few travel with much money in their pocket, and we often assist one another with money, in case one gets a good bargain.</p>
               <p>There is no occasion for a wink, he could have called you back; is not the course of your dealing to leave earnest when you buy a thing? - No.</p>

               <p>Did Simons give you any thing? - Not then, he did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon that Saunders and you went in? - Yes, and Saunders says, this is the man; then I fetched him out of that house, and we went into another public-house, over the way.</p>
               <p>Simons did not give you any thing then? - No, I took him into the public-house and then I searched him.</p>
               <p>What did you find upon him? - These two guineas in his fob; the one is the guinea I gave Simons, there is two cuts in it before the face of it; that guinea I took out of his pocket; that is the guinea I gave Simons, and that is the guinea I took out of his pocket, and this I took from Simons.</p>
               <p>When did you first see that in Simons's possession? - At the second public-house.</p>
               <p>Where had he it when you first saw him; had he it in his pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Simons take it out of his pocket? - I can't tell; I never saw it till I came to that public-house.</p>
               <p>How was it done up? - It was tied up in a paper, with this very bit of string I have here in a brown paper, but that is not the paper, that paper is worn out; I opened it and counted it; there are sixteen shillings and thirty six-pences; I am sure that is the same number.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did Simons produce any that the prisoner had made a present to him at the same time? - Yes; he had these in his pocket loose, and he made me a present of them; I have them here.</p>

               <p>Have you ever had any dealings with him before, on account of bad money? - Never.</p>
               <p>How have you known him? - Crying old clothes about the streets.</p>
               <p>Did you never have any informations about bad money from him before? - Never that I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that positively? - To the best of my knowledge, I don't know that I have.</p>

               <p>You understand the extent of the question; I don't mean coining? - I never had any dealings with respect to coining with him, except this.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any reward under this act? - None at all.</p>
               <p>But you always make some compensation to these people? - That depends upon what the Solicitor to the Mint chuses to give them; every man ought to be paid for his trouble.</p>
               <p>Court. When these people brought you this information; did they ask you what they were to have, or how they were to be paid? - No, not a word when they came to the office to give the information; they were there before I was, and had mentioned the same information as they did to me.</p>
               <p>You found them there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then they gave the information? - Yes, I put the question as I generally do, asking them where.</p>
               <p>Who did they speak to when they first came in; did they give you the first information? - I was informed they had given the information.</p>
               <p>Then it is not true that they first met you in the street, and gave you the information there? - Yes, I saw them in the street; they saw me first, but they had been at the publick office first.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know, whether at the public office for any other purpose, or for any other information, Saunders had received had received money before? - I do not happen to know.</p>
               <p>Court to Saunders. Have you not before this, received money at Bow-street from the officers? - I never received any money but once, when Sir Sampson Wright sent me down into the country to fetch a watch back, and gave me a guinea for my expences.</p>
               <p>Is that all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes, positively, Sir Sampson Wright gave me a guinea to go forty-five miles into the country, that is all the money I received in that office in my life.</p>
               <p>What case was that in, was you examined here afterwards? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Have you any witness to shew that either of these men asked for two half guineas for a guinea? - No, my Lord, I cannot I have.</p>
               <p>Because that is a fact extremely material for your defence? - There was not above two people in the house, and they were sitting backwards at dinner, and I was standing by the bar door.</p>
               <p>Who was in the bar? - I did not see any body in the bar; I was between the bar door and the tap.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say there was nobody there? - Nobody but the persons who were eating their dinner behind.</p>

               <p>Was there any body in the bar? - I cannot recollect that.</p>
               <p>Do you know what money Simons had? - He had only two shillings.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - Because I searched his pockets; I thought he might be a buyer.</p>

               <p>Court to Clark. Is that so? - Yes, my Lord; it is really for no other purpose, but to blind who gave the information at the time, and to take away the suspicion from the person who gives the information.</p>
               <p>Court to Ting. Was it done? - It was done.</p>

               <p>When was it? - Yesterday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Was it men and women together? - There was men and women together; they were in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Did you know them? - No, I asked them if they had been at the Old Bailey, and they said they had, and that the trial was to come on that morning.</p>
               <p>How came you to ask? - They said they came from the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>How came they to say that to you? - Because one of our people was tried here yesterday, and I asked them when my brother's trial was to come on, they all knew his name.</p>
               <p>What did you ask them? - I asked them if the trial of my brother was come on, and they said it would not come on before to-day.</p>
               <p>Why, your brother was not to be tried? - I asked them if the trial was to come on between him and the man; I do not know the man, I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Did you tell them that you intended to come here? - Yes, I did say so.</p>
               <p>Did you never tell any body before that? - Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell your mother-in-law? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was that? - Last week and this week.</p>
               <p>Does she know the prisoner? - No, she never saw him any more than myself.</p>
               <p>Does she know him? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how came your name in that brief? - I cannot tell, many people know my name.</p>
               <p>You never told the prisoner at all? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to be Mrs. Mitchell's daughter-in-law? - I married a son of her's; her first husband's name was Barnet's; she is married again.</p>
               <p>Simon. I beg to know what she knows of me? - I can only tell what people have said; he gave a man a kick, and the next morning he was dead, and it was very well known, he flew away for it. The jury sat, and if they had not brought it in manslaughter, he would have been hung.</p>
               <p>How much have you for coming here? - Nothing at all.</p>

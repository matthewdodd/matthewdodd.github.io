I am a tailor, employed at 35, East Street, Lamb's Conduit Street—I know the prisoners; they live at 4 1/2, East Street, just opposite our shop—the prosecutrix worked at that place till about October, 1874, when she left—after she left I received two letters with the Yokohama post-mark at my private address, 82, Stanley Buildings, King's Cross—one, I believe, I received on the 2nd January and the other on the 11th January, 1875—I took them to 4 1/2, East Street, and Mrs. Whitehouse took them in—I had orders to take them there—I put them into her hand and said nothing—all the instructions I had about it was to take them to where she lived, and, Mrs. Whitehouse being a friend of hers, I was to take them there—I do not believe I saw Mrs. Dunbar from October, 1874, till I saw her at the Court; it was over twelve months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know that in 1874 Mrs. Dunbar and Mrs. Whitehouse were on very friendly terms that was the time I had instructions to take letters there—Mrs. Dunbar was in the habit of visiting the White houses—I used to work at East Street, for Mr. Sherwood the tailor and Mrs. Dunbar worked for me as seamstress—in consequence of my being slack of work she ceased to work for me, she left my service in January or February, 1874—I never received a letter till June or July, and those which I received before October I used to give to Mrs. Dunbar herself—I do not know what she did after she left me—I do not know Mr. Gray—I knew Mr. Thomas Watts, the first time I saw him was in October, 1874—he was then I believe living with Mrs. Dunbar; she told me so—I do not know that she lived with him under the name of Thomas Dunbar—I know that she had a hus<lb></lb>band named Thomas Dunbar in Yokohama—I know that she was living with Watts while she was drawing her money from her husband in Yoko<lb></lb>hama—I never wrote letters for her, I cannot write—the last time I saw her was at 4, Windmill Street, I cannot tell you the landlord or landlady's name but that is were I took the last letter—she may have told me then that she was out of work, it was a slack time of the year—I do not remem<lb></lb>ber her telling me that she had been out of work since she left my employ<lb></lb>ment, but she might have—I saw Mrs. Dunbar at both hearings at Bow Street—I told her that she had better be careful what evidence she gave—I went into a public-house with her—it does not matter to me what she says, I came here to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>M. A. <hi rend="smallCaps">DUNBAR</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>).

               <p>knew them about November, 1873, or it may have been September—Mrs. Whitehouse and I were very thick friends—she was very kind, indeed, to me in 1873—I did not exactly have my meals there, but I used to go backwards and forwards, and occasionally had something to eat and drink—I never paid anything for that and was never asked to—I did not tell Mrs. White-house, that my second husband who was in the Guards had deserted me and gone to Japan, and I had not heard from him since, or that I had deserted him—I have heard from him—I told her that he did not send me any money to support me—I asked her in January, 1874, to go with me to the Foreign Office, for the purpose of making enquiries about my husband who was in Yokohama, and as to whether he would send me over any money—she went with me and waited outside while I went in, and when I came out I told her that they would communicate with the engineers in Yokohama, and let me know—in January, 1874, I dismissed myself from Bamford's on account of slackness of work and. went to Windmill Street to work as a waistcoat tailor—that brought the same money as Mr. Bamford's as long as it lasted—I told Mr. Bamford that Mrs. Whitehouse was to take charge of my letters—I write very little and have been in the habit of getting certain people to write letters for me—when I was at Mr. Powers, in Little Wind<lb></lb>mill Street, in June or July, 1874, I got a letter from the Yokohama Light Horse Company, stating that my second husband was in their employ<lb></lb>ment and would make me an allowance of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—in July, 1874, I made the acquaintance of Mr. Watts, who I called my friend at the police-court—he is a silver polisher—I do not know from his own mouth that he is a married man, but I heard from others that he is—he has no children—he lived with me under the name of Thomas Dunbar, and during that time I drew money from my husband, the real Dunbar, at Yokohama—I bor<lb></lb>rowed some money from a loan office, and Watts was security—he signed my husband's name to the best of my belief—they put an execution into my house, and Mrs. Whitehouse then went with me to the door of the loan office—I asked the loan office people to give me time and not to press the execution—I did not say that my husband was going to have some money from India—I promised them that it should be paid—I said that I expected to receive some money from abroad; I did not say from India—I paid them 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I worked for that in Tottenham Street, and was paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—it was not paid out of the proceeds of this money order, which I am charging the prisoners with forging—I never fell out with the White houses—I first met Watts at Christmas, 1873—I never asked Mrs. Whitehouse to go to the Shanghai Bank for me and get the order of December 30th paid; I decline to say whether I was in the family way by Thomas Watts, in December, 1874—Mr. Whitehouse did not tell me in September, 1874, that he would not have me at his house because I was, deriving money from my husband and keeping Watts and myself upon it—Watts signed these rules for me in my presence—Mr. Gay has written acknowledgments abroad for me—I mean to tell the Jury, that-knowing that the Light Horse Company had promised that my husband would remit 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, I never from October, 1874, went to ask the White houses about my remittances—I knew that Whitehouse was a confidential clerk in one of the. largest houses of business in London, and I should never have thought they would have robbed me; I believe this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is either Mr. Watts' or Mr. Gay's, I do not know which—Mr. Gay is a schoolmaster—these other two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in the male prisoner's writing.</p>

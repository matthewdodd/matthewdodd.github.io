             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a dealer in cloaths; I know the prisoner perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Where was he on the 21st of December? - At half past six I was at the King's Head, Charing Cross, there I remained till half after ten; Coxill was in the house when I came in, and I left him there when I went away, at half after ten; I was in the taproom, and he likewise in the tap-room the whole time; I am sure he was there at half past six, when I came in, and there when I went away.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he never was out for half an hour, or a quarter of an hour during that time? - I cannot tell that; the major part of the time I am sure he was in, when I went away he was asleep, with his head against the fire place.</p>
               <p>To Castletine. Are you sure he could not have been out for a quarter of an hour? - I am sure he could not; he never waked, he was asleep the whole time.</p>
               <p>You are sure he never was absent? - He never was awake, but asleep the whole time.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - I am confident of it.</p>

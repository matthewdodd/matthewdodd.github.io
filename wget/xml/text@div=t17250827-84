About 5 Weeks ago, betwixt 5 and 6 in the Morning, when my Master was gone out, and my Mistress was a-bed, the Prisoner came into the Kitchen, threw me into a Leather Chair, turn'd up my Coats, threw my Legs over his Back, and enter'd my Body with his ***. I believe it was in me about half a quarter of an Hour. I struggled and cry'd out, but nobody heard me. He staid about half an Hour afterwards; then he went out and came in again, and call'd for a Mug of Beer. I was asham'd to tell my Mistress of it; but two Nights after I got her Sister

Ann Tunstall thus deposed: Amy told me that the Prisoner had ravish'd her, and put her to a great deal of Pain all the while; but she never shew'd me the Place where he hurt her. - And he's as likely to do it as any body I know, for he had like to have ravish'd me once since he serv'd her so; for truly, what does he do but comes into the Kitchen, and would needs kiss me Nolus bolus; and then, Sir, he stoops down, pretending to buckle his Shoo, and whips his Hand under my Petticoats; and if somebody had not come in, I don't know but he might have got his Will. And then he had such Tricks of throwing Water up a body's Coats, that there was no being at quiet for him.</p>

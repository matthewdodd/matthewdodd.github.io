On the 24th of September, between half-past one and two o'clock in the morning, I was out on duty, and observed the prisoner with a basket on his shoulder, coming from Red Lion-court, Wood-street, about three hundred yards from the prosecutor's house, which is in Lamb-street; I asked what he had got there, which appeared to be weighty - he said some cop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230010"></xptr>per; I said I wished to see it, and he put it down immediately - I asked where he got it from; he said from Mr. Atkins, a salesman in Spitalfields-market: I asked where he was going to take it to - he said to No. 4, Old Montague-street, Whitechapel, to his mother, and I might go with him if I pleased; he said his mother used to send Atkins silver for copper, and the reason of his being so late was, that he had been drinking with Atkins - we passed on together towards Brick-lane, where I met a watchman, and asked if he knew the prisoner; he said not - I secured him, made inquiry, and went to McLean's, with two inspectors, about two o'clock, or half-past two: I saw the prisoner searched at the watch-house, and a 5s. paper of halfpence found in each of his trousers pockets, also a phosphorus match and three farthings; the match did not appear to have been used. I produce the property I took from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What you call a match is a bit of stick with sulphur at the end? A. Yes - I found no phosphorus-box; he went quietly with me: I have not inquired at No. 4, Old Montague-street.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Mr. McLean's house is on my beat - I tried his door at one o'clock; it was all safe: after the alarm at half-past one I tried it, and found it open - I alarmed McLean, and saw three locks broken, and his desk and cupboard lock.</p>

On the evening of the 24th of September, I went to bed about ten o'clock, and left every thing secure; my elder children and servant were up after me; my bell rang about eleven o'clock - my servant called me down to speak to a person, and every thing was then safe: I was alarmed about two by the watchman ringing the bell violently - I came down and found my house open; I had left in a cupboard in my counting-house, 10l. in copper, all in 5s. papers, except a few loose coppers in a bowl - I left a sovereign and some silver in the desk, and have no doubt there were crowns and half crowns among it - after the alarm, some 5s. papers of copper were produced to me - there was 5l. 15s. in the basket, some of the papers had my own hand-writing on them, and some my son's; two of them were not marked - here are some with my writing on them; I am certain they are part of what I left safe when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear the person had got out of your house? A. There is a door in the side of my premises which leads to a passage at the side of my house; he had opened that door and drawn out two bolts; I found the door entirely open, when I came down - it must have been opened by somebody within, certainly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons did you leave up when you went to bed? A. Two sons and perhaps my daughter - I have no partner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent, and throw myself on the mercy of your Lordship. I was coming through the market, and actually picked up the basket with the copper in it - when the man stopped me I put it down, and if I had known them to be stolen, I could have thrown them down and escaped - but knowing myself innocent I went to the watch-house with him.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

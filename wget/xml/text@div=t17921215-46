He did not return till the 27th of November, and I did not see him till the 21st; he came to the Horse Guards, and asked a soldier to let him sleep in the guard in a night, and a corporal of the same company I belong to, came and informed me. I had him taken up in the morning of the 28th, and he was conducted to his master, and I took him to the magistrates, and then he was committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This gentleman gave me half a guinea to get change, and it dropped out of my hand, and I was afraid to go back again.</p>

               <p>This boy was in my service, he had been there from Sunday to Tuesday, and when he left me, he was employed to draw beer. I knew nothing of him before, he directed me to a place in Westminster, where I could get a character; I went; he had not lived there, but he had been there about eight or nine days about the house, and appeared very industrious, and he believed he was honest; he left my house on Tuesday between two and three o'clock, I missed him all of a sudden, and presently the serjeant came to me, and enquired where the boy was; he never came back till he was brought back by the corporal on the 28th of November; I asked him what made him behave in that manner, or what made him make away with the half guinea, he said, he went to a public house, and there he saw a man like a coal-heaver, who said, to him what do you want? says he, I want change for half a guinea for the serjeant; O says he, never mind going back with the half guinea, let us nd seen it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I can get a character from where I lived five years; I have always been be up very honestly, and I never do any thing of this sort before in my life; my father and mother live down at Newbury in Berkshire.</p>

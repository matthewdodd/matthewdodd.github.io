                  </hi>. I am an engineer, living at the Manor-house, Westbourne-green. I was returning from London in one of Cowderoy's omnibuses, on the 22nd of December—I was sitting on the left-hand side with my right pocket next to the door—there were two persons on the step for a very considerable time, but at this time there was only the pri<lb></lb>soner on the step—I felt a little twitching at my pocket—I could not see any one—I looked very quietly, and saw the handkerchief going through the crack of the door, and it went on until it was taken out through the crack—I got up, looked at the prisoner, and said, "I will stop here"—I saw him throw the handkerchief on the step—I jumped out, seized him, and gave him to the police—I saw it in his hand, and then he threw it down on the step.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It was quite accidental that I saw the omnibus at that time of night—I am not the conductor.</p>

PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One o'clock in the morning—I had rode from Oxford-street—I left the City at twelve o'clock, and was at Paddington by one—I did not leave the City in the omnibus—I might have been half an hour in the omnibus—that is the nearest guess I can make—I think I got in in Oxford-street—it might have been the end of Oxford-street—I do not recollect the street—to the best of my belief it was Oxford-street—I cannot swear whether it was the end of Oxford-street, or the top of Holborn—I had been dining with some soli<lb></lb>citors and a friend of mine, at the Guildhall Coffee-house, near Guildhall, about half-past eight o'clock—I had been attending the Court all day in the</p>

               <p>Common Pleas—I drank, of course—I was perfectly sober when I got into the omnibus—I took no particular notice where I got into it—I will not swear I did not get in at the bottom of Snow-hill—there were two or three persons in the omnibus when I got in first, but none at the time of this occurrence—they might have passed me to go out—I was sitting at the door—there is a portion of the omnibus, between the seat and the door, that would be between me and the person outside—I saw the handkerchief in the prisoner's hand, in Great James-street, Paddington—I called as loud as I could, "Stop, I will get out here"—the prisoner was on the step—I called several times before they did stop—it might have been half a minute from the time I called, until it stopped, and be had the handkerchief in his hand—there was no one else present at that time—there was a boy on the pavement at some distance from the omnibus—I did not take my handker<lb></lb>chief out at all during the time I was in the omnibus—I had it in my pocket just as I have it now—the door was ajar.</p>

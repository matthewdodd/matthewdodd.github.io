On Tuesday evening, Nov. 3rd, I went with Saltzman, another person in the employ of Messrs. Gibbs, with a truck, in which was a quan<lb></lb>tity of leather—we had to call at Milk Street; we stopped there, and Saltz<lb></lb>man went into some house there, leaving me outside to mind the truck—it was just upon dark—while I was there, a boy said something to me, and afterwards Sculthorpe came up, and said, "There is a boy wants you, with a cap on;" my mate wore a cap, and I thought it was him, and I ran down the yard—I did not see my mate, and I went back again to the truck—I was not away five minutes—when I got back, I found the leather gone out of the truck—I gave information, and went and told my master—</p>

Summers and Isaacs, in Houndsditch, on Wednesday, the 4th—two skins were pro<lb></lb>duced to me by Mr. Summers, which bore our private mark—I waited there an hour and a half, when Thorne came—I went round to some reams of paper, where he could not see me, until he advanced into the shop; I then walked round to the rear of him, took him by the arm, and said, "Where did you get that leather from?"—he gave me two or three state<lb></lb>ments in about three minutes; the pith of it was that he had been employed by some man to sell it—he said afterwards that he had been employed by a man and a boy somewhere near Petticoat Lane, to sell it; that he had been walking along with some skins under his arm, and that they accosted him, and asked him if he could sell it, or if he would buy it, and he said that he told them he could not buy it, but he would sell it for them—I asked him where they were, and he told me that two of them were outside—he took me out, and pointed me out Sculthorpe as being one of them that had employed him—I went about thirty yards before I found Sculthorpe—he was remaining with a truck—I asked him where he got the leather, and he said he had been merely employed to wheel the truck—I took him back to Summers and Isaacs, sent for a policeman, and gave them into custody—Thorne said afterwards, at the station, that if I had not been so harsh in locking him up, he would have told me everything about it, and would have given every information—he has not given any additional information to me since—there were seven dozen and nine skins stolen—I found seven dozen and one in the truck; one is still missing—the value of them is about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I recognised my marks upon them directly—I</p>

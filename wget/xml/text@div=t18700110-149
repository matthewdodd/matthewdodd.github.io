                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and live at Monkwearmouth, Sunder<lb></lb>land—I was at a public-house with two men—the prisoner is one of them—he said that his father had left him 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and showed me some notes—I had some talk with him, and then wanted to go away by the train—I offered to pay for some drink, and took out my purse, which contained 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—the other man knocked the purse out of my hand, and the money fell out of the purse on the ground—the prisoner picked up two sovereigns, and the other man picked up two—I caught hold of the other man, but he got away, and they both ran away—I ran after them, but they escaped—I saw the prisoner the following Thursday night, and gave him in charge.</p>

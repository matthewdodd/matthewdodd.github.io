The prisoner has lodged with me for three months past: about a fortnight ago he left my house; he owed me a score of about thirty shillings and for lodgings for three months; he promised me payment, but he never paid me: in the course of last week I lost money several times; on the 13th I lost money; I missed twelve shillings out of the till; I was told of it: the girl said the prisoner had been in the bar: on the 13th, at night, I marked ten shillings; the housekeeper put it in.</p>
               <p>Court. What is her name? - Catherine: I saw her put it in; it was between ten and eleven; she went to bed, and I went to bed: when the girl came to me in the morning I told her to let the prisoner go into the bar as usual; the girl told me that the housekeeper had caught the captain's hand in the basket of halfpence: the girl brought the drawer up to me, and there was four shillings gone out; the drawer was locked; mean time he went out of the house; he went to the ship, the next publick-house; I went there, and saw him; I asked him to have something to drink; the prisoner pulled out five shillings among some halfpence; I looked at the four shillings, and I said I could swear to them by the mark I put on them: the officer has the other four.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long had the housekeeper been up before the girl came up to you? - She got up before the girl, and I told her she had no business up, and bid her go up stairs again.</p>
               <p>A good careful steady woman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No little disputes in the family about the captain? - None that I know.</p>
               <p>He had the run of the bar and the house. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath have not you complained that the Captain and Catherine were playing about before you got up, like two kittens, and two lovers in the honey moon? - No; not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did you never say that the Captain and Mrs. Catherine were more free than welcome? - No.</p>
               <p>Did she never give him change out of the till? - Yes, and set it down to his score.</p>
               <p>Perhaps more than was set down? - I believe there was: I mistrusted there might be a thief come, and I chose rather to trust the girl than the housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Court. Which had the key? - The housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Did the housekeeper go to bed again when she called the girl? - I do not know: she was watching on the stairs, and she ran down.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, Sir, have not you often quarrelled with her, and said she was fonder of the captain than you? - No, there never was the least dispute at all.</p>

               <p>I lived with Mr. Goswell, as housekeeper. I saw the prisoner come in the morning, last Tuesday, between six and seven, and saw him throw the upper part of the bar door up; I was on the stair case; I cannot justly say how far off; I could see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150037"></xptr>very plain; the maid opened the under part of the bar door, and opened the sash, and he went in; and I heard the till come out of its place, and heard it shut up again; the girl was opening the parlour windows; I had the key of the till; the lock was pressed open by some violence; I saw his hand in a basket of halfpence that stood on the shelf; I took him in the bar myself; I took him by the collar; he then sat down, and called for a pint of beer; and I went up stairs to speak to Mr. Goswell, and he ran away in that time; he was taken after that, and there was four shillings gone from the till; they were marked, Mr. Goswell took him at the Ship.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You had the care of the till? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As Mr. Goswell had not got up, you had not seen him? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>What before you was up? - That is nothing to you.</p>
               <p>Where was it you saw him? - That is nothing to the purpose.</p>
               <p>Did he give you any orders about the money that morning? - No, he had not given any orders either one way or the other; the maid was up first; I did not call her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Goswell did not tell you to go to bed again, for that you had no business up? - No.</p>
               <p>How long had the captain lived there? - Three months.</p>
               <p>He had pretty much the run of the house? - No more than other customers.</p>
               <p>There never was any uneasiness about the captain and you? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Goswell sleeps by himself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And did that night, and does every night? - I will not swear to that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Which was up first? - I was up first; nobody had been stirring till I came down; I had not heard my master say any thing to my mistress that morning.</p>

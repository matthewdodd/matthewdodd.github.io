About 2.45 on the morning of 14th July I was on duty in St. George's Road, and was called by the prisoner to No. 58—he said there was a woman down the area—I asked how she came there—he said she came down after a glass of water—I asked who she. was—he said a prostitute—I asked what he wanted to do—he said he wanted to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> her away—I said he had better go and turn her out, and if necessary I would help him—he went down the area—I waited some few minutes and saw the prisoner return and the woman—she was coming up the steps, and when she was about half way up I saw him stab her—she appeared to be in a hurry; she was not resisting—he had this bayonet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the top of a rifle and he pointed at her in the back—I only saw that once—she came to the top of the steps as fast as she could—he followed her to the area gate and went back again—the woman"' did not scream till after she fell down—she stood on the area steps a minute or two and then fainted—I saw a great deal of blood—she said she had been stabbed by the prisoner—Collingbourne, another officer, got a. cab and took her to St. George's Hospital—while she was lying on the ground I called to the prisoner to come and open the area gate—he came and unlocked it but did not come outside—he saw her on the ground—I told him he had stabbed the woman with the bayonet and she was fainting—I then went down with him to the area and found this bayonet in the scabbard hanging up on a belt behind the door—I took it out and ex<lb></lb>amined</p>

I was with Ford at the top of the area and saw the prosecutrix coming up, followed by the prisoner with this bayonet in his hand, fixed on the end of a rifle, I could see it as he came up—I saw him stab the prosecutrix three times—when she got to the top I saw that blood was flowing from her, she fainted and fell, I called a cab and took her to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 42, Cumberland Street—I am an unfortunate girl—on the morning of 14th July, about 1.30, I met the prisoner in St. George's Road—he asked where I was going—I said "Home"—he said he would come with me presently, and asked me to come to his house—I went with him to the gate and he brought me some sherry—afterwards he said "I find I shall not be able to come home with you, will you come down' with me"—I went down the area with him—there was a bed there—I was with him in the pantry there about five or six minutes, and had a little more sherry with him—after that he said "You will excuse me for going upstairs"—I said "Very well"—while he was gone I heard loud talking outside—he returned in about ten minutes and said "I don't live here, I live a little way down below if you like to come down with me, if not I will come home with you"—I said "You have not given me what you promised me"—he had promised me a half-sovereign before I went in—I had a few words with him he said "Are you ready to come out?"—I said "Yes," and I went out with him from the pantry along a passage, and when I got a little way from the area I saw something flash like lightening—I said "Oh!" and ran to the top as hard as I could—I was stabbed, and I don't recollect any more—I called "Police! murder!"—I was bleeding and fainted and was taken by the officer in a cab to the hospital, where I was twelve days—I don't know how it was done; it was done so quickly—I was quite sober—I did not go before the Magistrate at first, because the prisoner's mother came to me and paid me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. George's Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought there by the constable—she had lost a considerable quantity of blood—she had three stabs on her body, one on the back below the right blade bone, one on the back of the left thigh, and one on the right buttock—I can't say whether the wound on the back was deep; I should think not, as no symptoms followed—the wound on the thigh nearly went through the upper part, the one on the buttock was, I should think, between 4 and 5 inches deep; the wound on the back had healed on 26th July when she left the hospital, and the other two had nearly healed—I considered them dangerous at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. Now mind and tell the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Little girl, you was examined before the magistrate, was not you, did not you say there, you was about twelve? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been at church in your life? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your father was a man sent out of the country; you was not likely to get any religious instruction of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gorrow. What is to become of you, if you swear false? - Go to the devil.</p>
               <p>- That is as much as any body knows.</p>
               <p>Sworn.</p>
               <p>Now recollect and be so good as to tell us the truth, and the whole truth.</p>
               <p>I know all the prisoner at the bar, I lived with them about two months, I lived with Mr. and Mrs. Goodall, Mr. Mayo lived somewhere about Moorfields, but I cannot say I know where; I saw him most at Mr. Goodall's, he slept there about a week at different times. On the 25th of November, we had just done dinner, Mr. Goodall, and Mrs. Goodall, and me. Mr. Mayo just came in, and he waited about an hour, and they both went out together, Mr. Goodall and Mr. Mayo: I did not see them again till about six o'clock that evening; there was Mr. Goodall, Mr. Mayo and Mr. Muslin came, and Mrs. Goodall was making the bed; some body knocked at the door, and she went down stairs, and I heard some little noise, and then Mrs. Goodall came to me, and gave me some sessions papers to read, and told me I might go to my mother's and I might come again that night or not, just as I would; I went away; I was gone pretty near an hour; I then went back, when I thought my hour was expired; I was coming back by Clerkenwell-green, to go home, and I met Mrs. Goodall, and she seemed to have something in her apron, she appeared to have a small parcel before.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out did you make any observations? - Yes, my mistress was making the bed in the one pair of stairs, and I saw something in the lower room; I thought there was a bundle; I had not been in that room since the afternoon; that bundle was not there then. When I was coming from my mother's, I met Mrs. Goodall, and she asked me whether I was going to her house, I told her yes; she told me to go along with her; I went with her, to Castle-street, in Turnmill-street, where she desired me to wait, I waited there about half an hour; I left the sessions papers at my mother's and brought away five others which I had changed; I went from Castle-street to my mother's again, and I was at Mrs. Goodall's the next morning, about seven o'clock, and I met Mrs. Goodall going out, and she desired me to make haste, for the fire was alight; she told me to brush the stove, and to sweep the room over; I went there and I saw three parcels on the bed, and an handkerchief laying on the bed, and Mr. Goodall at the vice, hammering out the marks of some silver tea-spoons.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150044"></xptr>Q. Where used Mayo to sleep for a week? - On the same bed.</p>
               <p>Q. All the three prisoners together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a week running that he slept there? - No, sir, at different times, but they had slept on the same bed.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room was it? - The same room the vice was in.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you think he was hammering out the marks of tea-spoons? - Because I could see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him hammer out such things before? - Never but once.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room at the time? - Mr. Mayo.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mrs. Owen do any thing in the course of that day? - About a quarter after Muslin came up.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Mrs. Owen come in? - She came about half an hour after that she took the neck string out of a black silk cloak, and burnt it, and she said it was very remarkable, for it had three joins in it, Mr. Goodall and Mr. Mayo where both present, she then ript the body of a gown, and then she went out with the gown and cloak before breakfast, to take them to a mantua maker to be altered; she was gone about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When she returned what did you see? - Some handkerchiefs and aprons, some muslin ones, and a new pair of stays. I was set to pick the edging of a tucker, and the lace of a muslin handkerchief, by Mrs. Owen's orders; about eleven o'clock Mr. Goodall, Mr. Muslin and Mr. Mayo, went out together; they left three bundles, one was in the drawers and two on the drawers, as I can best recollect, Mr. Goodall took out the silver spoons, that the marks had been beat out of with him, and a pair of silver sugar tongs. While they were gone out Mrs. Owen shewed me two Bank notes, this was towards night, she took them out of a little book out of her pocket; she asked me, if I had ever seen any bank notes, I said Yes, and she shewed me them both; I said, what are these his, meaning my master's and she said, there are only one of them George's, the other is Mayo's; I asked her, whether or no he would take them to the Bank; she said, yes; but if he did he would get hung. I was not there when Mr. Goodall returned home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at any time desired of him to borrow any thing of the lodgers? - Yes, a chopper on Monday afternoon before he went out, I borrowed it of the lodger up stairs, and he cut up a box and burnt it, it was a brown box of a wainscot colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing about a pair of stays? - Mr. Mayo had them because they were sent by the boy on Monday morning wrapped up in a white counterpane to his wife Mrs. Mayo.</p>
               <p>Q. What white counterpane was that? - It was one that had been in a robbery before, I did not hear where the stays came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being there on Tuesday, where was Goodall the greatest part of Tuesday? - He came home at five o'clock in the afternoon, very much disguised in liquor. Soon after Mr. Macauley, otherwise Muslin, came in when he came in he said he had been ill used at St. Catharine's, and he brought in a bill which had been put out about this robbery, and Mrs. Goodall read it, and presently after she said, that there was something wrong in it about some things, but I cannot tell what; Mr. Muslin I believe said it was not right. Goodall was drunk on the bed, and Mrs. Goodall went and took his things out of his pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing about candlesticks? - Yes, I heard something about candlesticks in the bill, and a name on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else laying<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150045"></xptr>on the drawers which you had not noticed to lay there before? - I saw a pair of stone buckles on the drawers; I saw them before the justice, and I believe they were the same.</p>

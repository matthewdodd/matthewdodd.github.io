                  </hi>. My husband, John Smith, kept the Golden Anchor. On 13th March, the prisoner came to my house about dusk—he had something to drink, and paid me with a five-shilling piece—I put it into the till—there was no other crown there—the prisoner took his change and went away—in about half an hour my husband came in, went to the till and looked at the crown-piece—he put it away into a little box by itself, which was put in the inner bar—no one serves in the bar but my husband and I—on Friday, 16th March, the prisoner came again, about the same time in the evening—he had something to drink—he paid for it with a half-crown—I sounded it (I sound all money)—I believed it to be good, and put it into the till—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I did not say anything to him about the former transaction, because we thought if he did not come again we would let it pass—there was no other half-crown in the till—my husband came and looked at it, broke it to pieces, and put the pieces in the same box where the crown-piece was—on 24th March, the prisoner came again, about the same time—he had some gin, and gave me a half-crown in payment—my husband was in the inner bar—I took the half-crown to him—we considered at first that it was a good one, and I gave the prisoner change—just as he left the house my husband altered his mind about the half-crown, and went in pursuit of the prisoner with it—a day or two afterwards I saw my husband take the crown-piece and the pieces of the half-crown out of the box, and give them to the police-constable.</p>

I am the husband of Ann Smith—I did keep the Golden Anchor—I have now sold it—on 13th March I found a bad crown in the till—I took it out, and put it in a box on the mantel-piece—I finally gave it to the policeman—that was the only crown in the till or box—on 16th March I found a bad half-crown in the till—it was the only one there—I broke it in pieces with my teeth, and put the pieces into the little box with the other—on 24th March I was asleep in the inner bar—my wife brought me a half-crown—I looked at it, and rung it, and thought it was good—I then looked round, saw the prisoner, and I re-examined the half-crown, and rubbed it—I found it was bad, but my wife had then given him the change, and he was gone—I took the half-crown to the station, and gave it to inspector Brannan—I after<lb></lb>wards gave the crown-piece to Harvey, and the broken pieces of the half-crown to another officer—the prisoner was taken into custody on the 26th—he wanted to know what it was for—I said he was the man that passed bad money at my house—he said he was not the man that I represented—I am sure he is the person.</p>

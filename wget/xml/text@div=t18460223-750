                  </hi>. I am twelve years old, and live with Mr. Henry John Collett, at No. 5, Seymour-place, Camden-town—he keeps a toy-shop. I was in the shop on the 11th of Feb., at half-past eight o'clock in the evening—the prisoner Scott, and another, who is not here, came into the shop—they purchased a halfpenny ball, and went out—they came in again, and wanted the ball changed for a halfpenny shuttlecock—Scott went with me to where the shuttlecocks stood in the shop, and the one who is not here stood against the door—I gave them a shuttlecock, and they went away—as soon as they were gone a little girl came in—I looked into the window, and missed a card and some knives—Scott had proposed to look at those knives—I had shown them to him, and put them back</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, York-place, Camden-down—I work for Mr. Hailes, a green-grocer. I passed the prosecutor's shop on that Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening—I saw the prisoners Pearson and Westbrook looking in at the window—I saw Scott inside the shop, looking in the window, and another boy who is not here—Scott came out with seven knives under his jacket—he ran away with them—he had come out with a ball first, and looked at it, and spoke to Westbrook and Pearson—he went inside again, and came out with the knives—the boy who is not here went in, put his right hand behind him, and drew the knives out of the window—Scott stood behind him—he took them from him, doubled them up, and ran out with them—Westbrook and Pearson ran after him—they all ran together down Hawley<lb></lb>crescent—they could see the other boy draw the knives from the window—they were watching him, looking in at the window—when I was noticing what was going on, Pearson said to me, "What do you want here?"—I said, "What has that to do with you?"—I went and told my master, and he told the policeman.</p>

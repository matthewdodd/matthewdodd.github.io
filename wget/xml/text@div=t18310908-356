On the 23rd of July I met the prisoner in Shoreditch; he gave me this parcel - it is directed "Mr. Hall, passenger to Reading, Sunday, July 24;" I had some suspicion, and gave information to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Were you employed by the prosecutor to carry parcels? A. Yes, occasionally; I was not intimate with the prisoner - I made a box for him, for which he pair me, and he lent me 2s. about a month ago, since I had this parcel from him; the prosecutor had not forbidden me to come to his house -I have carried parcels for him for years.</p>

On the 22nd of July, I took in a letter by the Twopenny-post, and handed it to him; he read it, and said he must go out of town, on account of the illness of his sister - I think he said to Reading, in Berkshire. On the day following, I went to Peacock's house - this parcel was there - I opened it, and these articles were in it; I can swear to the print, from its matching, where it is cut, with the piece left; the prisoner has taken goods, and charged himself with them, but I had told him not to do so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.But he has charged himself with goods? A. Yes, he had done it more than once; I have employed Peacock as a porter, and about the shop, but he had not so much access to it as the prisoner -I had told the prisoner not to encourage Peacock there, on account of an opposite gin-shop - the prisoner remained in my house an hour of two after I discovered these goods.</p>

            . I took the prisoner on the 2nd of August; he cried, and said he was very sorry he should be guilty of robbing his master, and begged his master to forgive him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he would have paid him for them? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Trendall allowed me to have goods, and post them to myself; he never to me expressed any disapprobation of my conduct - I could not agree with Mrs. Trendall, and she used to make differences be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080149"></xptr>tween my master and me; when we were called up to sacred devotion, she desired the servant to put pins in the sofa, to injure my person; and, on another occasion, to get cowage for the same purpose; my master found this out, and went up to speak to my mistress about it - knowing she was my enemy, I ran out of the place; I afterwards surrendered, and when I returned to my master, he said to me, "James, if I don't prosecute you, how can you get your living?" I said, I had an uncle who would take me; he then consulted his wife, and I was taken.</p>

               <p>MR. TRENDALL. I did consult my wife, undoubtedly; I never heard of pins being put in the sofa, or of the cowage, nor do I think it likely my wife would have desired it to have been done. My wife had gone to Margate, and on her return, the prisoner spoke in a very improper manner to her, and from that time, I believe, she had a sort of prejudice against him - I had no suspicion of him before this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he any opportunity of posting these things in the book? A. Yes; after I had received the information, I went up stairs, and was there for ten minutes, and he might have booked these articles; I owe him his quarter's salary, 7l. 10s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you gone up stairs to speak to Mrs. Trendall just before he went away? A. Yes, on account of the information I had received; he could only imagine that I was speaking about this information.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Since I have been confined here, did not my prosecutor send me 20s., and did not you keep 2s. of them? A. I borrrowed 2s. as a loan.</p>

On the 8th of May, I was coming through St. Giles's from my work, between the hours of eight and nine in the evening, and observing a crowd opposite the church, I stopped and enquired what was the matter. A person told me it was a woman, who was stopped on suspicion of stealing something. I remarked that if she was innocent, it was a great shame, and the prisoner answered me, and said, it was, and offered to assist me in rescuing her. After some slight interruption to the woman, she was suffered to go about her business, and I went about mine. I had not proceeded sixty yards, before the prisoner overtook me, and told me that the woman was again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210006"></xptr>stopped, and asked me would I not return, and see she was not hurt.

I gave information to the Bow-street officers; in consequence of which, the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

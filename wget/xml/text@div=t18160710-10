            . I am a corporal in the 3rd Guards. On the evening of the day in the indictment, I went with some of my comrades to celebrate the Anniversary of the battle of Waterloo, to a house in <placeName id="t18160710-10-crimeloc46">St. Catherine's-lane</placeName>

While we were sitting in the house, the prisoner at the bar came in; we were in the tap-room at the time we fell out with the prisoner; he forced himself into our company, and we refused him. He wanted to get some beer to drink, and we refused him. We told him to be off, because we would not have any Foreigners among us. He did not go; he would not. He told us that he was an English man, and would not go away. We told him to be off, for we would have nothing to do with him. We ordered him out of the door. Upon that, he refused, and some of the soldiers turned him out; not in a manner to hurt him at all; I can't say Twigg was one; I can't say he was not. He did not say any thing to the prisoner. The prisoner did not come in again; it was ten minutes before I saw him again. Twigg went out; I followed him soon after, almost directly; I saw Twigg and the prisoner close together in the lane; I saw the deceased fall; before that, I did not see any thing done by him. I did not see him strike the prisoner, or any thing of that kind; I am not sure he did not strike him. I was within five yards of them. I saw the figures of two men in short; the soldier was not dressed in scarlet; I was near enough to see one lift his hand to the other, if he had done so; but I did not take any notice. I saw Twigg heel back; on seeing him fall, I jumped up the prisoner, and he made a blow at me. I discovered that the two persons I saw were Twigg and the prisoner. Twigg groaned out when he fell. When I came up, the prisoner struck me; he made a back handed blow at me, and I felled him with my left, and seized him with my right hand. The blow he made at me, cut me; it was such a cut as could not be done without some sharp instrument. I secured the prisoner, and there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100009"></xptr>was a man came up, and took him to the watchhouse. I did not say any thing to the prisoner, nor he to me. I went to the watchhouse; but did not go in. I did not see what became of Twigg, the deceased.</p>

               <p>Prisoner, (by interpretation.) Q. Do you say I struck you?</p>

               <p>Witness. Yes; he struck me in the street, after Twigg fell.</p>

            . I am also a soldier in the Guards. I went to this house with some of my companions who were at Waterloo; the deceased was of the party; we went about half past nine; there was a good many. I did not see the prisoner there; I had seen him in the course of the day; he has lost one of his arm; it was about four o'clock in the afternoon that I saw him. He had a fork screwed to the stump of his arm, it screws into the top of the arm; I took that from him, because he was breaking the doors open with it, and abusing the people in the lane The deceased was not with me then. The prisoner was in liquor, but not drunk. About half past nine, I and my comrades were in the house. I recollect the deceased going out to buy some tobacco; I saw there was a row just opposite the White Lion soon after, and there I found Twigg laying there; I thought it was from liquor that made him lay there at first; he was twenty or thirty yards above the White Lion. He was laying down; he was wounded, as I discovered afterwards; I directly went up to him; he was laying with his face up, I believe; he was put on my back; he was not able to get up himself to go to any place, and I took him to the Guard-room at the Mint; that was about fifty yards, or more. He said something while he was on my back; but I could not tell what it was, I did not understand him. I laid him down when I brought him to the Guardroom; he continued there until the surgeon came; he was the same man the surgeon saw.</p>

               <p>DAVID EVANS. I am a surgeon; I live in that neighbourhood. I was called in to examine the deceased, on the 20th, two days after the murder, it was before the Coroner. He was wounded a little below the navel; it is my opinion that, that wound was the occasion of his death. It appeared to be done with a sharp instrument; it was three inches deep; a portion of the omentum protruded through the lacerated integuments; it had reached the intestimes, but not to wound them.</p>

            . I am a police officer. I conveyed the prisoner from Aldgate watchhouse to the police office. As I went along, I had a conversation with him. I asked him where the knife was; (for I had searched him at the watchhouse, and found none.) he said, he had no knife. I asked him how he came to commit the murder; and he said, he did not commit it; that was directly after I asked him for his knife. He was taken, and examined before the magistrate. He was asked what he had to say; whatever he said, I believe the clerk did not put down. He said, he was drunk and mad, and did not know what he did. I got this knife from the landlord of the White Lion; it was exactly as it is now.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the White Lion. I recollect the night on which this offence was committed; I am a Prussian. In consequence of something that had passed, I went about eleven o'clock at night to look for a knife, and some one went with me. I found this knife; I took a candle in my right hand to go and look for it; this is the knife I found; I found it between. thirty and forty yards from the public-house; it was shut when I found it; it was a dry night; there was a little blood on the blade.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Perhaps he had it in his pocket?</p>

               <p>Witness. I swear I found it, and never saw it before to my knowledge; I found it in the street.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker; I live in East Smithfield. I sold a knife to the prisoner on the 17th of June, similar to the one produced; with the name of Stelty on it. I believe it to be the name; I can't swear to it.</p>

            . I was one of the party of the Waterloo men, on the night of the 18th. I saw the prisoner in the evening in the house, about half past six; the last time I saw him was a quarter past ten; I have reason to know, that at that time, he had a cutting instrument or knife in his hand.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was at the public-house, three soldiers fell upon me, beating me about the head, and when they took me to prison, all my head was swelled, and I had two black eyes. I lost all my money and my knife. I was at Greenwich; where I have been eight years, and I received twentyeight pounds to go home to my own Country; and they robbed me of all my money. I have no witness, for I was very much in liquor.</p>

            . Re-examined. I did not see any body beat the prisoner about the head. I saw him the whole time, until we turned him out, and I am sure nobody struck him on the head, or gave him these blows. I was near enough to see him the whole time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, residing at 5, Grantham-road, Bethnal-green—on the night of 8th August I went to bed at a quarter past 12—I saw the house fastened up—I awoke about 5 o'clock and heard a noise below—I listened, and heard footsteps moving about—I looked out of my bed-room window, and saw a man leaving the door-step with a violin, trying to conceal it under his coat—I immediately went below to see if my violin was where I had seen it, and it was gone, and the parlour window was open—I rushed upstairs again and partly dressed myself and pursued the pri<lb></lb>soner—I overtook him in company with another man—I lost sight of him for a few minutes—I am sure he is the man I had seen leave the door-step—the other man had the violin when I overtook them, and he threw it down and escaped—I secured the prisoner, and told him he had broken into my place and stolen my violin—he said he knew nothing at all about it, the other man had done it—we had a desperate struggle; he put his hand to my throat and forced me over a rail, but, with the assistance of a civilian, I detained him and gave him into custody—the parlour window had been closed the night before; I cannot say whether it was fastened.</p>

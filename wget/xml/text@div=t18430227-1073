                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Nicholls—this umbrella re<lb></lb>sembles mine—I had sewn a button on mine, but any person might do that—I cannot swear to my work—I cannot point out any difference between the umbrella I lost and this one—it appears to have had a button sewed on since it was made—it looks like my work as far as I can see—it looks like mine, certainly—there is no mark on it whatever—it is sewn on with silk.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab-driver, at Woolwich. On the 18th of Feb. Mr. Nicholls hired my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to New-cross—when I got there he left an um<lb></lb>brella in my charge—I returned to Woolwich, and on my way home, between Greenwich and Charlton, I overtook the prisoner—he got inside my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and rode two miles and better to Charlton—when I got home I missed the um<lb></lb>brella—I had placed it in the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not notice that the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean that Mr. Nicholls left it in your charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was to give it to my employer, Mr. Milton, at Woolwich, and he was to call for it—I missed it about a quarter to nine at Woolwich, better than a quarter of a mile from the barracks—I went to the barracks, and saw the prisoner and the umbrella, about an hour and a half afterwards—I did not tell him I had got an umbrella in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> when he got in—I saw him get out, but I did not get off my box—he had paid me when he got in.</p>

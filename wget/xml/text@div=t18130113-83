I took him back, and some other person took Valence back. A constable was sent for. Some person said, let us search them. Upon Valence was found five shillingsworth of halfpence. A woman came in, and said, here is the paper the boy has dropped in the street, and one or both of the prisoners went down on their knees, and asked forgiveness.</p>

On Saturday evening, 4th April, I came ashore with a pilot from the steamer—we met the prisoner and another young woman in the Tiger public house, and accompanied them to a house—we went up stairs, and I went into one room with the prisoner, and the pilot and the other woman into another room—I took a sovereign out in that room</p>

               <p>from a bag in which I had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was to pay for sleeping there and for a little supper—the prisoner went to bed with me—I undressed and laid my trowsers alongside of me on a chair by the side of the bed, and felt that the money was all right—I fell asleep about five minutes afterwards, and was awakened by a noise—I felt for my money and it was gone—it was then very nearly 1 o'clock—I had gone to bed about half an hour before—I called a policeman and the pilot—I have never seen my money since.</p>

                  </hi>. On Saturday evening, 4th April, I and the prisoner met the prosecutor and another person at the Tiger public house, on Tower Hill; we were there twenty minutes; we left just before it shut up, and went to a coffee house, kept by Neehan; we walked some distance, and then took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to that house—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor go into a room adjoining our's; I went into another room with the pilot, and could hear what passed in their room—after they had been about twenty minutes in the room we heard the prisoner jump out of bed and call for two cups of coffee; Mrs. Neehan answered from the top of the house that she could not come down to serve them—the prisoner then left the room, and we heard her walk down three steps, and heard her pour a lot of money, as if she was pouring it into some one's lap—she said, "Here it is, you have it all, away with it;" the other person said, "All right," and went down stairs—it was the landlady's daughter, I can swear to her voice—we tried to get out of our room, but could not, we were fastened in; the landlady would not open it, and we made an alarm—we then went down stairs—the landlady opened the door after the policeman was called.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 158). I took the prisoner at about a quarter past 1 o'clock on Sunday morning—she denied all knowledge of it—the prosecutor charged her with stealing the money—I know the landlady, she was at home—I know her daughter, she was not at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the landlady taken into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and discharged.</p>

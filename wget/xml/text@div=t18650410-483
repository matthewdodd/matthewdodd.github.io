I am a sawyer, and live at Princes road, Plum<lb></lb>stead—on Monday evening, 20th March, I was in the Royal Oak, Plumstead, with my wife, my two daughters, and my little son—I went out at the back, and the two prisoners followed my son into the room and insulted my daugh<lb></lb>ters—Cook pulled them about, and tried to kiss them—Walters did nothing to my daughters; he tried to get Cook out—they were got out with the landlord's assistance—Cook then went to the bar, and accused my daughter of taking a watch—they were got out of the house twice, and about a quarter of an hour after that we left—I had the best part of a quart of ale in my hand, which was for supper—some one, I cannot say who, knocked me down, and then Cook knocked me down a second time—I got up, and was going up the road; Walters then turned round, knocked me down, knelt on me, and Cook stabbed me with a knife on the top of my head—I saw the blade shine—my little daughter came up and pushed them off—I got up, and was knocked down again by Walters—my son came up, and they ran away—with the second blow the knife closed—I am very weak still, and not able to work—I was also struck with the knife when it was half shut.</p>

I am a coal merchant, carrying on business at Crown-wharf, Deptford—the prisoner was in my service as collector in September last—it was his duty to collect money every day, and to account to my clerk, Isaac Kilner, every evening—his wages were 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. week, his rent and coals, and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year extra, if he made the business answer—I gave him in custody on 11th September—I went up to his bed room that day; he was in bed—I asked him what he had been about taking my money and not accounting for it—he said he would do anything I liked to work it off, hot I said no—he said that he had received about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as nearly as he could recollect.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you say whether you received any money from him, from 26th July? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not receive anything on the 26th—he paid some money on the morning of the 27th, and I received some on 7th August, I believe it was in the morning; also in the morning or afternoon of the 8th—I received nothing on the 13th, but I did on the 14th—this is the account he kept of moneys received by him—this, on the 14th, is what be paid over as having been received on the 14th—all this is his writing except the signature J.

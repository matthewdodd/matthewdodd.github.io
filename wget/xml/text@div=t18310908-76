I have known the prisoner about two years; her sister occupied my first floor; I missed money at different times, and on the 24th of July I marked a half-sovereign, which I put in a paper into one of the drawers in a chest of drawers in my bed-room; I locked the drawer, and told Dugan to hide himself under the bed; I left a young lad in my parlour, to come to me if he heard any demur - I was out about ten minutes, when I was sent for, and I found the prisoner in my bed-room, where she had no right to be; I found a key in the drawer in which I had left the money - the drawer was unlocked, and the half-sovereign was gone, but the purse was left, and four shillings, which were marked as the half-sovereign was- the prisoner denied having any money about her; she was searched by my wife, in the officer's presence - this half-sovereign was found on her.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it broken open - A. No, I had left the door upon a latch; it had been broken open before, I had placed a spring gun on a bench, and fastened a string to the door, they cut the string and went in. I saw the property in their possession on Thursday evening last, about eight o'clock, I asked the prisoner Eades how long he had the table, he said fourteen years; Mortimer said he knew it to be his table. I then gave them in charge of an officer.</p>

            . On Thursday night last I was returning from the garden where the table was stolen in company with Mr. Cole, I saw Mortimer, he had the table on his bead, Eades and another man were with Mortimer; we followed them to a public house, the sign of the Loggerheads; I left Mr. Cole to take care of them, I went for Mr. Pittard.</p>
               <p>ROBERT COLE. I was coming along Hackney-road with Mr. Pickering, Mortimer had the table on his head, Eades was with him; Cadman the officer was in the public house they stopped at, Cadman told me Eades had offered to sell the table to him for a pound, he offered him fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>JOHN CADMAN. I am an officer. Eades offered me the table for a pound, I offered him fourteen shillings for it, Mortimer said he would give him fifteen shilling for it, it should not be sold for that. I came out of the house; I received information that the owner of the table was sent for, he came and owned the table, he saw them fetch it out of the house.</p>
               <p>Eades' Defence. Going to my labour I found this table against a brick wall in Hackney-road, I took it home; on my going up Shoredith I met

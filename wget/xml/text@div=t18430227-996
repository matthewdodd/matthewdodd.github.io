                  </hi>. I live in Fox-street, Limehouse, and deal in potatoes. Linge was in my service to sell potatoes, but was never to sell on credit without my special consent—I had missed potatoes for a long time—I ap<lb></lb>pointed Sarah Tabraham to watch on the morning of the 9th of Feb., and I also went to my neighbour's house opposite to watch—while there I saw Donovan go to the shop—she and Linge went to the potato-bin—she took hold of one end of her apron which she had on her person, and Linge took hold of the other end of it, and though the scales were immediately before them, and it was Linge's duty to weigh them, they put them into her apron without—when she got as far as the curb-stone immediately opposite my shop I stopped her, and taxed her with stealing them, in the presence of Linge—Donovan said she had not stolen them—I asked what quantity she had got—she said she did not know, but she had given him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked Linge what quantity he had sold her—he said twopenny worth—I sent for a policeman,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270177"></xptr>
               <p>and gave them both into custody—in a minute or two afterwards Linge appeared to take a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of his mouth, and on my making some remark condemnatory of his conduct, he said he thought there was no barm in giv<lb></lb>ing her a few.</p>

I was directed by Mr. Jordan to watch his premises—I was at my own door, which is opposite his shop—I saw Donovan go into the shop; both she and Linge took the potatoes, and placed them in her apron—she then went out—the potatoes had not been weighed, and there was no money paid that I could see; I had a full opportunity of seeing, if any thing of the sort had passed.</p>

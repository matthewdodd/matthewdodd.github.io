               <p>Was you in liquor? - No. I had had some liquor, but I was compos mentis. I did not stay in the house ten minutes; she went out for a pot of beer, and I immediately missed my watch; there was to it a steel chain, a steel hook, and a base-metal key. She locked the door, turned the key, and went off.</p>
               <p>Did you see the watch in her hand? - Yes, as she went out to order the beer. She never came in any more. She had not put it in her pocket then; I saw it really in her hand; the constable found it on the Tuesday evening after.</p>

             the prisoner is an opposite neighbour of mine.</p>
               <p>Is she a married woman? - Yes. About three weeks ago she brought a watch to me and said she had it to dispose of; I looked at it; I thought it a very indifferent watch; I showed it to a person who I thought was a proper judge, and was informed it was worth but 18 s. I bought the watch of her; I never confisticated it. Bolton keeps a clothes shop.</p>

               <p>Weverton. I carried the watch to one Mrs. Gatty in North Audley-street, and desired her as an acquaintance, to let me have a guinea upon it for a few days; it was found at her house; this is the watch.</p>
               <p>The CONSTABLE sworn.</p>
               <p>I searched Mrs. Gatty's house, and found the watch. I believe there is an evidence in jail that sold the watch to Bolton.</p>
               <p>BOLTON's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I bought the watch. As Weverton had asked me if I had a watch to dispose of, I said I had not; and he desired me, if one came in my way to buy it for him.</p>

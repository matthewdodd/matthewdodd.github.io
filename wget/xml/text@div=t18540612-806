                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Welsh, and live at No. 15, Joiner-street, Westminster-road, Lambeth; the prisoner is a second cousin of mine. On 23rd May, I was taken ill about half past 6 o'clock; I fainted away and became insensible—when I came to my senses I found myself in my bed—about half past 5 o'clock in the morning I missed a coat of my husband's—I had last seen it about half past 6 o'clock the afternoon before; I have since seen it at the pawnbroker's—I do not know whether the pri<lb></lb>soner was in the house during the time I was ill, I did not see or hear her in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the house in which Mrs. Welsh lives. I re<lb></lb>member her being taken ill on 23rd May; I saw the prisoner at the house between 7 and 8 o'clock; I let her in myself and she came into my par<lb></lb>lour (my mother had let her out twice), she had a bundle—she did not go upstairs that time—I heard her come down stairs, and go out; and I saw her pass my parlour window with a bundle under her visited, it was a con<lb></lb>siderably larger bundle than the bawl she showed me when she came back.</p>

I received the prisoner into custody at the station, on 26th May—Mrs. Welsh gave her in charge; she seemed to be very much excited, and had been drinking—she threw herself about in the charge room, and threw some money down, and two or three things, which I picked up and produce—she said, "Oh, God! woman, don't charge me; don't lock me up"—on the way to the police court next morning, she said to me, "I will give Mrs. Welsh the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that the coat was in pledge for, and likewise I will return her 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for herself if she will not prosecute."</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 10th of April, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and another (who was tried last Sessions) going down Compton-place; the other man had the harness on his back, and the prisoner said, "Watchman, never mind, it is all right - the man is in the street who gave us the harness to carry;" he then went away, and said he would fetch the man, but did not return. I secured the other man. I have known the prisoner from a child.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you still watchman there? A. Yes. I saw the two lads together - I do not know which of the two said, "It is all right;" but it was the prisoner who said the man who gave it to them was in the street, near the coach rank.</p>

I am a colonial broker, carrying on business at 39, Min<lb></lb>cing-lane—at present I have one partner, Mr. Merridew—between the years 1852 and 1855, Mr. Campbell was my partner; the firm was then Laing &amp; Campbell—between 1855 and 1858 I had another partner, Mr. Page—the name of the firm was not changed, though he was a partner; it was still Laing &amp; Campbell—Mr. Page left in 1858, about the end of the year, I be<lb></lb>lieve—until the end of December, 1859, the firm was Laing &amp; Campbell, as before; then Mr. Campbell left, and Mr. Merridew entered into partnership with me, and so the firm has continued ever since—we deal in a great num<lb></lb>ber of different articles of colonial produce, as many as thirty at least—we have two clerks—in January, 1852, the prisoner Crowther entered my ser<lb></lb>vice as a market-clerk; he had to attend to the cream-of-tartar business, and various other articles, and to assist me generally in the business—it would be part of his duty to buy and sell articles for me in the market when he came he informed me that he was connected with chemical works, a very risky business, and he should much prefer having a regular income, and I took him into my business, with an express understanding that he should sell all the stock in his hands connected with the chemical work—he was</p>

               <p>expressly to devote his time to the interests of our firm—that was a matter distinctly arranged between us, and it was distinctly arranged that he was not to carry on any business on hw own account—there was an arrangement at that time with respect to salary, nothing else; it is not in existence now—when the time expired it was destroyed I suppose—I don't know—when one agreement expired another was made—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the agreement made in 1859 with regard to the salary—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "39, Mincing-lane, Oct. 21st, 1859. Sir, I accept your offer, namely, to continue my services for the following years: 1860, at 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 1861, at 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and 1862, at 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon the former understanding that the whole of the time be devoted to your interests. Yours truly, James Crowther. To Seton Laing, Esq. and his future partner")—during the time he was in my service he had especially to attend to the purchase of saltpetre, which was added to his department—Goodburn bad been in my service, I believe about thirty years—he came to me as a boy, and be has been with me ever since—in 1859 his salary was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; he was book-keeper, cash-keeper, and had the sole charge of the bills, warrants, and all the securities—in our business we only have the warrants representing the goods, not the goods themselves—when we pur<lb></lb>chase goods in the market, the warrants are always delivered to us on the payment of the prices, and those warrants were entrusted to Goodburn for safe keeping—when saltpetre, or anything else standing in our name, was sold, he would deliver up the warrants to the purchaser on receiving the money for the same—my instructions to him were, not to part with any warrants without receiving the money, and without letting me know—in March, 1853, Crowther introduced to my notice the account of a person named Henry Barber—at that time I had had no dealings with Barber—Crowther told me that Barber carried on chemical works in Jamaica-level, Bermondsey; that he was a very respectable man, of limited means, but quite capable of paying for any goods that he might require—he said occa<lb></lb>sionally he might require advances upon warrants—I told him there was no objection to that whatever, but to be careful about the accounts, and not to allow Barber at any time to go beyond from 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without letting me know—if he overcharged his account at all he was to let me know—it was also understood between us that Barber was to buy the whole of the materials he used through us, and we were to sell the whole of his manu<lb></lb>factured articles, with the commission mentioned, one per cent each way, one per cent on the raw article, and one per cent on the manufactured—I told Goodburn exactly the same as I told Crowther with reference to Bar<lb></lb>ber's account—I think I had a personal interview with Barber at that time, I am not quite sure—from the time Crowther entered my service, in 1852, till the time he left, in March, 1862, the rule with regard to the making out of the balance-sheets, was, that every party should have a copy of his account—a current account was sent to every party, generally half-yearly, sometimes every quarter—those accounts were made out by Goodburn and ought to have been signed by one of the partners—he had no business to send an account out of that sort, without its being signed by one of the partners; that was the rule—prior to Campbell's leaving me, I had made inquiries of both the prisoners, I should say, eight or ten times every year, regarding the state of Barber's account—when I asked Goodburn he only gave me one answer, which was, that the account was in a very satisfactory state; and when I asked Crowther, he told me the same thing—I never beard from either of them that it exceeded a certain sum—when Mr. Camp<lb></lb>bell was leaving me as a partner, we went over the different accounts with</p>

               <p>our book-keeper, with a view of seeing that all the different balances were properly covered; Goodburn was present—among other accounts we referred to that of Mr. Barber—I asked Goodburn whether the balance of that ac<lb></lb>count was properly covered by securities, and he told me it was—when Mr. Campbell left I paid him 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than be ought to have had; I paid him in cash and bills—on the 1st January, 1860, Mr. Merridew's partner<lb></lb>ship began, and just before that I had a conversation with Goodburn, in the presence of Mr. Merridew, with regard to the state of the balance—Mr. Merridew had been a clerk in my house—I said to Goodburn, "Mr. Merri<lb></lb>dew is coming in here as a partner, and it is very desirable that be should know the true state of all the accounts in the ledger"—Goodburn then assured us both that all the balances were properly covered, and that there was not a bad debt in the ledger; "a bad or doubtful debt, " I believe he said—on the 18th March, 1862, Mr. Merridew made a communication to me with regard to some purchases of Barber's, and I told Goodburn later in the day to make up Barber's account, and have it closed—on the following morning I came to my counting-house about half-past 9; Goodburn had been there, and left before I came—Mr. Merridew and I were sitting in our private room, reading our letters, when Crowther came in, and shut the door—he said he was very sorry to tell us that Mr. Goodburn had gone away unwell—I said I was very sorry to hear it—"in fact," he said, "I have a very unpleasant communication to make, which is that Mr. Barber's ac<lb></lb>count is considerably overdrawn"—I said, "Overdrawn! how can that be? how much is it overdrawn?"—he said he did not know; he knew no<lb></lb>thing about it—I said, "Why you must know all about it"—he said he did not; he did not keep the ledger—he said, "I am not your book-keeper; how can I tell and the ledger is kept locked"—I asked him how the ac<lb></lb>count stood—Mr. Campbell left at the end of 1859; he told me it was all right then, be knew—the balance was covered by securities—I think that was all—he also said that in consequence of a letter that my partner had sent to Barber the previous day, Goodburn was quite alarmed about the account, and was afraid to face us—after that Mr. Merridew, and I went to Goodburn's private house; he was not at home—we then went to Barber's, and had some conversation with him, and he delivered to me a quantity of papers and letters, which I took to the counting-house—Goodburn did not return to the counting-house for two or three days—when he came, I called him into the private counting-house, shut the door, made him sit down at the opposite desk to where I was, and I charged him to tell me the whole truth, and everything connected with this account of Barber's—I said to him, "Now, Goodburn, tell me everything connected with this affair, and if I find you telling me another falsehood, you may depend upon it you will be answerable for it"—he said he had nothing to tell me; he was extremely sorry, and had no excuse whatever to make—I referred to Mr. Campbell's account at well, and said, "How is it, Goodburn, after the liberal treatment you have received from me, that you allowed me to pay Mr. Campbell such a large sum of money more than he was entitled to?"—he said he had no excuse whatever for it—I said, "Mr. Crowther tells me that he knows no<lb></lb>thing about this account"—he said, "Nonsense! he knows all about it from beginning to end"—he said the account got gradually worse and worse; he had repeatedly called Crowther's attention to it, and he was assured by Crowther that it would be all right, and was persuaded by him to conceal the state of the account from myself and my partner, until it got so large that he was afraid to mention it—that was all at that time—on the follow<lb></lb>ing</p>

               <p>morning I called Crowther into my private room, and spoke about this matter—I said, "Well, Crowther, I find you have been telling me a false<lb></lb>hood; Goodburn tells me that yon know all about that account from begin<lb></lb>ning to end; and more, I find that when you introduced Barber to my firm, he was indebted to you upwards of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that you have recouped yourself the money"—he said that that was quite true—I told him it was a very disgraceful and dishonourable act, for he must have known that the money he obtained from Barber came directly out of our pockets—he said he considered himself quite justified in doing as he did, in paying himself—I said I considered his conduct throughout most disgraceful, and he could not longer remain in our service, and I ordered him out—he then left—I have had no communication with him personally since—he sent to me some months afterwards—Goodburn remained at my counting-house for some time, making up the accounts, perhaps two months, from March to May, or some where about that time—he made up Barber's account—this account (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) is made up by Goodburn.</p>

               <p>we have in our possession—it is a business of several hundred thousand a year—we make advances from time to time to persons who do not pay their prompts—the contract-book is the first book in which a purchase would be entered—it is no one's business in particular to keep the contract-book—very often some of the junior clerks enter—if I or one of my partners have made a purchase in the market we come back and enter it in that book—it shows distinctly the date of the contract, and the nature of it—I believe the contract books for 1857, 58, and 59, are here; if not we can send for then—after it is entered in the contract-book it is entered in the day-book—Mr. Goodburn partly kept the day-book, and Mr. Walker partly—Walker is not in our service now; he is clerk in a house in Mincing-lane—after it is transferred to the day-book it is then entered in the ledger—all those books were open to all the partners, so that they knew the extent of the purchase they had made, and of the advances—I depended upon Goodburn as looking after the securities; he got them—the brokers from whom we purchased the goods would hand the warrants over to Goodburn at our office—we have a banker's book—from time to time I found out that we were very much in advance on Mr. Barber's account—the warrants and securities were sent every night to our banker's—I saw that there was a large balance against Barber every year—I found that out two or three times every year—the first time I found it out was about the middle or end of 1853, when we began the saltpetre business—the balance in 1853 was, 1,145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—that was on account of tartar and acid—it was immaterial whether we took the warrants up or not—we acted upon Barber's instructions about the goods—having ascertained that it was covered by warrants, I did not cure what became of it—I should not desire to realise the warrants if I was satisfied they were covered—I did not consider it requisite—I relied upon Goodburn holding proper securities—whether there was security of not I expected to get my 5 per cent. interest on the balance—it was in 1855 that the saltpetre transactions commenced—I saw the annual account in 1856—the balance then against Barber was 2,034<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mr. Merridew was the person who acted in the saltpetre trade—it is a trade that fluctuates very much—our brokers sometimes give advice as to when it is desirable to sell or to keep the saltpetre—Mr. Merridew had communication with Barber during the time he was in our books, and so had I frequently—I called his attention to the heavy balance against him several times—I advised him that it would be desirable for me to proceed to sell the saltpetre which covered his balance—we nominated the warehouseman after we pur<lb></lb>chased the goods—very likely the goods were warehoused before we bought them—I never took the trouble to find out what warrants had been used to take away the saltpetre from the warehouse—I depended upon my book-keeper—neither I or my partner ever looked over our securities that were sent to the bank every sight; I did not consider it requisite to do so—I do not believe that any brokers in the lane do, I never did—I should think we had fifty or sixty customers who were dealing in this way, I cannot tell—with the exception of Barber, or Barber's account, I have not been able to discover the slightest impropriety in any of the accounts kept by Goodburn—from 1855 to the end of 1861, the transactions were not so large, as between 90,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; within 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of that, I should say—from 60,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 70,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I should think the saltpetre transactions were not to the extent of 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I will say somewhere about from 60,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 70,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; upon all that there was a commission, and an interest ve per cent, on the balance—when</p>

               <p>Barber commenced dealing with us, I do not think he had any saltpetre refining place—he began to feline for himself in 1866, I think—I know that he incurred expense in fitting up his premises for refining saltpetre—I do not know to what extent; I have only been to his premises once, when this affair was found out—it was in 1867 or 1858, when the saltpetre, which was coming over by vessels to Liverpool, was damaged; that was saltpetre that we had purchased on account of Barber, to arrive—it was to arrive in more than one vessel; 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, or somewhere about that, had been bought by us on account of Barber, to arrive—we paid the prompt for it when it armed—some of it did not arrive—we paid the prompt for that which arrived; about 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Mr. Merridew will tell you better than I can, it is his branch of the business—the amount of our contract was upwards of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the saltpetre was damaged in the voyage, and did not make a profit—it was washed out—the water bad got in, and dissolved it, so that the anticipated profit on the arrival of perfect saltpetre was disappointed; I believe if it had all come perfect, there would have been a profit of between 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon it—the extent of transactions in money and cheques which passed through our hands differed very much—it was some times quite as much as 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per month, sometimes less—the transac<lb></lb>tions were generally very large—Goodburn had no one to assist him in keeping the ledger—he had to keep it all himself; nobody wrote in it besides himself—he had to look in the day-book, and the contract-book, or to receive information from the partners and also from the market clerks—I beg to observe that I have repeatedly offered to give him further assistance, and he has said he did not require it—since this affair has been discovered I have gone through the books with my own clerk—we have not had an accountant to go through them; we did not require one—I have not found a single error in his accounts, save and except those with regard to Barber's affair—it was in 1862 that I had these conversations with Crowther and Goodburn—it was Crowther I first spoke to on the subject, on the morning when he came in and said that Mr. Goodburn was ill—I had not spoken to Goodburn about it before that morning—it was two days afterwards when I saw him, and then I spoke to him for the first time—it was at the counting-house; no one was present—I believe I said some<lb></lb>thing to the effect that if he told me everything, and disclosed everything, he would not be the worse for it—he, after that, came day by day to make up the books, and to go through the accounts, and worked as hard as he could—I think that was for two months—I think this account, beginning with a balance of 7,609<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was handed to me, at the date it was made out, the 8th of April, 1862—that was before he left me—I had these other two accounts from Barber; I. don't know when he gave them to me, with several other papers, after the discovery—it was not whilst Goodburn was making op the accounts; it was after he left, I am quite certain of that—Goodburn remained in my office only so long as I thought he knew nothing about these frauds, but when I began to look into matters, I found it was desirable that he should leave—up to shortly before he left, I was under the im<lb></lb>pression that be knew nothing at all about this—I don't think I sent Goodburn to my attorney—he has been to our attorney; I never sent him there about Barber's matter—our present attorney is Sharp—I have sent him to Lawrence and Plews—I did not send him to Barber's attorney—I am quite sore of that—Barber handed me both these accounts—I cannot say when that was—he banded me papers almost every time I saw him—Barber has handed me other letters than those which have</p>

               <p>that what I represent to hate been the understanding, and to pay I percent both ways—I mean to say that if I had known he was dealing with others I would have closed the account at once; it turns out now that he dealt with Caudery—I did not know it; I have only heard so since we have had several transactions with Caudery—we might bane sold Caudery some refined petre of Barber's; he has had large transactions with Caudery through our house—we did not charge Barber 2 per cent upon those trans<lb></lb>actions of Caudery's"—there may have been some arrangement to charge Caudery 2 percent, and pay Barber I—it was not a fact to my knowledge—I have not done business in that way to the amount of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, not to that extent—it is very likely we consulted with Barber, and he agreed to pay Caudery a commission—it was not done to the extent of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, nothing like it; it was something very small indeed—there was not an agreement between us and Barber that this should take place—we never charged Barber any extra commission without explanation—we no doubt explained that; I will swear we did—I did not sign all the contracts made by Caudery myself, sometimes one partner signed, and sometimes another—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) those are very large transactions, but they have nothing to do with Barber; I cannot tell that they have—it was the rough petre that we bought on account of Barber; he was supposed to refine it, and then bring it back into our hands, our proposition being 1 percent on the purchase, and 1 percent on the sale—it is clear that Barber has been charged 3 percent, but Caudery would not purchase Barber's saltpetre without receiving a commission, and we communicated with Barber, and he agreed to pay him that extra commission; we did not benefit by it—I remember it all now perfectly—I must have explained it to Barber—I don't think it was anything like to the extent of as much as 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year—I cannot swear it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some paper</hi>) there have not been transactions of that kind in one year to the amount of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I swear that—our books, of course, show the amount of business we did by Caudery; it would take me a day to go through them—I do not think the transactions in which Barber was charged 3 percent, upon the whole was anything like the amount you state, but I cannot say what the amount was—we, being the brokers, were bound to find a customer for the petre—we sold it to Caudery at a charge of 2 percent instead of 1 to Barber, because we get a higher price from Caudary than anybody else; his was the best market—that was partly after the failure of Caudery, and partly before—Crowther had dealings with him to a very large extent unknown to me and my partner; there were very few dealings indeed that were known to me and passing through our books—there were not to my knowledge large transactions down to 1862—there were in 1861—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some cheques</hi>) these are cheques of Crowther's, pot ours—there is no writing of mine upon them—by turning to our books I could ascertain whether they had gone through our bankers—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the books</hi>) on 26th January, 1861, Caudery paid us a cheque 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the end of 1860, Caudery owed us a balance of 3,387<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this was in part liquidation of his debt—it has nothing to do with Barber—that 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. does not apply to petre sold on account of Barber—we had plenty of transactions with Caudery besides those on Barber's account—I say decidedly this 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had nothing to do with Barber, it was a liquidation of a balance due to us at the end of the previous year—that was not a balance created partly by Barber's transactions, dif<lb></lb>ferent things, there is cochineal, tartaric acid, and other things that Barber had nothing at all to do with—there were some solitary instances in which we made this charge to Barber—we never charged him beyond 2 percent.,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a salt-refiner, at Bermondsey—I have been acquainted with Crowther upwards of twenty years—I knew him when he was in business in Bermondsey—I had business transactions with him when he went into Laing &amp; Campbell's employment—I then owed him from 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had transactions with him, on his private account, after he went into their employ—he paid a series of dishonoured bills, to the amount of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for a house which failed, so that I was in his debt somewhere about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I began to deal with Laing &amp; Campbell somewhere in 1853—I opened that account through Crowther—he did not introduce me personally to them—he told ma he had opened an account for me with them; that I was to pay cash for goods as taken away, and give value for value, and was to have no credit—at that time my circumstances were not flourishing; I was about solvent, getting a living—he told me I was either to send a cheque for the amount or deposit goods for the value for which they were advanced, and that when I was not in a position to pay he would lend me the amount—I agreed to pay him a commission of 2 1/2 percent for the advances—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from him and accordingly allowed him 2 1/2 percent on any advances which be procured for me—I got, from time to time, warrants for goods from Laing &amp; Campbell—I cannot tell the amount in 1853—I received accounts from time to time—the balance in 1853 was 1,146<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; in 1854, 779<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and in 1855, 945<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I likewise paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton for the goods which were sold by him—the persons he employed to sell for me were charged in the accounts, as arranged—I am aware of some instances of transactions with Caudery; between myself, Laing &amp; Campbell, and Caudery—my transac<lb></lb>tions were with Laing &amp; Campbell, and they dealt with Caudery—then were instances in which 1 percent was allowed to Caudery, as well as to Laing &amp; Campbell—that was an understood thing; I was to pay the 1 per cent, to both of them; it was done with my sanction—in 1855 I com<lb></lb>menced refining saltpetre—it was discussed between myself and Mr. Crowther in order to meet the loss that had been sustained on the dishonoured bills,</p>

               <p>which were the occasion of my getting into Mr. Crowther's debt, and in order to clear off that I began the saltpetre-refining business—I should think I had incurred a loss of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in respect of that transaction—I never spoke to Mr. Laing for years afterwards; he is mistaken when he says I did—I transacted the business, connected with the saltpetre, with Mr. Cowther—I purchased some goods through Mr. Crowther from a person named Hinton, about a year or so after commencing the saltpetre trade—that is a matter of memory only—they were invoiced to me by Hinton—some dispute arose respecting the quality—that transaction had nothing whatever to do with Laing &amp; Co.—Hinton was partially paid in refined saltpetre—that was the reference made to Hinton's account in the letters—the arrangement with Crowther was, that I was to sell the saltpetre in any way I could, but the sale was to be through Laing's books; in fact, they were to be the ostensible sellers, and 1 percent was to be paid on the whole—in many cases they sold, themselves—if I sold goods through Laing &amp; Co., Mr. Cowther had no commission whatever on that, but he was to Have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on any goods which I sold not through Laing &amp; Co.—an account was arranged between us, which was to be kept in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), for the purpose of reducing the old account, for the repayment of the money which he had advanced—that was from time to time mentioned between us, in order to evidence that fact—I sent in goods to other persons besides Laing &amp; Co.; to Mr. Crowther's brother, and, I think, to Mr. Caudery—Charles Crowther is a brother of the prisoner—he was not a broker at that time—I presume he was then what he is now, a merchant dealing on his own account—latterly he has bad a warehouse, to which my goods were sent—when I sent these goods to Caudery, and to Crowther, I did not inform Goodburn of the fact, nor any one at Laing &amp; Co's.—I sent some to Caudery warehouse at Mr. Crowther's request—I paid Crowther's brother and Caudery 1 percent, in addition to the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton, on the reduction of the account, and 1 percent for sales—in 1857 I remember proposing to extend my premises—at that time I had made, through Laing &amp; Co., a purchase of saltpetre, and it was out of the purchase of that saltpetre that I anticipated the funds—before the cargoes, or any of them, arrived I had expended money on my premises—I have no doubt that that fact was often talked over between Goodburn, Mr. Crowther, and myself—I cannot re<lb></lb>member any particular time—an arrangement was made that I should have what saltpetre I required, and when the profit was realised—on the other it would set the account right again—the profits were certain if the ships had arrived—we thought the insurance covered it—I got warrants in pursuance of that arrangement—I can only state what the amount was by stating what the balance would be at the end of the year; it would be somewhere about 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I deposited nothing as security against that especially—it was out of the produce of those warrants that I was able to lay out the money upon my premises—I was applied to, from time to time, by both Crowther and Goodburn, to repay this money—I was not able to do so—several times I said that it would be better to lay the whole affair before Mr. Laing, and take his advice, and see what he would wish to do—both the prisoners always objected to that being done.</p>

WONTNER JUN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">proved the service of a notice upon the defendant's solicitor to produce this letter</hi>)—matters went on in this way till March, 1862, when these affairs were discovered, and my account was closed—I remember receiving a letter from Crowther, on 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> March, beginning, "I have not seen Mr. Goodburn this morning"—I have seen Crowther since then, to the best of my belief twice—at the commence<lb></lb>ment of these transactions I was in the habit of meeting Crowther in Messrs. Laing's sample room; afterwards I was introduced to Mr. Merridew, who was then a clerk in the house, and transacted business with him—I know Mr. Adams' office, in Fenchurch-stceet—I know Mr. Adams very well—I met the prisoners there frequently—I was in the habit of going there and lending a note over to them—I did not go to Mr. Laing's office, because they were in constant fear that they should be found out, and requested me to meet them elsewhere—there is not a Miss Adams; the "Miss A." re<lb></lb>ferred to in one of the letters if my housekeeper—I recollect the latter part of 1859, when Mr. Campbell was about to retire from the business—I remember the letter which begins, "I have had a plain straightforward talk with Mr. Goodburn"—the state of my account was a matter constantly discussed—there was a proposition made by both the defendants, which was, that they should land me 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that I should reduce my account 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—they stated that—that amount was so paid to Laing &amp; Co. on my account; 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by each—this letter refers to certain twenty-five tons</p>

Laing, it was under 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I don't think I ever did receive any; no, I never re<lb></lb>ceived any—it would have been impossible for me to have worked my business without their capital—that was perfectly known from the com<lb></lb>mencement—it was not known to Mr. Laing, but it was to Crowther and Goodburn—it is quite clear that, unless I got advances on the prompt and an uncovered account amounting to a certain extent, I could not work my business—I being the manufacturer, and bringing the refined petre into the market, after the goods were manufactured, I always had the conveyance, either through Laing, or some other person getting the money—they were cashed to me—I got the advances immediately—there was not an extra per centage when I sold through Laing—if I sold through Caudery or others, I</p>

               <p>still paid Mr. Laing one percent—My expenses were about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. weekly—I don't think Laing knew anything about my business—I did not come in contact with him for years, not to speak to him on business—at one time I thought everything was brought round—I conveyed that impression to Crowther and Goodburn—they knew it as well as I did—the constant subject of conversation between us was bow my account could be set right with their employers—as far as they were personally concerned, they got nothing out of these transactions, to my knowledge; certainly not with any collusion with me—that I answer distinctly, and not to ay own knowledge, any further than helping me to liquidate Mr. Laing's account; beyond that, I know of no benefit positively which they have derived from their transac<lb></lb>tions with me—the period when I expected to get out of my difficulty was at the time the cargoes of petre were injured and destroyed—it then appeared certain that there would be from 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that transac<lb></lb>tion—the petre was sold and insured, and the profit absolutely made, and in my communications with Goodburn and Crowther I treated this as an ascertained fact; and there was every reason for them to believe it to be so—I thought the money was as safe as if it was in a bank—that would have enabled me to pay every single farthing I owed to Laing—that was my full intention, to close my business and pay every farthing—I directed Mr. Merridew to insure the cargo—it was insured, but when the vessels came in with the cargo washed out, I found the insurance was of no value—I cannot explain what I don't understand—I am not an <hi rend="italic">fait</hi> at insurance matters—I left it to Mr. Merridew, and whether it was his fault or anybody else's, the underwriters would not pay the insurance; there was, therefore, a tremen<lb></lb>dous loss, instead of a gain, which I had foolishly anticipated, as then I could have disposed of my plant and property, and everything else—the expression in one of the letters about some contract becoming dangerous, was not clear to me when I received the letter, bat I have heard the matter discussed since—it appears to me clear now, that that contract was shifted to Laing and Campbell at that time, to saddle them with the loss—there was a loss in the difference of price—there would have been an actual gain, pro<lb></lb>viding Mr. Caudery had not failed.</p>

               <p>saltpetre for the raw which I got, and what I might tell directly, I would hand over the cash for, or my agents would hand it over on my account—I could not carry on my business without baring a large quantity of raw salt<lb></lb>petre in trust—I could not make the quantity and return it in refined salt<lb></lb>petre—it is quite clear that unless Crowther and Goodburn had furnished me with very large quantities, I could not hare carried on my business for a week—I don't think Mr. Laing troubled himself about the quantity I had, or the other partners in the house—when they saw that I was carrying on transactions to the extent of 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, of course they must have known that I was refining large quantities of saltpetre, and that I should require large quantities of raw to be entrusted to me—it might have been understood that I was to deal with nobody for saltpetre except Laing, and I should not consider myself justified in buying any large quantity from any<lb></lb>body else—in the first instance, the matter was arranged with Crowther and Goodburn, but not afterwards—I did not see the principals of the firm when my transactions commenced—if Mr. Laing said so, he must have made a mistake—I did not see either of the principals, neither Mr. Campbell or Mr. Laing—I know Mr. Campbell very well, but we never talked on business—I knew him about a year or two years before the dissolution of partnership—of course be knew I was dealing with the firm—I did not enter into details with him as to the terms—of course he knew I had the refining manufactory—in general conversation, I have no doubt that I told him that I was making such and each a quantify—I must have done so—I never told him about the arrangements I had made with Crowther—I don't think it probable that any of the partners ever asked me who it was who was making the arrangements with me at to buying and selling—Mr. Merridew used to do the business with me, but at that time he was not a partner—he bought and sold for me; it came to be rather a large concern—the purchases were sometimes very extensive—I have always consulted him in the business since he has become a partner—he became a partner when Mr. Campbell went out in 1860—Merridew used to tend me the bought and told notes signed by himself or Mr. Laing—my dealings have been with Merridew from the time he became a partner, in that way—if we had order, which was generally the case, the goods were delivered directly to the parties buying if not they were warehoused—we got orders from Laing &amp; Co. to deliver them to the pur<lb></lb>chaser when sold, so that they never came into their possession at all or their warehouseman—it was done in this way; Laing or some of my agents would get orders for a quantity of saltpetre, either to be shipped or delivered to the various buyers in London; I then delivered it according to the orders, and returned Mr. Laing a note of such delivery—the orders to deliver would come either through Crowther or Goodburn—Mr. Merridew did not counter<lb></lb>sign the delivery orders of "refined"—the order would come generally with him, and I should deliver it to our customers; they would get their per<lb></lb>centage—previous to that form of letter which was drawn by Goodburn, the state of my affairs was a matter constantly discussed; never a week passed but we talked about it—I certainly staled before that what my property was, so as to make me solvent—it was in writing that letter that Goodburn and I disagreed—I was solvent, taking the goods at their fair value, but if I was broken up at once, then I should not be solvent—if I could have done that at that time, which was in the summer of 1859, I should have been perfectly solvent—I owed Mr. Laing about 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that time according to the ac<lb></lb>count—at that time the amount of the whole of the contracts which I did with Mr. Merridew was. in much as 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; in 1859 we were in full work—</p>

               <p>if that trade had been continued at that rate, the returns would have been from 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week; the purchases would hare been about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, through Merridew—he acted as the broker—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in my writing—I know it perfectly—this is supposing it was disposed of at I told you—about 19th July, 1859, I had saltpetre in hand to the value of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that paper is correct, it is a letter of mine to Goodburn, a mere memorandum, a rough statement—the saltpetre I had was then in process—I had tartaric acid worth 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the metallic lead on the premises I estimated at l, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there was what yon call the plant, but I had other things comprised in the plant—then I estimated the building, the freehold estate, plus a mortgage I had upon it, as worth 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and steam engines, boilers, and other plant, 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was another small factory, which I estimated at about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was all—the total is 6,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. beyond the 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I then owed, always supposing that we found a customer to sell it to—that 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of saltpetre which was them in progress, was afterwards delivered by Mr. Laing's order to his customers, and it was replaced again by more rough from them—this saltpetre would be delivered weekly, and I should receive a further weekly quantity from them—as I sent off the refined, I should keep receiving raw; to keep my works going—Mr. Merridew knew, as well as I did, the profits I expected from buying that saltpetre to arrive—he bought the petre and it was sold through their house—of course I told Crowther and Goodburn as well—every one knew it, because it was such a large profit that everybody was talking about it—it was at a time when saltpetre was becoming very valuable—the habit was, as soon as the contract was effected by Mr. Merri<lb></lb>dew, to debit one with the amount—I was debited in their ledger as though it had been actually delivered—as the time went on, Goodburn became more and more anxious about the heaviness of my account, and more and more alarmed—at one time it was arranged that he should send an accountant to look at my accounts—he did so; a Mr. Du Pre, and he was there going through the accounts for me a month or six weeks—he came for the purpose of seeing that the business I was doing was all right—that was in the summer of 1859—I was never satisfied with the way in which the account was managed, and it was at my wish as much as Goodburn's that it was done—at that time, independent of my position as a solvent man, I could have paid off, by the assistance of some other person, Laing's account—I could have got somebody to help me, if there had not been the dread of bringing it before Mr. Laing—that is to say I could hare received that amount of accommodation, and paid for it in that way, which would have given me a sufficient sum to liquidate their debt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you must, of course, have dealt with other persons, and they would have lost their 2 percent? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would have been the induce<lb></lb>ment—at that time Mr. Goodburn often pressed upon me to get a partner, but I objected to it—I do not like partners—he proposed that I should take a partner so that Laing might be paid—the advance of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Crowther and Goodburn was after this, in November or December—they were to advance 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and I was to advance another 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to reduce the account; that was the plan that was proposed—it was agreed that the paying of this 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not to effect my payments at all—I was to do all I could to reduce the account lower—it was mentioned how Goodburn was to be repaid; he was to have another factory of which I was in possession, made over to him by way of security—it was to be a <hi rend="italic">bond fide sale</hi> sale to him—I was to secure him by a positive sale of the property, putting him in possession—</p>

               <p>it was a factory detached from mine, 3 or 400 yards off—that had nothing to do with Laing's transactions, it was part of my general property—that is the factory which I estimated worth 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a solicitor named Kiley drew up the deeds—Goodburn referred me to Mr. Kiley—Goodburn stipulated at that time that I should also give a bond to pay Laing, and after the lapse of a period of I cannot exactly say how long, wished to reassign the property to me on condition of my mortgaging it to a building society, of which I think he was a member, which was done—he reassigned it to me, and then the building society advanced 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the mortgage—I never recovered the money—there is now 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing to him, I think, I acknowledge that—he has no security for that—I do not know that Goodburn raised that 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the advantage of Laing &amp; Co. with the greatest difficulty, by selling some little houses he had—I do not know how he got it; I rather think I was told Mr. Crowther lent it to him—he did not tell me that it was with the greatest difficulty he raised it; he did not enter into particulars how he raised it—the premises, plant, and stock, began to depreciate from July 1860—at the end of 1859, I had had delivered to me 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of saltpetre; that was in progress of refinement at the end of the year, although it was not delivered—the petre delivered to me in December would be in progress of refinement in the following month, but the system was, to put in more salt<lb></lb>petre every week and take refined out every week—I cannot identify any particular petre—I got accounts current sent to me from time to time, very irregularly, about once a year, I should think, on an average; in some years there might perhaps have been two sent—they were sent to me by Mr. Merridew, who was acting as the broker, and buying and selling for me—Mr. Merridew never complained to me that he had not bad the accounts current submitted to him, nor did any of the partners—I went on for a number of years doing these large transactions, and neither of the partners ever complained to me that they had not signed the accounts current—in 1857, there was a clerk in the firm named Walker; I do not remember the date exactly—I remember his acting as book-keeper very well—whilst he was so doing, I went on in precisely the same way, receiving the warrants and getting the saltpetre—I was aware that Mr. Goodburn was very much engaged in that great fraudulent bankruptcy of Windle Cole's—it did not trouble me, and perhaps I did not go to Laing's house more than two or three times a year—the business was principally done by Crowther through Mr. Merridew, and all the money matters through Goodburn—besides paying in refined saltpetre, considerable sums would be paid in cash by some of my agents—I would not take upon myself to say what amount, but large sums of money—that would include cash paid by the persons who bought the refined saltpetre—of course the percentage would come on that to Laing—it was in 1861, I think, that Caudery owed Mr. Laing about 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—from 1859 Mr. Goodburn got so alarmed, that he managed the concern in such a way as to continue a system of ruinous losses—I pressed that it should be laid before the house, which they refused—I said, "If that cannot be done, put it into the hands of a man of business, and put an end to any further losses—Mr. Caudery was then agreed upon as the man of business, and that was how the arrangement came to be made—Caudery was to pay the money to Laing, and be answerable to them, instead of relying upon me—it was nothing whatever to do with me, they looked to Mr. Caudery for the money, and that debt of 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was incurred in that way—Mr. Good<lb></lb>burn before that got alarmed, and acted like a madman—it was because he said, "We will not let yon have so much" that the ruinous losses were in<lb></lb>curred</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186305110139"></xptr>
               <p>—it stopped the concern altogether—of course he pressed me, and said I must pay and reduce the account—that is what he always kept at—he also said that if the concern was stopped it would be ruinous to himself—he said that be should be dismissed if it was discovered that he had given me credit—he said that repeatedly, and that was the reason it was not brought before Mr. Laing—I said the only way the concern would be enabled to pay Messrs. Laing was by carrying it on, by supplying large quan<lb></lb>tities to refine—Goodburn refused to do that, and that is what I call carry<lb></lb>ing it on at a ruinous loss, and the next project was that Mr. caudery should be the purchaser, so as to give the funds over to pay Messrs. Laing—the balance of the account is stated to be 6,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—up to July, 1859, the account was kept in a very unsatisfactory way to me, simply because I did not know the way in which broker's books were kept, by making the purchase, debit<lb></lb>ing me with the goods, and never delivering them—I have even gone so far as to say, I did not believe that I had received the warrants so charged—very likely I had not—I then proposed that an accountant should be called in, and that I should have satisfactory proof of each delivery, that the salt<lb></lb>petre had been delivered to me that was charged to me in these accounts current, and that I pressed on Goodburn and Crowther twenty times—I can<lb></lb>not answer as to the amount of the commission and interest, without having the accounts before me—I had the accounts current delivered to me—I have not taken the trouble to examine whether the large balance which out claimed is made up principally of commission and of interest—I have not gone into the question of commission—I did not presume to tell Goodburn how he was to keep his books—I said it was totally unsatisfactory to me—according to my notion it was wrong to enter to my debit sums for which purchases were made before I bad actually got the goods, but that seems to be the broker's system; Goodburn told me so.—I afterwards stopped the system—I will not venture to say as to the particular date, but I believe that it was about July, 1869, that that plan was discontinued; I know it was very shortly after—if the books are here they will at once show when it was, and if I bad been at home, I could at once have stated—I am not prepared to say from memory whether up to that time the accounts had been carried on on that system—I was charged interest on the yearly balances—I was not called upon to take the trouble of ascertaining whether the bulk of the large balance against me was made up of commission and interest—I could make a mental calculation of it in five minutes—it must be a very large sum for interest and commission—taking it from the time when the balance was 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., there would be 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for interest; then taking the yearly return, there would be 2 per cent. on that—adding the interest at the end of the year to the principal, and taking the compound interest, it would bring it to a very large sum—I am not now carrying on my business—no one is doing so—I am living upon some little money which I bare got—my expenses are very trifling—the works are shut up—I shut them up about February—when I say that, I wish U be perfectly clear, I am paying the wages of two or three men whom I do not choose to part with, and who are leading men in the factory—I have not told that to Messrs. Laing—it is no business of theirs that I know of—Messrs. Laing have not asked me to pay something off their account—Mr. Merridew has not done so—I have not offered to pay anything—the plant is still there—Messrs. Laing have not applied to me to ask how much I could pay off the debt, if I sold the manufactory—I have had no negotiation of that kind with them—the men I retain on the premises merely job about the place, and sweep it up—there are three or</p>

Laing, I have seen him there—I know it is not Hall and White—I know that there is a Mr. Hall, one of Messrs. Laing's clerks—it was Hall and White—I presume it ceased to be so when Mr. Hall entered Messrs. Laing's service—that would be in March, at the time Mr. Crowther left—that was when he took his place—I first applied to Mr. Merridew for him to let me have salt<lb></lb>petre—he would not let me have it—Mr. Merridew did not ask me how much I could pay off their debt—he did not inquire at all into my circumstances, not until this matter came out—I believe they thought it was a total loss—they never inquired how much I could pay in the pound.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came the balance of your account with Crowther to be increased to 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I sold Messrs. Foot a quantity of tartaric acid, and drew upon them for the amount at three months—part of these bills were passed through Messrs. Laing's, part Mr. Crowther got discounted for me—Messrs. Foot failed—he then said it would be a ruinous matter for any of the bills to be returned to Messrs Laing, and it would be ruinous to me; he would therefore come forward and advance the money and take up the bills, and take whatever dividend there was from Foot's estate, leaving me his debtor afterwards—that increased the balance to 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I subsequently brought it down to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was swollen again to 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the payments to Messrs. Laing—the amount of 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was reduced to 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not gone through the account myself, but Mr. Crowther's-account shows 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—since the account has been reduced to 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I have not paid Crowther 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton and interest and commission in addition—during the whole time of the account running, I paid Crowther for discount of bills generally at 5 percent on the transaction; if I drew a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill for three months, I should pay 5 per cent, that would be 20 percent per annum—I paid Crowther 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton on a given quantity of saltpetre, which he applied to the liquidation of the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the interest was charged in the accounts—2 1/2 percent, was paid in addi<lb></lb>tion, upon my sales of tartaric acid—it was put in his accounts—during all the time this was going on Crowther never told me that Mr. Laing had been willing that his balance should be uncovered to the extent of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—accord<lb></lb>ing to his representation, the dealing with Laing and Company was only to be in cash—I cannot tell how much I paid Crowther for discounting bills, without looking through the accounts—it would be a considerable sum of money altogether during the time the account was running—the 2 1/2 percent. was not on account of Messrs. Laing at all, but for Crowther personally—I know of purchase of tartar from Crowther—there were communications</p>

               <p>between me and Crowther in respect of the value of that tartar—we disputed as to the qualities—he said that the quality was bad, and that it would have to be exchanged, or some allowance would have to be made on it—I did not get any allowance or exchange from Crowther—it was one of the conditions of his paying Foot's bills, that I should forego any claim for remuneration on the bad tartar—at that time I was very ill, and confined to my bed—taking my foreman's representation of it, who was a practised hand at tartaric acid, I should say the loss would amount to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or more altogether—that would be the special lose upon the qualities—exclusive of that, there would be a further loss that would bring it up to 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it never came to a claim against Crowther—Crowther sold the tartar to me through Messrs Laing—at that time he was in Messrs. Laing's service—I told Crowther that I was about to make a claim on Messrs. Laing—he told me that it would seriously injure him with Messrs. Laing, inasmuch as he was not allowed to do busi<lb></lb>ness on his own account—Messrs. Foot failed just about that time, so that that at once would settle the tartar matter—I could not carry on the concern without capital, or having an uncovered advance—I was not at any time aware that Laing and Company had consented to my having credit to any Amount—neither Lang nor Crowther ever told me so—with reference to the lots of the cargo of saltpetre, I had given directions to Mr. Merridew to insure in the usual way I did not suppose that more was necessary—with reference to the contract which was shifted from Mr. Caudery to Messrs. Laing, I do not profess to have the matter at my fingers' ends—the dealings with Messrs. Laing were upon a <hi rend="italic">credere</hi> commission, so that, upon any sales made to insolvent parties, they were answerable, and I should not lose the amount.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>the advance of the two sums of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the prisoners was in December, 1859, or January, 1860—in taking the balance of July, 1859, and looking at the increase of the debt in September, 1861, that 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. must be added—you must also add the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for stock taken into account in Messrs. Laing's books which had not been delivered, and which was delivered in the follow<lb></lb>ing January—the arrangement about Caudery making the sales was in Sep<lb></lb>tember, 1861—I could not tell the uncovered balance at Laing's at that time, as it would be in the middle of the year, when the books were not made up—from the time when Caudery took it up, I think that Laing and Company got no commission—part of the saltpetre which I worked up for Caudery, and which he sold, was represented by warrants obtained from Laing, and part Caudery, went into the market and purchased on his own account—I have had an account with Caudery for years—from memory I should say I owe him 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I owed him a great deal more than that in March, 1862—from the time of Messrs, Laing throwing it up, the works were conducted through Caudery, up to the beginning of February—since then I have had the single transaction with Mr. White—I know that Laing and Co. have not had anything to do with the transaction I have had with White, because I asked them to do it themselves—in March, 1862, at the time when Messrs. Laing made this discovery, if the concern had been pro<lb></lb>perly wound up, I think 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. might have been got for it—that includes everything; it would have been 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon a debt of 9,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—that is, supposing it to be sold properly and at that time—provided it was properly done, it could be managed without expense—my estate at the present time would not pay more than the dividend I have mentioned—I was present when a person came from Laing and Company the premises to value the stock Messrs. Laing's system is, that the moment they make a purchase they debit the party with it—about 1860, that sys<lb></lb>tem was stopped upon my representation—they would debit me with it when the prompt had expired; I am not quite clear about it—I think it is when the purchase is made—I am not sure.</p>

I was for many years a clerk in the em<lb></lb>ployment of Laing and Company—I became a partner on Mr. Campbell going out in January, 1860—before I was a partner I acted as market-clerk—Crowther was the other market-clerk—the dealings in tartaric acid and saltpetre were in his department—up to the time of my being a partner I had nothing to do with the books—the only book that came to my charge was the contract-book—I had no access to the ledger or to the security box—before I was a partner I was not at all aware of the state of Barber's account—upon Mr. Campbell leaving I was present when the state of the account was discussed in Goodburn's presence—Mr. Laing asked him if the balances were all properly covered, as it was necessary to be certain of that before they paid Mr. Campbell over what was due to him out of his capital—he then said that the balances were all fully covered, and that there was not a bad account in the ledger—Mr. Barber's account was transferred from Laing and Campbell to Laing and Merridew—the account has been men<lb></lb>tioned several times since I have been a partner, both by Crowther and Goodburn, Goodburn merely confirming his previous statement that it was covered by security—Crowther'a conversation with me upon that subject would more relate to the state of the stock in hand than to the other portion of it; I should never speak to him on the cash matters—I mean the stock under the control of Laing and Company—both Crowther and Good barn had access to the contract-book—I refer <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the contract-book of October 13th, 1857—I cannot say whose handwriting this entry is in—there is a mark against it of "J.

               <p>against these entries indications of their being posted to the ledger—the indication is the folio in Goodburn's handwriting—the entries in the day-book have figures against them in Goodburn's handwriting—both the entries which are in the day-book are posted into the ledger—I am now looking at William Caudery's account—I find the entry to his debit—that is posted by Goodburn, and in the day-book his figures appear in the margin as the folio of the ledger—I turn to Barber's account—the entry from the day book is posted into that account likewise by Goodburn—the figures in the day-book indicating the folio of the ledger are in the handwriting of Good<lb></lb>burn also—the entries are to the debit of one, and to the credit of the other—there is no contract in the contract-book—the market-price of saltpetre upon the 24th of November was about 42<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the rate charged in the books is 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more than the market-price at that time—I remember the fire at Cotton's Wharf in June, 1861—we had a quantity of saltpetre which had been warehoused for Barber at that wharf—a claim was made in consequence upon the insurance company—I have the claim here—the body of it is in Goodburn's handwriting, and signed by me—I did not test its accuracy before I signed it, except so far as the price was concerned—Goodburn laid it before me for the purpose of my signature, and I, as one of the principals, signed it—the practice as to goods when they are landed is to draw an average sample, to send it to an analytical chemist, who gives a certificate of the quantity of impurity in it, which we call refraction—that is the in<lb></lb>variable practice in the case of saltpetre—it is done at the docks—there is no duty upon it—when saltpetre is bought the refraction is stated in the contract—we buy according to the refraction as stated by the analytical chemist invariably—the contracts stated in our books are likewise stated on the same refraction—the books are a copy from the contract—I have an entry of the contract with reference to the saltpetre that was burnt, in the contract-book of the 14th February, 1861, a purchase on behalf of Barber—I cannot say whose handwriting the entry is in—when Goodburn made out this claim his knowledge would be derived from the entry in the day-book made from this contract—the entry is transferred from the contract-book into the day-book—the entry in the day-book is in Goodburn's handwriting, and is as follows: "Pile 1,278 bags, per Alipore; refraction, 54 1/2 per cent"—the refraction stated in the claim is 40 percent—the claim besides being sent in to the insurance company is entered in our books on the 31st of July by Goodburn—the weights in the entry in the day-book when they were bought, and the weights in the claim, correspond precisely—I am speaking of the weights without reference to the refraction—in the ordinary course of his business Goodburn would refer to this entry in the day-book for the purpose of making out his claim—I know of no instance in which, when he made out a claim on an insurance company, a clerk handed to him any memorandum for the purpose—the refraction stated in the claim does not correspond with the contract—on a small portion of it, it is 53 per cent., and on another portion 49 1/2 percent—in the claim it is all put down at 40 percent.—the claim is made out on three contracts—in the third case the entry of the claim is in Goodburn's handwriting—the refraction is stated at 40 percent, and in the entry of the contract in the day-book it is stated at 54 1/2 percent—the heading of the entry is in Goodburn's handwriting—the amount of excess is 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave no authority to Goodburn to part with the two warrants in July or August, 1861—there is an entry in our books with relation to those two warrants, the one per the <hi rend="italic">Palnurston</hi> on the 30th of July, in the handwriting of Mr. Hewitt, a clerk of the firm—he was a clerk under Goodburn—he had nothing</p>

               <p>to do with the warrants—the entry of the other warrant is in Goodburn's handwriting, dated the 7th May, 1861, and is as follows: "Henry Barber, debtor to J. F. Drake and Company"—that is the entry of the contract of purchase for Barber—there is no entry showing the disposition of warrants—I have an entry in what is called a delivery-book, dated August 3d, in Crowther's handwriting (<hi rend="italic">the entry was read</hi>)—that is an entry of the delivery of the warrants on that day to Barber—I gave no authority either to Good<lb></lb>burn or Crowther <hi rend="italic">to</hi> hand over those warrants.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In order to substantiate your claim was it necessary to send the warrants of the goods to the insurance company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "Yes—the weights appear upon the warrants; the refraction does not—Goodburn might copy the weights from the warrants—I cannot say whether before the claim was allowed Mr. Hardy, on the part of the insurance com<lb></lb>pany, examined into it, looking at the warrants—I cannot say whether, before the insurance company allow a claim, they employ a person to check the amount of it—the policy was a floating policy on goods at several wharves—we claimed for a small quantity of black dye—Hewitt made out amount sales, and he made some entries in the day-book—he had no other duties—supposing there were six warrants applying to six different contracts, the average might have been calculated by three different people in the office, so as to apply it to three or four contracts—our business is a very large one—wt had only one cashier and book-keeper, with two assistants—one was Mr. Hewitt, another was Mr. Walker—Mr. Goodburn would probably give information to them—when he was making up the ledger there would be no occasion for him to look at documents, he would look at entries—it is impossible for me to say who assisted him—I cannot tell whether in making out the refraction he looked at the warrants alone—the actual refraction is upon an analysis of a sample—the sample by which it is ordinarily tested is the one that follows the article through every course of commerce—the quantity of saltpetre in a bag varies from 1 1/2 cwt to 1 3/4 cwt.—supposing there are 100 bags of saltpetre, the Dock Company take what we call the average sample—the size of the sample is 1/2 cwt—the chemists who analysed the saltpetre that was destroyed at Cotton's Wharf were Messrs. Tishmacher and Smith—I do not know which of the gentlemen did it—the sample was sent by the Dock Company direct to the chemist's—it was after we had made the charge against the two prisoners that we sent back the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the insurance company—we gave them notice the day we found it out, and paid them on the following day—I think we sent back the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the second examination at the Mansion House—I calculated the Averages—there was one beside myself engaged upon it, the young gentle-man who is helping me here to-day, Mr. Hewitt—is not here—he is not now in our service—Mr. Walker is here—he is not now in our service—he left us in the beginning of 1860—Mr. Hewitt left about a month or six weeks ago—I do not recollect that anybody came in Mr. Walker's place—we promoted other clerks in our office I think Mr. Hewitt took his place—we have engaged a clerk to take Mr. Hewitt's place, who has not come yet—I have a delivery-book here—it shows what warrants were delivered out to Mr. Barber, and to Mr. Barber only—I found it among some of our books when we came to look over them—I find that some of the entries are in Good<lb></lb>burn's, and some in Crowther's, handwriting—besides the delivery-book there is no other book that shows the warrants that go out, or the warrants that are in our possession—we do a very large business in colonial produce; not in the same way in which we dealt with Barber—we buy of one man for</p>

               <p>another—on some goods we pay a deposit, according to the terms of the market—if we pay the deposit, as Boon as we have the particulars we enter the whole amount of the purchase-money against the buyer in our books—if we made a contract to buy for Mr. Brown 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, and paid a deposit, we should enter against Mr. Brown, on the date of the contract, 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., be<lb></lb>cause we should be answerable as broken; and, besides that, if we paid a deposit out of our own funds, we should debit him with interest immediately upon the deposit, and then when the prompt came, if we paid the money out of our own pockets, we should debit him with interest upon it until we were paid—that was the course adopted with reference to Mr. Barber—there was a transaction of a purchase of saltpetre, to arrive by two vessels at Liverpool in 1857—when we bargained for that saltpetre, it was at a low price—I should think it was rather more than a 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. purchase—if we had been called upon to pay at the prompt we should have been upwards of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advance—I have no recollection whether we were called upon to pay at the prompt—supposing saltpetre, instead of rising, had fallen, Barber might have been 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of pocket—we were answerable to pay, as brokers, the whole 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if it would not have netted more than half, then Barber would have been the loser of 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or more—I recollect the transaction of buying for Barber to that large amount; it did not turn out to be a losing transaction—there was 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. profit on that which did arrive—I recollect being directed to insure that which was bargained for—I gave instructions to Mr. Goodborn, who did all our insurances, against fire and everything else, to insure it—besides being our book-keeper, and keeping the ledger, it was a part of his business to effect the insurances—I did not know with whom the insurances were effected; I never inquired—there was no dispute with the insurers as to payment—Barber did not insist that the insurers were bound to pay him as upon a loss of upwards of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was no dispute by him—the profit was made upon that which arrived in London—there would be the difference between about 33<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a <hi rend="italic">cwt.</hi> and 48<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a <hi rend="italic">cwt</hi>—I bought for Barber after I became a partner—I never sold his refined salt<lb></lb>petre—Crowther had the duty of selling for him; that was with my concur<lb></lb>rence and knowledge—we made an agreement with Barber after this dis<lb></lb>covery, not to molest him—we made an engagement with Mr. Caudery for twelve months, upon condition that he should pay the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the warrants which he had had—he has paid the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the warrants he has had—I refer to my ledger and find the following entries: September 11th, 2 barrels; October 3d, 30 casks and 20 barrels; on October 11th, 3 casks; on the 12th, 30; on the 18th, 5; on the 19th, 12; and on the 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 71"—these are all entered to the credit of Barber as against his debit account.</p>

Laing and Co. could not be called on to pay except on the goods which actually arrived—I did not know of the existence of the delivery<lb></lb>book until after the discovery of these frauds—my attention was called to it by a communication from Barber, with reference to two warrants for salt<lb></lb>petre</p>

               <p>—I searched and found that book—I find no entry in it except in Goodburn's and Crowther's writing—the earliest date is the 27th April, 1860, and the latest is the 3d August, 1861—there is the exception of one marked "not delivered"—we had transactions with other customers in salt<lb></lb>petre, and in other colonial produce, to an extent equal in gross amount to Barber's)—in many instances we had possession of warrants for them in the same way as for Barber—there was no book kept by our concern for the purpose of containing entries of warrants to anybody else—this book is printed, "Warrants sent to Mr. Henry Barber" throughout—I gave no directions to have such a book as this prepared, and was not aware of its existence—I have seen it before to-day—it was found among a number of other books, in one of our rooms where we put away our ledgers—where I found it, I should think it would not be accessible to the partners; merely because we very seldom go into that room—we hare a room up stairs where we put a number of books that are completed—I should say, the book being full, it would not be lying about the counting-house—that room was kept by the firm for keeping a portion of their books which were filled up—I had not seen that book before—I did not find any other book there; no other in continuation of it.</p>

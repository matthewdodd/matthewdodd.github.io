            , an attorney, in Finsbury-place. I was concerned for Earle; he had referred Price to me for a character; he was convicted last Session.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give Earle a most respectable character? A. I am not aware that I did - I stated to Price what Earle had represented himself to me, and what I knew of him: I stated that we had been concerned for Mr. Earle, in settling a lease of some premises, near Battle-bridge, for which he was to pay a rent of 2000l. a year, we being concerned for one of the ground-landlords, and that he represented to us that he had a fishery in Ireland, the lease of which was just out, and he had premises at St. Mary-at-hill: it was in contemplation to form a tontine; that he was to reveal a secret for the cure of fish; that he was to receive a large annuity; and that Earle stated to me, that the agent of the Duke of Devonshire was to be a party concerned; several other persons whom he named were to be parties, and that there had been a meeting at the London-tavern, to make the arrangements; but Earle had stated to me afterwards that the arrangements were broken off, and it was to be conducted according to the terms of the engagement; I left it to Price to judge for himself, and that he must see the danger of this security being negociated - I said that Earle was only a very recent acquaintance, and I relied on his representation to me, having no previous acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state to him that Mr. Earle was a man of 5000l. a year? A. Certainly not, nor that he was in possession of a fishery in Ireland, nor what he had given for the fishery; nor that whether the pickled fish concern was successful or not, he would be sure to recover his money, for Earle was a man of property - nor that the company was sure to be successful, and that I was glad he had got into the company's service: I am positive nothing of the sort passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner any party to that agreement? A. Only by inference; he was not present at the execution.</p>
               <p>COURT Q. Did you see him on the subject of the agreement? A. I did - I think it was on the 6th of September; I went down to St. Mary-at-hill to read a draft of the agreement; I saw Brown in the counting-house; there were a number of circulars on the table: Brown entered into the subject of the agreement, and I understood from him that he was a partner in the concern, and that I might read the draft to him, which I did; some pencil alterations were made at the suggestion of Brown and Earle; some were made before Earle came in.</p>

             re-examined. This agreement was executed at Mr. Minithorpe's office, on the 15th of September, and I there paid over into Earle's hands, a 50l. bill, dated on that day - there was nothing in the warehouse at St. Mary-at-hill but two chairs and a small counting-house desk; there were no barrels of pickled fish; I was there day after day, and was repeatedly ordered to prepare for a journey by Brown; I never saw any barrels of fish in the warehouse; I first went there on the 30th of August, and a month or five weeks after it was closed; I saw, perhaps, 30s. or 2l. worth of pickled fish; it was brought into the warehouse one morning - that was the only fish I ever saw; there were probably 6lbs. of eels; they filled four small pots; I never saw Brown after October - the warehouse has been shut up ever since - the bill was paid when it became due, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160048"></xptr>I have it here; the prisoner's endorsement is on the back of it - there were probably two or three-thousand printed bills on the counting-house table; here is one of them.(this bill being read, was addressed to Merchants, Innkeepers, &amp;c., recommending the pickled fish.) I never saw a greater stock of fish than I have mentioned, and part of that was thrown away - I had no notice that my bill was circulated - I never saw Brown after the warehouse was closed, which was in October, till he was apprehended; Eurle was in custody in October and discharged, as the bill being in negociation, could not be produced - I did not see him afterwards, till he was taken again - I know of no business having been transacted by the company; the bill was presented and paid when due, (bill read;) when I applied to know when I was to go my journey, Brown said the pots were not come in, and sent me to Palmer and Bernall's, to inquire after them - I went several times, and at last one hundred dozen pots came in; eight days after I signed the agreement, I said they had put me to some expence in preparing for my journey, and I must have assistance, but I did not require the 6l. per week; Brown asked what I wanted - I said 2l., and he gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you told all you recollect of the business? A. There may be other things which I do not recollect; I am not aware of any thing else - I took a reference from Earle, and he had one from me; he referred me to Wilks and Minithorpe, on behalf of himself and Brown - they were both in the counting-house together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to Mr. Minithorpe for a single tittle of the character of Brown? A. I consider I requested the reference from them both; I went to Mr. Minithorpe with a note, which they wrote - the reference was quite satisfactory; Mr. Minithorpe told me Earle was in possession of a salmon fishery in Ireland - he did not say he was in possession of 5000l. a year, nor tell me the value of the fishery, nor any thing of the kind; he said he had a right of a salmon fishery - he did not say the Pickled Fish Company was sure to succeed; he gave me his opinion that, according to the outline, it might be productive - he did not say he was glad I had got into the Company's service; he said Earle was a man of property, but not that whether the Company succeeded or not, I was sure of my salary from him.</p>
               <p>Q. If Mr. Minithorpe has sworn he never told you that Earle had a salmon fishery in Ireland, that is not true? A. It is assertion against assertion; his assertion to me was, that he was a proprietor, or had a right of fishery on the coast of Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not understand from Mr. Minithorpe, from beginning to end, that Earle was a highly respectable man? A. I considered so, from his representing him as having a right of fishery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever tell you he believed Earle to be a very bad character? A. He told me he required from him 2000l. as a bonus for the secret of pickling fish, and likewise a capital to carry it on - this was a week or two after signing the agreement; he may have told me then that he began to suspect all was not right - the pots were fetched off the premises; he said he had given Mr. Bernal his opinion of Earle - I tasted some salmon in the warehouse; I may have told Earle it was a successful speculation - I have no doubt if there had been any thing real in it, I could have made it a very good thing in the quarter I was going; I searched for Brown repeatedly, after the bill was due - I did not include him in the indictment with Earle; I employed an attorney - I always intended to charge him with this offence; I was not told to do so in this Court - I have no recollection of it, and think I can swear I was not; Brown was not present when I gave the bill to Earle - Mr. Minithorpe might tell me I was giving a negociable security, and the face of it showed it to be so; he did not caution me against giving a negociable security - if he has sworn he did, it is assertion against assertion.</p>

            . I live in Allen-street, Lambeth. I received this bill at the warehouse, in St. Mary's-hill -Mr. Forty, the clerk to Earle and Brown, gave it to me, to inquire into the respectability of the party; I think Brown was on the premises at the time, but do not think he was present - I made inquiry, and found it was a very good one; I then appointed with Brown to meet me to endorse it, and he endorsed it at the Ship public-house, Charing-cross; I got it discounted in Vinegar-yard, Drury-lane, the same day - it was paid over to me for building an oven for the cure of pickled fish; my demand was 52l. 13s. - Earle gave me the order to build the oven- 2l. 13s. 6d. was left unpaid when Brown endorsed the bill; I was to give him 20l. out, if he gave me security which I should approve of for the 20l. and my balance - as I did not approve of the security he tendered, I kept the 20l. towards my account; the oven was to be 45l., but extra work came to 7l. 13s.; all Brown ordered was an extra boiler - I have not received the 2l. 13s.; I called at the warehouse twice afterwards, and saw three or four dozen pots - I saw Earle there, and saw Brown repeatedly, because he used to come after me, for this 20l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are the only person receiving benefit from the bill? A. I received it in a payment; Mr. Moses, of Vinegar-yard, discounted it for me - I have done work for him - when I get a hill I am obliged to discount it where I can; Moses gave me 48l. for it, which was 2l. for three months' interest, and I was glad to get it at that rate - Brown was repeatedly backwards and forwards; I was informed he was a partner; I had nothing to do with him till I had incurred a debt of 45l. with Earle; I saw him on the premises daily, but he gave me no directions; I do not think he was in the office when I received the bill from Forty - he wanted me to get the bill back again three or four days after I got it, and to arrest Earle; he said he found Earle had got no money, and if he could get him arrested he should he able to pay Mr. Noble his portion of the rent, and should be able to come in and carry on the business on his own account, and that he suspected Earle was deceiving the concern; that he had deceived him, and misrepresented the whole thing - that he was desirous to pay me - he never said he believed Earle to be a scoundrel and a swindler - what he said about Earle was when he applied to me for the 20l.</p>

             I was at St. Mary's-hill shortly after the bill was given - the warehouse was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160049"></xptr>entirely closed early in October; I have seen none of the party since, except in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The person who represented to you that he had 15,000l. worth of salmon fishery, was tried last Session? A. I never stated that he said so - I did not tell Price it would be a thriving concern; I did not express an opinion about it - I told him Earle told me he was proprietor of a salmon fishery, not that he was so; I never expressed an opinion whether it would be a successful company or not - I was not paid for drawing the agreement; I saw the inutility of applying to any body for it - I do not know where Brown or Earle lived; Earle lived in Chapel-street during part of the transaction - I had done business for him about a month before this transaction; that was all I knew of him.</p>

On the 11th of August, 1831, by appointment, Brown waited on me for the purpose of taking those premises, on behalf of himself and a company, representing Earle as one of the partners; he said there were some noblemen, but they could not be named in the agreement, and if the premises were taken, it would be in the name of

             - he referred me to Mr. Pilling, of Red Lion-square; I was waited upon next day by Brown and Earle, and let them the premises, as yearly tenants, subject to six months' notice - they entered without making a deposit; the premises were open till I distrained some goods of Mr. Burnell's, the morning they were brought in; Brown had promised to pay me the rent, but did not, and he recommended me to distrain - he was present when the goods were distrained; Mr. Burnell satisfied me, and I got Brown to give me possession of the premises by a written order -Brown had represented to me that they were carrying on a very extensive business, and that he had employed Price as a traveller, at 6l. a week, and in the event of the business turning out profitable, he was to have 7 1/2 percent., and that Price had lodged a bill with him as a collateral security for certain trusts - that he had paid that bill away to Mr. Walker for an oven, in consequence of Walker dunning him, to keep him quiet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are a commission-agent, I presume? A. Acting by power of attorney; Mr. Burnell paid me the rent, and took the goods - Brown did not recommend me to distrain till after I could not get the rent- he had promised to pay me on the 29th; he then said there was a difference between him and his partner, and he feared I should not get it without distraining - I never saw him afterwards; the goods were going - a person on the premises told me of it, and I distrained; Brown told me long before the 29th, that he found Earle had deceived him - it was half a quarter's rent, and became due on the 29th; Brown told me he should not sign the articles of partnership till he was satisfied respecting Earle, and he thought he was a very bad character; he said,"I will pay your rent at any rate" - he afterwards came, and said he feared I must take my course; he said the proposals of Earle, and what had taken place latterly, was certainly very different to what he understood.</p>

            . I live in Wynyatt-street, Goswell-road. I know Brown as Earle's partner, and on the 15th of September I saw Earle give

             the bill, at No. 20, Finsbury-place, for the purpose of inquiring whether it was the acceptance of Mr. Tibbutt; after that Earle asked Brown what he had done with it - Brown said he had returned it to Mr. Price, and that Price had cancelled the agreement; I repeatedly heard this conversation between them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q, Are you married? A. Yes - my husband is alive; I do not live with him - I was living at Finsbury-place at the time, with Earle, on the first floor; my husband was living in Holborn at the time - I have two children by him: I first went to live at Finsbury-place on the 14th of September; my youngest child was then nine months old - I took that with me; Earle would not permit me to come forward on his trial - he said I should not be mixed up with public business, and it is against his wish that I come now, but I am subpoenaed, and am obliged to come.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing to prevent your coming forward on Earle's trial? A. Yes; I am not obliged to state what.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Burnell, a potter and glass-seller. Brown came and gave us an order for some pots, in company with Earle, the latter end of July or the beginning of August; we were to furnish about 50l. worth of pots a week: on the 6th of October pots amounting to 51l. 0s. 8d. were delivered at the warehouse - some samples had been delivered before; we have never been paid for them - neither Brown nor Earle were to be met with when I delivered them - they had not been there three hours before I received information, and fetched them away - neither Brown nor Earle have applied for them since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What number would come to 51l.? A. About ninety dozen of various sizes; it took about six weeks to execute the order - Brown came repeatedly, to know when it would be executed; the last time was about a week before; he did not come to Mr. Burnell, and complain that Earle was doing wrong, and beg him to get the pots away; the information was not given by him, but by John Galloway: Brown was not on the premises when I received them back.</p>

Forty offered me this bill to get discounted - I kept it three or four days, and then returned it to him, in Brown's presence, at No. 32, St. Mary-at-hill, because they would not take what I offered for it; Forty afterwards brought it to me again - I went with him to Walker's; I then gave it to Forty, and think he gave it to Walker's clerk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you offer? A. They were to have 20l. in goods, and 30l. in cash - I should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160050"></xptr>have expected 2 1/2 per cent. commission; I asked for 5 per cent., nothing more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I declare most solemnly I was introduced to Earle in a speculation for a monument to his present Majesty - he was introduced to me as a man of property; he afterwards proposed to me to manage some premises, in Gray's Inn-lane, which Mr. Minithorpe has mentioned - that not going forward he said, "You are an active man, I should like to have you a partner in the fish concern;" that he had a fishery in Ireland, which cost him 15,000l. - I embarked in it with him, and from that the whole of this calumniation has come on me; I was innocently brought into it - I did not do a single act with a dishonourable motive, and if the prosecutors speak like men, they will say my conduct throughout was honest and upright - having been deceived by a scoundrel, I am attainted as a felon, without having committed (with humble submission) an act of felony: it is scarcely necessary to call witnesses to rebut the evidence, as most of the conversation between Price and me was before my own family, who might he supposed to be partial - the fish company was exploded in consequence of my finding out Earle - he took 150l. out of my pocket to pay for the fittings up; the instant I found my name was not in the agreement I said it was most ungentlemanly, for if I was a partner why was not my name in it - I never made any fraudulent representation to the prosecutor, nor any other person - my conduct was perfectly honourable.</p>

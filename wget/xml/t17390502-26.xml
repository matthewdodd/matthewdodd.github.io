            . I am a Watchman in Tyburn-Road. I was going my Rounds the 10th Day of April at Twelve at Night, and heard a Noise in the empty House, and I called my Brother Watchman to stand at the Door, while I went into the House. I found the Prisoner in the Garret, and the Lead and some Casements were by him. As soon as he saw me, he collered me, and asked me what Business I had there. Then he pushed by me, and ran down Stairs into the Cellar, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173905020012"></xptr> from thence up another Pair of Stairs and hid himself in a Closet, where we found him, and he told us be intended to do all the Mischief he could that Night. The Lead and four Casements were rolled up, ready to be carry'd away.</p>

            . I was called to assist my Brother Watchman, and stood at the Cellar Door. The Prisoner came down Stairs, and slipped thro' the Joists into the Cellar; but upon seeing my Lanthorn he run up Stairs and hid himself in a Closer, where we found him. When we seized him, he told us, he had been that Night with the Overseers of the Parish, and they would not allow him any Thing for his Subsistance, so his Design was to do all the Mischief he could that Night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lay two Nights before in the House; he knows I did, and had a Fire there; for I had no Money to pay for a Lodging, and they knew that I was in the House. There was a Noise in the House; (I heard it:) so they came in, and took me away for the Sake of Twenty Shillings; which the Parish allows, for every Person they can convict. When they attempted to take me away, I scuffled with them, as well as I could, and in the Scuffle I tumbled down Stairs.</p>
               <p>Ponsir. I did give him Leave to lye in the next House, and another Man was with him, but not in the House where he was taken.</p>
               <p>Jury. This Man has been a Parishioner in that very Parish for some Years, and has served Offices in the Parish. He kept a Publick House in this very House a great While, but he is now lame and reduced so low, that one of our Jury-Men at a Club-Feast made a Collection for him, to keep him from Starving. The Parish ought to do something for him. The Court censured the Parish's ill Usage of the Prisoner. <rs id="t17390502-26-verdict130" type="verdictDescription">

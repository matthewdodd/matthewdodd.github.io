                  </hi>. I keep the Bridge-house tavern, Vauxhall. The pri<lb></lb>soner is a waterman, and had been in the habit of coming to my house before this happened-about a month or six weeks before this, I refused him permission to enter my parlour—when the company left the parlour on that occasion, he was the last that left—I went in to put the lights out, and he said, "I will mark you for this"—on the night of the 26th of August, about ten minutes before eleven o'clock, he came to my house in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, accompanied by two females—he came into the bar, then went into the tap-room, and went out to the females, wishing them to come out—I went and told him he could have what he liked at the bar, or take any thing outside, but I could not admit him at that hour in the evening—he directly caught hold of one of the girls, who had got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and tried to pull her past me—I stepped between him and the girl, as he had hold of her arm, between my door-post and the door—he was behind me, pulling her—he had got over the threshold—I put myself between them to prevent them coming in—he then let loose of the girl's arm, and struck</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Eldon-place, Vaux<lb></lb>hall, within one hundred yards of the prosecutor. I examined him about eleven o'clock, on the Sunday night in question—I found an incised wound on the scalp, about three inches long, and a small punctured wound, about an inch from it, which might have been done by the nails on the instrument—in my judgment this is an instrument that would inflict an injury of that description—there was a great deal of blood from the wound, and some on the instrument—a blow from such an instrument would be very likely to produce a dangerous wound—I attended him about ten days, or a fortnight—the blow must have been inflicted with considerable force—the scalp was divided, almost to the bone.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother at 2, Tavistock-court, Covent Garden—she keeps a coffee-shop there—on Tuesday, 7th February, between 7 and 8 in the morning the prisoner came in for a cup of tea and a roll, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a half-crown—I put it in my pocket—there was no other half-crown there—I took it out about five minutes after-wards and found it was bad—on the following Thursday, the 9th, she came again and asked for the same—I recognized her immediately, and waited to see what she would give me—she gave me a half-crown—I detected it at once and said, "You were here last Tuesday morning and gave me a bad half-crown, and you are here again this morning and have given me another"—she said, "Yes, I know I was here last Tuesday, and did give you a bad half-crown"—I sent for one of the market-beadles and gave her in custody with the half-crown.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Totness Castle beer-house, Highgate New Town—on Saturday night, 11th December, about 11.51 the prisoner was in my house—he was very noisy and quarrelsome in front of the bar—I went round to him and told him to be quiet—I gave him a little push and sent him on to a form in front of the bar—he still kept on making a noise and disturbance—I told him if he was not quiet I should put him out, and I oponed the front door—he said, "I don't want any putting out; I will walk out"—ho walked out at that door and went round to a second door—I put the second compartment door to, and he forced it open three or four times and nearly knocked me backwards in so doing—I told him if he was not quiet I should have him locked up—by that time it was very nearly 12 o'clock, and I was trying to get my customers out—I was leaning on the edge of the door, with my left side outside, and I felt as if blood was running from my clothes—the prisoner had made use of the expression, "Take that, you b——"—I did not feel anything at the moment; but afterwards felt the blood running between my legs—after I had got the customers all out of the house I began to feel very faint and weak, I unbuttoned my waistcoat and found that I was stabbed on the left side—I sent for the police, and Dr. Lucy came to me—the cut had gone through my jacket, waistcoat, my outer shirt, and my flannel shirt, and just</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife—on the night of 11th December the prisoner was in our house—there was some disturbance, and my husband went round to quiet it—the prisoner was quarrelling with a woman—my husband said to him, "Sheen, you must be quiet, for you hinder me in my business the whole evening"—he made use of abusive language, and Harvey gave him a push and pushed him on to a seat in front of the bar—he got up and still continued his abuse, and Harvey gave him another push and told him he had had enough of his nonsense and he must go out—he then stood up and said, "My boy, this is the first time you and I ever had a quarrel, and it shall be your last"—Harvey then said, "Now, out you go—he said, "I don't want you to put me out, I can walk out," and he did so—upon that Harvey closed the door and put the table against it, and the prisoner came round to the second door and forced it open—Harvey was standing behind it, and it pushed him with great violence against the steps—he went to the door and said, "Sheen, if you don't be quiet and go home I shall have you locked up"—he forced the door open once or twice after that, and the last time I saw his hand strike at Harvey with great violence; but I did not see any weapon—I went to the door, and he had gone round the corner—I saw that my husband was wounded—the prisoner had been drinking; but he had recovered from the little beer that he had had.</p>

I am a surgeon, of No. 1, Junction Road, Upper Holloway—about 12.30, on 11th December, I was called to the prosecutor—he was slightly faint—his under linen was saturated with blood—he had a wound in the left side, about 2 in. in extent, 1 in. in depth, and between 5 and 6 in. below the left nipple, and 2 in. from the medial line of the body, exposing the deep muscles—there was not much hemor<lb></lb>rhage, no large vessels being divided—the wound was brought together by a suture—it healed very rapidly—I attended him for about a fortnight—he is now out of danger—it was a wound that might have been produced by the large blade of an ordinary pocket-knife—it was below the region of the heart.</p>

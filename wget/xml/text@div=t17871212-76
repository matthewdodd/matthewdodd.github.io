               <p>Did any body go with you? - I told him I did not think it was material; but that I would call upon a friend and take him along with me; I called on a person, he was just at dinner, and as his people were from home, he could not go; the prisoner and me went to Bartholomew-close, to my brother-in-law's, he was at home, I went to the house, and the prisoner stood at a little garden gate; he run away, I went after him, he got there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before me; I then sent for a constable and had his box opened, I found nothing of my property in his box, but this razor and a snuff-box; they were mine clearly.</p>

               <p>Are there any marks on either of them? - Yes, there are.</p>
               <p>(Produced.)</p>
               <p>Court. By what mark do you know the razor or the snuff-box to be yours? - I know the razor to be mine, by the name upon it, I had four, but they are gone.</p>
               <p>What name is upon the razor? - Pearson; it is a French razor.</p>
               <p>But he makes a great many besides yours? - Yes, he does.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there any private mark of yours upon it? - Yes, Sir, there is a cross.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you buy it in Paris or in England? - I bought four of them in a case; I know the snuff-box by having it in my compting-house these two years past, with snuff in it; I never missed it till I found it in his box.</p>
               <p>There is no particular mark upon it? - There was a particular scented snuff in it; it was in it when it was found.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you suspect this boy before? - I suspected he had wronged me.</p>
               <p>How could you wish to keep him? - Because I was not provided.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120090"></xptr>Court. What did he say when these things were found in his box? - He said the razor was given him by a French gentleman, that I had in my house.</p>
               <p>Did he mention the name? - Yes, his name is La Belmontier; he has varied in that account; he then said he found the razor among some rubbish, (that was to one of my servants, not to myself.)</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing about the snuffbox? - He said he looked upon it as of no consequence, and he took it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Prisoner's Counsel. This man whom you suspected so much as a thief, when he gave you warning, and told you, he was going to learn a trade, I believe he told you who he was going to live with? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>You asked him to stay with you? - Yes, it was only a few days before.</p>
               <p>How came you to desire him to remain in your service till you got a servant? - I could not do the employment I wanted them to do; I suspected him a few days before.</p>
               <p>How long did he continue with you after he gave you warning? - There was a month's warning; he continued all that time, and about a fortnight.</p>

               <p>Was that before the officers came in from the Custom-house or Excise? - No, it was after; I do not know that any officer of the excise came in at all.</p>
               <p>What, were they Custom-house officers? - I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Do you not recollect the day? - It is a small occurrence, having five hundred or six hundred pounds seized.</p>
               <p>The young man was a servant in the house then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If he is convicted of your petit larceny, he cannot be a witness? - I do not know that it it will come to trial.</p>
               <p>What, is it made up? - No.</p>
               <p>It is nicely contrived, the old razor and the tin box, a very clever thing; you know if he is convicted, the crown cannot call him as a witness? - I do not know that, if it is so, it is my own bringing on.</p>
               <p>Is not it so as I say? - It is not.</p>
               <p>Then will you give us some satisfaction how you could desire a man to stay six weeks in your house? - It was only two days before that that he told me he could not stay, he was not going to learn any trade at all, I can swear that, and I will call a person that will prove it; Mr. Keene told me so himself.</p>
               <p>How long had you missed this razor before? - I had missed four of them for nine weeks.</p>
               <p>There is a mark? - Yes; long before they were taken out of the box; I put the same mark on them all when I sent them to be set.</p>
               <p>Jury. What, was it done with a knife? - I cannot tell; it was a knife or fork.</p>
               <p>Now as to the tin box, there is no mark upon that? - I know it to be mine from the scent of the snuff, from having it a long time in my possession.</p>
               <p>The man told you where his box was? - He told me it was in Fann-street, but not where.</p>
               <p>And he desired you to have somebody with you? - It did not strike me as odd in him, but that led me to get somebody with me.</p>
               <p>The constable was present I believe? - The woman of the house was there.</p>
               <p>How many days before you went to search this box had the officers of the customs been at your house? - Six weeks or more.</p>
               <p>And yet if he would have staid, you would have kept him? - No, only till I had provided myself with a servant, which was to have been in a few days; I engaged a servant.</p>
               <p>Are any of your servants here? - Yes, several of them.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to call any of them? - They can be no evidence for me at all; they were not present when I took him up.</p>
               <p>Have you never declared you would not prosecute him if you did not suspect he would be a witness against you? - Never.</p>
               <p>You have never said so? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you never said that all you wanted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178712120091"></xptr>was to confine him till the cause in the Exchequer was over? - No, never, clearly, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you never did? - I never did.</p>
               <p>In no way at all? - No, I never declared that.</p>

               <p>I searched the prisoner's box, the gentleman picked the things out of the box himself; I saw them found.</p>

               <p>Did he say how he came by them? - Nothing particular that I can remember.</p>

               <p>You are sure of that? - I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Then he did not say of the tin box that he had taken that, because he thought it of no value? - No, I did not hear him say so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. What are you? - I am a constable; my house is facing where the box was, and being so handy he sent for me.</p>
               <p>Who gave you the key of the box; who was present? - Mr. Keene was present; I did not see them open it, but I found it open when I went into the room, the lid was put up, I was behind the prosecutor about a yard.</p>
               <p>You did not see the lid lifted up? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Where was the lad? - He went up with his master and me both.</p>

               <p>Do you mean that the box was open before the prisoner went into the room? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Had he time enough to open it, before you went into the room? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>If I understand you right, the prosecutor and the prisoner went in first, and Mr. Keene and you after? - They were close together, not a minute difference.</p>
               <p>Then he had no opportunity of opening the box without his master? - None that I saw.</p>
               <p>Where did you see the prisoner first when you was sent for? - In the house where he lodged, he was below stairs in the house when I went in.</p>

               <p>Was you present when the box was searched? - No, I was in the kitchen talking to his master's brother-in-law; Mr. Read, the constable, and this young man all went up together; he came without any authority, he had no warrant to search my house at all.</p>
               <p>When did your wife give the young man the key of the room? - She gave it to the gentlemen when they went up to search.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect that perfectly? - I believe she might give it him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Do you know Mr. Read? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear him say any thing about this prosecution? - No, never nothing of the kind.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I mean to apply to the Court for a copy of the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any witnesses to prove any declaration of this kind? - The mischief of it is, they are all servants to Mr. Read.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am still a servant to Mr. Read.</p>
               <p>You must speak the truth; did you ever hear your master make any declarations about this young man? - I heard him say, that he thought it was the prisoner that had informed.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing about his being a witness at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing about confining him? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. You have heard him say that he was the informer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I shall give you a copy of the indictment; there is a strong circumstance in Mr. Keene's evidence, the wife delivering they key to persons who came to search, which ought to have removed from Mr. Read's mind, all impression of the prisoner's having gone before him, and which he ought to have stated in his evidence to the Court.</p>
               <p>Tried by the London Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>

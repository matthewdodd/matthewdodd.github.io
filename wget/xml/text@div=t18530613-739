                  </hi>. I was at Wanstead Church on 6th June, about half-past 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I was looking at the review—I had a watch in the right pocket of the waistcoat I have on—there was a chain to it—I felt a person pull my chain—there were many people near me—I put my hand to my pocket, and my watch was gone—I saw it in the hands of the prisoner—it was broken from the chain—I charged him with having it, and laid hold of him—my father was with me, and came and held him—I did not see what became of the watch after it was in the prisoner's hands—I saw somebody pick it up, and give it to my father—I do not know how it came to the ground—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

I was at Wanstead, at the review—about half-past 4 o'clock in the afternoon my son called out about his watch—I laid hold of the prisoner till a policeman came—while holding him, a person behind said, "What watch is this?" and put it into my hand—this is the same watch—I gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

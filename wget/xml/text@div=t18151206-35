            . I am partner of Mr. Sweeney's. I have nothing to do with the proprietorship of the house. At about twenty minutes before eleven in the night of the 15th of November, I was at work in the dye house; I heard the door bang, upon which I went forward into the street, and saw two or three men with a carpet, which they immediately, dropped, and ran away. That carpet was Mr. Sweeney's. Mr. and Mrs. Sweeney were in bed. I called Haines, who was at work with me; I did not run after these people; I waited a minute or so, and the prisoner passed me and went into the shop door way, and came out again directly; I said here is one of them, and he said, yes, certianly I am one of them; take care of me now you have got me. I did so, and delivered him to the watchman: I am not sure he was one of those who had hold of the carpet.</p>
               <p>Carpet produced and sworn to by the prosecutor Sweeney.</p>

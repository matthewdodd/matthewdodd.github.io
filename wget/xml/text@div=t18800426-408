                  </hi>. I am a German, and came to this country in 1876—I went as lady's-maid to Mrs. Otway, of 13, Grosvenor Square, about July, 1876—the defendant had been tutor to her youngest son—he was not so then, but he came to and fro; he did not live in the house—a man named Vincent was the butler, and in August, 1878, his changing a cheque at Mrs. Loderhose's became known to Mrs. Otway, and the defendant made inquiries about it—I had nothing to do with removing a cheque from Mrs.</p>

               <p>Otway's cheque-book—I have never tampered with her cheque-book, but sometimes I was asked to fetch it—I never tore blank cheques from it and gave them to Vincent—it was discovered while Vincent was in the service that he had been in prison—the defendant reported that Madame Loder<lb></lb>hose had a letter which I delivered by Vincent, asking her to cash a cheque and retain 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me—I said that I could not believe that my writing could be forged, and I should like to see it, as I thought there must be a mistake—I insisted on the letter being produced, but I never saw it—I can swear 100 times over that I never wrote such a letter—I gave an ex<lb></lb>planation to Mrs. Otway, and she continued me in her service—I remained there till April, 1879, and then went into Lady Johnson's service, in Belgrave Square, to whom Mrs. Otway gave me a character—a day or two before I went to Lady Johnson's a detective came to me and asked me to go to Bow Street and make a deposition against Vincent, and I did so—in August last I went into Lady Dunraven's service, and remained there till November—I then went to the lady I am with now, in Warminster—Mrs. Colby is not a relation of mine, but a very great friend; she sent me the letter—this letter is the defendant's writing—this is the first opportunity I have had of going into the witness-box and denying complicity with Vincent—Mrs. Otway made me presents of money and other things, and I am wearing a brooch which she gave me—I never stole any money of hen—it is not true that I robbed her of hundreds of pounds—in consequence of hearing rumours of what Vincent alleged against me I wrote to Mrs. Otway, and received this answer of 17th March (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have entered upon the prosecution simply to. put a stop to these slanders; I cannot stop in any situation if they go on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know Vincent's writing—these three letters (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) are very much like his writing, but I cannot say that they are his—there was an inquiry at Bow Street about these matters in July or August, 1879—I had a summons, and gave evidence—the defendant did not go there, to my knowledge—I know that he goes to and fro on business matters to Capt. Otway's, who is a gentleman of fortune, of Grosvenor Square and Otway Towers—Mrs. Loderhose and I have had words because I wanted the letter—she is a German—she told me that the letter about the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in German—Vincent does not speak German.</p>

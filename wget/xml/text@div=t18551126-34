                  </hi>. I am a single woman, and live at No. 28, Great Chart-street, Hoxton—I am an unfortunate girl—I have known the prisoner from childhood. On Tuesday night, 23rd Oct., about 11 o'clock, I was at the Eagle Tavern, City-road—I was in company with the prisoner, and went to the bar and had a glass of brandy and water with him—I left the bar and went into the front coffee room—I left the prisoner at the bar, and bid him good night—I did not stay in the coffee room more than two minutes—I then came out in company with a gentleman who I had met there, the prisoner was still at the bar, and as I was going out, he said, "Is that gentleman going to see you home?"—I said, "He is going part of the way"—he said, "If you allow that gentleman to go home with you, I will kick your——"—I took no notice, but bid him good night, and walked away with the gentleman—I did not see the prisoner say more that night—about 4 o'clock the following afternoon he came to my apart<lb></lb>ment in Great Chart-street—I was alone—he came into the room, locked the door after him, and said he had bad news for me—I asked him what it was—he appeared very agitated—he pulled a knife out of his pocket and opened it, and said, as I had left him on the previous evening he intended to do for me—he said he would cut my throat, and he held up the knife—I said, "Don't be so ridiculous, don't be so silly; I will do anything for you if you won't be so silly"—I believe he had been drinking, but as he had the knife open, and said he would cut my throat, of course, I expected he in<lb></lb>tended to do so, and I put up my hand, and by so doing the knife out my finger—he took hold of me with his left hand, at the top of my dress—that was at the time I lifted up my hand—he had the knife in his right hand, holding it up, and I put up my hand and it cut my finger—he did not do anything with the knife, further than cut my finger with it—it was cut across, just at the top—it is getting perfectly well now.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185511260044"></xptr>
               <p>Mrs. Wellam, do come up stairs!"—my landlord and landlady both came up stairs—I opened the door for them—they interfered, and the prisoner went out of the room—he did not say anything before he went, he had not time—the landlord compelled him to leave the room immediately—when he got outside, he said, "Allow me to speak to her, I will not leave the house without speaking to her," and as my finger was bleeding, and I was frightened, I said, "Leave the house; I will never speak to you again "—he was talking to the landlord for some minutes, and saying, "Do ask her if she will speak to me; do let me see her."</p>

On the 7th of March, about a quarter-past seven o'clock, I went out, leaving my box locked, and the key in my pocket - I came back about six in the evening, and the prisoner was missing; my box was broken open, and my clothes gone - he never returned.</p>
               <p>HONOR CULLIS. I slept in the next room to the prosecutor, who is apprenticed to my husband - it is usual for the lodger who last left the room to bring the key into our room; the prisoner brought it between eight and nine o'clock on the 7th of March - I put it on the shelf for about six hours; when I went to make the bed, I found a bed-screw under the quilt - the box appeared to have been broken open with that.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILLIAMS. On the 31st of March I apprehended the prisoner and another boy who lodged in this room - they were discharged; Blease came to my house next morning, when I was out; he came a second time, and said he had come about the clothes - I said, "I thought you had done with that;" he said he came to tell me where they were, that he was the party who stole them, and said he did not confess at the office as he did not wish to implicate an innocent young man, and he would take me to where they were pawned, in the name of Smith - I went with him, and there we found them; he has got a bad father, but I believe bears a good character himself.</p>

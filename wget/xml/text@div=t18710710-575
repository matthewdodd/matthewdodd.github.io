                  </hi>. I live at 4, Dorrington Cottages, Camberwell Road, Peckham, and am a sea captain—I have known the prisoner about nine months—my brother-in-law, James Austin, introduced me to him—he had known him before that—at that time I was engaged in purchasing guns for the French Government—the agents for the French Government, at</p>

               <p>that time, were Shroeder &amp; Schiller—I employed the prisoner to go to the gun makers, and ask them if they had guns for sale, and went myself afterwards to inspect and buy them—I paid the money myself to the gun makers—I did not make any arrangement with the prisoner as to what he was to be paid for the trouble he had in finding out these guns—I gave him money—I saw the prisoner two or three days before, and he said he was very miserable, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was in a very bad position at the time, and I did not make any contract or agreement with him—I said "You had better work, so that you shall not come on me for money always"—then it was agreed he should go to the gun makers, and look for guns, as I kept him, and gave him enough to live, and his family—I have given him more than 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., during the time I have known him—when I made his acquaintance, he was in a furnished house, and I advanced him money to take the house, and I became answerable for the furniture in the house—I paid for thirty guns that were found by the prisoner—I myself bought 10,000 guns, perhaps, or more, and 6,000,000 cartridges—the prisoner had nothing to do with those 10,000—I have a father and brother carrying on business at Bordeaux, as Gallet &amp; Co, wine merchants—I have been agent for them since I have been in England—I employed the prisoner as agent for the sale of those wines—amongst other persons, some wine was supplied to Mr. Whittet, of the Horns, Kennington, to the amount of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I never gave the prisoner any authority to endorse my name on cheques, or to sign receipts in my name—if he received money on my behalf, it was his duty to bring it to me—the endorsement on this cheque is not in my handwriting—I did not authorize any person to write my name on the back of it—these two receipts are in the prisoner's hand<lb></lb>writing—when I received money from the prisoner I gave him receipts to take to the customers—once or twice I gave him a receipted invoice, to take to persons who did not know me, and he got the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> All the business the prisoner did for me was to find thirty guns—that is as to the guns—he sold, perhaps, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of mine in five months for me—that is all that he did, and I mean to tell the Jury that I paid him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not keep a banking account—I kept eight persons for nine months—I did not pay it by cheque—I kept his family during nine months—I have not any written account of the moneys I have paid him—I never knew the prisoner before he was introduced to me—I don't say that I paid him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, but I kept him and his family during nine months, and that cost me 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I arrive at that by guess work—I have no written entry—when charity is given, no receipts are required or demanded—there was no necessity for an intermediate party to buy the guns, but he was a man who could work, and he asked me every day for money without working for it—I did not represent to Shroeder &amp; Schiller, or to anybody, that he was my partner—the wines came from my brother at Bordeaux, and sometimes from Shroeder &amp; Schiller, who are wine merchants also—I am quite sure I received wines from my brother—I don't know that the prisoner bought eight hundred guns from Tate &amp; Salby—he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Griffiths—he did not receive 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission, and give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't recollect that he handed me any commission<lb></lb>money—I can't say that the prisoner purchased two hundred and sixty-eight guns from Messrs. Griffiths &amp; Co.—I don't know—I can't say that the prisoner received any money from them as commission; as far as I am con<lb></lb>cerned, I have done business for those gentlemen, and I received my com<lb></lb>mission</p>

               <p>—I don't know whether he received any commission or not—I can't swear that he did not receive it, because I don't know—this is the book I keep, where is the entry of the thirty guns bought for Shroeder &amp; Schiller—for the wine I have another—I have no book which shows the number of arms I inspected—I have no entry of the ten thousand guns I inspected, as I was not the purchaser of those guns; I was simply the agent for Shroeder &amp; Schiller—I have no document or paper to show relative to those ten thousand guns—I have certificates to show that I was the inspector for the Gironde &amp; Brittany—the book would not show the number of guns inspected—I have my books relating to the money transactions in the wine trade—this is one, that is the only one I have—I don't consider the wine business my business—I only did it for a month—I only carried it on intermediately, till I should have my own business established.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I met the prisoner at the house of my brother-in-law, Mr. Austin, a solicitor—it was not Mr. Austin who first introduced the prisoner to me—I had been in Australia, and my wife had been living in Mr. Austin's family, and she introduced the prisoner formally to me, saying "They are an honest family" and so on—when I saw him first he told me he had not eaten anything for forty-eight hours, and I gave him the business to pro<lb></lb>vide him with something to do—as inspector of theae 10,000 guns I simply saw them, and then reported upon them to Shroeder &amp; Schiller—I was in England in April and May.</p>

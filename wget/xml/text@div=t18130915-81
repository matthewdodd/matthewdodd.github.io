               <p>Q. Did you at any time miss any curled hair - A. Yes, not till I got the hair merchan'ts accompt.</p>
               <p>Q. What steps did you take to find out who had stolen the curled hair - A. I consulted the prisoner, and then I went to Bow-street; I consulted the prisoner, and desired him not to let it be known.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your suspicion at last fall upon the prisoner - A. Not before I received information. The prisoner's house is next door to mine; his yard is in a direct line to mine, with a wall about seventeen feet high.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner carry on any business with your permission - A. Certainly he did, and I wished him to do it; I had a good opinion of him; he was my confidential man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you recollect any body going out of your house on the very day that the prisoner desired you to mark the hair - A. On the night it was stolen I certainly did observe one of the women go out bulky.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give you the hair cloth for that purpose - A. He did; from Mr. M'Kenzie's premises into his own; he handed it over the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hand over the quantity that you wanted, or a larger quantity - A. A larger quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you by his desire cut off for the work - A. Four yards and a half, which covered the seats of six chairs; I cut it off on the prisoner's premises in the back-house; I took the remainder into his parlour, because it should not lay in the back-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had given information to the prosecutors were you shewn the hair-cloth again - A. I said I should know it again by some marks that were on it; it was a chalk mark that I found on it. This is the hair-cloth that was fetched from Mr. M'Kenzie's press, and shewn me; it is in small pieces now; it has the marks on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were these chairs for - A. A customer of the prisoner's; I fetched them in, and took them back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you receive the brass nail - A. I received one thousand over the wall, by Mr. Best; they were used when they were wanted for this job; the covering of the chairs took about a day; this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150049"></xptr>was about the middle of June; it was handed over to me in the middle of the day.</p>

I have seen curled-hair, canvas, and tick, put over the wall by Mr. Best; I cannot say what the quantity was; there was no secrecy in this a I know off, all the work people could see it publicly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. to M'Kenzie. The prisoner, by your consent, worked for himself - A. Yes, and we let him have articles at prime cost, either upon credit or ready money, which he chosed; but he was to accompt to me or my partner, and to get the clerk to book it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is your partner here - A. Yes.</p>

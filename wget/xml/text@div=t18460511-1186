                  </hi>. I am assistant in the shop of Mr. William White and three others, of Christ Church, Surrey—between four and five o'clock on the 30th of April the prisoners came into the shop to look at black hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs—I brought them some—both satin and silk—after looking at them a few minutes, they opened the silk ones and covered those on the counter with them, and I saw the woman put her hand and take the satin ones and put them in her lap—the man put his hand and took them of her—I said, "Give me those handkerchiefs you have got"—the woman gave them to me—I then missed some of the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. handkerchiefs—the man was then walking out, and had some handkerchiefs in his pocket—I told the woman of it—she denied it—the man quickened his pace, and he went out—I told Mr. Foster, and he went after him—he was not brought back—nor the handkerchiefs—there had been no one else there between my missing the handkerchiefs and the going away—I am sure I saw the silk ones safe while he was there, and I missed them when he was gone—I am quite sure I saw the woman's hand draw the satin handkerchiefs from the counter—there is a ridge four inches high which it was quite impossible for them to fall over, and I saw the man move his hand as if to take them from the woman—I told the woman she had some</p>

               <p>satin handkerchiefs and to give them to me—she hesitated a little and moved—I said, "You have got them, give them to me"—and she did—she had not given them to the man—as soon as I saw the man move his hand I spoke, and she gave them up—she said they were too expensive for her.</p>

MELLOR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When she came in she stated she wanted to look at some handkerchiefs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, she bought one handker<lb></lb>chief and a skein of silk—she left half-a-sovereign—there were several persons in the shop—it is a large sbop—there are persons generally passing to and fro—we have a great many pieces of handkerchiefs, but these were all black—three persons walk the shop to watch—both the prisoners sat down—the man sat with his face to me when he came in the shop—I did not see his back till he was leaving—he was there about ten minutes—they were in close conversation and then they chose one handkerchief—I think it is impossible that a handkerchief can slip off the counter into a person's lap—when I told the woman she had some handkerchiefs, she said, "Have I; no, I have not"—I cannot be certain whether I said before the magistrate that she said "No, I have not"—she did not band them back till I asked her the second time—they were on her lap as she was sitting down—I should say any person walking by could not see them—the prisoners were sitting close together, side by side—I had only that one box of handkerchiefs out—I cannot say how many parcels of handkerchiefs were in it—I had the bundle of handkerchiefs in my hand that the man carried out—I missed them in one minute—the prisoners were at the lower counter, almost close to the door—when the male prisoner turned round, I saw them in his pocket—they were folded in a square—not in a paper—they appeared quite the size of what I missed, and folded in the same way—they looked like mine, and I missed them not a minute before—I did not cry, "Stop thief,"—I called the shop walker and told him—I feel sure he had not the handkerchiefs in his pocket when he came into the shop—his pockets were in front of his coat—I saw the handerchiefs in his left coat pocket as he was rising—the handkerchiefs have not been found—the woman betrayed great anxiety and alarm, and repeatedly assured me her son would not have taken the handkerchiefs.</p>

                  </hi>. I was called, and went out to look for the male prisoner—I came back and saw the female prisoner in the shop—I said to her that Lovering had told me that her son had taken a piece of handkerchief in the shop—she protested it could not be so—I said, "Come out with me, and look for him"—she went out, and wanted me to go to her residence—I said, "No, come back; it is perhaps a mistake"—she then took out a half-sovereign, and said, "If he has taken one at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I will leave the half-sovereign to pay for it"—I said, "No, that is a proof of your guilt at once."</p>

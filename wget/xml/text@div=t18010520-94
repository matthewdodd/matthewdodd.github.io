            ; I lodged at that time at No. 6, Staple-inn-buildings, Holborn; the trial was put off till the next day, the 10th; I left my lodgings about a quarter after seven o'clock, to go to Wells and Co. my employers; when I got to the bottom of Castle-street, Holborn, turning into Cursitor-street, there was a hackney-coach standing with the door open; I passed it about ten yards, when a man came up to me in a tailor's dress; there came up immediately three or four more, who forced me into the coach; one of them said, d-n you, you are a deserter; I holloa'd murder, and made an alarm as loud as I could; Edwards was one who forced me into the coach; I think I recollect to have seen his face before; Edwards, and another in a tailor's dress, then got into the coach with me, and another on the outside; the coach drove immediately down Chancery-lane; I made seve<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200072"></xptr>ral attempts to run my head through the window, upon which Edwards stuffed something into my mouth; they stopped at the Prince of Wales public-house, in St. Georges's-fields, when I observed another man behind, Harry Rounce, who called himself a press-master; I heard his name afterwards; Edwards and the other man said, their press master was without; when we got to the Prince of Wales, he got down and came to the coach window, and shewed me a copy of the information, which he said he had received, that I was a deserter; there they called for something to drink, and asked me to drink with them; I said, I hoped they were not going to hurt me; and the press-master and Edwards assured me they were not if I was quiet; I thought it was policy to be quiet, and I drank some gin and water with them; they then proceeded to Mill-stairs, Rotherhithe, and went into a public-house, the Prince of Orange; we went into a private room.</p>

               <p>Q. When you were taken up in Castle-street, did you call murder loud enough for the coachman to hear you? - A. Yes; when we got to Rotherhithe, the coachman came into the room, and had a glass of spirits, which is the defendant in livery, John Welch; he stopped a considerable time in the room, and I told him where I lived, and asked the favour of him to let Wells and Co. know where I was confined; I told him I was a witness upon a trial, and I suspected that this was done to prevent my giving evidence; he gave me a blunt kind of answer, that he knew nothing about it, or something of that sort, and then went away; he was paid in the house. but I did not see him paid; the press-master, Edwards. and the other man in a tailor's dress, had some ham and bread, and some porter, and I had some with them; they begged I would have what I liked, for Government were at the expence of it; while we were eating and drinking, I reported to the press-master the particulars of the case; he said, from my hands and my appearance he did not believe I had ever been at sea; that was about eight o'clock; he said, if I would shew him a subpoena he would let me go without going to the regulating Captain; he remained about half an hour and then went away, saying he was going to the regulating Captain; Edwards also went away, and left me with one tailor; I forgot to mention that I said to Edwards I had seen him before, and believed I knew him; he said, I had not, for he had just come from sea; I saw no more of Edwards that day.</p>
               <p>Q. You got home in the evening of that day? - A. I did; about three weeks after the women were tried, I saw Welch standing against a toy-shop, opposite St. Dunstan's church, with the coach door open, ready to take up a fare; I said, well coachy, how are you; he seemed very much confused, and said, I thought I recollected you; I forgot to mention, that after I had been two hours at Rotherhithe, there came into the room where I was, a distiller's clerk, who happened to know one of my brothers, and I conveyed a letter by him to my brother, to let him know where I was; when I saw Welch at the toy-shop, I said, I suppose you recollect taking me to Rotherhithe the other morning; he said, yes, I do; I then asked him if he knew of those fellows that were with me; he said he had never seen them before; he then took up his fare and drove away; about three weeks or a month after that, I was going to Somerset-house, and saw him again near the same place; I was talking with Mr. Canner, the City Marshal, about this business; I called to him, and said, how are you, coachman, and he nodded his head; Mr. Canner immediately followed him, stopped his coach, and took him to the Mansion-house; A considerable time after that, I saw Edwards sitting on the rails in Smithfield, with a parcel of drovers; when he saw me, he ran across Smithfield as hard as he could run; two officers pursued him, and caught him; I am sure he is the man; I could swear to him from a thousand people if it were necessary.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp (Counsel for Welch.)</p>
               <p>Q.You did not see the coachman when you got into the coach? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor till he came into the room at Rotherhithe? -No.</p>
               <p>Q. And will you venture to swear that the defendant is the same man? - A. Yes, I will; they called him coachman, and he had a whip in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear to that Jury that he was the man who drove all the way from Castle-street to Rotherhithe? - A. It is impossible that I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not always tell you, at the public-house, at the toy-shop, and again near the same place, that he knew nothing at all of the other persons? - A. I did not ask him the question at Rotherhithe.</p>
               <p>Q.But upon both the other occasions he told you he did not know the men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see or hear of the fare being paid? - A. The man in the tailor's dress said he had paid the coachman half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Gilgrest's shop is in Fleet street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the coachman you belonged to that gentleman's shop? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet the place that you afterwards saw him in was in Fleet-street, near your master's shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is now in the service of Sir

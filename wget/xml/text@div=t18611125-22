               <p>that he had already cashed at the bank, to pay in in its stead, it was to save the trouble of carrying the silver to Brick-lane and back—he would take the amount from the cheque that he had already cashed, and put it into the station's remittance; for instance, we will say that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was retained at Brick-lane, he would take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the amount of the cheque to pay at Brick-lane, and place it in the station's remittance, leaving the amount at Brick-lane for the purpose of the wages—I think I have an entry which shows in what coin he was paid on these two particular days at the bank—this book will show it; it is the prisoner's entry—it shows the whole amount he was paid, but it does not specify the amount in specie that he received from Brick-lane.</p>

Welton was in my employ, and left a few months ago—Sullivan has been lately in my employ—I have lost a great quantity of squirrel-skins and tails—on the day before Easter, I received 500 skins, and on 21st missed fifty-two—I received information from Mendelson, and went with the police to the prisoners' house, 133, Petticoat-lane—the house was searched by the police, and 300 tails found which were my property—I had been before that, and told the prisoners that my boys had robbed me of skins and brought them there—the prisoners said they had not received any—I told them if they did not return me my goods I should be obliged to put it into the law's hands; but they denied every thing—I said nothing about tails.</p>

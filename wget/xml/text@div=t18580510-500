                  </hi>. I am a victualler, of No. 9, Bear Street, Leicester Square. My house was open at about 3 o'clock, in the morning of 28th July, and a party of men and women knocked at the door—I refused to let the women in, because it was late, and they remained outside—the prisoner and three others came in—there were no other people there, and there was no one assisting me—they called for some drink, and when it amounted to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I asked for some money; a watch was offered me, and I said, "Well, I will take that as security for what you have had to drink"—they went on, till it came to 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I lent them 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the whole reckoning then came to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; they had been drinking two hours—a few minutes afterwards, I missed one of them, and was suddenly seized by the neck from behind—(when I put the watch into my pocket, the prisoner said to the others, "Do you see?")—Iwas garroted from behind, and the prisoner and the others ran round the bar, and rushed at my pockets, and some of my money fell on the ground—I</p>

               <p>lost the watch and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., four sovereigns and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver, and the rest I picked up after they were gone—I became insensible, and when I came to myself, I found myself in a pool of blood, from my mouth and nose, and they were all gone—I do not think I was insensible more than a quarter of an hour—I believe they had gone out and spoken to the women, but I did not go from behind my bar—three of them have been convicted, but I do not remember seeing the third one; the police swore to him.</p>

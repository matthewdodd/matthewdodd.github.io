Between twelve o'clock and half-past, on the night of the 23rd of September, I was walking with two friends in Fleet-street—I saw the prisoner and four other women coming along the street—one of them laid hold of my friend, Mr. Parsons, and began pulling him about—I walked on a step or two, turned, and said, "Come along"—one of the women came forwards to spring on me—the prisoner rushed forwards, and took my pins from my breast—MR. Parsons was noticing the pins some time before—I gave the prisoner into custody two or three minutes after.</p>

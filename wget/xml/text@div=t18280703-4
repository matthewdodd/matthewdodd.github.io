               <p>JOHN MARK BIFIELD. I live with Mr. Tollitt, a fishmonger, of <placeName id="t18280703-4-crimeloc17">Orchard-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18280703-4-crimeloc17" type="placeName" value="Orchard-street"></interp>

On Sunday, the 1st of June, Mr. Tollitt went out of town, leaving me in charge of the business; about eleven o'clock, shortly after he was gone, Wight made up a tray of fish to send to customers in Edgware-road, Cumberland-place, and other places; I looked at his tray, and found he was going to send some fish to Harley-street, and told him some of it was not proper to go there, and removed part of it - he got into a passion, and told me I did not know how to send out fish, and was no fishmonger; I told him it was of no use to make a piece of work on a Sunday, and what complaint he had to make he had better make to master when he came home; about half an hour afterwards he went out with a tray, and came back in about an hour with a lobster; I asked where he brought it from - he said it was no business of mine; he put his tray down, and was going out - I asked where he was going - he said on his own pleasure; I said he had better stop and do his master's business first: he then attempted to pass by me, to go out - I pushed him back; he attempted to pass again, and I struck him with my hand - he said he would get a warrant for me on the Monday, and make me pay for it; I told him I would answer any charge, but to let it rest till Monday; I then took down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030007"></xptr>some fish to put in the ice, and while I was down in the ice-house, I heard him tell the servant that if I struck him again when I came up, he wished God might strike him dead if he did not stab me to the heart with the knife, which he then had in his hand, if he was hung to-morrow at Newgate for it. I came up into the shop in about ten minutes, and saw him standing by the block where we clean the fish, with the knife in his hand; he said to me,"You are no man - you are as frightened now as you can be, and look as white as a boiled maggot - you are no father of a child;" he then threw the knife which he held in his hand at me - it passed close by me: I jumped out of the way - it struck against the wainscot, and bounded back; I then saw him take another knife off the block, and thinking he was going to throw it at me, I ran to catch hold of him; he chopped at me, and cut me on the finger of my left-hand; I was trying to take it from him - he got hold of me, made a sudden turn, got out of my grasp, and stabbed me in the back with the same knife as he chopped me on the finger with; I said, "Oh! dear me - he has stabbed me!" I ran out of the shop, and as I ran across the road to the surgeon's, I felt something strike me on the legs, which I found to be a steel which was thrown after me; I did not see him throw it, I was in such a flurry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You resisted his progress in attempting to go out? A. Yes - I gave him the first push; I pushed him in, and then struck him. I am a weekly servant, and so is he - he is younger than I- I do not suppose he would attempt to fight me. I had heard him say he would stab me if I attempted to strike him; I saw blood on my hand, and on his nose - I cannot swear whether there was any blood on his face before my hand was cut, I was so flurried; I do not know whether I struck him or not before my finger was cut - I might have struck him in the face after he threw the first knife at me - I will not swear that I did not strike him several times before that; I did not hold him and strike him on the back of his neck.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I first saw the prosecutor on the 2d of June, at ten o'clock at night; my assistant had been and stopped the hemorrhage; I did not open the wound till next morning - I found a wound on the right side of the spine, about an inch long, and a quarter of an inch deep - it appeared to have been done with a cutting instrument. I attended him till about the 20th of June: I considered him in great danger at first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you have seen the instrument with which it was supposed to have been inflicted? A. Yes; it certainly appeared to have been made by a knife of that description; there must have been an artery severed by the hemorrhage; I did not see the artery, as the wound was bound up - I put an adhesive plaister to it; that is all.</p>
               <p>Q. And do you mean to swear he was in the slightest danger? A. I certainly do; an artery having been severed; we did not sew it up, but brought it together by compression, and put a bandage on; he was in bed for a fortnight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long did you consider him in danger? A. I could not decide that he was out of danger under a fortnight.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Tollitt. On the 1st of June Wight was placing some fish on a tray to go out; Bifield came from breakfast, and asked where it was to go - he looked at the tray, and told him he should not send the Cumberland-place fish with what was going to Upper Harley-street; Wight was vexed at that, and said Bifield was no fishmonger, and did not know his business; he still kept on scolding, and saying disagreeable words to Bifield, who told him to hold his tongue, and if he had anything to say to tell Mr. Tollitt of it - he still kept wrangling; Bifield would not speak to him, and he went out with some fish; he returned in about an hour - Bifield asked if he had any orders - he made him no answer; Bifield asked where he brought the lobster from; I did not hear his answer - after that he said he was going out; Bifield stopped him, and said it was not his Sunday out; and if he went he would kick him out of the shop; Wight went to rush by - Bifield stopped him with one hand, and hit him with the other; a scuffle ensued, and Wight said he would make him pay 7s. 6d. for that to-morrow, and pushed himself in Bifield's face, for him to hit him again, but he did not; about ten minutes elapsed - Bifield went down to put some fish into the ice-hole; in the mean time Wight took up a knife which I work with, and said to the servant-maid, "I wish God may strike me dead if Bifield hits me again, if I am hung to-morrow, I will stab him;" Bifield came up - he did nothing to Wight, but went to send some more fish out; Wight walked from one side of the shop to the other, and said, "Mark, you are no man, nor the father of a child - you look as white as a boiled maggot;" he then have the knife at him, but it did not hit him - Bifield crossed the shop to him; I saw Wight take another knife off the fish-block - a scuffle ensued; I heard Wight cry Murder! I turned away for a minute, and then heard Bifield cry Oh! I turned, and saw the knife sticking in his side, about his loins; I followed him across the road, and saw the knife fall from him in the road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner in a great passion? A. He was in a passion when they were quarrelling in the morning; he cried Murder! before the other cried Oh! I was about three yards from him when Bifield asked where the lobster came from, but heard no answer given; there was a carriage going by at the time - I believe no answer was given; I think Bifield swore he would kick him out of the shop; I saw him hit him in the face once before the prisoner went out with the fish - it was not done in play; I was close to them when they were struggling, and do not know what made the prisoner cry Murder! I only saw Bifield strike him once - I saw his nose bleeding when I came from the doctor's; it must have been from violence used before I returned - Wight came to master's service before Bifield.</p>

However to encourage him, she desired him to let her have the Six-pence, and she would bring it him again within an Hour, and she would put him in a good way of living, and tell him more; with much Perswasions of her Canting Dialect, he let her have it; then she told him, he must get all his Monies together, against she came, which he did. At the time appointed she came again, and delivering the Six pence, she observed into what Pocket he put it, and immediately conjectured the Money to be there; Then she asked him if he had any Gold, he showed her some; she took it in her hand, and gave it a fill-up, and 'twas gone, but at length she gave it him again; he put it into his Pocket as before, She showed him some Juggling Tricks, till she had Juggled away his Money; Then she wanted to be gone; and told him, that some People that lived there formerly had hid some Treasure in such a place under the Earth, and if he would go, he should immediately find it; upon which he went to search for his supposed Treasure; in the mean while the Prisoner was gone.</p>

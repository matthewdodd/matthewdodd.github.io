               <p>Q. Were the deceased and the prisoner acquainted before this? - A.Quite so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they been good friends before? - A. Always good friends; I was surprised to see two people such good friends as they were going to fight.</p>

             sworn. - I went to the Crown public-house about nine o'clock; the prisoner and the deceased were sitting together in a box when I went in, they afterwards came and sat down in the box by me; I saw the deceased throw down five shillings to fight the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010029"></xptr>Q. What conversation took place before that? - A. Not any thing that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nothing said by the one to the other before the five shillings were thrown down? - A.Nothing that I attended to.</p>
               <p>Q.How long had they been sitting down by you before he threw down the five shillings? - A.About five or ten minutes; he threw down the five shillings, and challenged to fight him; upon which, the prisoner repeatedly asked him if he was in earnest; he said, he was; upon that, the prisoner put five shillings upon the table, after great hesitation, and they both went out together; I did not follow them out immediately; I went out just at the finishing of the fight; I got round, and picked up the deceased; he was lying upon the ground when I got into the yard; he was quite motionless; I carried him, and put him upon the bench that is in the yard; Mr. Wood, the landlord of the house, came and took him from me, and I went home, and saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q.Had there been any quarreling between them in the box? - A. I heard no more than the prisoner hesitating, and asking him if he was in earnest; the deceased kept urging him to fight him.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very extraordinary that these two good friends should think of fighting, without any angry words? - A. I heard none that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your conversation during the ten times that you speak of? - A. All the discourse was about fighting.</p>
               <p>Q. What was said before the five shillings were thrown down? - A.Nothing particular, that I know of; I did not interfere.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a very extraordinary story; you were sitting in the same box with them, you might hear what passed without interfering; who else was there? - A. A relation of mine,

             sworn. - I went into the Crown between the hours of nine and ten; I happened to sit down at the same table where the deceased and the prisoner were sitting; I was an entire stranger in the house; the prisoner and the deceased were laying a wager how many beans made five; they produced five beans, two white beans, two black, and one red one, and that won the wager.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by how many beans made five? - A. I do not know; I have very often heard it expressed, but don't know what it means; after the wager was settled, the prisoner was smoking his pipe, and the deceased began to aggravate him to fight him; he kept continually aggravating him to fight; he wanted to fight with him for any money, he would fight him for a guinea, or five shillings; the prisoner laughed it off, and would not take any offence from him; then the deceased got up, and stood in the middle of the tap-room, and swore he would lick the prisoner, whether or no; then the prisoner said, laughing, if he gave him a good hiding, he thought it might be of service to him; then, after that, the deceased turned to beat him, and the prisoner asked him if he was in earnest; he told the prisoner he was, and that he would give him a d-d good hiding; then the deceased deposited five shillings in a man's hand; the prisoner was very loth to put down five shillings; he put his five shillings down, six or seven minutes afterwards, quite in a flurry; the deceased asked the prisoner it he was ready; the prisoner said, he did not want to fight with him, and asked him again, was he in earnest; then the deceased pulled off his coat, and hung it upon the bannisters of the box where we were sitting; I did not go out to see them fight; the prisoner went out so good humoured, I did not think he would fight with him; in about ten minutes, the prisoner returned with his shirt torn to pieces, and his face besineared with dirt; I said, what have you been fighting; he said, yes, I have, and have conquered him; after that he sat down, and called for some porter to drink, and began to smoke a pipe, when the news came into the tap-room that the man was dead; when the information came in that the man was dead, the prisoner's countenance changed immediately; he seemed very much concerned indeed, and surrendered himself up to go any where with any body that pleased to take him, and he waited in the house till an officer came.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the deceased sober, or how do you account for this strange behaviour of the deceased? - A. I don't know whether he was drunk or sober; I never saw either of them before, to my knowledge; he seemed to know what he was doing.</p>

             sworn. - I was going to the Crown about ten o'clock at night, and saw the prisoner and the deceased coming into the yard to fight; Connop twice asked the deceased whether he was in earnest; he said he was, and then went a step or two further, and had a round, but there was no blow struck there to hurt; I then went up to Connop, and said, surely you are not a earnest to fight; he said, yes, he was; I then went to the deceased, and said to him, Lewis, do not you fight; he said, ah, Mr. Balmer, if I had fair play, I should beat him, by g-d; he was struck upon the left side, he then fell, he afterwards got up, and had another round; he was struck then upon his left side again; he fell, and was picked up by Webb; when I looked at him, I saw he was incapable of standing; I went up to the prisoner, and said, Connop, do not fight any more, the man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010030"></xptr>came to me, as if he could not stand; well, says he, I do not care, but I will have the five shillings for the tearing of my shirt; after that, I stopped in the ground a little while to see how the deceased was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not the deceased strike me twice before I struck at him? - A. I saw the deceased strike at him once; I cannot say whether he struck at him more than once, or not.</p>

             sworn. - I am a surgeon: I examined the body of the deceased on Saturday night, the 8th of June; at first, I observed no appearance whatever of external violence; I opened him, but could find nothing internal that could lead to the cause of the man's death; I could find nothing internal nor external that I could account for his death; I have no doubt he died in consequence of the injury he had received; it is impossible to say whether it was from the blows or the fall.</p>
               <p>Q. If the man died in consequence of injuries received in a battle of this sort, how could that be without some appearance of injury? - A. There was none, either external or internal.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you suppose that his death might be occasioned without any appearance of violence; was there no rupture of the vessels? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open the head, so as to examine the brain? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been any rupture upon the brain, you could not see that through the skull, I suppose? - A.Certainly not, but there is generally an hemorrhage.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you account for the man's death, then? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you say, we should be disposed to think the man would have died, if he had not been fighting; can you say that his death was occasioned by that which happened in the fight? - A. I could find nothing; there was no fracture nor rupture.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had heard nothing about the fight, but had been sent for to examine that man, what would have been your opinion; that he died a natural death? - A.Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, It seems to me to be unnecessary to sum up the evidence, because it is not proved that this man died of the injury received in the fight; in order to six upon him either murder or manslaughter, you must be satisfied the cause of the death was some injury received in the course of the battle; now, the surgeon says, there was no external or internal appearance of violence, and if he had not heard of the fight, he should have supposed he had died a natural death; he does not give you any reason to suppose he died in consequence of any injury he received in the battle; as there is no proof of that kind, I think he must be acquitted. <rs id="t18010701-30-verdict172" type="verdictDescription">

I live at No. 6, Glasshouse-buildings, Whitechapel I am single—I know the prisoner—I believe he is a sailor—when he is at home from sea he has been in the habit of staying with me—on 14th May he made a charge against my sister, of taking 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his—my sister was taken into custody and taken before the Magistrate—the case was heard,</p>

               <p>and she was discharged—I was in the Court—I did not hear the prisoner say anything when she was discharged—I met him the same evening, about 8 o'clock, in Dock-street, near my house—I ran away from him because I heard him say, before my sister was taken, that I had better not go out, because if he did not find my sister he would get his countrymen to kill me—that was my reason for running away—I saw him again about fifteen minutes afterwards, as I was standing at the door of the Cock and Neptune public house, in Neptune-street—he came up arm-in-arm with another man—I stood into the doorway, and the other man who was with, the prisoner said to me, "What for you be frightened?"—the prisoner was on the other side of him, not next to me—he stepped forward, and I made a hasty step to go up stairs—some girls stood in my way, and I fell—the prisoner had passed the other man, and came towards me—the prisoner was coming in after me, and when he got to the stairs where I was, I saw him—he came close to me as I was lying on my side—he pulled a knife out of his belt, and stabbed at me—I put my right arm over my head, and he stabbed me with the knife on the arm—I had a long sleeve on, the blood came through that—I did not hear him say anything—before I got up, he was running out of the door—he only struck me once—I do not know how much I bled, it was all over my dress—I was taken to a doctor.</p>

Bank note in a pocket-book in my coat pocket; I put my trousers between the bed and sacking; I went to sleep, and awoke a little before twelve o'clock - the prisoner was then out of bed - I heard money rattling; I immediately jumped out of bed, searched for my trousers, and they were gone; I immediately accused her of taking my money, and asked where my trousers were; she said,"Here are your trousers;" and gave them to me immediately; she was standing in a different part of the room, and must have had them in her hand when she spoke - I gave an alarm in the house - the watchman came and took her; she was dressing herself when this happened; she had got on her under clothes and stays - I do not know whether her gown was on; she had partly undressed when she came to bed - I believe her stays were off; when I first gave the alarm I said I had lost sixteen or seventeen sovereigns, but when I put my hand into my pocket I found seven and a half left, nine had been abstracted; on our way to the watch-house we met a constable, who asked the watchman if he had searched her; he said No; he took her into a public-house - I found nine sovereigns, 1ls., and 7 1/4d. on her; I had lost nine whole sovereigns.</p>

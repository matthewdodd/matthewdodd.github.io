               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do not you think this looks very like a crim. con.? A. I do not know what to think of it - my wife had left me before, and had come back again; she took some things away before, and brought them back again - she staid three days or a week - she had gone two or three times; I have got all the things stated in the indictment - my wife is here; I will take her home - I dare say the prisoner was present when I gave my wife leave to take some things.</p>

On Sunday, the 6th of November, the prisoner was in my service; I went to church about a quarter to eleven o'clock that morning, leaving him in the house - I left this property in a drawer in my bed-room; I locked it up there that morning - he has seen me put money into that drawer; about half-past twelve o'clock, while I was in church, I received information of this robbery; I went home, and found a 5l. note on the bed-room carpet; there was half a sovereign and some silver left in the bowl, where the money was kept - the rest of the money was gone; the drawer had been forced open- there was the mark of some instrument having been applied; the prisoner came home soon after me, but I had no conversation with him - as I left my bed-room to go to church I observed the shadow of the prisoner in the watercloset.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have the servants access to the water-closet? A. Yes; he was four years in my service; the room adjoining mine was broken into in March last; the back of the house was broken open- I have one female servant; the prisoner came home earlier than I expected him from church - the 5l. note laid open on the carpet; any body might have seen it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When your house was broken open, did the same female servant live with you? A. No, the prisoner did; the 5l. note laid flat on the carpet - I had left it in the bowl, folded up with the other money: I had left the female servant at home.</p>

            . I am a brush-maker, and live in Duke-street, Grosvenor-square - the prosecutrix is also a brush-maker. I was called out of church about a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve o'clock; in consequence of this, (church is generally over about one) I went to Bedford's house, and on her bed-room carpet I saw a 5l. note, several loose keys, and a key ring, broken; I then turned round and saw two chests of drawers, two drawers of each were open - I saw Mrs. Bedford go to the wooden bowl, in which was 20s. in cash, and a piece of paper with 59l. written on it; after remaining in the house about twenty minutes, I went out, and met the prisoner in Mount-street - I called him, and gave him in charge on this robbery; he then declared, (holding a very small Prayer-book in his hand,) that he had been to chapel and no where else - he was taken to Mrs. Bedford's; I searched him, and in his waistcoat pocket found 1l. 16s. 1/2d and a key - he appeared much agitated, and asked for some water; I afterwards went to Castle-street Long-acre, and received information.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons did you find in the prosecutrix's house? A. Five, one man and four women - I met the prisoner coming towards home; it was about one o'clock; I found no tools on him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Who was the man? A. The female servants' brother-in-law - her sister was there, and Mrs. Bedford, and Mrs. Turner, the second floor lodger; the prisoner had the Prayer-book in his hand very conspicuously.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Bedford. On the 6th of November mistress went to church, Mrs. Turner, the prisoner and I, were in the house - my sister and brother-in-law were on the step of the door at the time Mrs. Bedford went out, they came in - they were in the habit of calling with mistresses knowledge; they had come to Mrs. Turner, who is a mantua-maker, to give orders about a dress - I went into the kitchen with them; I then took my sister up and left her with Mrs. Turner - as I came down to the bottom of the kitchen stairs, the prisoner was suddenly behind me; mistress had then been gone to church about five minutes - I told him my brother was down stairs; he said, "Oh, is he?" he did not come down after me, but went from the bottom of the stairs somewhere; but in ten or twelve minutes he came down stairs very quickly, and had hardly entered the kitchen when he asked for his book; I told him it was on the end of the dresser - he reached it hastily, knocked down some halfpence, and did not stay to pick them up; when he got near the street door he called out that he would leave his great coat, as it did not rain - I did not hear the door opened or shut, but saw no more of him; my sister came down stairs in about two minutes after the prisoner left the kitchen, and asked me to show her the watercloset, which I did - we staid there about eight minutes; I took her to show her Mrs. Bedford's bed-room, and on opening the door, I was surprised to find a door open which is never opened except when the room is scruhbed, and another door was shut, which is not usually shut in the day time - I felt alarmed, and the first thing I saw was some keys on the carpet - I did not see the ring; I then saw a piece of paper rumpled up - I called my sister to look at it; I took the paper up, it was a 5l. note - I called Mrs. Turner, who came down, and advised me to put it down again, and not touch anything - I did so; Mrs. Turner proposed that the house should be searched - I called up my brother-in-law; we all searched, and found nobody there; a few minutes after Mrs. Turner's son came to the door - I went and let him in, and the door was closed - I then went to St. George's church, for Mrs. Bedford; she came with Ashmead.</p>

               <p>Q.From the time the prisoner took his Prayer-book<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010055"></xptr>till you went to the room, had your brother or sister been out of your sight? A. Not at all - my brother did not go up to the water-closet, but I stood in sight of Mrs. Bedford's bed-room door, with the water-closet door open, and nobody went there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know your brother and sister were coming? A. No; I found no instrument in the bed-room - none of us were searched; I laid the note down, crumpled up, as I had found it - I went to show my sister the room, as she said the water-closet was clean; I did not look at the drawers for marks - I opened the note to see what it was; I crumpled it up again, and put it down as I had found it - I went into the room with Mrs. Bedford, but left again without seeing the note taken up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the prisoner said he would leave his great coat, did you see what had become of him? A. I did not.</p>

            . I am a miniature-painter, and live in Cheapside; I am Gould's brother-in-law. On Sunday, the 6th of November, I went to Mrs. Bedford's house, about twenty minutes to eleven o'clock, with my wife: I had lost a child, and we went about getting some crape put on a dress - my sister did not know we were coming: she let Mrs. Bedford out as we rang the bell; while I was in the kitchen the prisoner came down, reached out his hand, took his Prayer-book off the tea-chest, and knocked a 1d. down - I was afterwards called up; I had never been up stairs before.</p>
               <p>This witness described the state of the bed-room as the other witness had done, and Mr. Adolphus declined proceeding further in the case.</p>

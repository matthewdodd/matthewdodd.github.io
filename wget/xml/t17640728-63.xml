            . I am wife to the prosecutor; the prisoner came with a young woman, whom he called his wife, to lodge at my house; they were in the room about five weeks. On a Friday night, after I was in bed, and my light out, he came down, and went out in great haste. I lie in a lower room. She came down, but not till after he was out, and said they had had a pig's foot for supper, and he was gone for another; the next morning, before it was light, they both went out: she said she should be at home by one o'clock. They never returned: on the Monday I miss'd my things, mentioned in the indictment; part of them were let with the lodging-room to him; my wearing-apparel were taken out of the garret: she was so officious she would make the garret bed for me, before she went away; I suppose she took them.</p>

Mills called on me here last evening, and from what he said respecting Wallis's check, it will be better not to present it till after I have seen him, which I will do at twelve o'clock, and then see you, and either then have the money or draw it at the bankers. Yours, truly, R. Tuke.")—I got this note about twenty minutes after ten—most of the City banks open at ten—I think the next time I saw the prisoner was on Tuesday following, the 25th—I told him I was surprised at his giving me such a check, that there was no account at the bankers' in the name of Wallis—I do not exactly remember the answer he made, for I followed up that obser<lb></lb>vation by another; I was very angry; I had met with great annoyance at the bankers', and I said I would give him in charge—I moved away, and he moved away at the same time—I heard he was in custody the following morning.</p>

HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you undertake to speak exactly to the words he used, or are you giving us your impression as to the conversation that took place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The substance of it; I do not tie myself down to particular words—they made no more impression on my mind at the time—I certainly understood him to say there had been a purchase of grease between him and Bryant and May, that the grease bad been delivered to Wallis, that the sale that had been effected to him by Bryant and May, had been transferred to Wallis, who was to pay them, and this check was the profit he was to have got in the transaction, supposing he bad paid them and resold it to Wallis—I understood that instead of himself having delivered the grease to Wallis, he had allowed Bryant and May to deliver it to Wallis, taking a check for the profit he would have made if it had passed through his own hands—he mentioned that Mills had effected the sale to Wallis—I cannot say that he said he had received the check through the hands of Mills—he told me he had been introduced to Wallis by Mills—my impression decidedly was that he must have received the check from Mills—from the whole tenor of the conversation, I collected that the transaction had passed through the hands of Mills as well as the check—I could not swear to the precise words—I saw him again on the Tuesday following; Mills was already in custody—I know that Mills was tried and convicted here yesterday of forgery—I had never seen Mills but once—the prisoner had mentioned his name to me—he told me that Mills had introduced him to Wallis.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head clerk to Bryant and May, of Tooley-street—I never saw the prisoner till he came to our premises five or six weeks ago—I think I saw him there twice, but I am not quite certain—I did not sell him any grease—some arrangement was made by Robert Tuke with our principal, Francis May, for some grease, but it was never delivered nor com<lb></lb>pleted, because the money was not forthcoming—the money was to be paid to Bryant and May by Robert Tuke I suppose—I do not know any such person as J. T. Wallis—there was another name mentioned; I think Charles Burrion, or some such name.</p>

               <p>tons was actually entered in your book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that quantity; a certain quantity was entered—an invoice was made, which was cancelled because the money was not forthcoming—I think the grease was to have been delivered at Pickford's office to Charles Burrion by Tuke's order—some of this grease was put out in the yard—it was sold, so that the party to whom it was sold might on a re<lb></lb>sale make a profit—I am not prepared to say whether from 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton would be a fair profit—I should think 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not be too much—if a person had come with Tuke's order for this grease and tendered us the money, we should have delivered it at the price at which we agreed to sell it to Tuke.</p>

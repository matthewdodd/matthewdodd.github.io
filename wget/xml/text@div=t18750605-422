                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 183). On 25th April, about 1.30 in the morning, I was in Nelson Street—I had a man named Thomas Hayes, in custody; the prisoner came up from behind, took hold of the "collar of my coat and pulled me with such force as to make me release my hold of Hayes I turned and saw the—prisoner standing in the gutter, an the next moment he struck me a violent blow on the right side of the neck, which caused me to fall on the flat of my back on the pavement; when I got up he was gone and Hayes was in the custody of two other constables—as I was proceeding with them to the station I felt a smarting in my neck, but I did not take much notice of it, as I had been wrestling for full twenty "minutes and was in a state of excitement—when we got to the station I found I had been stabbed in the neck through my two coats, waistcoat, and two shirts—I was bleeding; I believe a gland was severed.</p>

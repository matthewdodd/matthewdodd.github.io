                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Philpot Place, Ilford, and am a water-man—I was in the High Street, Barking, on Thursday night, the 26th August, at about 10 o'clock—I went down on the Quay, where I saw the two prisoners lift a cask off Glenny's Wharf on to a barge—the two lifted it, one on each side to the barge, from there on to the other quay, to another wharf—I was close at the side—I stood there for an instant while they lifted it on to the other wharf and when they got it on to the other wharf I went and told a policeman what I had seen and the policeman came down the street and went aboard and took the two men—the prisoners are the two he brought out of the cabin—before the cask was taken on to the last barge I saw they had a half gallon can on the wharf ready to receive half a gallon out of the cask and I believe they did—I saw them knock the cork in on the second wharf—they took the can and then the cask afterwards on to the barge—I saw them come out of the barge before the last time and come up the street and back again to the Blue Anchor—Ryan is not one of the men who was with Hollick when the cask was lifted—I have never seen him, except when he was brought out of the barge—it was about 9.20.</p>

I received some information from the last witness in consequence of which I went to the Town Quay, Barking, to look after Hollick, Ryan, and two other men—I saw them in the Blue Anchor public-house, which is close on the Town Quay—about 20 yards from Glenny's Wharf I saw Ryan and two other men come out of the public-house and go on board a manure barge in the Town Quay—about two minutes afterwards Hollick came out and went on the manure barge and all went down in the cabin—I went for another constable and, while I was com<lb></lb>ing back with him the two prisoners and another man passed us in the street—Hollick spoke some bye-word to me—this was close on 11 o'clock—I stood there for some ten or fifteen minutes and the two prisoners and the other man came back again and went on board the manure barge—I then, some minutes afterwards, went on board the barge in company of the other constable—I jumped off the Town Quay on to the barge and away one man went a good run—I believe that was the man in charge of the barge—I don't know him—I went down in the cabin and found the two prisoners there and this can about three parts full of ale (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and on the seat in the cabin I found a cask of beer with this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) knocked in the hole and dripping very fast at the time—it is a piece of wood with some paper round it, a substitute for a tap—they appealed to have been drinking beer; they appeared to be sober—I took them into custody and told them they were charged with stealing that cask of ale from the wharf—Hollick said he had come with the others to have a drop of beer—Ryan said he had come there to have a night's sleep—I took them to the station.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of his losing any thing on the 24th of September last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he lose? - A muslin handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. What else? - Nothing else at that present time.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it he lost the other things? - The other things was found in the prisoner's boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live in the house? - No, the prisoner lived in Banner-street, with Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. How came this to be found out? - She came in, the 24th of September, in the evening, and asked for some muslin for cap borders, I shewed her some, and cut her a quarter of a yard, she paid me for it; when I was looking for some paper, I lifted up my head, and I saw her take a muslin handkerchief off the counter, she seemed rather confused, seeing I saw her, she held it down beside her, between her and the counter; in a minute or two afterwards I saw her put it in her pocket; I immediately informed an elderly person who was in the shop with myself, what was best to do; while we were speaking she went out at the door, and I called her back again, and desired her to walk into the kitchen, and I desired a young woman to search her; she went down into the kitchen immediately, and the young woman went down with her, and found the handkerchief on her; we sent for her master and an officer, and her master demanded the key of her box; this is what was found in it, and the constable and her master and myself saw it there.</p>

               <p>Q. Who gave you the handkerchief, the person that keeps the shop? - I am not quite positive, I believe it was Mr. King, the master of the shop; I had not seen the prisoner till I went and searched her box, and all these articles were found in the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe this is the handkerchief? - I am positive, because I twisted this about it, to distinguish it from the others.</p>

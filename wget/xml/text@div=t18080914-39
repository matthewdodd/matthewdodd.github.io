               <p>Q. Have you seen it since - A. Yes, I saw it when he was detected, about noon on Friday last.</p>
               <p>MR. HANLEY. About eleven o'clock it rained very hard; I stopped at the public house reading the newspaper; I saw the prisoner with the board, he asked the landlord if he would buy it, he said no; the prisoner took the board up Peerless row; I stopped him near the constable's house, I asked him whose board it was; he then said it was a scaffolding board, he was taking it home to his master; I seized him by the collar, I told him I would see whose board it was; he then said he saw it fall out of a cart in the City road, he called to the man to take it up in the cart, the man said he had plenty of them, he might take it. During the time the constable came; I then gave charge of him, I insisted he should go before a magistrate; the constable said he knew where he worked, he would take him to his master; he then confessed that he had taken it away from Mr. Moore. Mr. Moore came and owned the board.</p>

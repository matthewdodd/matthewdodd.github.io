                  </hi>. I am servant to Lieutenant Kensington, of the Royal Artillery—on Wednesday morning, 21st June, I put a cap and jacket in my master's cupboard—this is the cap, and the jacket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can swear to the cap by the lining—it is rather a fancy lining—I don't know whether there is any other cap like it—I can swear to the coat by the tabs on the collar—they are official tabs—I don't know that every officer has them; no one but my master, that I know of—I brushed it on the Wed<lb></lb>nesday morning, and put it in the cupboard about 8 o'clock—the next morn<lb></lb>ing I went to fetch the coat and cap, at my master's request—that was about 7 o'clock—he was going on duty at 8 o'clock—they were both gone—I also missed a set of studs, which were in the cupboard—I missed a pocket-handkerchief; it was in the coat pocket—this is the one—it was in the coat pocket—I felt it when I folded the coat up—the handkerchief has my master's name upon it, "No. 12, E. Kensington, 69"—I have seen them by sending them to the wash—the prisoner was apprehended on Thursday, 22nd, and the things were shown to me on the following Wednesday, at the Police Court.</p>

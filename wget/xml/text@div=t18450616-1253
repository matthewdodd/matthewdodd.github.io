                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the 20th of May, about half! two o'clock in the morning, I was on duty, and saw the prisoners coming over the garden-wall of No. 16, Glo'ster-place, Camden-town—they saw me, and went back again—I went into the garden and found them in the shed—I asked their business there—they said they came to go to the water-closet—I asked how many gardens they had been into—they said into the ad<lb></lb>joining one, but denied going any further—I saw footsteps where they had been into other gardens—I took them to the station, returned and traced footsteps from 16, Gloster-place to 23, but could not trace them further—about half! five o'clock in the morning, I heard Mr. Boyce's house, 5, Great Camden-street, had been entered—the prisoners were a hundred yards from the prosecutor's when I first saw them—I found footmarks of two persons in the garden of No. 3, having gone over several gardens, I traced them to Mr. Boyce's, and to No. 6, (Dr. Leifchild's,)—I found the wash-house had been entered at the wash-house window, which was open—the shutter was let down inside—it is a sliding window and looks into the garden—I traced footsteps from there down to a summer-house at the bottom of the garden, and there found these three brushes—I found a bath-curtain in the wash-house folded up and laid on the stones, not taken away—there is a narrow passage between the dwelling-house and wash-house—the same roof goes over part of the passage—I cannot recollect whether the wash-house door opens into the kitchen without going into the passage—I came to Newgate by order of the Magistrate the same day when the prisoners were committed, for their shoes—they were brought to me by a tall stout man—he gave me four shoes—I took them to Nos. 5 and 6, tried them there and in several other gardens—I found they exactly corresponded—I first put them close to the marks making an impression by the side of them, and afterwards put them into the marks—the prosecutor's garden had been newly done up and was soft—the impressions under the trees were very plain and fresh—I measured them with a string, the width and length—they correspond with the shoes in both cases—the house is in the parish of St. Pancras.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Leifchild, 6, Camden-street—I was in the wash-house on the evening of the 20th, about ten o'clock—the window was shut close but not fastened—it has no catch to it—I know these brushes to be master's—they were on the shelf at that time, and this curtain was on the bath—this is the curtain—I was the last person up and went to bed about ten o'clock—the wash-house door opens into a little area which is open to the sky—it has no roof to it at all—it is quite open, and nothing to connect the roof of the house with the roof of the wash-house—there is no roof covering the area—it is all enclosed with the passage, but not covered in—I missed nothing but the curtain and brushes—I was not alarmed in the night.</p>

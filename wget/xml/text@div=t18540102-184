                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Union-row, Tottenham. The prisoner keeps the house, and lives in it; I paid my rent to him—I occupied the front room, first floor—I went home between 1 and 2 o'clock on Christmas morning; that is, after midnight—I went to the door, and asked him to let me in—he would not—the door was fastened against me on the inside—I called out to the prisoner to let me in—he said he would not let me in—he was in his own kitchen; that is the front kitchen, on the ground floor—after that I went to the front window on the ground floor; the prisoner rose the window up—I put my head to the window and saw John Costello inside, in the kitchen, and he told me if I offered to come in the prisoner had a gun inside to shoot me—the prisoner could hear what he said—I could not see him at that time, but I put my head to the window, and directly I did so the prisoner shot me through the open part of the windows—I did not put my head inside; I put it over on the outside, to see where he was—I received the shot in the face and shoulders—there had been no altercation between us before this, nor any quarrel—he had made an attempt to shoot me a fortnight before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live with the prisoner. I am his wife's nephew—I remember Fleming coming home between 1 and 2 o'clock on Christmas morning—I heard him call out to the prisoner to let him in, I was in the same room with the prisoner at the time—he talked to Fleming about the rent, and about a clock that he had bought of him—Fleming told him that he did not owe him any rent, that he owed him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the clock, and when the bread score that Hannigan's wife drew from Fleming's mother was settled, whatever he owed him in the line of rent he would pay him—Fleming then walked up stairs into his own room, the front room—I am speaking of Christmas night; this was between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning—in about two minutes Fleming came down again, opened the door, and went out, and then Hannigan took and barred the door—the gun stood in the corner of the room—he went and took it out of the corner, came to the front window, rose it up, and walked back again to the passage door, at the foot of the stairs up which Fleming lived—he pulled a percussion cap out of his pocket and put it on the nipple of the gun—I asked him if he knew what he was a doing of—he said, "Yes, I do; and if you stir I will blow out your brains"—Fleming directly came to the door outside, and knocked at it to be let in—the prisoner would not let him in—Fleming</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Levy, and live in Albany-terrace, Regent's Park. The prisoner lived with me as cook for nineteen months—I employed her to pay the weekly bills to the tradesmen regularly, during the whole period—the bills were generally delivered to me on Tues<lb></lb>day or Wednesday, and on the Wednesday week I gave her the money to pay <hi rend="italic">them</hi>—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a bill</hi>)—this bill of Mr. Sadler, the cheesemonger, was brought to me—I gave it to the prisoner again, and she brought it to me again with the words "Paid, Sadler," on it, at the end of the week—I had given her money to pay this bill with a variety of others.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman; just as I cried the hour of twelve, I heard a woman cry, stop-thief; I saw a man coming along, and he dropped the shirts out of his hand; I had the light of my lanthorn, and there was the light of the lamps and the windows, I could see him very plain; I ran towards him, and my partner ran to the other side; he fell down before him, and he laid hold of him, and I took up the linen; we took him to the watch-house, the woman came up, and took the linen out of my hand, my partner took it from her, and took it to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>CORNELIUS CUTHBERT sworn. - On Saturday morning last, about a quarter after twelve o'clock, as I was crying the hour, I heard the cry of stop-thief, in Monmouth-street; I saw a man running, I went towards him, in order to catch him; I saw him drop something like linen, and directly he fell down, about five or six yards from where he dropped the linen; I came up to him and detected him, and took him to the watch-house; I took the linen out of Mrs. Lamb's hand, we put our marks on it, and left it at the watch-house all night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He told me in the morning, as we were going to the Magistrate, that he could not hurt me, for he did not see me drop the linen.</p>
               <p>Cutbbert. I saw him drop something white, which appeared to me to be linen or paper, I could not tell which.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going home through Monmouth-street, somebody ran hard by me, and knocked me down in the mud, the watchman came up to me, and said, as there was nobody else, he wanted me, the other watchman brought the linen, and asked the woman if I was the man, she said, she did not know. <rs id="t17961130-38-verdict208" type="verdictDescription">

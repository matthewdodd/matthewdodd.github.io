               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I never saw him until that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner on any day hire a horse of you - A. On Monday week the prisoner came to my house for a saddle horse to go to Kingston, and back; I let him have one to go that journey; not on his own account, not till another man answered for the horse. It is a difficult thing to let a saddle horse to a stranger; he was to return the same evening at eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060036"></xptr>Q. What home was it - A. A little brown Welch horse, a Roman nose; with one eye; it was a gelding; I value it and from seventeen to eighteen pounds. He did not come back that evening. I never saw my horse from Monday about the middle of the day, until Friday; a friend of his came to me after I had been searching for him two days; he asked me if I was in the habit of letting out horses; I told him I went. He asked me if I had not lost a horse; I told him I had and asked him if he knew where it was, she said he did not. I saw the horse again on Friday, the horse was at livery at the Flying Horse, near Lambeth-street office, in the care of the landlord of the name of Chuk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the horse that you had lent the prisoner - 
               <persName id="t18140706-62-person559">A. </persName>
            Yes; I am sure it the same horse that he had hired on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his marks - A. Yes; he is a brown gelding, small brush tail, black eyes, and wrashed round. I had the horse four months; he had one eye, and a Roman nose; the near eye was out; that was the horse I let the prisoner have on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You did not know the prisoner before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You applied to a friend of the prisoner, he came with the prisoner - A. I should not have let him have the horse without that friend had passed his word for him. I saw the prisoner again on the Friday; I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiries after the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner intoxicated at the time he hired the horse - A. He might; I took very little notice of him. He hired the horse at five o'clock in the afternoon of Monday.</p>

            . I am a butcher; I live at Mile-end. The prisoner called on me last Tuesday morning, about eight o'clock, he asked me if I knew any body that had got a poney to sell; I told him I did not. I told him that I had a little blind horse that I would part with. Accordingly my lad went with him to shew him the horse. When he came back he liked my horse vastly well; he proposed to chop the brown gelding of the prosecutor's; he offered to take five pounds in exchange and my horse for this gelding; we struck no bargain. He told me that he had an uncle that kept the Bird in Hand public-house at Bow; his horse unfortunately fell down with him at Mile-end, he could not proceed so far; the brown gelding fell down with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what he was - A. He said he was the landlord of the Running Horses at Brentford. A friend of mine was coming by at the time. I suspected it was not his own horse. I asked my friend his opinion, and he and I agreed to go down to Bow to ask the uncle if he kept the Running Horses at Brentford; the prisoner made an objection to go towards Bow; he said, he would go up Globe-lane. I agreed to that, and as he went round Old Ford, he wanted to get out of the cart; he said, I had tried the horse enough. I came through Old Ford into Bow; I said to the prisoner, you say your uncle lives here, we will have a little porter; he said, no; he did not want his uncle to see him with a bad arm; I said, your uncle will excuse that. I pulled up to the door; he got out of the cart. The landlord and landlady were at the door. I told the landlord I understood that the young man was his nephew; the landlord made no answer. I asked him the second time; he said, he was no relation nor any kin whatever. I told the prisoner I thought the horse was a stolen one; I would give him in charge of an officer. I left the prisoner with two friends that were in company with me. I drove the horse home to my own house. The horse was taken to Lambeth-street, and left in the care of Mr. Coombes, by order of the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the horse that was left in the charge of Coombes, the same horse that you had of the prisoner - A. Yes, it is; I have no doubt about that.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COLE. I am a cow-keeper, in Mile-end-road. On Tuesday morning last, Mr. Cooper called to me, and related the case of the young man wanting to shop the horse with Mr. Biggs; I said, I should persuade them not to have any thing to do with the horse. He said, he was going to his uncle at Bow; the prisoner objected going down the road; he would go down Globe-lane. The young man wanted to get out of the cart; he said, they had trial enough of the horse. Mr. Biggs said, you have an uncle at Bow, we will call upon him; he said, no, he should not like his uncle to see him in that situation. He got out of the cart, went to the landlord, told him to say he was his uncle, if we should ask. The prisoner said it was his own horse, he gave two ten-pound notes for it. I said, do not try to lug other people into difficulties. The landlord said, he was not his uncle. As we were walking up Mile-end-road, he shoved us both into a ditch; I got out again. He ran off; I called stop thief. A dog crossed the road, run against him, which impeded his running. At last, I came up to him; I got hold of him. Mr. Coombes came past, he took charge of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much in liquor when I hired the horse; when I came round from my journey at Bow I tumbled off the horse; the next morning I was so tipsey I did not know how to walk. I did not mean to part with the horse.</p>

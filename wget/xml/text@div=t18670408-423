I am manager to Phillips and Co., cigar manufacturers, 80, Hackney Road—on 11th March the prisoner came and asked for twelve boxes of cigars, at 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I showed him some, and he said if I would send them to the Bell, in Fleet Street, he would pay the boy—I sent the boy with an invoice—he returned about two hours afterwards without the money—on the same evening I went to the Nottingham Castle, Angel Street, St. Martin's le Grand, and found the prisoner there—I said, "I want the money for the cigars"—he said, "I have not got the money, I gave them to a man to take to Holloway"—I said, "If you like I will go to Holloway with you"—he said, "I cannot go just yet"—I said, "Well, if you like to go with me now, I will pay for a cab, as I only want to get the goods or the money"—he then went into the parlour and spoke to some man—I called him out and said, "Now, what are you going to do; are you going to give me the goods or the money?"—he made no reply, and I called a constable and gave him in charge—the value of the goods was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these are part of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Brick-kiln-row, Plumstead Common, and am in charge of the felloe stores of the carriage department at the Royal Arsenal—I did not know the prisoner till he was taken into custody—he was employed in the laboratory department at that time—on Thursday afternoon, 2d August, about a quarter to 5 o'clock, I saw him at the back of my stores—he was drawing the copper hooping from the vat, doubling it up and concealing it about his person, between the waistband of his trousers and his shirt—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; I saw it taken from him—he had got it straight down—I asked him what he was going to do with this copper; he told me he was going to take it to the fitter's shop—I told him it was decidedly wrong, and that he had better put it back again—he said it was all right—I begged him again to put it back, but he still persisted in taking it with him—I told him it was under Mr. Dean's charge, and belonged to the carriage department—he made no reply to that but walked on, and I said that if he persisted in taking it away I would follow him—he walked away at first—he took the direction down to the timber shed at the back of the saw-mill, and when he had got there he ran away from me through the wheel shop—I followed him and overtook him in the front of the saw-mills, and took him to Mr. Wren, one of the masters of the saw-mills—Mr. Wren asked me what was the matter—I told him, in the prisoner's presence, that the man had got something concealed about his person, and I desired the prisoner to pull it out—he drew from his person the copper now produced, and laid it on the table, and said, "There it is"—Mr. Wren asked him where he belonged to, and the prisoner said that he belonged to the carriage department under Mr. Ambrose—Mr. Wren sent me for Mr. Ambrose—we found out afterwards that the prisoner belonged to the laboratory.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter employed in the carriage department of the Royal Arsenal—on Thursday, 2d August, I was passing by where the felloe stores are—I saw the prisoner there behind the cask concealing the copper between his waistcoat and trousers—I did not see him doing that, before my attention was called to him—Mr. Peen called my attention to him—Mr. Peen had not spoken to him then—I saw him put the copper between his waistcoat and the waistband of his trousers—after that I saw Mr. Peen speak to him—Mr. Peen told him he had better stop there, and the prisoner afterwards ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Camden-terrace, Plumstead, and am as<lb></lb>sistant timber-master in the Royal Arsenal—on Thursday afternoon, 2d August, Mr. Peen came to me and brought the prisoner with him—I said, "What's the matter, John? "speaking to Peen—he said, in the prisoner's presence, "This man has concealed a quantity of copper about him"—I directly said to the prisoner "Where do you work, and who is your fore<lb></lb>man?"—he told me that Mr. Ambrose was his foreman; that he worked in the carriage department—I requested Peen to ask Mr. Ambrose to step down; the, prisoner heard that—when Peen had left the office the prisoner requested leave to leave the office for a minute or two to go to the water closet—I allowed him to do so in charge of one of the workmen—I called Stephen Cowley; the prisoner went with me to call him—the prisoner did not come back that afternoon—I next saw him at the police-court, on the following day; Friday—I believe this to be the copper which I saw concealed about him—it has the mark of the broad arrow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the stores at the Arsenal at Woolwich—I went on the morning of 3d August to the place where the cask was, containing the copper—I found that one of the casks there had been opened, and that some copper was gone from it—I was round there on the Tuesday evening before; the 31st July—the cask was then shut, and the tarpaulin was over it—I saw the cask itself—I did not lift the tarpaulin up.</p>

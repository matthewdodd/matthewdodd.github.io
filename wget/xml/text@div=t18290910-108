               <p>Q. Did the person who took it come behind you or meet you? A. He met me; it had a double chain, and was pulled away with a tremendous pull; he gave a tremendous pull before he got away - it was not a sudden snatch but a wrench; my arm was very sore afterwards, for some time the clasp of the chain broke - he got the reticule, and rushed away with it - I called Stop thief! and he called Stop thief himself! somebody then came behind, struck me on the back, and made a catch at me, to prevent my running in pursuit, but he was taken directly on the spot, without being out of my sight; he is the man -I am quite sure of it - it happened on Sunday evening; my purse was found on the Wednesday following, over a garden wall, which the prisoner passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I take it for granted you were very much agitated? A. I was - I had never seen him before; it was done momentarily - there was a person standing at a door as I passed round the corner, and her brother pursued him; I had to turn a corner in following him, but did not lose sight of him.</p>

            . I am a journeyman baker. I was in Dean-street, standing at my father's door; I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running and calling Stop thief! his hat dropped off - he did not stop to pick it up, so I thought he was the thief himself - he was coming towards me; I told him if he did not stop I would knock him down - he paid no attention to that -I ran after him up Dean-street and laid hold of him, but missed my hold; I secured him at the top of Dean-street; he said he had done nothing, he was not the thief, and was very resolute to get away - I held him, and said,"What as he robbed;" the lady said he was the man immmediately; I took him into a public-house, as the rest of the persons round said I should not illuse him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not a good many persons behind pursuing him? A. Several were running after him, calling Stop thief! whether that hid him from the lady I cannot say - I did not see her till she came up to me - if I had let my hat fall I should have stopped to pick it up- I kept very close to him; there was nobody between him and me, I swear - I did not see him do any thing; the others were all just behind him when I first met him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave every thing to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

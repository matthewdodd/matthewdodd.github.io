I am a letter sorter in the inland branch of the General Post-office—on 8th February I made up the dispatch for Wimbledon about 12.30 p.m.—there were two registered letters, one addressed to Miss Pott, a flat letter, and another a square box, addressed to Mr. Walter Doller, Wimbledon—registered letters are marked with a blue line across—I am sure those two letters were put into that bag—I annexed a bill and tied all together with a string, and placed them in the bag—Mr. Ford was present—I saw him seal the bag—it would go off by the 2 o'clock delivery to Wimbledon.</p>

I am head letter-carrier at Wimbledon—I was on duty there on 9th February, when the bag came from London at 2.10—it is my duty to open the bag—I was engaged this day and the prisoner opened it—when he had stamped the letters he reported to me that there was no bill come with the bag, and I left off what I was doing then and said "Are you sure?"—he said "Yes"—I made inquiries of the other letter carriers and a search was made, and no one had seen the bill—registered letters are tied in the bill, and unpaid letters on the counter<lb></lb>part of the bill—I asked the prisoner if the bag was properly sealed when it came—he said "Yes, as usual"—the letter would be in my delivery—we always receive a bill.</p>

Bank of England note there?"—he said "Yes"—I said "How long since?"—he said "Last Saturday fortnight or three weeks".—I put the note into his hand and said "Is that your endorsement?" pointing to "E.

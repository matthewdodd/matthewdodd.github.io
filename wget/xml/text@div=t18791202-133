                  </hi>. I carry on business in partnership with Mr. Hinde as cabinetmakers—our factory was at one time in the Euston Road, but has recently been removed to Lower Road, Deptford—the prisoners were in our service; Tomkins was a cabinetmaker working in the shop at Deptford, where about 150 men are employed—in the workshop there are benches, tools, and appliances for the manufacture of dressing-tables and goods of that class—Tomkins's wages were from 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he was a skilled workman—his hours were from nine to ten hours per day—he was not allowed to work for any one else—he had worked for us about 18 months regularly—Cope was taken into custody first—I was not present when Tomkins was taken afterwards—these things were produced to me—this is part of a dressing-table; it is made of ash—I can swear to my pattern—the spindles are ebonised wood—I did not make these myself, but I bought a stock of them, and I have since tried to get the same pattern, but could not do so—I have had to take a different pattern—the deal drawers form part of the same table—I missed the goods when taking stock—the drawers are made of ash and walnut—I can swear to the ebonised spindles because the pattern is ours, and has never been made by any one else—it has been imitated—this towel-horse I can swear to—Tomkins said at the police-court they were ours—he cross-examined me, and I positively swore to there parts—the moulds are used in our business, and I swear to them—no one</p>

               <p>had the right to take them out of the shop; they are kept in the foreman's office; the workman never took them away to my knowledge—Tomkins never took work home for me—the value of the two jewel drawers, with a glass frame and tiled back, would be about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the four moulds are of very little value, about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the walnut towel-horse about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—there is also a peculiarity about the veneer—we bought the whole stock, and tried to match it afterwards,'but could not, although my foreman was going about the whole of two days to try and get this particular wood—it is Hungarian ash, and we cannot procure it now—I have never sold any of that veneer—on one occasion I sold four pieces of pine to Tomkins; he asked me to do so, and I told him then that I did not care about selling wood—I think I charged him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; that is the only occasion I ever sold my wood—I was not aware that he had this property at the coffee-shop—my foreman makes out delivery orders for the materials each workman requires—these produced are some made out in the name of Tomkins—when the job is finished the order is signed as finished, the job is entered, and the clerk has charge of the orders—the orders ought never to leave the premises.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Tomkins had been in our employment one or two years—he was a good workman, and it was not impossible for him to imitate my patterns—I have given my workmen wood, but never much, not enough to make any of these goods—they said they wanted to repair something—cabinetmakers sometimes work at home, but it is not the rule—one of the duplicates found at Cope's place referred to a miniature set of drawers—no doubt that was manufactured at home—a workman would have to buy 24 gross of those spindles, and even then, considering the price he would have to pay, he could get other patterns cheaper—I can also swear to the graining on those drawers—a miniature chest of drawers like that could be made by a workman without my knowing it.</p>

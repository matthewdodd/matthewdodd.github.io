                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Jacques, as watchmakers—the prisoner was in our service—subsequently to 21st August, or upon that date, he did not account to me for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Mr. Medlock, or on 22d for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Attenborough—he accounted to me in October for one sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. only—on 24th October, I think, from something that came to my knowledge, I said to the prisoner, "I have some doubt about your conduct, in consequence of not finding your samples</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186511200034"></xptr>
               <p>correct; what watches have you sold to Messrs. Attenborough?"—he said, "Only one"—I said, "I have made inquiries and I find that you have sold three, two of which you have not accounted for"—he then said it was quite correct, he had sold one to them of ours, but the other two were his own property—I said, "It is very singular that you should sell watches on your own account, and we paying you a salary for selling for us"—I then told him I should inquire further into it—he then went away—on the afternoon of the next day, the 25th, he came to me in rather an impertiment manner and threw this paper to me, and said, "That is the invoice for the goods that I sold to Messrs. Attenborough on Monday last."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had he to pay money to you, or to Mr. Jacques, or to Mr. Sherwill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—MR. Harrison was our traveller—he is not with us now—if the prisoner paid ready money we entered it in a ready-money book, and, if it was an account open, we entered it in the day-book—he hands the money over in my presence to our book-keeper, who enters it in the cash-book—he does not pay the money personally to me—if the book-keeper was not present, I should enter it myself—I swear most distinctly that he did not pay me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in August in Harrison's presence—we had never done business with Messrs. Medlock before—that was the reason he paid cash—the prisoner never paid me money received from a Mr. Williamson, or from a Mr. Harris, that I know of—if he did they are entered in the books—I know the name of Poyle—I have no recollection of his paying me three guineas in August, or in July 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from a Mr. Collier—ha paid Poyle's money, there is no doubt about that—I don't find the amount of 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid in July in the books—I find an amount, on 29th July, of 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the 17th 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. both received from the prisoner—he gave us no name—I saw Mr. Poyle, and I found that he had paid the prisoner a cheque, but that cheque he never brought us—he paid us the money—I really cannot tell you whether it was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot find any other sum paid by Poyle—there is an entry in the day-book of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 21st. August, placed to Messrs. Medlock and Ellis' debit, and on that day the prisoner received that amount and did not pay it in—if it had been paid, it would have been entered in the ready-money book, not in this book at all—he has paid several sums on account of Spinks and Sons—I don't see the amount of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the books paid by Spinks in September—I can't say whether he paid it—I don't know the name of Gibbs—there is no entry here of 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of Gibbs—I cannot swear that he did not, in July, pay me 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of Baker, but if he did, I think it would be entered here—Mr. Jacques is here—the prisoner has increased our business, no doubt, ft little—i imagine it was by means of his own connection—we have not opened accounts with his customers, because we do not know them sufficiently—what be has done has been more a ready-money trade—I never heard before we gave him into custody that he had gone to Mr. Rawlins and requested him not to give us credit for goods—such a thing was never intimated—I know Mr. Rawlins quite well—he is a customer—we had goods delivered last week by him—we buy of him—he did not come to our place two or three days before the prisoner left and say that he had requested him not to trust us with goods—some time before the prisoner left I told him that we could not afford to give him that salary of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I never heard before I gave him into custody that he was going into some other employment—he has paid me as much as 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time, and it has been entered by our book-keeper, "from McNeilly 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." for so many watches, without giving the names of the persons to whom the watches were sold—when he came home, on 21st August, he gave this account, "six silver</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

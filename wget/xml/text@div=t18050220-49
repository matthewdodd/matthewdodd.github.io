             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, I live at No. 37, Broad-street, Bloomsbury: I produce a hat and coat pledged on the 9th of February, about two o'clock, by the prisoner at the bar; I lent her five shillings on the coat, and three shillings on the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, had you any information of the robbery? - A. I had, in half an hour after I had taken them in, and about an hour after that the prisoner and a man came in, and asked to see these articles, with an intent, as I understood, for the man to purchase them of her. In consequence of the notice I received I detained her, and sent for an officer, and took her to Bow-street.</p>

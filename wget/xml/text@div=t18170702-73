On Sunday morning, the 25th of May, between six and seven o'clock I went to the shop, and found the back-door of the house a-jar; I found the shop-door burst open, the padlock was forced off, and several of the shelves cleared of the property; the window-shutters were forced, and the windows thrown open; I mean the back-windows of the yard, the bolt was wrenched off and the sash up. I told my mistress, and got an officer; I went round to look for the property and saw the prisoner, Grogan, in Blue-anchor-yard, which is about one hundred yards from the house, with a bundle on his shoulder; I knew him; Ellis was with me, we went up to him and took the bundle from him, and Ellis secured him; this was between nine and ten o'clock.</p>

Howard asked me, in the presence of Jones, if I would buy a jacket, I said I would; I went into the shop. Howard produced one, and asked 4s., for it; having my suspicions I sent my boy to Mrs. Jacobs; she came, I heard she had been robbed, two jackets were taken from Howard and one from Jones; Jones wore one of them, and Howard two.

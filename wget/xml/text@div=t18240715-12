            , JUN. Here is my waistcoat; I saw it on the prisoner Daniel's back one day, and tried to take him, but the constable had no warrant, and would not go into the house - it was found in a box at his father's house when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you swear to it - A. Yes, by a mark which is on it. I spoke to him for full twenty minutes when he had it on, but did not charge him with stealing it, as I was alone. He was in a field adjoining my father's orchard.</p>

             I found an old twilled handkerchief on his neck, with the letter B. marked in the corner - I did not know that it was the prosecutor's, and let him put it on again, and in three quarters of an hour I found that he had another handkerchief on, which had been in his hat before; I could not then find the twilled one. I found the waistcoat in a box at his father's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prosecutor with you when you apprehended him - A. No; he had been for a constable one evening, who would not take him without a warrant. It was a dark chocolate coloured silk handkerchief, and when I went to him again he had a cotton one on.</p>

            . I am a constable of the London dock. On Sunday I perceived the two prisoners walking on the north Quays of the London dock, they were directly opposite No. 1, warehouse; I suspected they had something in their hats by their walk; I followed them up to the gate and stopped Smith; I asked him what he had got in his hat, he told me nothing at all; I took his hat off, and found concealed in the crown of his hat this brass sheave. The gate-keeper stopped Pipi, we searched him, and found one sheave in his hat. I then took them to the police office. After I returned to the Dock I knew the Prince of Wales came into the Dock the day before, and the head of the pins corresponded in colour with the blocks, and the blocks were without sheaves. I looked inside of the blocks, and the verdigrease corresponded exactly with that on the sheaves, they fitted exactly. I then informed the captain of it.</p>
               <p>- TILLER. I am a constable of the London Dock. I stopped the prisoner Pipi at the gate, I pulled off his hat, and in the crown of his hat was this brass sheave, and in his jacket pocket was this brass pin.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. We went into the London dock, we found the two sheaves and the pin laying among some dirt. Pipi said we may as well take them out and get some beer.</p>
               <p>Pipi said nothing in his defence.</p>

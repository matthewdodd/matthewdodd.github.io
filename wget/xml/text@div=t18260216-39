I had a library of valuable law books and manuscripts. On the 24th of January I went into Devonshire, on account of my father's illness; I returned on Sunday evening, the 5th of February, and on Monday evening, the 6th, about ten o'clock, I was passing my chambers, and on looking up at the window I saw a much greater light than a candle would give- I went up stairs, and knocked loudly at the door several times, but received no answer; I then went to the gate watchman, and on returning up stairs I met a boy, named Sullivan (whose brother had formerly been my clerk) -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160032"></xptr>>he had a common law bag quite full of books and papers- I am sure it was then past ten o'clock. I had Sullivan, Chilmead, and Wilson taken up afterwards, and from their account before the Magistrate, I procured a search-warrant; and on Wednesday or Thursday morning I accompanied Cousins to No.93, Chancery-lane - the name of Torkington and Son is over the door. On entering the shop the first thing that struck my attention was a page of the octavo edition of "Pickering's Statutes," round some butter, which a person was about to take out of the shop- the youngest prisoner was in the shop. The work consists of forty-two volumes; I have lost seventeen of them; they were all safe when I left town, I believe - I can sefely swear that full one hundred and fifty or one hundred and sixty volumes have been taken while I was from town- [four large hampers of books were here produced] - these are all full of books, parts of books, and papers; here is aprt of "Wentworth on Pleadings" - I lost six volumes of that work; here are several parts of volumes of that work; several of these have my own writing on them- here is "Pickering's Statutes," and</p>
               <p>"Cummins' Digest"- I had seven volumes interleaved - they are all here except a volume and a half; here is a manuscript of my own, and another of a late pupil of mine - they were intended of publication. I believe all the papers in these hampers are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. The property to a stranger, in its present state, is only waste-paper? A. Pecisely so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Among thses papers do you find considerable portions of a volume not disjointed? A. There are in many cases volume after volume still cannected together - most of the books are octavo; here are two volumes ouly stripped of their covers, not at all disjointed. I believe the prisoners bear a most irreproachable character.</p>

            . I am ten years old, and live with my mother, who is a tailoress on Clerkenwell-green. On a Monday night I went ot Mr. Moore's chambers, and saw Chilmead, who was convicted on Saturday night; we put some books into a green bag there - the covers were torn off; Thomas Chilmead and Wilson tore them off; we put seven or eight books into the bag - some were large, and some small; the bag was almost full; we could not conveniently carry more. I met Mr. Moore when I had the second bag full - that was as full as I could carry it; I carried it to Mr. Torkington's, in Chancery-lane; I saw Osgood Torkington in the shop; the father was weighing butter on the other side of the shop - there are two counters; I think he could hear what I said to Osgood; I only said I had brought some more paper - he said, "Let me look at it" - I put the bag on the counter - he took some out, and I put some in the scales, and he put some into the scales too; he put in a large and small weight, and paid me 8d. for it; that was for both bags full.</p>
               <p>Q. The bag you took before and the one you took then? A. Yes - he gave me 8d. for each bag - I amd sure of that- I do not know the weight; he gave me a 6d. and 2d.; I delivered him the same quantity as Mr. Moore met me with. When I took the first bag I saw Osgood Torkington; the father was weighing butter then; I asked Osgood if he would buy that paper; he said, Yes, and asked what I wanted for it - I said 4d. a pound; he said he could not give so much as that, he could only afford three half-pence per pound; we put it in the scales, and he gave me 8d. for that also.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time was the father near enough to hear what was said? A. Yes - I believe he heard. I do not recollect anything more that was said; he asked me where the second bag came from - I said from my brother, in Bellyard; he did not ask my brother's name, nor mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not been spoken to on this subject at Bow-street, and other places? A. Yes; I have been in prison a fortnight to night. I was accused as a thief at Bow-street. My brother was formerly a clerk at Mr. Moore's - he is now a writer, and lives at Westminster. We all three tore the covers off the books - I am sure of that; we burnt most of the covers.</p>
               <p>Q. That is as true as all the rest you have said? A. Yes. Wilson said he tore none off, but he did. I had sold some before to Mr. Parker, and knew what he gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did you not get 31/2d. a pound for each bag at Torkington's, and return to your companions and say you got but three half-pence? A. No, I did not, on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not accused at the office of eating cheescakes and custards oftener than they could get them? A. No; I used to eat custards. I sold the paper for 11/2d., because Chilmead said it was better to get that than nothing, and that he did not know any other place where they would buy it. I did not get 31/2d. a pound for it, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, for one of these bags, get half a crown and two shillings? A. No - I got but 16l. for the two bags. My brother has not told me what to say here; he was in the coach which took me to Bow-street, but Mr. Moore and the constable were with us - also Chilmead and Wilson. I work for my mother, at sewing.</p>
               <p>Mr. CARRINGTON. Q. Why did you not take this paper to Fetter-lane? A. They said they did not want any more. I went to Torkington's by Chilmead's direction; I took the second bag about a quarter past ten o'clock - they were just shutting up the shop.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. I accompanied Mr. Moore to the prisoners' house, with a search-warrant, and found three hampers full of books and papers; the other hamper Mr. Torkington lent me, to put the loose papers in, which I found in drawers, and some on a side-board.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CURWOOD. Q. Does not the whole appear to you to be waste paper? A. I should conceive it might be bought for waste paper; I do not know their value; it was produced as soon as time would permit; we generally find stolen goods concealed, but they are generally given up when asked for.</p>

            . I am a printer, and live in Gough-square. I sell a good deal of waste paper - if sold in the ream it is 5d. or 6d. a pound, but in the state this is in 4d. a pound; worse than this is continually sold for 4d. - we sell the author's proofs; 11/2d. is greatly under value - we get 4d. a pound for worse. I should think the bag produced would weigh 8lbs. or 10lbs. if well filled.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. You sell proofs and works which are spoiled? A. Yes. It is ca<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160033"></xptr>>pable of being used for many purposes, which this is not. I know nothing of the sale of old books; all this would fetch 4d. a pound. I have seen books at the booksellers', with the covers cut off, but for what purpose I cannot say. I should not consider this paper, in the state it is now, fit for anything but waste. I should not feel surprised at seeing it sold for waste.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Should you expect to see, as waste paper, books, not only without covers, but still adhering together by their backs - should you think it strange? A. I should certainly require to know where they came from; some of these leaves are connected, but not many; here is one that appears new, but the title page is torn off; here are pages from 913 to 1916, progressively. As a printer I should inquire about this, but what a cheesemonger might think I do not know.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Were you present when they were cut off? A. Yes, and so was Chilmead, but neither of us cut the covers off. Sullivan took the books away in a bag - he brought the money, and laid it on the table; he said he brought 8d., but we could only find 6d.; Chilmead said there was only 6d. - he said he had got three half-pence per pound.</p>

            , JUN. I am the eldest prisoner's son; he was a grocer, and retired from business, but took this shop for my brother; he afterwards came to live there, and helped my brother a little; we usually give 31/2d. and sometimes 4d. a pound for waste paper. I know Sullivan; I cannot exactly say what day it was that he came to the shop - it was one evening, about an hour before the shop was shut up, I think, but cannot exactly say- my brother dealt with him; I saw him pay 5s. 3d. for the paper - it was for one bag; I do not know whether any one else was in the shop except my father; after Sullivan was gone I calculated, by the Ready Reckoner, 18lbs. at 31/2d.</p>
               <p>MR. CARRINGTON. Q. How long was this before the shop was shut? A. It might be about an hour - somewhere about eight or nine o'clock; the paper was in a blue bag. The 5s. 3d. was paid for the contents of one bag - it is a large shop; I did not notice whether any one else was there. I was sweeping by the door as this boy came in; the door-way is about three feet wide - a person might pass me without my knowledge.</p>

            . My husband is a supernumerary porter of Lincoln's Inn. I was at Messrs. Torkingtons' shop, and saw a boy there, who I think was Sullivan; Osgood Torkington and him were weighing paper at the further end of the shop. I was waiting to be served. Old Mr. Torkington was standing at the desk on the opposite side- I saw old Mr. Torkington lay down 4s. 6d. to the boy; when he went to the counter the son had laid down no money. The boy refused the 4s. 6d., saying it was not enough; he went to the scale, and pointed to one weight, and asked Osgood what that weight was; I believe it was between nine and ten o'clock. I heard Osgood call out, after he had weighed the paper, "Eighteen pounds;" that is the reason Mr. Torkington laid the money down, I think- when the boy refused it I heard Osgood say, "Eighteen pounds," pausing a moment, as if he was reckoning, and then say, "five shillings and three-pence;" he went towards the till, and I do not know who gave the remainder of the money; old Torkington laid down half-a-crown and two shillings; I did not see the boy take it up - I saw him leave the shop, and the money was gone then. I should not have taken further notice of it, but my husband saw this affair in the paper, and that brought it to my mind.</p>

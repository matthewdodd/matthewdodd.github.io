                  </hi>. I live at 2 1/2 Scott's-place, Islington, and am the daughter of the deceased, William John Brooks Collins—the prisoner and my father were acquainted, but she did not live at his house—she came there quite intoxicated on 11th December, between 8 and 9 o'clock, and as soon as my father got into the house, she began quarrelling, and they went away to the Crown public-house—they came back in about a quarter of an hour, and stood at the door, and she struck him just over his ear—it seemed like a violent blow—I saw her hands doubled, but did not see any weapon—my father fell over a chair, but did not fall on the ground, as the chair saved him—he sat down on the chair, and said, "If that had been my eye, it would have been a black eye"—he said, in the evening, that his head ached, and next day he complained very much of his head—Mr. Thane, a medical man, was culled in on the Monday—my father was in bed all day on the 22d, and continued in bed till his death—he was only able to attend to his business two or three hours in the day, between the time he received the blow and the time he went to bed—he was a baker—he attended to his business a little time after the doctor came.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 42, Ward's-place, Lower-road, Islington, and am a general dealer—on this evening in December I saw the deceased with the prisoner in a public-house—that is within five doors of Mr. Collins'—they were drinking together, and I heard a Quarrelling between them—the land-lord put the prisoner out—I did not hear her say anything then, but about ten minutes or a Quarter of an hour afterwards, she said she would bury a penny in his head—I saw her waiting about the place after she had been put out; and when Collins came out, she went up to him and knocked his hat off—I did not see her follow him to the shop, where he lived—there was a crowd—they went in the direction where he resided.</p>

Islington, next door but one to where the deceased lived—on 11th December, I heard a quarrel in the public-house, and saw the prisoner pushed out, at a little after 8 o'clock—I saw the prisoner walk up to Collins, knock his hat off, and he went into the middle of the road, and picked it up—he walked past my house, and just as he was going to turn in, I saw her strike him a blow just behind his right ear—he went forward from the effect of it, and seemed as if he was knocked down—that was all I saw—it was a violent blow—I should not have liked to have had it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Springfield House, Canon-bury-square, Islington—on Monday, 17th December, I was called in to see the deceased—he complained of intense pain in the head, especially on the right side—I questioned him as to whether he had received a How—he denied it until the Thursday, when the prisoner called on me—after seeing her I went to see the deceased, and told him that she had called on me, and he said, "She has done for me" or words to that effect, and admitted having received a blow—he became insensible for some days previous to his death—he was partially sensible at times, but not quite rational—that was from about the Saturday when the prisoner was taken—he died at midday on 1st January—I made a post-mortem examination, and found a quantity of fluid effused on the membrane of the brain—the vessels on the right side were very much congested, and there was a quantity of serum in the ventricle or cavity of the brain—there was no clot and no extravasation, but the vessels were very much congested, almost amounting to extravasation—there was no wound or other appearance on the scalp—I cut down through the membranes, and there was no appearance of anything but congestion—there was no black or blue mark, and nothing of a local character; no extravasation of blood under the scalp—I believe that he died from inflammation of the brain, which, I have no doubt, was caused by a blow—I put that down before making the examination—a violent blow on the head with the fist, three weeks before, would be quite sufficient to account for the appearances I found—I have no doubt that he was a man of intemperate habits, which very much increased the effects of the blow—if there had been any external mark three weeks before his death, it most probably would have been absorbed before I made the post-mortem examination; but when I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101280046"></xptr>
               <p>first called in I examined him, and saw no marks of a blow—there was a slight tumefaction, but it is impossible to say whether that was not through a blister he bad been subjected to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might this appearance that you found on the brain be the result of something other than a blow? might it not result from a fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, or violent excitement; but the symptoms were all local—the congestion throughout was on the right side—there was congestion through-out, but principally on the right side—I had attended him on several occasions before—I knew the connexion which existed between him and the prisoner—f found the right lung very much diseased—the left was diseased also, but that was not the cause of death—he could have lived for years—that did not accelerate his death at all—all the other organs were perfectly healthy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you attend him six months ago, when he fell off the omnibus opposite the Thatched House; I fetched you to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember it—I attended him three months ago, when he was waylaid in Green Man's-lane, knocked down, and very much bruised—that might not be the cause of it, for he was about at his business since that, I under<lb></lb>stand; but certainly, a blow received four or five months before would not cause death—the symptoms follow one another in such a manner that it was impossible to mistake them—I think I sent him lotion and cold pump water for his head, now you mention it—he was merely suffering from a black eye then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner produced a written defence, stating that she never struck that deceased; that when she went to see him, he said to her, "Good bye, God blest you and protect you, as I shall not be here long to look after you; for that row a few weeks sines in Green Man's-lane has finished me at last!" that he had also fallen from an omnibus and injured his head, and that he neater alluded to her having given him a blow, not having thought of anything so untrue.</hi>

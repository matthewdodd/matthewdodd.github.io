                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 27th of Aug. the prisoner came to me in the morning, and asked me if I would lend him half-a-crown—he said my husband told him the money was in a bag in the drawer—I went to the drawer, took out the bag, and gave him the money he wanted—he then asked me if I had a fourpenny piece—I emptied the money out of the bag on the table in the middle of my sitting-room, where the prisoner was—I said, "There is not a fourpenny piece"—he said, "Never mind, I must do without"—that was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning—I put the money in the bag again, and put it in the drawer—there was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I remember my husband paying some money to Mr. Knowles about eleven o'clock—I saw my husband take the money and put it into the drawer again—he then went out with Mr. Knowles—my husband came in to dine—I was then in the house, and my two children, and the baby in the cradle—I remained in the house from the time my husband went out at eleven o'clock till one o'clock, and no one had an opportunity of going to the drawer during that time—they could not without my knowing it—my boy is fourteen years old, my little girl is ten—the boy came home with his father to dinner, and after dinner he and his father went out—my son did not go into the bed-room, I am positive—when my husband and son left, there was me and the girl, ten years of age, and the baby in the house—I went out about one o'clock to take my father's dinner, who was at work in a field—I left my daughter Ann in the house, and the baby—before I went out, I shut and fastened the bed-room window, which is on the ground-floor—I then locked the bed-room door, and left home, leaving my little girl at home—I returned home about three o'clock, and was in the house from then till six—when I came home at three my husband was at home—the prisoner called again about six, and brought me the half-crown—I went to put it away where I took it from, and the bag was gone—when I came home at three my husband was at home, at the desk—he did not say anything to me about any loss—when he came home again afterwards, we had some discussion about a shilling, and discovered the loss of the bag—I did not observe whether the window was fastened as I had left it, when I came home at three—it had been open till I shut it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the New Inn at Portland-town, in the parish of St. Marylebone—Radley was my potboy. On 26th Oct. I went to bed about half-past twelve o'clock—I left the place quite secure, I fastened it myself—Radley leaves my premises at ten or half-past—I did not go into the tap-room that night—I had a little puppy, which I missed on the Friday night—I always went into the tap-room to let the dog in there at night, but he was not in the back-parlour, and therefore I did not open the tap-room door, and cannot say whether the window was open or not—the dog was about the house next morning—I do not know what time Radley came that morning—on that morning I missed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a shelf in the bar—there was a half-sovereign, two half-crowns, and the rest was in shillings and sixpences—I last saw it at twenty minutes to one.</p>

               <p>there is no fastening to the window; it only opens nine inches from the top—a person outside would have no difficulty in opening it, but he would have to climb up five or six squares—I do not know precisely what time Radley left that night—any person might have been secreted in the tap-room—any person might get from the tap-room to the bar by pushing the partition out at the bottom, I found it was not secure—a piece of the bottom groove was broken off, which would allow the partition to be pushed out—it could not be opened very wide, for there is a bolt halfway up.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am sexton of the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell: On the 22d of February, at night, I saw all the doors of the church fastened; I was alarmed between one and two in the morning; I got up, I saw a light in the church, all the doors were then fast, except the vestry door, I am sure it had been locked the night before; the look was forced off, and the prisoner was standing by the vestry-door; I then went away with the prisoner, and secured him; I left two watchmen in the church, I locked them both in, and when I came back, I found the pulpit-cushion and the other cushions upon the floor of the vestry, disfigured; I had put them myself into a box the night before under the pulpit; one of the cushions had the lace cut off entirely, and another with it partly clipped off, and the third with the tassels off; the Communion linen I found upon a bench in the vestry, which I had left in a box in the cupboard; we found some tinder, some matches, and a flint; I found three places in the casement of the South side of the church where he had attempted to get in, and in one place I found an apron and the spring of the casement broke off, that was on the South side also; we went back to the watch-house, and he was searched in my presence, and a knife found upon him.</p>

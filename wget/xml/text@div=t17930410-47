               <p>I was robbed of my watch the 1st of April 1791, I saw it again on the 6th of March last 1793; I saw it at the Fountain in Shire-lane, Mr. Rymer had it in possession then; he said he bought it of one John Green, and gave four guineas for it; I swear that is my watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Are you sure you was sober enough to know at the time whether you lost it or whether it was picked out of your pocket? - I lost it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you feel it go out of you pocket? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>This watch I had of Mr. Green about three weeks before Christmas; he gave it me to dispose of in a public manner, I advanced a trifle on it, ten and six pence, and six and six pence; after I had it in my possession about a couple of months I told him I could not sell it, if he would give up the money I had let him have, I would give him the watch; but he said it did not suit him to pay it, so I paid him four guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe the prisoner gave you this watch, that you might exhibit it in a public raffle? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. You was to shew it to every body who might wish to see it? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a man who bears a better character than Green? - I never heard any body give him a bad one.</p>

The prisoner was nearly seven years in my service, and was entrusted to receive money for me; Miss Cummings owed me 1 l. 1 s. 6 d. The prisoner should account to me as soon as he received money; he never gave me the money, I asked him about it. It was not his duty to enter it in the books. I enquired of him about this account among others; he acknowledged that he had received it, and I gave him in charge.</p>

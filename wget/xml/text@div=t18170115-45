Some persons were looking at ribbons at the same counter; the prisoner's companion asked to look at some ribbon, and I showed her some. I saw the prisoner with a piece of ribbon in her hand, it was secreted in her hand; I asked her what she was going to do with it; her companion said she was only looking at it. I took it from her, went up stairs, and told Mr. Death. When I returned, her companion was gone, but the prisoner was sitting by the counter; she said her friend would come back, but she did not. The prisoner was taken into custody. She might have gone away if she chose, when I was up stairs.</p>

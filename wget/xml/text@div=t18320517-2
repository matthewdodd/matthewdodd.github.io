             CLARKSON. I am a proctor, and live in Doctor's-commons. On the 9th of February the prisoner Peacock brought this will to me, to be proved; I am certain of her person - I saw her very frequently; she described herself as the sole executrix named in the will, and in consequence of her instruction I prepared the affidavit which I hold in my hand: I was present when she swore the affidavit, and upon that, probate was issued in the usual course - she afterwards directed me to write to Mr. Heathorn, owner of the ship Eliza, to demand payment of what might be due to the deceased; I do not know whether any body was present then - this was after probate had been granted; she sometimes came to me alone, and sometimes had persons with her; I think she was alone, and sometimes had persons with her; I think she was alone when she brought the will; she was sometimes accompained by Elizabeth Brennan; I do not think that woman attended till after it was alleged the will was forged; I do not recollect that it was her who came at first - after probate was issued, a decree was taken out to recall the will.</p>
               <p>MR. WILSON. I have the decree; here is the original book of the Court, which I produce from the clerk of the papers - it is the original book in which the entries are made by the registrar of the Court; he is the officer who has the custody of the book - I do not know the registrars' hand-writing.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. I believe this to be the hand-writing of Mr. Ingleby, one of the registrars.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Does the will you produce purport to be the will of Shiell or Shields? A.Shields.</p>

            , widow, the party cited, and brought in probate of the will of the party deceased, and appointed William Geering Clarkson to be her proctor - present Frederick Clarkson, who brought in the decree, and declared he opposed the said will; William Geering Clarkson propounded the same, and asserted an allegation on admission the bye day."</p>

               <p>WILLIAM GEERING CLARKSON. In consequence of the suit instituted, Peacock came and retained me as her proctor, to defend the suit; I desired her to come to me, and bring all the witnesses who knew any thing of the transaction - I told her it was intended to be charged as a forgery, and I wished to know what she could bring forward in support of the will: in consequence of this she came to me with the prisoner Driscol and the other subscribing witness, who was Brennan, and another woman, who was not a witness to the will; I do not remember when it was, but it must have been before the day of the allegation - instructions were given to me to prepare the allegation in the suit by all the persons who were in attendance, and whom I have named; they all four spoke to me, in each other's hearing and presence; what they said formed the statements made in the allegation - I do not think it was read over to them after it was prepared; Peacock stated that the deceased called on her, and stated that he was going to sea shortly, and was disposed to make a will before he went, in her favour - that the deceased appointed the time and place in the evening where they should meet to draw up the will- that they met agreeable to the appointment, and the will was drawn up at the time and place named in the allegation; I took the contents of the allegation down from their months - this is it; I drew it up in the beginning of February.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.Have you the original memorandum made from the parties' instructions? A. No, but I drew this paper up within twenty-four hours.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Is the allegation verified by the oath of any person? A. No, the time had not arrived to do that; I expected that Driscol would have verified it - they have never been produced as witnesses in support of it: I have discontinued proceeding in the suit until the result of these proceedings are known; that is all - if it is not taken down so it is a mistake.</p>
               <p>COURT. You may look at the allegation to refresh your memory, but it must not be read. Witness. Mrs. Peacock said the will was executed on the day it bore date, and in the presence of those parties - I asked her who was the writer of the will; she said it was a person who was at sea, a friend of her half-brother's; they stated that the will, when drawn up, was executed by the deceased affixing his mark - I asked them all if the deceased had requested his name to be written for him; they all said he begged his name might be written for him; and then he put his mark to it; I asked Driscol and Brennan if their names subscribed as witnesses at the foot of the will was in their hand-writing; they each of them said it was - I asked if they put their names at the time the deceased executed the will - they both said Yes, and that it was done in his presence; the will was at this time in the registry, and none of them saw it; I had no other business in hand for Peacock at that time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.You used the word deceased - is that what you mentioned to them? A. I might have said testator - it was stated to be the will of Shields, who lately died on board the Eliza.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the name of Shields ever mentioned, or did you speak of him as the deceased or testator? A. They did not attend me on any other subject - I told them there appeared to be a difference in the names set forth in the will and that in the decree; this was previous to drawing the allegation.</p>
               <p>Q.Then the name was the subject of conversation? A. Yes - Peacock had brought the decree to me as soon as she was served with it, and it was then I told her to bring her witnesses; Shield's name was mentioned in the presence of all of them, because I mentioned the difference in the name in the decree - they said they could not profess to say which was right, whether it was Shields or Shiell; Driscol said he had been to Heathborn, the owner of the vessel, to ascer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170014"></xptr>tain the amount of the wages due at the time of the deceased's death; Mrs. Peacock and Driscol went repeatedly to Heathorn - they said so; Driscol said he had been to Heathorn in the presence of all the others - I am not certain whether Brennan said she was present at Heathorn's, or whether it was another woman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe the female prisoner was the first person you saw? A. Yes - she represented herself as executrix; I saw her two or three times before I saw Driscol - I cannot say whether Brennan attended before the whole four, but a woman had attended with Peacock; I should think it was not Brennan - that woman did not enter into the particulars; I did not ask her till I found it necessary to go into the merits; I had not at that time asked Peacock to produce a witness to the will - I think Driscol did attend before the probate was called in; it has not been revoked yet - I had told Peacock the will was suspected to be forged before Driscol came at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When the four were together, did not Mrs. Peacock give the principal circumstances on which you framed the allegation? A.She did - I have paid no money over to any of the parties under the will; I was examined before the Magistrate; Brennan was not examined in my presence- I never saw her before I saw her in the Commons; I am sure she said she was present at the execution of the will on the day of its date, which is the 11th of December, 1830- she said it was her hand-writing; I put the same question to Driscol - Brennan said, that besides Driscol there was a Mr. Cous in the room; I think I understood there were other persons present at the public-house they met at to execute the will - she said Mrs. Peacock, Driscol, herself, Mr. Cous, and the writer of the will, were present; the name of the writer was not mentioned - he was stated to be the brother-in-law of Mrs. Peacock, or the friend of her brother-in-law; she said there were five in all present - I understood the writer of the will was a seafaring man, who was in the South Seas, and I did not trouble myself to have more than three persons as witnesses; I did not require the attendance of the publican, or any of his family; the publican's name was not mentioned, but the sign was stated to be the Nag's Head, Cotton-street, Poplar - nobody from that house was examined in my hearing before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.Was all this statement made in the hearing of Driscol? A. Yes - I had seen him once before on this business.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.When the four persons were there, did not Driscol express a wish to see the will? A. I cannot say whether he did, or did not; it is very likely - if he did I should have said the will was in Court.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did he die on the voyage home? A. A. Yes - it is reported in the log-book; there were wages due to him - I do not know how much; his father made application for them first - Driscol afterwards applied for them, in company with a woman; I have seen Peacock at my office, but whether it was her, or another woman came at that time, I cannot say - (looking at Brennan) I think that is the woman that came with him; I have seen Peacock at my office, but whether she accompanied Driscol I do not know - she came about Shiell's wages; Driscol called on the same subject - we declined giving him any information, because we had paid the wages to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170015"></xptr>father; he said the woman who was with him had the will- what woman that was I do not remember; he threatened to take proceedings against the ship; he said he came to claim John Shiell's wages, who died on board the Eliza-I think I saw him at my office on the subject two or three times, but I am not positive, because I saw him about other ships on many occasions; I saw him there about almost every ship that had been paid - he accompanied the seamen who were to be paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Without referring to the ship's articles, do you know whether John Shiell was a man or a boy? A. No - there are names here without marks, which are attested; a dot means that they are all attested - Marshall has attested the four first names.</p>
               <p>Q.There is no witness to the name of John Shiell? A. Yes - there is no attesting witness' name; the sum 1l. 5s, per month against it, in the column, is not a lighter ink than the rest - the designation of a landsman on the list would apply to a boy, as well as a man.</p>
               <p>ANDREW SHIELL. I have every reason to believe this name to the ship's articles is my son's writing; he wrote an excellent hand - I received letters from him at Spithead after he left; I live at Camberwell - my son went three voyages before this; the letters I received from him are dated on board the ship Eliza, and I know them to be his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Tell me whether you will swear the signature to these articles to be his hand-writing? A. I cannot swear positively, but believe it to be so; there is a great variance in person's hand-writing at different times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You know your son could write? Yes - he was a tall thin lad, about five feet ten inches; I got this log-book from the chief mate of the Eliza - it is my son's private log-book on board that ship, and in his hand-writing; I received my son's payment on the 5th of January -I received all he was entitled to.</p>
               <p>MR. HEATHORN re-examined. The party applied to me after the crew were paid; we did not state that we had paid the wages, but declined giving any information; I paid the wages myself, and paid them in cash - I never mentioned to Driscol that I had paid the father; we always declined giving any information - I cannot tell what my clerks may have done.</p>

               <p>Q. At the bottom of it is John Shields, his mark, and then a cross, was that so when you saw it? A. Yes, and so was this name of Cornelius Driscol - there was no other name to it then; Peacock produced it to ask if I would put my name to it - I did so; that was early in January - I afterwards accompanied her to Mr. Heathorn's; I did not go in with her, but waited outside - I only went that once; I have had no conversation with Driscol on it is business - I afterwards went to Mr. Clarkson's, the proctor, in Doctors'-commons, with Mrs. Peacock, as Mr. Clarkson requested to see me; nobody but Mrs. Peacock was present - I never went but once; I have had no conversation wit Driscol about this business on any occasion; I was never at Clarkson's when he was there.</p>

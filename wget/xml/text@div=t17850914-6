               <p>What age is your little boy? - Ten years of age.</p>
               <p>Do you think your little boy knows the nature of an oath? - I do not think he does, I never heard him say any thing more than that he was frightened and ran away; he gave no particular description of the circumstances or the person.</p>

               <p>Did he say any thing about what coloured hair he had? - I do not remember, I think he said darkish hair.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is that the knife? - It was a larger than that to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How came you to describe the person who robbed you, if you knew him so well, to have lank black hair? - It appeared so to me then.</p>
               <p>But if you knew him by sight before that, you knew what colour his hair was before? - He has had his hair cut since, it was in curls then, it appeared to me to be black, I never saw him close, I am quite positive this is the man.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Grays Inn, I have chambers there, I am not of the law, I am a coal merchant, I know the prisoner, he was servant to Mrs. Hales, No. 82, Queen Ann-street, when first I knew her; I was at Mrs. Hales's drinking tea, and spending the evening on which the robbery was, which I believe was the 2d of July.</p>
               <p>How came you to recollect it? - When I went again the Wednesday following, the servant told me, good God! poor Jack is taken up for a robbery; and when I went into the parlour Mrs. Hale told me the same; I had spent the evening the Saturday before, and on that night I believe about ten, I went into the garden or yard; Mrs. Hales stables and coach-house stand in the garden, but no communication to it; I saw a light through that window that looks into the garden, I was a good deal alarmed thinking it might be fire or thieves, and I knew that young Mr. Hale and the foot boy were below somewhere; I called Mrs. Hale out, says I, have you any body in the stable, no, says she; I immediately went round, and took the present foot boy with me, the watch was then going his rounds; I stopped and made the boy get a ligh from a woman in the Mews, and I still saw the light in Mrs. Hale's premises, all at once it was put out; the watchman was then going ten: I took the key and opened the door, and who should present himself in black, but the prisoner at the bar, says I, good God! Jack, what do you do here, he rather seemed to hesitate, I insisted on knowing what he did there, he said he was looking for a dog, I told him it was a very improper hour to look for a dog with a light, I believe by this time the watch was going half after ten; the prisoner then came out, and went to a cottage over the way in the Mews, but whether he went in there I do not know; I came back to let Mrs. Hale know, and she then told me that her son had just told her, he had given him leave to sleep in the stable, in the coachman's room, to save a lodging while he was out of place, but that it was unknown to her before.</p>
               <p>How old is Mrs. Hales son? - Between fifteen and sixteen, I believe; upon that she was very uneasy, but I took the watchman and went and examined very carefully, and found all very safe; I saw no more of the prisoner after he went out to go to the Mews, but that very evening I called there, I said I will cross the rope walk, in going over two men attacked me, and made a push at me, and bid me stop, and one of them was so like the prisoner, that had the prisoner been at liberty, I could positively have sworn to him.</p>
               <p>What was that young man dressed in? - I do not know, it was a very dark night, he was in a dark dress, the man who stopped me appeared to have prodigious black hair, I observed he was a very black man, but I cannot swear to his hair.</p>
               <p>Was this young man's hair when you first knew him lank or curled? - I cannot say, I did not take any notice, he used sometimes to wear his hair curled when he was with Mrs. Hale, but it was oftener lank then curled.</p>
               <p>Jury. How far may it be from this stable, to the place where this gentleman said he was robbed? - I imagine it is near four hundred yards, you are obliged to come up Queen Ann-street, and down Ogle Court, and down the rope walk.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Brown. Mrs. Hales lives three doors below me.</p>
               <p>What clothes was the man dressed in when he stopped you on the Wednesday? - I believe he was in black, I sprung from him, and gave him his own salutation back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140016"></xptr> again, which was not a very gentleman-like one, there were two men.</p>

               <p>The prisoner lived with me and my son four years, and behaved exceedingly well, and had my son been living, he would have appeared in his defence, but he is dead; he looked after the horses, he laid in the house on the Saturday night before he was taken up; he laid in our stables that particular evening, my youngest son saw him about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Do you remember when he was taken up? - I heard of it about three or four days after he was taken up; the robbery was on the Saturday, and he was not taken up till the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>When did you hear he was taken up? - Upon my word, I cannot say, it was two or three days after, I fancy it might be about Wednesday or Thursday, a gentleman came and told me of it, a coach-maker that does our business came and asked me about it, I did not know that he laid in the coach-house.</p>
               <p>Was it with your knowledge that he lay in your stable? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>When did you first know it? - That very night, that was on the Saturday, a gentleman that supped at our house went in the garden, and said, there is a light in your coach house, and he came back, and said, there is Jack there; and then my son said, mother, he lays there. I have frequently entrusted the prisoner with money and drafts. That gentleman was Mr. Kinnersley; it was about half an hour past ten that this happened.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Brown. Do you recollect about what time it was that your apprentice was out? - He was not out above ten minutes, I believe it was not above ten minutes under or over half past ten, I cannot be more particular.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Was there more than one in black, at the time of the robbery? - No there was not, they had short jackets on, I think one was a butcher.</p>
               <p>Have you any means of fixing what o'clock it was when this happened to you? - It was about half after ten, I cannot fix it more near.</p>
               <p>How long has the prosecutor lived with you? - Two years.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the person of the prisoner, seeing him at any time as a neighbour? - I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you know where Mrs. Hales lived? - No, Sir, not then.</p>
               <p>Where did you see the prisoner? - At the public house, it was after he had left his place.</p>

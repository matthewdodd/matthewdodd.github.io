About the 6th of March Edwards came to my shop—I had known him before—he brought Madell with him, and said he was a highly respectable tradesman in the habit of selling watches and chains, and he required some chains to show to a gentleman he was about selling a watch to—he said I might trust him—they selected three chains—Madell said he wanted them to show to a gentleman he was about selling a watch to—I said,</p>

               <p>if one was sold I should expert cash—Madell said, "Certainly," and if not sold they were to be returned—they went away—I heard nothing more about them for three or four days—I then went to Edward's place of business—he was not there—I then met him, and he said he would go to Madell's and see about him—I expressed myself surprised at their not being returned—I after<lb></lb>wards saw Madell at No. 2, Wellington-street—I went to took after my chairs—I told him I insisted on having them back directly—he said he would go to the gentleman, who was a customer, at Knightsbridge, and get them that evening—I afterwards met Edwards, and I said it was not a debt, and I should take proceedings—shortly Madell called, and left two of the chairs—I have not got the other chain, nor do I know where it is—I spoke to Edwards about that—I asked him if he knew what sort of a character Madell was, and if he had heard of some proceeding going on—he said yes, and he was much astonished, for had know him some time, and thought him a respect<lb></lb>able man, and that he should have nothing more to do with him.</p>

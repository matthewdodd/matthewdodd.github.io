                  </hi>. I was at the company's office on 10th September—I did not receive any debentures that day—they were not delivered till some time after; it may have been four or five weeks after—I received them, and signed for them—it is my belief that I received 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—a few days prior to 10th September, or on the morning of that day, the pri<lb></lb>soner told me that he was required to furnish a certificate—he said he could furnish them with the certificate of the Government engineer if they desired it, he was so confident of the work—I heard from him that the debentures would not be issued without a satisfactory certificate, a certificate of some extra amount of work done on the line subsequent to the last—about 52,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of debentures had been issued previous to this 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—those were the last debentures I received; and there had been sham to the amount of 59,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but they were issued by the old company, pro<lb></lb>moting, not the present company—that is 59,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in nominal value—I knew they had been issued to Mr. Buck well—I think I went to the office about a week after 10th September—we were waiting for this certificate—he went there, in pursuance of some request, to see the directors about the issue of some more debentures, to satisfy them as to the work done—I under<lb></lb>stood from him that he could give them a satisfactory certificate of the work done; if they required it, he could give them the Government engineers—I was in the room on one or two occasions; but I never heard any promise of that kind in the room, or any resolution about the issue—the prisoner after<lb></lb>wards told me that 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of debentures would be issued, and he desired me to look after them when he went to Italy—he left directions for them to be given to me—I merely understood that he had satisfied the directors to induce them to issue them—there was some delay in getting the certifi<lb></lb>cate; it was mislaid in the company's office, and I remember directing a telegram to be sent to Mr. Buck well to forward it—I had no conversation</p>

               <p>with him about it afterwards, he went away to Italy so quickly afterwards to go on with the work—I understood he was going to send a certificate; he told me so—I can't remember how shortly after that he returned—he was very seldom away more than three or four weeks—I had no further conver<lb></lb>sation with him about the certificate soon after his return; I had subse<lb></lb>quently, a considerable time afterwards, when there was some dissatisfaction at the office about it—he then said that the two men signing the certificate were the best men to certify to the works that were done there; one was an engineer, and the other had charge of the goods, and knew the value of the goods that were put on the line—I did not learn from him, in the first instance, who Harry Fisher was—I think I mentioned to him who I had heard he was; that I understood he was the son of the sub-contractor, not an engineer, and that he was described as a very young man; I don't know the age—it was then that he said he was a very fit man to certify, because he had charge of all the goods on the line, and knew their value—I think he admitted that he was the son of the sub-contractor, but I really don't remem<lb></lb>ber exactly what he said—he did not deny it; he tacitly admitted it—I have seen Harry Fisher once within the last six months; I should fancy he was more than 19, I should say from 20 to 22—he is not an engineer that I know of—I have no knowledge—he certainly could not be the Government engineer—I do not, of my own knowledge, know who Del Papa is—I knew from Mr. Buck well that he was employed by him on the line as an engineer, and had been for some time—I have heard more than once from Mr. Buck<lb></lb>well, that he was employed on the line as an engineer or a surveyor; I do not discriminate between the two; he was engaged upon engineering works—the certificate was shown to me at the office some month or two after the date of it, after I had received the debentures—Mr. Buckwell was not then present—I am not aware that it was shown to him on any occasion—I have no recollection of mentioning to him the fact that I had seen it—I do not remember being present in the board-room when there was a conversation about a telegram—I remember taking a telegram which they said was insuf<lb></lb>ficient; Mr. Buckwell was not there then—I don't recollect Mr. Buckwell laying anything more about Fisher than I have mentioned—I remember calling his attention to the certificate signed by Fisher, and that the com<lb></lb>pany were not satisfied with it, and it was then he said that Fisher was the proper man—I don't remember that he told me who in particular had sent over the certificate, or who had obtained it—I think I understood from him that it was Charles Collins.

                  </hi>. I am a member of the bar, and am one of the directors of this company—I was present at a meeting of the board when the prisoner was there in September 1861, when he asked for some more debentures to be issued—I should not ordinarily see the handwriting of the minute-book, the secretary would read it out—the prisoner was asked what amount of work had been done, and he made a statement as to the amount of work—I cannot recall the figures; I think it was that a considerable amount had been done since the last issue of debentures, and he wished for a fresh issue to meet the work done—as far as I can recollect, he was told that he could have a fresh issue if he could show that the work had really been done—he offered to produce a certificate that work had been done to an extent exceeding the amount of debentures he asked for, and he proposed that that certificate should be signed by two persons, whom he mentioned, and he gave an</p>

               <p>account of who they were—as far as I can recollect, he stated them to be persons holding considerable positions; and the board, so far as I can recol<lb></lb>lect, passed a resolution; I think they agreed to it in his presence, that if he would produce such a certificate, they would issue the debentures—I think he attended the board the following month—I have no means of knowing whether that was after or before the debentures had been issued—I think he attended then on the subject of sending out a cargo of rails—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect any conversation with him about the certificate—I think I was present at a subsequent meeting when the debentures were issued—the secretary had reported that he had received the certificate—unless we had believed that a proper certificate from a competent person had been lodged, we should not have issued the debentures—I should have no power, as a single director, to depart from the resolution of the board—I had nothing to do except to act as one of the two directors, to attach signatures for the issue of the deben<lb></lb>tures—no debentures were issued to Mr. Buckwell subsequently to those which were issued in virtue of that certificate.</p>

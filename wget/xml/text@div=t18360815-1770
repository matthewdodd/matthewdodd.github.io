                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Lovegrove and Co., Cloak-lane. On the 27th of July I was standing at the door where I live, in Basing<lb></lb>hall-street, and saw a lad, named Collis, come out of Buckler and Bux<lb></lb>ton premises, about half-past seven or twenty minutes before eight o'clock in the morning—he had a bag on his shoulder—knowing he did not be<lb></lb>long to the firm I suspected all was not right, and followed him to Alder<lb></lb>manbury—I overtook him, and asked him what he had got—he said, "No<lb></lb>thing, "and then he said it was wool, but it was not his—I returned, and just after, Billings followed him—he joined him, and I thought it my duty to follow them—they went up Golden-lane to Baltic-street, St. Luke's—I saw them go into a house in Baltic-street—I followed them in just after, and found the prisoner there, in bed—I told him I thought the boys com<lb></lb>ing there,</p>

               <p>was doing wrong, and asked him where they were—he made no exact reply—I went into the back yard, and found the boys hid in the water-closet—they came out with me and went into the room where the prisoner and his wife were—I told the prisoner I considered he was doing very wrong by taking the bag of wool in there—he said he did not intend to keep it—and then the boys and me came away together—we came little way, and I sent Billings back to fetch the bag of wool, and he brought a bag with wool—I did not see him go in—I went back to the house after the boys were in custody, and said to the prisoner, "Walter, Billings confesses you have bought some of him before"—he replied, "Never but once, and that was nothing but pickings or sweepings, but not so good at this"—the wool had not been produced in my presence—I should not think there was time for it to have been shown to him, from the time the boys went into the time I entered, but the wool was left behind, and he had time to look at it—then he said he meant to have sent it away if the boy did not fetch it—the boys both saw me just before they entered the door—they did not take the wool there by my directions.</p>

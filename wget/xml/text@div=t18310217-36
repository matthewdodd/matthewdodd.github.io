On Friday night, the 14th of January, I sent her out for my beer for supper, about ten o'clock, and as she did not return I went into the kitchen, and then to her room - I found all her clothes were gone; I missed a shawl and a bonnet of mine, which I had not given to her at any time - I have seen them since, and know them to be mine; she came to my house again on the Monday - I did not use any threat or promise to her; I went up, and said, "Come in, Maria?" she said, "No; you accuse me of robbing you;" I said, "Yes, you have robbed me;" she at first refused, but at last came in, and said she had taken the shawl by mistake, and she understood I gave her the bonnet - I had never led her to believe that she might have it; I had lent it her to go out, but I intended to use it again - I do not think she had worn it to go out for the beer; she was not in the habit of wearing either bonnet or shawl at that time, and she had a good shawl of her own - I gave her into custody.</p>

I went to No. 17, King-street, Drury-lane, on the Monday after the 14th of January - the prisoner came up stairs; I asked her how she came to rob her mistress - she said her mistress gave her the bonnet, and the shawl she had taken by mistake; I advised her to go to her mistress, which she did - she gave me up the shawl, and had another shawl on at the time.</p>

            . While she lived with me she behaved very well - I advanced her money to get some things; I afterwards saw her in the street with this child in her arms, and agreed to take her again - the child was not ill; she went out that day to get relief from the parish - she should have come home at three o'clock, but did not till eight; I then sent her for the supper beer, and she did not return.</p>

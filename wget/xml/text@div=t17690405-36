               <p>Q. When was the prisoner and you together?</p>
               <p>Westcott. It was some time on a Monday: I cannot tell the day of the month. We went to Mr. Grece's house: he is a taylor, and lives in <placeName id="t17690405-36-crimeloc196">North-Alley, York-buildings</placeName>

               <p>Q. How did you get into his house?</p>
               <p>Westcott. The door was upon the latch; we went up into Duke's Place, and Tresler disposed of them for three guineas and a half. I staid at a corner of a street the while. I was not with him at the time he sold them; he told me he sold them to a Jew, named Lyon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any share of the money?</p>
               <p>Westcott. I had a guinea and a half, and two shillings of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you take the things?</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Grece, On Monday the 13th of February, in the afternoon, Mr. Grece went out, and gave me orders to go to a gentleman for some things. I brought them home, and laid them down on the table; the things mentioned in the indictment. Whether I shut the outward door or not, I cannot tell. As it grew dark, I was called down to put up the window shutters. I then found the things were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any of the things since?</p>
               <p>Copage. No, not till Wesoott gave me a piece of the night-gown, which I have here. We had a search-warrant from my Lord Mayor to search the Jew's house, named Lyon. I took an old coat under my arm, and went to Duke's Place. I said I would sell it. I went to Lyon's house, they said he was not at home. I said, Did not a person sell some gold and silver waistcoats here the day before? They said, Yes. When Lyon came in, I asked him the same, he said he did buy them; then I searched his house, but there was not a rag of cloth in the house, except some linen, and an old waistcoat. When he found what we were upon in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050024"></xptr> searching, then he said he had not bought them.</p>

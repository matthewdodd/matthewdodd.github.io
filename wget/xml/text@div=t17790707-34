I took him backwards to a place contiguous to the shop and shewed him some gold watches. I put down a quantity before him; I told them as I put them down; he desired to see another parcel; I took that parcel away; I told them again, and missed one. I laid them on one side, and shewed him another parcel; I told them as I laid them down; when I took that parcel away I likewise missed one of them; he desired then to see some silver watches; I bid my man shew him some; he shewed him seven, and I missed one of them. The prisoner was then about going away; I told him he had some watches of mine about him, and threatened to send for a constable; upon which he stripped off his coat and waistcoat, but I could find no watches there; then he pulled off his breeches, and between his breeches and a pair of drawers I found a gold watch; we got a constable and took him to Sir

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Webb. The prisoner came to my master's shop on the 21st of June and asked for medals, and if we sold watches wholesale for exportation; I told him we did; he said he would come the next day; he came again on Wednesday the 23d; I told my master that was the man that had been on the Monday; we went backwards and shewed him some watches; I suspected him, and told my master my suspicions; my master shewed him some gold watches; my master gave me a hint that he had got one; he shewed him some more, and then gave me another hint. My master then got down the silver watches and I shewed them to him.</p>

               <p>I have been led unfortunately into these affairs; I do not know how to get rid of them. He said he believed I was concerned with some people that had defrauded him of several hundred pounds and he would punish me for all. I put the watch in my pocket by mistake.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mr. Webb. You lost three watches? - The silver watch he as artfully put on the table as he had taken it off when he was charged.</p>
               <p>Did you find the other gold watch? - No, that is lost. I insisted he had another watch; he said he had not; the gold watches are tied with blue strings, the silver watches with catgut. I undid all the parcels of watches to see if it was not in some of them, but could not find it. I thought then it might by mistake have got among the silver watches. I undid them, and saw a watch with a blue string, upon which I concluded that was the watch. We can only see the strings, the watches are all in leather bags; but afterwards when we came to take the watches out of the cases I found it was a silver watch. I then went to Sir

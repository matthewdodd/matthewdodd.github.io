                  </hi>. I am storekeeper to Mr. Richard Gilbert and another—they are extensive printers in St. John's-square, Clerkenwell—the prisoner Connell was in their service—he took Mr. Sedgwick and me to No. 3, Co<lb></lb>lonnade, Brunswick-square—when we got there Connell went in—it appeared like a <hi rend="italic">cobbler's</hi> shop—there was a very bad light in the shop—there appeared to be lasts and bottles—Connell remained in about ten minutes, and I re<lb></lb>mained outside with Mr. Sedgwick—we then went in and I saw the prisoner Young—I told him we came about some property that the boy Connell said he had sold given him—Young said yes, he had some which he bought of the boy, and he had given him 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for it—he said he had bought brass of the boy, but that he told him the foreman gave it him—he said he did not know where the boy lived or where he worked, but he believed it was somewhere down the Strand way—he said it would be very hard that he should lose the money after giving a fair price for it—I told him I did not believe he would lose the money if he had acted fairly in the transaction—he then, after some further conversation, said if we would retire from the shop, as he had no one to leave in the shop, he would go below and bring up the brass—we retired from the shop—he shut the door, and appeared to fasten it—I heard a noise—we remained outside a few minutes—he than opened the door, we went in, and he produced a bag, and placed it on the counter, from which he took seven packages of this brass-rules broder—this is one of the seven packages he took out of the bag—he placed them in a scale and weighed them—they weighed 25 1/2 lbs.—he again said it would be very hard for him to lose the money—we took it away. but he seemed very much to wish us to pay for it—I said we were not empowered to pay for it, but I gave him the direction of my employers, and said they were honourable men, and if they thought he had dealt honestly they would pay him, he would not lose anything by it—he</p>

               <p>said he would rather be paid then—I said if he did not give it up I should call in a policeman, and have it taken by force—he gave it up, and said he would try to call in the morning—I went the next day with Archer, the policeman—the policeman told him he had come about some brass which he had bought of a boy—he said, "I have found two or three more pieces, I was coming down with them"—I saw two or there pieces at the end of the counter—I observed, "That is not all, I know there were more pieces similar to that I took away the evening before"—he said he did not know of any more, he had searched, and could not find any more—the policeman then went into the parlour, and I saw him take from under the bureau this brass wheel, (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it was on the ground, near one of the legs of the bureau—the policeman then said he must search the cellar—Young said he had no more, but he unlocked the cellar, and the policeman and myself went in—the policeman turned over a quantity of brass gas-fittings and other things, and I observed this brass fork, and this brass shooting-stick—Young said something when we found them, but it was so low I could scarcely tell what he said—he said he brought things of any one that came, and then the police<lb></lb>man told him he must consider himself his prisoner—we told Young that Connell was in trouble about these things—I do not know the value of this brass-rule.</p>

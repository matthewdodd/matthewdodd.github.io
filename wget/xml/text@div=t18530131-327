                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, Elm-place, Lee, and am a labourer. In Oct. the prisoner lodged in the same house, and slept in the same bed with me—I went out at 4 o'clock in the morning on 27th Oct.; I left the prisoner in bed—I returned on Friday evening, the 29th—when I returned all my clothes were gone, and the money which I had left in my breeches, which was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had seen my clothes on the Monday and Tuesday before I left—I did not see the prisoner again till he was taken—he had been working at Mr. Mortimer's directly opposite—he left his work at that time, and went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Pope; I keep the house where the last witness and the prisoner lodged. The prisoner left on 27th Oct., early in the morning—he gave me no notice—I looked for his coming home to breakfast, and he never came—he was promised a winter's work, and I expected he would have stayed all the winter—he had paid his money on the Saturday—he owed me the half week when he went away—he went by the name of George Baker—I am quite certain he is the same man—the witness went out early that morning to go to work—the prisoner came down about an hour after the witness, about a quarter past 5 o'clock, and I called to know what he was doing, getting up so soon to bum candle in waste, and he went back again—I called him in general a little before 6 o'clock; he had only a few minutes to go to his work—I went up to the room where they had slept a few minutes after 8 o'clock, when I was expecting him in to breakfast—they are very exact in coming in, as their time is short—when I went up I turned up the quilt, and there I saw a pair of clean stockings which I had put into Loft's box—I went to put them away, and found his box was empty, except one dirty shirt, which was the prisoner's—I went down again, and in a few minutes I went to his employer's, and I could not find him—he did not come back for his little wages—I had seen the box on the Tuesday, and put the stockings in it—the things were all in the box on the Tuesday, and on the Wednesday they were gone—two men, a carpenter and a gardener, slept in the front room, and they are there now.</p>

I took the prisoner—while he was in my custody be asked if I had been to his aunt's, at Stratham, to inquire for Baker—I asked if he went by the name of Baker—he said, no, but persons who knew him when young might call him Baker, because his mother's name was Baker.</p>

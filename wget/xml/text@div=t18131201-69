On the day my master's house was robbed a man came down the area steps; he opened the kitchen door; he asked me for Mr. Gradon, a fellow-servant of mine, the footman. I told him he was not at home, but I thought he would soon return, from the time he had been out, on account of dinner. He then asked my leave to wait; I said, by all means.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sit down - A. He was just bending himself to sit down as the parlour bell rung. I immediately went up, and left no one in the kitchen but the prisoner. I went into the dining-room, and while I was in the dining-room the street door bell rang. I went to the street door, and when I opened the door, a stranger (another man) appeared, he also asked me for Gradon.</p>
               <p>Q. He asked you for the same fellow-servant as the prisoner had asked you - A. Yes; the man asked me how long Gradon had lived with us, and said he supposed he might see him at three o'clock. I said, you may see him any time this afternoon. No other conversation passed. He turned towards Russell-square; then I shut the door. I went into the dining-room immediately, and took the tray. I saw the same man return by the dining-room window; he was then coming back from Russell-square. I took the tray down stairs into the kitchen, and saw the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the prisoner is the man that you left in the kitchen - A. Yes, I feel quite confident of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did Gradon come home - A. I saw him come home the next morning. When I found the man at the bar was gone, I went up the area steps immediately, thinking the prisoner knew the other person that came.</p>
               <p>Q.When you went up the area steps did you find the man that was missing - A. No, I could not discover one or the other. I went back again; I went into the pantry, and saw the tray of plate was gone. I had seen the tray of plate in the pantry about three minutes before the prisoner came in the kitchen. I then took a silver fork out to carry up stairs. Gradon did not come home till the next morning. I did not tell Gradon of it, nor did my fellow-servant. I screamed out when I missed the plate; my mistress immediately came down; the intelligence was sent to my master; my master came home with Vickrey, a Bow-street officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What plate was missing - A. I cannot exactly say; my master valued it at one hundred pounds. We found more lost afterwards than what is in the indictment. The tray was full of plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when this circumstance was old to Gradon - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this was any steps taken by Gradon and you - A. Yes; I described the man to Gradon, his dress, and every thing, so far as I was able. This happened on Friday, the 12th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Gradon did not return till Saturday morning - A. No. On Sunday morning, Gradon and I went to the Spanish chapel to see if the prisoner was there. We did not see him there. Then we went to the Crown public-house in Clipstone-street; we sent to the prisoner's house, No. 11, Clipstone-street. I believe he is in lodgings. The prisoner's wife came. We did not see the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see the prisoner - A. Not till I saw him in a public-house in Fenchurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you since seen a coat that you know - A. I have since seen a coat that was the colour of the coat the prisoner had on. I did not see the prisoner until he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the persons call again that had called for the prisoner - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw the prisoner had you the least doubt of him - A. No, I had not. I knew his face then, though he was dressed in a different way. He was dressed clean when he came to enquire for the footman, and when he was taken in custody he was shabby.</p>

               <p>Q.Before you went into the service of Mr. Clements had you known the prisoner - A. Yes, about two years at different times.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you made any communication to him respecting your family - A. I mentioned to him that the young man that kept company with my daughter, his name was Watts; he lived as butler with Mr. - . I do not exactly recollect the gentleman's name. I told the prisoner that just before I went into the service of Mr. Clements.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever introduced him to Watts - A. Never, I believe he might have seen him, but never to have known him. He walked with him once on the 17th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day on which your master's plate was missing - A. Yes. I was out of my master's house that day. I did not return the whole day. I returned at seven o'clock the next morning. I went out with a message for my master; I stopped out without leave. My master told me of the plate being missing about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you suspect to be the person that stole the plate - A. The prisoner from the description of the maid servant. I suspected Carey and Johnson, from the description the maid servant gave me; in consequence of that suspicion we went on the Sunday following to the Spanish chapel, with a vew if we could see any person of my acquaintance. After that we went to Clipstone-street. We sent a message from the public-house to the prisoner's house, to know if the prisoner was at home; his wife came. On the Wednesday following, Watts called upon me, to know why the prisoner called at his master's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010054"></xptr>house. In consequence of what Watts said, the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the place where the book is usually kept - A. No. He asked me the favour to put him on the book present on Friday, on the 12th; I told him I would put him on the book, or cause him to be put on the book sick.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he was ill or well - A. At this time he told me he was ill on Friday, and I believed he was ill on the Friday, seeing him look so bad. He rather paused about it, still wished to be put on the book as present; I told him I would do what I could, if I did not put him on the book, Mr. Nash should.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean sick, do not you - A. Yes; that ended the conversation at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the day did you see him again - A. Yes; he asked me whether he was put down on the book as present. I told him, no, he was put down sick; I dare not put him down any other way; I should have been discharged if I had. He was very unhappy and uneasy. We were together some time. We went and had some beer together after. He said he was unhappy and uneasy. I said, oh, my God, Carey, what have you been doing; I am sadly afraid you have been guilty of a robbery. I said that because I saw him so agitated.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did he make to that - A. Yes, I have. Oh, my God; I said who saw you. The maid. That is all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass after that - A. No. We both went home; I went my way, and he went his. I did not tell any body of this for three or four days: I believe I first told the Commodore Gentry of it. I have known him five years and three months; I never knew any thing amiss of him; I would trust him with any thing.</p>
               <p>MR. CLEMENTS. I live at 51, Woburn-place. My house is in the parish of St. George's Bloomsbury, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the plate you lost - A. Between sixty and seventy pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The reason I asked Mr. Everest to put me down in the book sick, the Company only allows two days to be absent in a month. I never did the robbery; I am accused falsely, so help me God.</p>

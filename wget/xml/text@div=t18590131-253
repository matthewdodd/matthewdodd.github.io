I live with my father at 16, Plumb-row, Bethnal-green—on 12th January I put up the shutters at night all safe—I was awoke about half-past 3 o'clock by the shutters rattling—got up, looked out, and saw the prisoner walk across the road—I went to bed again, but was awakened at about quarter to 5 by the shutters falling, and saw the prisoner smashing at the window—I halloed to him, and he put his arm through, laid hold of a timepiece, and ran away towards Shore-ditch—I am sure it was he—there was a gas-light right opposite my window—there was a policeman at the window, and I described the prisoner to him—they brought him back about three minutes afterwards, and I iden<lb></lb>tified him—he had nothing with him—he is the man—I heard the voices of three but could not see the other two.</p>

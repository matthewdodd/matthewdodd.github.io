                  </hi>. I was present on 19th April at the trial of Scott <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Danks, before Mr. Clive—the prisoner was examined as a witness—Scott produced a document, and placed it in the prisoner's hands; the prisoner was called because he was the attesting witness to the instrument—he swore that he wrote the body of it, and that Joshua Danks signed it, and that he witnessed it, and that "H. Croft Ryland" was his signature—there is some peculiarity in this which struck me; it is in the final "s" in Danks, and the letter "s" in the body.</p>

               <p>this money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was about three days after he sighed the bill—it was on the 11th he applied last, the day before it was due—it became due on Sunday—he came on Saturday for the money—that was after Ryland had been—I told him that Ryland had been—Ryland had also been on the 11th for the money, and promised to come again the same evening, but he never came—I did not tell Mr. Scott that I could not pay it, but I would pay him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I know nothing about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about three days after that I offered him half a crown, and said, "If you will take it, there will be 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. left on my bill"—I am sure it was the day before the money was due that he came—he did not bring the document with him, or I would have paid him—I told him I would pay him if he had the document, because I had that same morning seen the document in the possession of Ryland—that was the reason I asked for the document; I mean the document in the book—Ryland had come in the morning, and Mr. Scott came in the evening—I told Ryland if he came in the evening I would pay him—I thought as it came due on the Sunday, it was payable on the Saturday—he said that Mr. Scott had sent him—he did not come in the evening, but Mr. Scott came instead—I had seen the document in Ryland's possession in the morning—I wanted 'to see it again in the evening, because I disputed Mr. Scott's having it—Ryland told me in the morning that Mr. Scott should not have it; if Mr. Scott had produced it I would have paid it—I thought it was still tin the prisoner's possession—I would not pay without it being given up to me—I never said to Mr. Scott that I could not pay the whole, and offer him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I offered him half a crown a few days after I had first signed the document, when I found that my brother had left me—I did not say that I would pay him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from time to time, as I could—I have no recol<lb></lb>lection of anything of the sort—I do not believe I have any doubt about it—I did not say so—I neither offered him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. occasionally, only the half a crown a week—I had offered him that a long time before—if he had taken the half crown a week there would have been 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid at this time—that was about three days after I had given the security.</p>

                  </hi>. I do not know Danks's handwriting—this is the docu<lb></lb>ment that was produced to me; I first received it on 17th March, after I had had the first hearing—I got it from the prisoner's son's house; I do not know whether it was from his son's wife, or who: it was not the prisoner; but I saw him about two minutes afterwards, and said, "Here is a note or paper left for me how is this? I ought to have had it in the morning"—he said he did not know anything about it, it was a mistake, he supposed—I said, "You ought to have gone up with me this morning to the trial"—he said he did not see that—I said, "Yes, you ought; I saw you in the morning, and told you; you said the copy of the document I had was quite sufficient, and you could not spare the time, so I went alone, and so I got beaten; I will put it in force again, and bring you up as a witness"—he said, "Very well, I will go as a witness"—he seemed surprised that I had lost it; he did not suppose I should be beaten—he said, "Well, this document, and the I O U in the book, will beat them the next time, there is no doubt of it"—I showed him the document then, and he said, "That is the document that Danks gave me"—this was on 17th March, after I had had my hearing—I had never seen that document before—I went to him on the evening of 18th April, and told him, "I must have you to-morrow"—he said, "I don't knew that I can go; is the trial to-morrow?—I said, "Yes, I must have you with me"—he said, "Time is time"—I said, "Will you have a glass of something to drink r—he said, "Yes"—he said, "Well, you must give me half a crown</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185406120112"></xptr>
               <p>and I will go"—on the morning of the 19th I went and found him; he was up at the Court pretty nearly as quick as I was—he did not go with me—we had something to drink, of course, and sat in Court some time—my name was called in the Court, and he said, "Give me the half crown, or I'm d—d if I will go in now as a witness," so I gave him the half crown—he repeated several times, "Give me the half crown," and would not go till he did get it—I had not got a half crown, I had a good many shillings, and a gentleman who stood there, and knew me, said, "Here is a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and I gave it him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first know that the name of Danks was cut out of the book in which the I O U was written? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On 19th April, not till then; just before the hearing he showed me the book, and I was surprised—I think it was on 13th or 14th Feb. that he told me he had got 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Danks; it was a day or two after the money was due—I went to Danks myself for the money, on a Saturday night, about 4th Feb., in the evening—I told Ryland that I should summons Danks, and that I should want him as a witness; I told him that before the case was first heard—I do not know how long before 17th March it was that I told him so; it might be a day or two, or it might be a week—I saw him on the morning of the 17th, and he would not go with me then—he had not said one word before the first hearing, about possessing any such document as this—when I met him, a minute or two after I had obtained this document, I said to him, "Here is a paper I have now taken from your son's; I ought to have had this in the morning"—he said, "We can beat them the next time."</p>

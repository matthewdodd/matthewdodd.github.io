               <p>Q. What do you know of his having stolen the sugar from your father - A. Having some months lost quantities of goods suspicion fell on the prisoners, I watched him. On the 23d of October, a quarter before nine, I took an opportunity of sending the prisoner out; I took part of a lump of sugar and broke it into pieces and put a mark upon it; I then concealed myself in the manufactory; about nine o'clock the prisoner came into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310046"></xptr>manufactory, I saw him; he had not been there a few minutes before his fellow servant took the light to light a fire in the stove, which left the prisoner and me in the dark; on perceiving the light taken away he came to the place where the sugar was close by where I was concealed; he began striking the sugar, which occasioned a light being struck together in the dark; he took one piece and concealed it under some part of his dress; I went out; and went over to a public house, I told him my father wanted him; he came back with me, I charged him with having taken the sugar, he denied it. Coming back from the public-house, I observed his hands at his breeches waistband, I felt upon his breeches, he instantly cried for mercy; he then took a piece of sugar out of his breeches and threw it away with violence. I took the other piece out of his hand; the two places, by the size, I suppose, weighed two pounds, on both the pieces I found the mark I had put. This is the sugar, it is the same I marked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I plead to you for mercy, hoping you will grant it me, I never committed any crime before this, and what was the cause of my misfortune: I have five children, my wife was confined to a bed of sickness eight months past, in doing my duty to her I sold all the goods I had, and my clothes; at this time she is dead; I was in hopes she was likely to get better; but my misfortune broke her poor heart. I have lost one of the best and tenderest wives, and my children the most endearing mother in the world. I never before was guilty, not never will again, therefore, my lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I hope you will consider my distress, and show me all the favour in your power. I am bereaft of the comforts of this life, and shall forever he miserable on account of my crime. I ask pardon of your lordship, praying for mercy, and also praying for mercy of my prosecutor, hoping you will have mercy on my babes, who are destitute of food, likewise the loss of a tender mother, and the distress of a father, who stands accused before this honourable court, and begging forgiveness, that I may be restored to my distressed babes.</p>

             sworn. - I was coming along the King's-road last Saturday night, and I saw a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190016"></xptr>man take a great coat off the box; I went and told the coachman, and he ran after the man; the same man-dropped the coat that took it off the box, no other man dropped it, I saw him drop it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Perry.) Did you pick up the coat before you took the prisoner? - A. I did not pick up the coat at that time, till I stopped him; I turned him about, and the watchman came along, be took him out of my hands, and then I went and picked up the coat; I never lost sight of him, after I saw him with the coat, till I delivered him to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going home about ten o'clock on Saturday night, I was a little in liquor I own; I was going along the side of the wall, and a man came running by me, and almost knocked me down, I heard the cry of stop thief, and I walked on; I had not walked above ten yards when the coachman came up, and said I had got his coat; your coat, says I, it is on my back if I have, for I have no other; says he, I have lost my coat, and he took me to his master's house; I told him to take me where he liked; after that they took me to the watch-house; this good lady said, at Hatton-garden, there were other persons passing at the time, and she could not swear to me.</p>

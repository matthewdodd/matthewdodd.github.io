             to know whether she had been to lay out the seven shillings as desired, she said that she had been there, and had laid out the seven shillings; I returned back; other business called my attention directly, I had not time to have the prisoner taken up then; on the 18th I desired another gentleman to go and lay out some money with me, that money I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300059"></xptr>marked, and took it to him there marked, his name is Gough, he his here; I did not mark it in his presence, I marked that money with a fork at a different distance from the side.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You say it was on Tuesday evening the 15th that you went to Mrs. Edwards; do you remember what time of the evening? - It was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a perfect memory of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether you gave the same evidence before the magistrate? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure? - I did to my knowledge; I remember I was not asked whether it was the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that you did not say that your conversation was with her on the morning of the Wednesday, instead of the Tuesday night? - It never was in the deposition because it was not so.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home after Mrs. Edwards had been there, you saw but five shillings in the till, and you expected seven, what did you say to him on that occasion? - Nothing at all, I had a mind to know whether there was seven shillings laid out or no, and when I returned the prisoner was gone to another house, and other business called my attention of consequence till towards the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing to him the next day or that night? - I did not till I took him up.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you took him up to answer for it? - Not for that only.</p>
               <p>Q. Having done this, having let all this time elapse for the sake of some good purpose no doubt, who searched him? - The constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the money? - The constable.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath have not you had it in your possession since? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the alderman tell you that it should not be so? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the marks that you talk of, you marked a great deal of money for the different persons? - Yes, half a guinea-worth of silver; I marked seven shillings for the lady to lay out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never mark more on your oath? - Not this five, six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean did you mark more than the seven shillings which on that day you marked, did you after that time mark more? - I did, on Friday three shillings and six-pence; but it was a different distance from the sides.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that you did not refuse the constable to keep the money? - I did refuse he should keep it, that there might not be any alteration made in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been concerned in any of these prosecutions before? - One.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath was not you concerned in more prosecutions than one? - I shall not tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact how many people have you prosecuted for this same thing? - I don't chose to answer it.</p>
               <p>Q. What will it hurt your feelings? as they are so nice I will not press it? - You warm me, when I first got up I was very cold.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you told any body that you knew he was a thief before you hired him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have you had any conversation with Mr. Arnett? - Mr. Arnett brought him to me and recommended him to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with him on this subject? - I see Mr. Arnett at the shop where he lives, and I had conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. And you never told him so, that you knew he was a thief before you hired him.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had you had this man? - About three weeks; a fortnight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300060"></xptr>in the shop where the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken up? - On Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he taken up in your shop? - He was taken up in my shop in Newgate-street.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>I am a constable; I was sent for on Friday the 12th of October; I took the prisoner out of the shop into the back room, and he took some monies out of his pocket and threw them on the table; with that I searched him further, and I could find nothing else on him. The monies were half a guinea, five shillings and six-pence in silver, and three-pence halfpenny in copper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. When you took this young man into custody he was told that he had taken money that was marked, then he threw down the money immediately without coercion? - He did.</p>

               <p>Q. You know that he put his hand into his pocket and threw down the money; you searched him and found that he had no more than that. At first did not Mr. Stirtevant say that all the money belonged to him? - I don't know that he said so; I remember, at Guildhall, that there was three shillings that Mr. Stirtevant swore to. I kept the man till next day, and produced it before Alderman Langston.</p>
               <p>Q. The Alderman wished you to keep it; who prevented you? - Mr. Stirtevant.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was produced the next day, had not you a shilling in your pocket marked just the same? - I had one the Saturday afterwards, and I really did say that I could not swear to money that was marked no more than they were.</p>
               <p>Court to Stirtevant. Is that money you now produce, the same as was produced before the Alderman? - It is the very same.</p>

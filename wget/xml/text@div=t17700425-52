I could not swear positively to the handkerchief; my mother lent me one like that, which I lost at that time.</p>
               <p>W. Paine. On the 26th of February, the time when one of the Kennedys was expected to be executed, I was among the people before Newgate. I had seen the boy at the bar about half an hour; I kept my eye upon him. I saw him take this handkerchief out of this young gentleman's pocket; I immediately seized him by the collar. He dropped it. I held him with my left hand, and picked it up with my right, and called to the gentleman. (The handkerchief produced in court.)</p>

            . I live with Mess. Salt and Baker, in Cheapside, paper-stainers. The prisoner was errand-boy at our shop; he always went home to his meals, and came regular. He has never missed a day's work, except sickness hindered him. He has a good character for whatever I heard.</p>
               <p>W. Elsey. I am one of his masters; I have employed him five years. He has behaved very well, and goes of errands very quick, and brings his money very properly.</p>

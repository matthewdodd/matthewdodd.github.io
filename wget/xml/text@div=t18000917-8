             sworn. - I am the wife of Thomas Abrahams. On Thursday morning, the 10th of July, a little before eight o'clock, I went to Fleet-market, and bought three pecks of peas, I borrowed the basket to take them home; I set them down by the side of the cart, and saw the woman take them up; I turned my head to speak to a neighbour, and lost sight of the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was she from you when you saw her take them? - A. Not a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure she is the woman? - A. Yes; I saw her again on Saturday morning, and then I took her; I accused her with taking my peas on the Thursday; she said she never saw me in her life; she was drest the same on Saturday that she was on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. So help me God, I know no more about the peas than any of the Gentlemen of the Jury.</p>

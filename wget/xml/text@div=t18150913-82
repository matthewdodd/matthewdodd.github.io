Nothing was said to him to induce him to confess. He said, I am guilty, and claim your mercy.</p>

He said he had made more than this one. We then went into a carriage, and went to Chichester, and there he took us up stairs, and shewed us some coulouring, and some brushes, with which he had done them. His companion is a man, whom we have not in custody. He did not at that time tell me any thing more; all that he has told me since is much to the same effect.</p>

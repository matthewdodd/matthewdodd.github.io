On the 3rd of January, at night, I was the last person up. My family consists of my wife, a servant-maid, and children; the eldest child is fifteen years old. I saw that the house was all fastened, and went to bed at half-past eleven o'clock; and was not alarmed in the night - the servant got up about eight. I got up myself and found every thing in the lower part of the house scattered about the floor, and in confusion; the drawers had been emptied, and the cupboards forced open. The thieves had entered by the back kitchen area; the iron grating in the yard, over which, was forcibly wrenched up; it had been bedded in the brick work over the back kitchen window. I missed the articles enumerated in this indictment, with many others, amounting in value to 30 l. or 35 l. at least. I saw a few trifling articles in the possession of Garton; ten or twelve days after, the adjoining house was empty, and in that some of the property was found; they must have come through there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you instruct counsel in this case - A. I have no solicitor. I have not employed counsel at the suggestions of Garton or Vanu. A gentleman suggested to me the propriety of employing counsel, as the Judge on the former case had much trouble to trace out the case, having no depositions. I was present when the Judge directed an acquittal, in consequence of Vann concealing a fact.*</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 9th of January I went to King's apartment, Bell-court, Bell-alley, Goswell-street; there was a woman in the room (not the female prisoner.) I asked how long he had lived there - he said, three months. I asked whether the place was furnished or unfurnished; he said it was furnished, and that all the property in that room belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that, without your putting the question to him - A. No. When I got into the room I asked how long he had lived there - he said three months, and that it was furnished. I said,</p>
               <p>"Then are all the things in this room yours?" - Yes, said he; we then proceeded to search the room. Garton and Lines were with me.</p>


               <p>Q. Did King make any objection to your searching - A. None. We found two bundles under the bed. I asked him who they belonged to; the woman (Blackwell) said, that a woman of the name of Sharp had brought them there, and, in a few minutes Sharp came up into the room. Blackwell got her to the door whispering, Garton pulled them away, and made them come apart. I asked Sharp whether that property was hers - she said Yes, and acknowledged that she had brought them there. I asked her, in King's presence, how long she had had them - she said, a young man had given them to her. I asked her who the young man was - she then altered her story, and said, a young man had given her money to purchase them, and that she had bought them in Petticoat-lane. I brought the bundles, and took all three to Worship-street; and the evidence I have now given as to what Sharp said, I gave in my deposition to the Magistrate, but it was afterwards ordered to be erased out, and a fresh copy taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of your evidence was to be erased - A. That part where I asked Sharp if she brought the property there. Mr. Thomas claimed part of the property in the bundles. I apprehended Easterby next morning at his lodgings, Turk's Head-court; Bennett was with him, and on a table in the room, I found this fork; we were a good while before they would let us in. Garton came up and said, he saw a hand, and called out, that if they did not open the door he would break in. Easterby then opened it; he had said he would not let us in without a warrant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You were examined this morning on your oath - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. It became material to enquire whose property certain goods found in King's room were - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, did you tell the Judge one word about the woman, saying the property belonged to another person, or about another person claiming it - A. No. I explained it. I did not shrink from it, when King put the question to me; I did not state it, because it was put out of the deposition.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, did you mention it, till the verdict was recorded - A. It was on the next trial. Mr. Bevil ordered it to be erased. I did not think it necessary to state it. I did not conceal it wilfully.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sworn to tell the whole truth - A. Yes. I would have brought the woman, if I had thought it necessary. I did not think it necessary, it being erased, or I would have stated it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the Jury state, that if they had heard it, they would have acquitted the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean it to be taken down, that you stated that a woman in King's company said the property was not his, and that a person came and claimed it, and that the Magistrate ordered those facts to be erased from your deposition - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long have you been an officer - A. Eight or nine years, and have been upon the established five or six.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street, and accompanied Vann to King's lodging. Gleed was with us, but not in the room - we found King in the room, and a woman named Blackwell. Vann asked King if he lived there - he said Yes; he asked how long - he said about three months; he asked if the property in the room belonged to him - he said it was his. Vann asked if it was a furnished lodging - he said the things were his own. Some knives and forks, and several other articles were found between the sacking and the bed; some dishes and plates were found under the bedstead near the head of it; we brought away several articles; the knives and forks and some table-cloths were tied in an apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anybody come in while you were there - A. Yes, a girl of the name of Sharp. I omitted to say that Blackwell said Sharp brought the things there, and when Sharp came in, Vann asked her if she had brought them there - in the mean time I saw Blackwell give Sharp a nudge; she pulled her gown - I said,</p>
               <p>"Fall back, I will have no conversation between you," and had something to do to make her go back. Sharp said they were her property; Vann asked how long she had had them, and where she got them; she at first said (I think) nine months, and then six months, and that a friend gave them to her; she said afterwards that she bought them in Petticoat-lane, and a friend gave her the money to buy them - we took all three to the office. I went next day to Easterby's lodging, with the officers. I placed myself at the street door to let nobody go out; we at last got into the room, and found Easterby and Bennett. I took a saucepan off the fire to examine the chimney, and found nothing, but tinder came out of the bars when I poked the fire. Vann found a fork. Bennett said she had put a bit of rag in the grate. I was not present at the examination.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you state to the Magistrate all that you have now - A. Every word, all but about Sharp; I was not questioned about that, for I was not at the examination. Mr. Bevill said I must be bound over on account of the tinder being found in the fire. I was bound over after the prisoners were committed. I was not at the office when Sharp was there.</p>
               <p>Q. To day when King was on trial for his life or death, did you state a word respecting Sharp claiming the property - A. I did not. I was examined to day against King.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suffer the Jury to return a verdict against him without stating it - A. I did; if I did wrong, I am sorry for it. I did not know that I had any occasion to do it, when I gave no evidence to that effect at the office. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180036"></xptr>would sooner speak on a prisoner's behalf, than half a word against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you are not to state a word more than you say at the office - A. If I had been asked the question I would have stated it. The woman had one or two hearings, and was then discharged, and I thought it would have died away then.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought you would not state what was material for the prisoner - A. The Magistrate did not believe Sharp, or he would not have discharged her.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as you did not mention it here to-day, and your brother officers also omitted to tell the Jury, l ask whether you agreed that it would not be convenient to mention it - A. No; it was pure accident; it was through the woman being discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was purposely omitted - A. I did not give it a thought.</p>

On the morning of the 15th of January, I went to a house occupied by a person named Mills, in Little Arthur-street, St. Luke's, and in the first floor room of that house, I found Bennett - I afterwards took her up stairs, where there were a bed, three boxes, and a bonnet box; she took a bonnet off the bed, and put it on, and finished dressing herself there - I asked her who the boxes and property there belonged to; she said to a person who was coming there to lodge. I asked Mills in Bennett's presence, who the boxes belonged to; she said to Mrs. Bennett - I afterwards received the keys from Bennett; they unlocked each of the boxes, and the key of her former lodgings, where Easterby and her had lived, and in those boxes, I found among other articles, a pair of cotton stockings, two pounds and a half of candles, and a small quantity of tea; and on the way to her former lodging, where I had left Vann, I asked how she came possessed of a basket which was left there, and if the ribbons and lace among other things in it were hers; she said they were her own; that the basket was her own, and she had left it with her landlord on the Friday (this was on the 15th.) I went to her former lodging with the key she had given me, unlocked the door, and in that room, I found a pair of scissors, and some clothes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you any conversation with Vann before you went to Mr. Bevill - A. Not before he had been to Mr. Bevill. I have had conversation with him before he came here - he told me about Sharp; I heard him examined to day, and heard the Judge's observations; Vann stated to the Magistrate that Sharp came up, and claimed the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not surprised when you heard him say nothing about it in Court - A. I thought he had forgotten it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your surprise increased when you heard Garton omit it, did you think he had forgotten it - A. I did certainly believe both had forgotten it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not occur to you that if they had not forgotten it, the prisoners must be acquitted - A. Perhaps I did not know sufficient of law. I did not state it to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You suffered the Jury to go to their verdict without stating it to them - A. I think I should have done extremely wrong; to dictate to any witness when he was being examined.</p>
               <p>Q. When they retired from the box, did you say to Vann or Garton,</p>
               <p>"You have forgotten something which would save that man's life" - A. I did say something when I heard that the prisoner was convicted. I said to Vann</p>
               <p>"Something has been omitted, which should be communicated to the Judge;" and I think my words were these</p>
               <p>"Before the man should suffer, I will tell the Judge," but I did not think this the place to speak to the Judge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you or Vann examined on the second trial - A. I was not a witness on the second trial. I determined to communicate it, but did not think this the place to do it. I did not know the facts of the other case; it was only hear-say.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On Saturday, the 10th of January, I went with Vann, Garton, and Lines, to Easterby's lodging; they left me there while they went to another house; I stayed in the passage all the time; they returned in twenty minutes. One of us then knocked at the door, and mentioned his name; somebody said they would not open the door; at last we gave our names, and Easterby opened the door; he and Bennett were in the room. Garton poked the fire, and something appeared to have been burning - I took some of it in my hand; it appeared to have been recently burnt. I went into the lower room, and found a basket. Bennett escaped while I was down stairs. Some of the property in the house has been claimed by Mrs. Thomas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The basket was not found in Easterby's room - A. No; it was produced to me in the absence of both the prisoners.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 9th of January I was on duty in Goswell-street; heard a boy had been robbed of some silver, and went into Bell-yard. Vann and Garton came down, and I followed them to King's house in Bell-court; there was a woman in the room - Vann had been talking to her before I got up - I only know what passed in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You forgot to mention that in the morning that Sharp said the things were hers - A. I was only examined about Easterby - I was not asked at all about King; I did not mention what Sharp said.</p>
               <p>Q. All four of you forgot to mention it - A. I only came about Easterby. I was not examined at the office, I heard what Sharp said, and did not mention it in the morning.</p>
               <p>MRS. THOMAS. My name is on some of the things found at King's, and the knives and forks are ours. The lace is mine, and here is a green ribbon of mine, some brown ribbon and muslin - they were in the house on the night before the robbery. The scissars found in Easterby's room are mine - (Looks at the property found in Bennett's boxes). I lost a piece of brown Holland like this, a pair of stockings, and some candles, but cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Is there any mark on the muslin - No; but I have a piece of the same - I speak to the pattern. The stockings are marked, and are my own mending. I have a piece of ribbon to match what was found. I had the whole piece made me a present of; I believe it is unsaleable. The fork found at Easterby's corresponds with mine - I have brought one to match it. The servant put the knives and forks into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180037"></xptr>water, which made the rozin start; we lost two dozen. These knives were made for us by Mr. Morgan.</p>

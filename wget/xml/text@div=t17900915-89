               <p>I keep this house; on the Friday preceding the 26th, the prosecutor and his wife went out, and left the key with the servant to clean out the room; she did clean the room, and they gave her four shillings for her trouble; on the Sunday they left the key with her, and on the Sunday evening, their not coming home so soon as we expected, the servant left the key with me; on the Monday morning, about one, they came home; on the Monday they went out again, and left the key with the servant; the two dogs I believe were not there; their not coming home on the Monday night, I was under some alarm about the property which they had told me of; I had a great mind to take the box into my own room, but, as I was alone, I did not think proper; on the Wednesday night, their not coming home, I did open the room; then the box was on the bed, and laces and other property was separate in confusion about the room; I called to the prisoner, who lay on the same floor, and had been sent up to bed ten minutes before; I asked her how these gentle-people left their property; and she said, as it is now, Sir; and I said, what, with the box open, and the window open, and all the things about the room I and she said yes, they did, Sir; I immediately went to bed, something easier than I was; on the next night, when they came home, I asked the gentlewoman how she left her property; the prisoner was present; she said she had left her box locked, and the things secure; then I said, I think all is not right, but the prisoner offered her service, and said I will go up with you, and take the candle: when they came up stairs the gentleman missed this property; I was sent for, and when I came, the prisoner was wringing her hands, and declaring her innocence; I said, it is very extraordinary how this could happen, how did you leave the things when you cleaned out the room? then the box was locked; because, said she, I had occasion to look under the box, and remove it; she said, if I die for it, I will speak truth; then I said, how came you to tell me last night that the box was left open, and the things about: the drawers in the prisoner's room were searched, but nothing found; I cannot tell whether she had been out or not; after I apprized her of the danger she was in, she said -</p>
               <p>Court. Then I must not hear what was said.</p>

               <p>I was never in the room at all; when the lady delivered the key to me, I delivered it to the bar immediately; I had no time to go up; there was a very great skettle-ground behind the house, where the window looks into, where there is a great deal of gaming the beginning of the week, and great beams that come across, any person might get in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live in Susannah-street, Poplar, Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon of the 15th of July, I was in Mr. James's shop, in Whitechapel-road—I saw the prisoner remove the cur<lb></lb>tain, take some boots out of the window, and put them in a handkerchief, in which was something else—I told the shopman—the prisoner took them out of his handkerchief again, and put them on the counter in the shop—they were Blucher boots—the curtains were drawn across the window, and the sun shining in attracted my attention—he then went out of the shop, and a wit<lb></lb>ness followed him—there were two females and a child with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Charles James. Wilson gave me some notice—the prisoner was in my master's shop—there was a woman with him, with a girl and child, and a female was trying on a pair of boots—the prisoner was standing by the window—I looked, and saw him take two boots out of his bundle, and place them on the counter—he then went out of the shop—I followed, and asked if he wished for a pair for himself—he said no, his wife was in there buying a pair—I asked him to walk inside, and accused him of taking the boots—he said he did not take them, he was only looking at them—he went out again—I followed, and gave him in charge, but he gave us a long chase first—these are the boots he took out of the bundle—they are my master's.</p>

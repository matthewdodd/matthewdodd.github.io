               <p>Did not you say the man was your husband? - No; I could not say he was my husband; there was a little woman took the candle and lit us up stairs, who I never saw here.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dignam did not desire her to take the goods to pawn? - I never saw her till the Saturday; I asked her if she lodged with Mrs. Dignam; she said, Mrs. Dignam was in the round-house; she said, she had not lodged there for three or four nights.</p>

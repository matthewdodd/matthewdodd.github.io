I told her I did not intend to let her go till such times as she had been to the justice's.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know from the quantity of the stock you have whether there was any missing? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak from the appearance of the counter? - I did not take any particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Then besides these marks of O. H. is there any thing else that you know it by? - Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. What may the value of it be? - Two pounds; we gave more than two pounds for it as a shopkeeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this woman do any thing that induced you to suppose that she took any thing? - I never did, it was merely her walking off that led me to suspect her.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did your master come in after this? - I went immediately to him and he came; there was another young man in the shop besides me, he is not here, he saw nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was in this shop in my life time? - I have no doubt about her person.</p>

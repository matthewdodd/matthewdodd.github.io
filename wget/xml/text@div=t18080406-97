            . I am a boot maker, I live in Apollo court, Fleet street; I was going by Mr. Foulkes shop on the 24th of March, between two and five o'clock, I saw two men engaged in taking away this baize from the door post,; I did not suspect them taking the property until they got to the corner of the gateway, which gave me me suspicion; then they ran hastily.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the piece of baize secured - A. It was under a chain; one end fastened in the shop and the other end at the door post, there was some difficulty in getting it away; he was half a minute in getting it from under the chain. I am certain the prisoner is one of the men that assisted in getting it out, and he was the man that ran away with it, I informed Mr. Foulkes's people of it. I pursued the prisoner; he heard the boy cry stop thief; he dropped the baize in Stewards rents; I passed the baize and caught him before he got to the bottom of the court. I assisted in bringing him back to the shop.</p>

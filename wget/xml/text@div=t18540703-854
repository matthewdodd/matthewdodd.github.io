               <p>of no quarrel between the prisoner and the deceased—there was a gun on the premises—I knew that it was loaded, and I told the prisoner to take it and carry it down to the field, for me to shoot the rooks, if there were any—I did not tell him that it was loaded—we went down the field together—I saw the deceased in the field, about twenty-five or thirty yards from us—the ground we were on, was about two feet higher than where he was—just as we passed him, he did this (<hi rend="italic">extending his fingers behind him, in an insulting manner</hi>)—I cannot say how the prisoner was carrying the gun, because my back was towards him, but I heard it go off, and I looked round immediately, and saw the deceased come running towards us about half way, and then he fell down—I started up to my master's directly, and a medical gentleman came and attended to the deceased—I did not see him die.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farm labourer in Mr. Watney's service. On Thursday, 2nd June, I saw the prisoner, with a gun in his hand, about twenty yards from the deceased, and on higher ground—I saw the deceased stoop down, and smack his backside at Weston—it appeared to be in joke; he was always in the habit of joking—the prisoner took the gun off his shoulder, cocked it with his left hand, and held it up with his left hand—I only saw one hand touch it—I then turned myself, and saw the deceased rising up from performing that salute, as if he was turning to his work—when the gun went off and hit him, the prisoner dropped the gun, and called out, "Oh, Lord!"—the deceased ran towards him—the prisoner ran to him—Steer was next, and I was next—I saw blood gush from his mouth and nostrils—the prisoner said, "Oh, Mike! why did you not tell me that the gun was loaded?"</p>

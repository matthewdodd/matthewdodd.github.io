            . On the 9th of October a labouring man came to me, between the hours of eight and nine in the morning, and asked me if I had lost any wether sheep, he said if I would go with him, he would shew me the remains of several being killed; I went with him, and it appeared to be in one of my fields where I saw three sheep skins, three heads with the wool on; their plucks were on their heads, and all their entrails and the cauls.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing about the skins and the heads that you knew them to be yours. - A. Only the marks that were on the fellow skins, to these being the same, is all I know them by.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what is there that you know them by. - A. There were one hundred and thirty four in the whole and there is only one hundred and thirty one remaining.</p>
               <p>Q. It is only by the numbers you know them by. - A. It is by the marks on the skins, being the same as the others are, a reddle mark on the loins, with a round pitch mark across that, and another mark down the side; and that was the mark that was common to them in the one hundred and thirty one that remained. It was under an oak tree where they had been killed, in the same field, I suppose, where I found the remains of them. There, beside what I have mentioned, two sets of ribs of two of the sheep, they had the meat all off, except three of the ribs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the rest of them. - A. At Queen-square office on the next morning; the officer had them in his custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as to what you saw, you were clear that it was the remains of the sheep that were yours, and the marks of the skins tallied with these remaining, and what you saw at the office, and these you had seen in the field, made up three whole sheep. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you told us before, they had been put in another field. - A. Yes, they were put before in the field on the other side, where I found they had been killed. There is a hedge and ditch parts the two fields.</p>
               <p>Q. They were left in one field and killed in another. A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. When did you see these men with the sheep. - A. On Thursday night the 8th of the present October, about half past eleven at night; I was going through Westminster with a billet of patrols on duty; I met the prisoner Brown first, Jessop was a little behind; when I saw Brown he had got this bag on his arm, that struck my suspicion; Jessop ran from the serjeant who was on patrol with me; he ran after Jessop. We conveyed them both to the watchhouse, there I searched them both. In Brown's pocket I found this knife, which had been recently used, there were grease and blood upon it, it appeared that they had been cut with this knife, there was meat sticking upon it. In this bag he had a shoulder of multon, with the ribs sticking to it; it had been tore away, and these three rib bones exactly fitted what the prosecutor brought up. In this knapsack there were three hind quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. You are still speaking of Brown, are you. - A. Yes; there were three hind quarters and two shoulders, and parts of the breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Without going through particulars with the parts produced by Watkins, and what was taken from the prisoners there were three whole sheep. - A. Exactly, excepting one foot.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I searched for it about three days afterwards. I found that foot in the pond.</p>
               <p>Gillmore. Upon Jessop I found this whetstone; they had each of them equal share of meat. We sent for Mr. Smith, a master betcher, he compared the meat; he is here.</p>
               <p>- BUSHNAN. Q. You was with the last witness. - A. Yes, I overtook Jessop.</p>
               <p>Q. And there were these materials found in the bag. A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (read.) My lord, and gentlemen of the jury. in the unfortunate situation we now stand before you, and the distress of our wives and children are great; and being unable to see counsel to prove our innocence, of the serious charge exhibited against us, we trust this, our defence, will be taken into consideration. On the 8th of October instant, as we were returning from Kennington, we got in conversation with a drover; he said he had three sheep that were quite exhausted with travelling, they would not go any further; he asked us thirty-six shillings each sheep; we purchased the three sheep for thirty six shillings each, being assured by him they were his own property. As we were going home at night, we were apprehended on the charge now against us. We humbly lay our case to your lordship, and the gentlemen of the jury. Our situation in life being low, though honourable; we both belong to the Coldstream guards; but in the private line of life, we are both married, and have children; which from our inability to support them at this time, are necessitated to suffer the severest hardships; we therefore bow to your lordship for mercy, and if we should find it contrary to our expectation, we trust we shall find mercy with justice.</p>

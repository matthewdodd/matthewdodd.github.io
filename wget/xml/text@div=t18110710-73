On the 4th of July, about eight o'clock in the evening, I told her to draw me some ale and table beer mixed together. I thought her long. I went on see what was come of her; I found her in the act of shutting down my bureau, she came from the desk and presented me the ale.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you accuse her - A No, I was afraid of accusing wrongfully. I called a neighbour in; I then went in the parlour. I asked her what she was doing to my desk; she burst out a crying, and said she was not at my desk; she told me she had no money about her. I went out and got the watchman to take her in custody; my wife gave me two notes, which I gave into the possession of the watchman.</p>
               <p>MRS. LANE. When my husband charged the prisoner, she said she had no money about her. I saw her slipping her hand under the baby's coat. I said Margaret, what have you put there, she said nothing. I took the candle and saw two notes, she said they were her notes.</p>

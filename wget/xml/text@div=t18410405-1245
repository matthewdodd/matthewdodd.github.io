                  </hi>. On the 2nd of April I was at the Two Brewers public-house, at Greenwich, at twenty minutes past ten o'clock at night—the prisoner was there—I was about treating some old pen<lb></lb>sioners—I put my hand into my pocket, and found I was without the means of doing so—I was a little the worse for liquor—I had, no doubt, spent the money—I took the prisoner for the waiter or potman—I gave him my watch, asked him to take it to his master, and ask him to lend me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I would send for it in the morning—he did not return, and I went to the bar to make inquiry—the landlord and I had a contention about it—I afterwards went out, and met the prisoner in the street—I challenged him with having taken my watch—he denied it on his oath, and words took place between us—a policeman came up—we went back to the house, and my watch was found in his left-band trowsers-pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The gentleman asked me to take his watch, to get some money on it; I did so, and as I was returning to tell him I could not get any thing on it he met me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> My impression is, the prisoner was so drunk he did not know what he was doing; I was not sober; I think he did not mean to steal it.</p>

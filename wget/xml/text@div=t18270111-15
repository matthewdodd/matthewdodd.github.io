I have not recovered it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you pursue him immediately? A. Yes; I did not keep very close to him; there were two or three others came up and held me, to prevent my starting for some time, so that he got about twenty yards a head - I kept him in sight till he turned up the court; he was not above a minute out of my sight; I did not see him drop the note, or give it to anybody - he was not searched till the officer took him - I did not make any bet, nor deposit any money; I heard nothing about a bet till he was gone, then somebody said something about betting 5l.</p>

            . I am porter at the Flower-pot public-house, in Bishopsgate-street. I was in Aldergate-street, and saw three or four men round the prosecutor - I saw the prisoner grasp something out of his hand; he said he had lost a 10l. note - two or three took hold of him, and kept him from running - I ran after the prisoner to the court, and finding it no thoroughfare, I ran for an officer; when I returned, the prosecutor had hold of him; the prisoner offered him 10l. not to appear against him.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had turned up the court for a necessary purpose, when the Prosecutor came and accused him of this robbery; and that several people around said he was innocent.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

I took her on the 30th of June last. On the 13th of September I called her up to do her domestic work, about seven o'clock; and while I was making the breakfast for the customers, she went up to make the beds. After I had made the tea for the customers, I called her to come to breakfast; she answered me she was coming. I waited a considerable time; I thought she was gone out after the pots. I put her breakfast on one side, and wondered why she went out. I went up in the servant's bed-room; I saw that her clothes were all gone. I ran down to the first floor; I said, Oh, Mary has run away, her clothes are all gone; I hope she has not robbed me. About an hour after that, I went up into my bed room, and when I got into the bed-room, a key that I had lost three weeks before was in the closet, and the closet door open; the key of the closet was is the door that I had lost three weeks before. The night before I had put all my money in the box in this closet, every pound that I had in the world, in a mahogany box in the closet; all the notes were taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you put away - A. I cannot tell exactly to one note.</p>
               <p>Q. About how much money had you in the whole - In the first place. I think there was near forty pounds in the whole. I think there must be eight or ten pounds in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of bank notes were there, do you know - There were twenty-six one pound notes that I put by the last time, and a two pound note.</p>

               <p>Q. How many had you put by before - A. I don't know. In the whole there was near forty pounds and eleven shillings, to the best of my belief. I sent directly for

I questioned her what she had robbed her mistress of a large amount; she said she had taken only twenty pounds in notes, and about three or four pounds in silver. She said she gave one Freer half of it, she had none left. She had spent it all. Ann Freer was out of the way as well as the prisoner, until after I apprehended the prisoner. After that I apprehened

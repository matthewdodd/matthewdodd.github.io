                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, at 22, Luke-street, Shoreditch. The prisoner has worked for me, on and off, three years—on Friday, 18th July, he was at work for me, and as soon as he was gone I missed a knife, two pairs of shoes, an iron, two pairs of leathers, one pair of pincers, and four pairs of lasts, which I had seen safe five minutes before he left—I did not see him again till he was brought to me on 4th Aug.—he ought to have returned to his work on the following Monday—I am a Jew.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I not come back on the Friday night for some stiffening stuff? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, you had not gone twenty paces away when you returned—it was when you had left the second time I missed the articles—I do not believe my wife gave you the stiffening stuff—I told you to take it—it was for work you had to do at home on the Saturday—I do not know that you laid your handkerchief down, and tied the stuff up in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a fellow-workman with the prisoner. On the evening of 23rd July I met him in Whitechapel-road, and asked him how be and Mr. Brandon were—he told me he had <hi rend="italic">let him in for it</hi>—I asked him what for—he said for some tools, and two pairs of shoes—I said he ought to be ashamed of himself, after being taken in from the street, as he was—he did not say what he had done with them—I afterwards met one of Mr. Brandon's neighbours, and gave him information.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Halling, Pearce, and Stone, of Waterloo House, Cockspur-street. I know a person who I suppose to be the husband of Madame Nelaton. On Monday the 28th of April, I went to 38, Howland-street, hut not in consequence of information from him—I think I left Cockspur-street about ten minutes after four o'clock, and I think I was in Howland-street about half-past four o'clock—I remained there about half an hour—I saw the prisoner Nelaton at home—she was not dressed as if for walking—she had not the cap on she had now and no head<lb></lb>dressed at all—her husband was not at home—she requested me to wait till he returned—I think there were some dresses on the table—she was not engaged upon them when I went in—I waited about ten minutes before Nelaton came in, and staid there about half an hour—she did not leave the house at all while I was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any particular reason for noticing the time you left Cockspur-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not further than I had promised the per<lb></lb>son who came to me to be there at four o'clock, I was not there by four o'clock—I looked at my watch when I started and think it was ten minutes past four, I cannot say positively, but it was between four and five o'clock I am certain—I could not say the time I arrived there to a few minutes—it might have bee near five o; clock—I went straight there—a young girl opened the door to me—I was shown into the parlour—Madame Nelaton was there when I went in—there is a room communicating with the parlour—the young woman opened the door and showed me that Madame Nelaton was there—she had a dark-coloured dress on—quite plain—it would be a very good walking-dress under a cloak—she had not head<lb></lb>dress at all—she could certainly have gone out by putting a bonnet on—I believe she is a dress and stay-marker—I went to speak to her about busi<lb></lb>ness—I think I have seen Mr. Nelaton before—I think I have seen them both at our house before, and I have seen them in Thayer-street, where I believe they formerly lived—I have been in the habit of dealing with Mr. Nelaton—we have three Frenchmen in our house—I dealt with him for some bandanas and a piece of silk—nothing else; that was both in Thayer-street and Howland-street—once for silk and bandanas together, and once for silk—we had three dealings, not more—they were for my employers—I brought about six handkerchiefs altogether, and two pieces of silk—I was going about some bandanas on the 18th of April—that was one of the three dealings—I dealt for bandanas that day.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure you set off from your employer's house a few minutes after four o'clock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was, I should say, about ten mi<lb></lb>nutes after four—I went straight from Cockspur-street to the house—I have been in Halling and Co's employ, nearly eleven years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">FANNY</hi> D—I was in the service of Madame Nelaton. On the 18th of April, I recollect Mr. Martin coming there between four and five o'clock in the afternoon—Madame Nelaton had been in-doors all the day long.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you tell him, Madame Nelaton had been out almost the</p>

               <p>whole day, that she came home late to a late dinner, and all the parties, she and her husband dined together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not that Madame Nelaton—I said, Madame Duchene had been out with Madame Victoire—he did not ask me about Madame Nelaton—he asked me if my mistress had been at home that day or out—he did not ask me any names at all—he asked me who were out; if they were out, if I recollected any of them going out that day, but he did not say any name, to my recollection—I will not swear he did not—he did not say the name of Nelaton, nor my mistress,—I have lived seven or eight weeks with Madame Nelaton—I lived with them two days, in Thayer-street—Nelaton and Duchene dine together almost every day—I do not know what business Duchene is.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is Madame Victoire there almost every day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Every day—she used to come to Madame Duchene—I am quite street it was Madame Victoire and Madame Duchene that went out together—I never saw Madame Nelaton go out with Madame Duchene, all the time I was there—Madame Victoire is a tall lady.</p>

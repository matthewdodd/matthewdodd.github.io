               <p>I am a pawnbroker's wife where the man came to sell the spoon; the prisoner was the person, he came to me I believe on the 14th of September on Saturday morning; the spoon being defaced, and the arms being endeavoured to be taken out, I thought it was stole, and I stopped the spoon and the prisoner; I sent for an officer from Bow-street, and had him taken to Bow-street; and I saw this gentleman's carriage come to Bow-street, and I saw the same arms on the carriage as on the spoons, although it was defaced.</p>
               <p>Willymott. I believe this to be my spoon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth to Davis. Was that the article the prisoner brought to you? - Yes, it was doubled together that I might not see what arms was on them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it gave you the suspicion? - By this being defaced, and being bruised in the manner it was. The woman that lives with the prisoner brought the bowl of the spoon the evening before.</p>
               <p>Q. You have produced the bowl of the spoon? - No, I have not, I produce only what the man brought; if you can find a bowl to that then I produce a bowl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put any questions to him? - I did, I desired him to come into the parlour, and asked him how he came by it? he said it was given him. When Treadway came I desired him to speak the truth, he said he found it in a cess pool; I then asked him how he came to get the arms out? he would not make me any answer to that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wentworth to Willymott. Do you know this spoon to be your property? - I have more of the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you positively swear to this being your property? - I can.</p>

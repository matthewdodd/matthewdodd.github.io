                  </hi>. I lived with the prisoner, as his wife, for about three months before 28th March, at No. 34, Queen Street, Chelsea—we had one room. On Saturday night, 28th March, I was with him, and I aggravated him to do what he did—we had a quarrel about my going out—it was between seven and eight o'clock—I was kneeling down mending his trowsers, and I felt blows on my head—I did not see what he struck me with, he cut me in three places.</p>

Mahoney was brought there on the night of 28th March; she had three wounds on the scalp, one in front, one in the centre, and one behind—they had been inflicted with some sharp instrument—the front blow had chipped out a piece of the bone; the two back wounds corresponded with some cuts</p>

               <p>JAMES ARCHER. I saw the prisoner, and a lad, standing at Mr. Pullen's door, at about half past seven in the evening, of the 15th of August, and presently I saw the lad take a piece of printed cotton, which was standing on the threshold of the door, half in, and half out, and deliver it to the prisoner at the bar. They immediately ran up the court, and I pursued them, and laid hold of the prisoner, who had the cotton, and had thrown his apron over it. Just at the end of the court, I met a man, who assisted me in securing the prisoner; and the lad got away. We then opened the apron, and took the prisoner to Mr. Pullen, who claimed the cotton. The prisoner said, he was employed by some person, whom he did not know, to carry the cotton, and he was to have had a shilling for his trouble. An officer was immediately sent for, and the prisoner was delivered into his custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am confident it was the prisoner that received the cotton from the boy, for he had it in his apron when I took him.</p>

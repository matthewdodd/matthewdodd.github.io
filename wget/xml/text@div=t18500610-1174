                  </hi>. I live at 15, Maiden-lane, Covent-garden, and deal in coal and coke. I know Cruise and the prisoner—on 2nd June I was in the Blue Posts, Newman-street, with Wall and Taylor—Cruise and Burnell came in together—Burnell showed a book, which he said contained a list of his free-admissions—Cruise said to me, "Will you help us," and explained that it was in taking houses, and selling the keys, and also in indicting brothels—he said, "We have made hatfulls of money, and we want one or two; will you lend us a hand?"—he said, "We have taken out eighteen indictments," and enumerated four or five—he showed me the list—I read it, and saw the name of Joseph Gillon—I said, "I am sure he never kept anything of the kind; I have known him upwards of twenty years"—I told him I would not give an answer—Burnell said, "Decidedly he is hindering us in gaining money, and therefore we have indicted him among the rest.</p>

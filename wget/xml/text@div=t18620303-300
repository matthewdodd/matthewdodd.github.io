                  </hi>. My husband keeps a chandler's shop, at 13, Horse-shoe-alley—on Sunday, 5th January, the female prisoner came to our shop, I think it must have been between 9 and 10 in the morning—I served her with some small articles, the price of which was about 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a half-sovereign in payment—I fancied it was not good and took it into the parlour to my husband—he went out for a policeman—the prisoner was still there, and as my husband was going out, I said he was gone to get change—he shortly returned with a police-constable—I then said to the woman, it was very wrong for her to bring in bad money—she said, "Oh, you can send for my brother"—while my husband was gone for the constable I saw her brother, as she said, walk by the front of the shop three times—I had seen the woman go to and fro up this court, but I did not know this was her brother till she said so—I did not go to her landlord—he went up and called her brother, he lived there—he came down with the landlord to the shop—I said to him, "You see here is a bad half<lb></lb>sovereign that your sister has brought"—he said, "I won't believe it, give it to me;" but we would not give it to him—my husband cut it in half with a pair of scissors, and gave half of it to the male prisoner—he said it was no use to him, chucking it across the counter—I kept one half—the prisoners were then allowed to go—I had known the young man come into the shop a number of times—I afterwards gave the piece of the half-sovereign to the constable Chillingworth—I do not know what became of the second piece, it went on to the floor.</p>

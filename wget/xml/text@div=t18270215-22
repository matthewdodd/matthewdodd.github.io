               <p>WILLIAM WILLIAMS. I am a <rs id="t18270215-22-viclabel113" type="occupation">licensed hawker</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18270215-22-victim206 t18270215-22-viclabel113"></join>, and live in New-street, Cloth-fair. On the 30th of January, about half-past twelve o'clock at night - (I had been spending the evening with some friends, at the Three Tuns public-house, in Redcross-street, but was quite sober - we had three or four pints of beer) I was going home, and a friend asked me to go into Golden-lane, and have a glass of gin; when I came into Barbican again I met a respectable gentleman, drunk, with two girls about him, who I thought were going to rob him - I got them from him, and in about five minutes I was in <placeName id="t18270215-22-crimeloc114">Golden-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18270215-22-crimeloc114" type="placeName" value="Golden-lane"></interp>

When I got loose I ran away towards Barbican, and went home as quick as I could. I gave information the next morning, and about twelve o'clock that day we took Ward at the Lamb and Lion public-house, in Golden-lane - I am quite sure he was one of the party who surrounded me; I described both their persons and dress to the officers. Harris was taken between nine and ten o'clock that evening, at a public-house in Moor-lane; I was quite certain of him - they were strangers before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Who had you been with? A. Mr. Hurst and two young men who use the house; neither of them are here. I was alone when I was robbed. Hurst had gone with me to the Brittania public-house, to have a glass of gin - I was as sober as I am now - I missed my pocket-book the following morning; I generally carry it about with me, but whether I had it that night I cannot tell - it was found the next day, at the public-house, and I know I had it at the public-house in the afternoon. I might have dropped it in the house; I found it in the hands of a person whom I frequently see there - I do not know how it got out of my possession. I did not have that man taken up - there was nothing in it but my licence. The prisoner Ward was holding me - he was dressed in a long blue coat, a hat, and, I believe, a yellow handkerchief - it happened between twelve o'clock and half-past.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are just as sure of one person as the other? A. I swear more positively to Ward, if any thing - I could pick him out from a thousand. I am certain of Harris also - he is a man of colour - I was not five yards from two lamps; I am certain I was robbed when they surrounded me; I was quite sober, but frightened. There is nobody here to swear I was sober - I had a witness at Guildhall, but the clerk said it was not necessary; I called for a watchman, but none came up, and I went home. I met the officers between nine and ten o'clock the next morning, and told them I was robbed of 2s. 6d., my pocket-book, and licence; I thought I might have lost the book in the scuffle, but was certain they robbed me of 2s. 6d., as they went to my breeches pocket - I kept my pocket-book in my side pocket, and have dropped it before now, when I have been sober. If I had not found it I should have thought that they had got it; I would not have sworn that they had stolen it. I felt the man's hand in my breeches pocket. I paid 5d. as my share of the beer - I am sure I did not take my pocket-book out of my pocket- I generally sleep at this house when my brother has not got a bed for me. I am not certain whether I told the officers I was robbed of my pocket-book, or had lost it.</p>

            . I am a letter-founder, and have been a constable. On the 30th of January, about a quarter before ten o'clock, I was with the new street-keeper of Cripplegate - the prosecutor was with him; the street-keeper asked me if I knew the parties; the prosecuto described several to me, one as having held his arm, and another as taking the money. I went with him, and we apprehended Ward, whom he had described as having a long blue coat, with pockets at the side - he said he held his arms; Ward's dress corresponded with that description; I took him at the Lion and Lamb, in Golden-lane, about twelve o'clock that day - the prosecutor went in first; he then fetched us, and said, "This is the man who held my arms, I am certain, and we secured him; he told me he had lost 1s. 6d., or half-a-crown; he did not exactly say half-a-crown; he mentioned something about a pocket-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150014"></xptr>book, which he thought he had lost at the same time: Ward denied the charge. We were all day looking for Harris, whom I knew well, by Williams' description - we took him at the King's Head public-house, Little Moorfields; when Williams saw him he said, "That is the man who took the money out of my breeches pocket" - he denied it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How long were you a constable? A. Two or three months - I was only an extra man; I suppose others had more interest than me - I am now on the extra duty, but have done nothing. I was with the new street-keeper, as I know the neighbourhood better than him. I heard the prosecutor say that Ward pinioned his hands; he has not said so to-night- I think Ward had a Belcher handkerchief on when I took him; there are two or three colours in a Belcher - it was not yellow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you going to work when you met the prosecutor? A. I was going on my master's business; I dare say I should have gone to my master if the street-keeper had not beckoned me over. I go to work at what hour I like, and my master is satisfied, as I am only paid for what I do; Williams told me he had lost the pocket-book in the scuffle - I rather think he said he had lost it at the same time as he lost the money.</p>

            . I am a City officer. I saw Williams, who told me he had been robbed of half-a-crown, and had lost his pocket-book - he said he was in Golden-lane at half-past twelve o'clock, outside the gin-shop, and was pinioned by a short man and a man of colour - that the short man field him while the man of colour picked his pocket - he did not describe their dress to me; when we took Ward, Williams said, "That is the man who pinioned me while the other picked my pocket;" Harris was taken at half-past nine o'clock that night, and Williams said he had taken half-a-crown from his pocket - they both denied the charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. If he had described Ward's dress, must you not have heard it? A. He did not describe the dress to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not collect from him that he had lost his pocket-book and money in the same kind of scuffle? A. He said he had lost his pocket-book and 2s. 6d., whether he meant at the same time I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The Prisoners' Counsel called -</p>
               <p>MRS. WOOLMAN. I live in Tabernacle-walk. Ward married my daughter - they have lodged with me for the last three or four months. On the night before he was apprehended he came home about ten o'clock - he sleeps on the second floor, and so do I; I went to bed about eleven, and left him and his wife up, as they sleep in the sitting-room - he could not have gone out without my hearing him.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not? A. He had no occasion to have gone out - I heard him talking to his wife at twelve o'clock, and saw him at nine the next morning; he was not out of doors.</p>
               <p>MRS. HILL. I rent the house where Mrs. Woolman lives; Ward came home about nine o'clock on the night in question, and, I believe, he was not out afterwards - my bed-room is on the first floor, and I certainly must have heard him if he had.</p>

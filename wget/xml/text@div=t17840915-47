               <p>How long did he continue with you in that capacity before he went away for any time? - I think till the 10th of May last, I disliked him much, and I parted with him, he came to me again the 19th of the same month.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to take him again? - His friends called upon me, and promised that his behaviour should be better in future; he continued with me then till the 26th of July; I parted with him then, his bad behaviour was the cause of his leaving me.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. Did he come to you again? - No.</p>
               <p>During the time that he was with you as your apprentice, where did he lay? - In the shop under the counter.</p>
               <p>Had he, in the capscity of your apprentice, an access to your property? - Yes, every thing.</p>
               <p>Had you lost any property from your shop about that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Describe as near as you can the amount of that property, and the sort of property that it was? - I cannot speak with any certainty to the time that they were lost, but they were all lost: on the 8th of September in the evening, a gentleman came to pay the interest of a watch, a gold repeater, which had been two years; I searched for it, and could not find it; the same gentleman happened to have a number of things, I looked over the whole belonging to that gentleman, and missed about one hundred and twenty pounds-worth; the next morning about eight o'clock, the prisoner Hewlett called for his breakfast, he did not lay in my house that night, he had not laid in my house from the 26th of July, when I parted with him; when he came on the 9th in the morning, I called him up stairs and taxed him about these, mentioning the different articles; he said he did not know any thing of them: I had a constable in the next room, and I charged him with him; upon searching him, we found a metal watch and some other things.</p>
               <p>Was that metal watch your property? - I cannot say, he told me at that time it was pawned with me in the name of Leard, for two guineas; I believe nothing else was found upon him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding, Prisoner's Council. Did Sir Robert make any promises? - No.</p>
               <p>You had a constable in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. James. What account did the prisoner give of the property? - The prisoner sent a man named M'Donald to tell me he could give me an account; he told me he had sold two rings and a locket to Mr. Shelley, silversmith, in the Strand, for forty-nine pounds, and a gold watch he had sold to Mr. Heather, for twelve guineas; at the same time he told me, says he, you do not know where my lodgings are, they are the corner of Orange-court, Leiceister-fields, mentioning that there was some chain, or something of that kind in that lodging; I do not recollect that he metioned any thing else; I went to Mr. Shelley's, and there I found one of the rings, a large cluster diamond ring.</p>
               <p>What was the value of that ring in your opinion? - I think between thirty and forty pounds is about the value.</p>
               <p>Did you find any other property of your's at Mr. Shelley's? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you go to any other place in search of your property? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any other circumstance respecting the prisoner Hewlett? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. That ring which you found at Mr. Shelley's, have you any knowledge of it? - Yes, I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>It was a ring that had been pledged with you? - I can swear to the major part of the the things, and that in particular.</p>
               <p>- SHELLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>Is that the same ring that was pledged with you? - It was sold to me by the young man in the red waistcoat.</p>
               <p>What did he say his name was? - Upon my word I did not ask his name; but I think it necessary to convince this Court, that I gave a full price for it; I shewed it to Mr. Blank, in Serjeant's-inn, Fleet-street, at least my workman did; he asked him forty guineas for it, and he said, to oblige him, as he had been a customer, he would give him thirty guineas; now you will find, Sir, I gave thirty-five pounds for it.</p>
               <p>What did he represent himself to be? - The person that called cut an elegant appearance; I cannot say who he was, he was not in my shop three minutes; he was elegantly dressed, with a number of superfluous ornaments: the servant appeared in the afternoon, and called for the money, which servant was the prisoner Stockdale.</p>
               <p>(The ring deposed to by Mr. Priestman.)</p>
               <p>To Priestman. Do you know the prisoner Stockdale? - I have seen him two or three times in my shop about a twelve month ago, he was pledging some things, and said he was going to the north of England.</p>
               <p>Did he pledge any thing at your shop? - Yes, I think he did, I had a good deal of conversation with him about the north of England, I have seen him twice since in my shop.</p>
               <p>What was he doing at those other times? - One time I remember I was behind the counter,

               <p>Did he stay to bargain for it? - No, he went out immediately, and was sorry he had given trouble.</p>
               <p>What appearance did he then make? - A very genteel one; I believe I asked the boy by remembering his face: I went to one of Stockdale's lodgings, Mrs. Rix's, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150091"></xptr> Oxford-street, that was after Hewlett was apprehended; I found there this gold watch, with chain, seals, and trinkets, I found it in a box up stairs, and this locket, and these silver buckles, and these knee buckles, they are paste; I can swear to the gold watch, I sold it once for thirty pounds, and it was pledged with me since: it was the watch alone, the whole together is worth that at a low valuation.</p>
               <p>Can you speak to any of the other articles? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>How did you know this lodging that you speak of to be Stockdale's lodging? - From the information of another person.</p>
               <p>Who was that person? - One of the witnesses in this business.</p>
               <p>What is his name? - Perry.</p>
               <p>In what capacity was Stockdale the first time you saw him? - He told me he was going down as a servant with Colonel Lowther, to Lowther Hall in Westmoreland.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the prisoner Stockdale at your house in company with Hewlett? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding.</p>
               <p>April twelve months I think you say was the time you took this lad as an apprentice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was he bound for? - Four years.</p>
               <p>He is very young, is not he? - They told me he was eighteen.</p>
               <p>You parted with him once and took him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many people do you keep in your shop? - I have one boy.</p>
               <p>He was frequently left with the controul of the business of the shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To transact all your business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To take in pledges? - No, he was too young.</p>
               <p>You never suffered him to take anything in? - No, I did not, he migh t a shilling article, but things of value I took in myself.</p>
               <p>Suppose a person came to your shop to redeem an article that had been pledged, was not it his business to deliver that article? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that was his business while he was with you in your absence? - I have hardly been out of the shop since the 10th of May.</p>
               <p>What kind of books do you keep in the shop? - Day books and cash books.</p>
               <p>This fell to his lot, I suppose, when you was out to manage and settle these books? - From the 10th of May I do not think I ever was out, except on a Sunday; I suspected him, and looked very sharp after him; but I took him again upon his friends telling me he should behave better: I sent to the Rotation-office for a constable.</p>
               <p>Where did you take the lad to when you spoke to him of your losses having been discovered, you first of all spoke to him in your own house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you threaten him? - I asked him what was become of those things, and he said he knew nothing of them.</p>
               <p>What did you reply? - I charged him with the constable.</p>
               <p>Did you hold no further conversation with him? - No, I did not; I asked him about these things, he sent for me and told me.</p>
               <p>Did nothing more pass between you and him in your house? - I was not four minutes with him, but I was present during the whole time between him and the constable.</p>
               <p>And nothing more passed? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you, upon your oath, tell him it would be better for him if he would discover where the property was? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You was considerably agitated, I take it for granted, at these losses? -</p>
               <p>Court. Were those memorandums that you have in your hand taken at or near the time; I see you have occasionally referred to them? - These have been taken by myself since.</p>
               <p>When the recollection was perfect in your mind, how near the time? - Within a day or two.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150092"></xptr>Court. Then it is very right you should refresh your memory.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I have no objection to it. Then you say you have a perfect recollection of the matter, and do not recollect anything of that kind said to the poor lad at the bar? - No.</p>
               <p>Then afterwards he sent for you himself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What struck you then, did not his penitence induce you to make him some promises? - No conversation passed.</p>
               <p>What did you say, answer the question, either you have or you have not a recollection; if you have not I will not ask you: did no other conversation pass, did you give him no promises or assurances of favour? - I never gave him any promise, not the least, I believe I hardly ever opened my mouth; I took a pencil and paper, and he gave me an account immediately.</p>
               <p>Then you say, in the capacity in which he served you, it was frequently his duty to receive money and restore the pledges? - Yes, I was always present, I suppose.</p>
               <p>But when you was not there: when did you examine your stock? - Since the commitment.</p>
               <p>Then when the property was taken from your shop you do not know at all? - No; I looked over the book before, and missed these articles.</p>
               <p>Court. What was the amount of what you missed in the whole, nearly? - About eight hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What, altogether, now casting up your account you find you are eight hundred pounds short? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. I am clearly of opinion, that where it is uncertain at what time the things were taken, it is necessary to prove the value of forty shillings in some one article, in order to make the offence capital.</p>

               <p>I have known him about eight years, his general character as to honesty is a very good one.</p>
               <p>Court. With respect to Mr. Heather, who was going to justify his conduct in buying articles of this value from a stranger, and was prevented by me, I thought it was unnecessary; for it is very evident he was deceived by appearances which might deceive any man whatever; and it is but justice to the character of Mr. Heather for me to say, that he has often appeared in this Court, in a light which puts him above all suspicion; he has appeared on all occasions to have been as circumspect and fair, and to have transacted his business as properly as any man in the trade. Gentlemen, with respect more particularly to the case before you, you ought to separate the evidence respecting the prisoners, for it is very different: and first, with respect to the prisoner Hewlet, he is in the situation of a servant in the prosecutor's house, with access to every thing that is there; he is proved by several different persons to have pledged several different articles to a considerable amount, with different people, which articles were missed and lost from Mr. Priestman, while he was in his service; added to this, there is proved a direct acknowledgment on his part, that he stole the things which he sold to Mr. Shelley, so that with respect to the prisoner Hewlet, if you believe the evidence, I am affraid it does not leave any room to doubt of the truth of this charge, or any latitude with respect to the value, for the things separately taken are worth more than forty shillings; I say separately taken, for there must be to the value required by law, which is forty shillings, stolen at one particular time, to make it a capital charge under this indictment, which is for stealing goods in a dwelling house; for if one hundred pounds worth of goods were stolen at an hundred different times, and included in one sum, they would not amount to a capital offence, inasmuch as an hundred distinct felonies all together will not make one capital felony: but in this case, the value of the things produced does not leave much room to doubt; so much therefore for the state of the evidence for Hewlett. With respect to Stockdale, the case is different, and you are to consider whether the evidence against him does not rather prove him, in this case, the receiver of these goods, than the person who actually stole them: the finding the property on a person when it does not appear how they came by it, is common evidence in every day's practice, that they are the persons who stole it; such is certainly the presumption of law: if therefore this property had been found at Stockdale's, without their being any other visible person standing forth as the thief, it would have been evidence undoubtedly to shew that Stockdale was the thief: in like manner, if property is found at the lodging of two persons, who lodged together, it is evidence to be left to the Jury that they were both concerned: so if parties are proved to be together, or very near the place at the time a robbery is committed, and the stolen property is found in the possession of one, that is evidence against the whole. But in this case there is a visible person, who is brought forward to you, by evidence, as the person who stole the property of Mr. Priestman; and though they endeavour to prove a connection between him and Stockdale, that is as well accounted for on the footing of his being a receiver as a thief; and though they prove him to have been there early in the morning, and all night, yet you must be clearly satisfied that he was actually present, and assisting and co-operating with Hewlett at some of the times when he stole property; that is necessary to make him a principal: for whatever connection and confederacy, whatever knowledge of his felonious intention, and whatever part he might have taken, yet if not actually present and assisting, he is not a principal but an accessary; and the times he slept there, there was another person with them, so when he was in the shop, there were other persons with him in the shop. However, if you think he was present and assisting at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150096"></xptr> any time when the value of forty shillings was stolen, he is equally guilty with Hewlett; but if you think that Hewlett availed himself of his access to the property of his master, and disposed of it to the hands of Stockdale, in that case he is a receiver, and upon this indictment he must be acquitted, liable to such other prosecution as may be commenced against him.</p>

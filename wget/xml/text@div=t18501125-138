I rent the ground-floor—the landlord does not live in the house—I deal in tools—on Thursday evening, 14th Nov. I went out about seven o'clock—I left my shop quite secure—there is a cellar under it, and a trap-door from the shop to it—when I left, the trap-door was quite safe, and secured with a thumb-screw—when I came home, I found it had been broken up from below—the cellar is partitioned off from the kitchen—I missed these tools(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) and other things which have not been discovered, and this pistol—I saw them safe just before I left—the entrance had been effected from the kitchen into the cellar by forcing a board off, and from there to the shop by the flap—there is a window to the kitchen, which faces the area, towards the street—these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—I have the fellow pistol to this.</p>

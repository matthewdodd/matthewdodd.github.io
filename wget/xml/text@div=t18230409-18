            . I am a bricklayer, and was employed on the premises. I had sent the prisoner as a labourer there the day before this occurred; Mr. Hansard called on the 26th of March, and gave me information which led me to Kerby's where I found a basket, containing a number of Dutch tiles and lead, which was cut in three pieces. and weighed about 40 lbs.; they fitted to each other. I took them to the premises, and missed some lead from a gutter by the side of a chimney, which had been pulled down the day before. I measured the lead, and from the manner it was folded, I have no doubt it was removed from the gutter. It had not been moved by my direction. I was repairing the premises for Mr. Hansard. I noticed the day before, that one of the fire places was lined with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090010"></xptr>Dutch tiles, and white washed over, and had told the bricklayer to take them down and send them to my house, but they never were sent. As the prisoner came out of the office next day, I told him I was very sorry he should have acted in such a way, and that he was a different man to what I thought him; he smiled, and said misfortunes would happen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Whether the tiles were taken down by your men, you cannot say - No. When I last saw the lead, it laid in the gutter covered with tiles. He only came to work for me the day before.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the morning of the 26th of March, before ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner with a basket on his shoulder, coming round the corner towards Newport-street, The tiles were at the top, but from his manner of carrying it, I thought there must be something heavy underneath. I followed him into Shoe-lane, to one Green, a dealer in marine stores; he put the basket on the floor. I asked what he had got; he answered nothing. I asked where he brought it from, he said, from the Old Bailey. While I was looking into the basket, he tried to get by me. I seized him, and struggled with him for ten minutes, and secured him. I produced the basket to Mr. Hansard that morning. The edges of the lead were bright and fresh cut.</p>

I said, I did not like to go home as far as London-wall without my hat; I should like to have my hat; one of them said, if I would stand half a pint of gin he would fetch my hat. I agreed. The prisoner put a glass of gin to my mouth; he took a dollar from me. I put up my hand to prevent him spilling the liquor over my clothes, to lay hold of the glass. He put his hand into my left hand pocket, and took out the dollar. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the dollar - A. I don't know. As soon as I challenged him with it, his companions shoved me from one side of the bar to the other. On last Sunday morning, near Charing Cross, I saw him on the opposite side of the way; as soon as he saw me he was surrounded with fourteen young men of his companions; that was Sunday morning, the following morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the same man - A. That is the man. I had a young man with me; I looked at him; his companions called me to go to Bow-street, and get a nurse; accordingly I went; I could see no one then. In the evening I saw Mr. Nicolls he went with me, and apprehended him.</p>

On the 16th of January I was at home, and saw the prisoner lurking about the window, from eight to nine o'clock; and about eleven o'clock at night I saw a boy leaving the shop, and believe it to be the prisoner; I then missed a pair of scales off my counter; and my till, containing about 10s.; I was in the parlour - there was nobody in the shop; I gave an alarm, and he was pursued; I saw the prisoner in custody next day.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Manning. On the 16th of January, just before eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked me two or three times to let him have three penny biscuits for 1d.; I would not; he went out; I saw him lurking about the window; I went into the parlour, and soon after the scales were gone; I ran out, but could not see him - I believe him to be the boy; the scales are not found - the till was safe when I was in the shop, which was three minutes before.</p>

            . I am a patrol. About half past two in the morning I was going my round, I found the prisoner at the bar concealed in a necessary in George yard, Chick lane; I told him to come out of there, as he had no business to sit there; he said he worked at Narrow Wall, Lambeth, and lodged in Jewin street in the city; I told him it looked very odd his being there, he must go to the officer of the night. I then took him to the watchhouse; the officer of the night saw him with these things in his bosom.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took them not with an intention of keeping them; the carpenters would lend us any of them when we wanted them, and then we returned them back and put them in the place again. I took the liberty of taking these tools, intending to bring them back again the next morning. Going from Narrow Wall two or three of my shopmates called me; I went with them, and got so intoxicated that I hardly know what I did; what I said at the watchhouse I do not know, and the prosecutor cannot deny that he lent me any tools when I wanted them at any time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did they quit the place before you quitted it? - A. A good while; there was a ladder that I had at work, which I locked up with the chain round one of the rounds of the ladder; the next morning, about nine o'clock, the ladder had been taken away, and set down into the barge.</p>

               <p>Q. If you were in the barge, would that ladder enable you to reach that accompting-house window? - A. Yes; the step of the ladder round which the chain went, had been cut through, to get it free from the lock.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see where the ladder was? - A. No, it was so dark, I could not; then I went round by Thames-street, and came down the back way to Dowgate to look for them; I thought they had gone away by that time; when I returned back again the second time, I found them upon the Dock-hill; they said they had got some money, and then we agreed to go to Darkhouse-lane.</p>

On Monday morning I met Lovett at Queenhithe; he said he was going to buy some shares in the lottery; he asked me to go with him, I went with him to Mr. Drummond's; he was going to buy a quarter and a sixteenth; I told him, if he would buy a quarter, and two sixteenths, I would take one of them, and pay him for it in the afternoon; then we came back again, and I left him at the top of Bull-whars-lane, and agreed to meet him in Bishopsgate-street at three o'clock; he took me up a passage, and told me he had picked a gentleman's pocket of a fifty pound note, and some bills of exchange; there was to be a fight upon Wirtibledon-common, and I lent him four pounds near a twelvemonth ago, and he had not the opportunity of paying me; he gave me the fifty pound note, and told me to get it changed for him, and I was to pay myself the four pounds that he owed, and he was to give me six pounds more for getting it changed; I was to have ten pounds out of the fifty pounds; I thought I should not have got my money, unless I took the fifty pound note to get it changed, and I kept the whole of it; Lovell is swearing our lives away to save himself.</p>

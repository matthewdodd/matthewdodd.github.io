The prisoner came into my service, on the 2d of February, and next day as she was going to bed, she was intoxicated; I was up in her room, a silk handkerchief, and a duplicate for a table-cloth and silk petticoat dropped from her person. She said she took the handkerchief to dust the drawing-room - I had left it in the kitchen. I gave my daughter the duplicate, this was on the Saturday, and on the Monday I went to the pawnbroker's, and found they were mine, and had been taken from my wardrobe. I had told the prisoner on the Saturday that she must be very clean in my service, and I believe she was distressed, which might induce her to do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. In what language did you desire her to be clean - A. I said she must be clean in her person, as single gentlemen were very particular, and she being an Irish girl, whom I knew were not particular. I never suggested that she should be smart and wear frills. She acknowledged to the officer that she had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do your daughters dress smart - A. They are children, one is fourteen years old, and the other fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do single gentlemen stay for a night or so - A. Mine generally stop weeks and months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Samels - A. The last time I saw him was on the steps of the Sessions-house at Clerkenwell. He was never employed by me in this business, or any other; I first knew him by seeing him at Mr. Martin's, a paper-hangers, in the Strand. I never authorized him to say I would prefer no bill if I received 8 l. The bill was taken out on the last day of the Sessions; we went there three times.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Sunday morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock, Mrs. Gale came to me, and I took the prisoner in charge at her house. She admitted pawning the things, and said she had torn the duplicate that they should not find it.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When Mrs. Gale hired me she ordered me to have dinner ready by the time she came home. She keeps different houses of ill-fame, and went out at eleven o'clock to receive the money from them, returned at half-past five, very much in liquor, and found fault with me and the other servant for not getting the work done. She went out again, returned at half-past eleven o'clock, used very improper words and swore. On Saturday she said gentlemen and ladies resorted there, and I must have better clothes, or not continue with her. I said I had been a year and a half out of place, and what few things I had were in pawn. She said, so help her God, I should not remain in her place any longer, as I had bad shoes. I said I should have another pair at night, and would keep myself as clean as possible. She said she did not particularly wish me to have good clothes, but to go dressy, or she should loose the custom of her house, as it depended on the servant. Herself, her daughters, and servants, were in the habit of seeing gentlemen, that she saw one gentleman three times a week, and ordered me to have wax candles up ready. When she went out, I took and pawned these things, and redeemed some of my own to appear decent. She has detained my box which has three yards of ribbon, and twenty-four duplicates. A respectable servant will not live with her.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister-in-law. I saw the prosecutrix with Samels at a public-house, by the Sessions-house, Clerkenwell - they met us there. Samels said, in her hearing, that if I would bring the jink with me, the bill would be done away with, and it should all be settled; and if I did not bring 8 l., my sister would be prosecuted. I said, it was a deal of money; that my husband was only a labourer, and asked what it was for, as I feared I might be doing wrong. I asked it he was a constable; he said, No, he was a higher post. I was to meet him next morning, at the Plough, at Whitechapel, with the money, (this was Wednesday). I met him there. Mrs. Gale was not present. I saw her on Friday, at the same public-house; Samels was with her, he asked if I had brought the jink. I said, No, it was a deal of money. He said, well then, Mrs. Gale must go and take out the bill immediately; and asked her if she would, she said, what he said she would apply to. I said 8 l. was a deal of money, he said,</p>
               <p>"Why Mrs. Gale's money is 5 l." Mrs. Gale wished us good day, and left. He said, what he said was law with her, he could do any thing with her. I went to borrow the money - thought I was doing wrong. I enquired at the prison, and happened to meet the Reverend Mr. Cotton. He took me to Mr. Sheriff Williams, who advised me not to pay the money.</p>
               <p>COURT. - Q. The proposal was first made on Wednesday? - A. Yes, I am sure Mrs. Gale heard the proposal, but on Friday, they would let nobody hear what passed; she said what he said she would apply to. I told her, I expected, that if I paid it, she would receive it with her own hands, and give me a receipt for it, that I might have no trouble hereafter. I live in Alfred-street, Poplar.</p>

               <p>COURT. - Q. Did you hear this man propose to do away with the indictment for 8 l. - A. Yes, at the bottom of Clerkenwell, in the street, which leads to Mutton-hill. Mrs. Gale was not in hearing; at first he talked to us about half an hour, then he fetched her. He took us into a public-house. Mrs. Gale took a drop of brandy. I believe this was on a Thursday, it was the first day that we met him. He asked Mrs. Gale what she would do, she curtsied and said, what he said she would apply to. I saw them together on the next day, (Friday). He would let nobody but my sister-in-law hear what passed then. He proposed to have a private room, but could not get one; he came and staid outside in the street. I went out and heard him say if the 8 l. was brought up to-morrow morning, it would make it up, and prevent the bill coming into Court, and pay Mrs. Gale and the officers.</p>

               <p>Q.- I thought he would not let you hear. - A. No, not at first, but my sister-in-law asked if I might; he said on the first day, that he should have to give the officers 3 l. for taking my sister, and 3 l. for Mrs. Gale, and 2 l. for his trouble; as we were poor people, he would charge no more. I said,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Gale, if the money cannot be made up, I hope you will punish my sister as little as possible;" she said she would do whatever Samels wished - he said, if it was not made up, she must take the bill out immediately.</p>

Samels said he did not think it worth while to put in the bill that day, as we should not get it out, he wanted to put it off till Saturday. I said, I could not come then, we agreed to meet on Friday, at eleven o'clock. On Wednesday, Samels and Mrs. Gale went away together. On Friday I went, and understood they had put it off, and attended on Saturday; the bill was put in on Saturday, about eleven o'clock.

                  </hi>. I am partner with my father, Daniel Smith—we are tallow-chandlers, at Ealing. The prisoner was our carman—our man gave him six packets of candles to take to Etherington, a grocer, at Eton—he had no business with any blue at all—he was taken into custody on the 14th of Jan., charged with stealing candles—he said, "I know I have been very bad, don't make me out worse than I am," and at the same time he offered some money, and said, "Here is the money for the candles"—I did not take it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to the prosecutors. On the 13th of Jan. I delivered six papers of candles into the prisoner's possession, each paper contained 61bs.—they were in a box, to go to Mr. Etherington, at Eton—he had a load of other things—we found the greater part of the candles at the Crown, at Kilburn—he brought the box back in which the candles had been—I asked if they were all right, and he said, "Yes"—I did not give him any blue, but I missed some.</p>

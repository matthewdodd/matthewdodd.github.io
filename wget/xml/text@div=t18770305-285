On 2nd February, in consequence of instructions, I went to the prosecutor's house at 9 a.m. and remained till 12 o'clock, when Clark went to the warehouse and remained outside—I was concealed opposite the doorway—Wykeham came out and joined him, and they both went into the warehouse where they remained a quarter of an hour, and Wells came to the door and looked about—I then saw Clark come out of the warehouse with this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I followed her to Middlesex Passage and stopped her, and said "What have you in this parcel—he said "Some pieces of cloth that I had from Charles, the porter to Mr. Jaques"—I took her back to the warehouse and informed the warehouseman—Wells then came into the warehouse, and I said to him "What do you know about this parcel?"—he made no reply to me, but turned round to Mr. Jacques and said "For God's sake, forgive me"—I said to Clark "You will be charged with receiving this, well knowing it to be stolen—she appealed to Mr. Jaques and walked as far as the basement door, where it is rather dark—she dropped this piece of paper in the warehouse and I picked it up. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "The patterns I told you about I cannot do, but I can let you have the same number of yards of the patterns enclosed; same price. Come to the firm on. Tuesday and let me know, about 3 p.m. Yours respectfully, Charles Wells.") On the same day I went to Clark's lodgings, 18, Prince's Street, Kingsland—she lived there with her husband—I found in a drawer in her room this piece of cloth, seventeen pieces of velvet, a box of buttons, and fourteen duplicates, only one of which related to this charge—the cloth was given up at the police-Court—next day I went to Wykeham's, at the Coach and Horses, Bartholomew Close, three or four doors from where he was employed as potman—I told him I was a police officer, and asked him if he had heard of the robbery at Mr. Jaques'—he said "Yes"—I said that I understood he had been receiving some pieces of cloth—he said "Yes, I have a bag here in my pot-house which it was brought in, and I parried it home to my lodgings"—I said "Do you mind my seeing your lodging?"—he said "I will go with you," and we went to 9, Long Lane, Smithfield—I searched his room, and in a coat hanging on the door I found this piece of velvet and five small pieces of cloth—I said "How do you account for them?"—he said "These are some pieces which Charles, the porter, brought home and gave to me"—I found in his box eighteen duplicates relating to the cloth.</p>

One evening he had been paying his master all his wages to pay the salvage, and he asked me if I would go with him to pawn some articles. He asked me to go in with them as he had an aversion to do so, and I pawned two or three of the articles for him. He asked me to keep the tickets for him. I had not the slightest idea that the stuff was stolen, or I should have been frightened to take them to the same pawn-shop two or three times. When I heard that he was taken I did not think it was for these cloths, or I could easily have got rid of the tickets. '</p>

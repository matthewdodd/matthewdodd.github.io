               <p>keeps an eating-house—the prisoner first came there on 13th March—I served him with some pork and potatoes, the price of which was 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half-crown in payment—I laid it on the shelf—there was no other half-crown there, only some small silver—I then gave him change and he left—in the afternoon I went to take the money off the shelf, and noticed the half-crown—I examined it and found it was bad—that was about two hours after the prisoner had been there—it was in the same place on the shelf where I put it—my father was in the back room when I served the prisoner—on Monday, 8th April, the prisoner came again—I knew him as soon as he came in—he asked me for some beef, which was 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling—I noticed that it was bad—I took it to my father, at the back of the shop, and spoke to him on the subject, and he went out for a constable—I did not give the prisoner the change—he waited about ten minutes—he had the beef in his hand, but he left it in the shop and walked out at the side-door—I asked him to wait a little longer—he said, What for?"—I said, "You are the same man that gave me the bad half-crown on 13th March"—he did not say anything to that—he was then standing outside the shop—my father had returned with the constable, and we were all standing outside together—my father gave him in custody, and I gave the half-crown and shilling to the police-constable.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>. I am the father of the last 'witness—my daughter showed me a bad shilling on 8th April—from what she said to me I went after a constable and came back and gave the prisoner in custody—I saw the prisoner standing against the door on 13th March, being served—I was at the end of the shop—I am sure he is the same man—I saw my daughter serve him on 13th March.</p>

Q.</hi> What part of your premises were you in when the half-crown was given? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I stood in the door-way, between the shop and the back-parlour—I believe you had a cap on—I cannot say exactly what dress—I did not take particular notice—I merely saw your face—I stood very nearly in the same place when the shilling was given, as I did when the half-crown was given—my daughter brought it to me—I can see my daughter through the door when she serves the meat, when the door is open—we never keep the door shut.</p>

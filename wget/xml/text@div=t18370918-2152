On the 19th of September I found the prisoner in the Harrow-road—in consequence of information I had received from the prosecutor on the Sunday before, (who described the prisoner,)—I saw the prisoner—I said, "I want you"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "Allow me to look at these shoes oh your feet"—he hesitated, and said, "They are my master's; I won't deny it"—I took him to the station-house, and said, "You have broken open a box, and taken some money"—he said, "I have not broken a box, but the money I was advised to steal."</p>

I took the prisoner out of charity—he had been with me about ten weeks—I employed him occasionally—when I came home on Tuesday the shoes were missing—a lodger gave me some information—I did not know the money and box were gone for a week, I lost them—there was sa near 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it as there could be.</p>

I met a man, who asked me for a penny—I said, "I cannot get you a penny"—I went to the box and opened it, and did not know what to do—I could not shut it again—I ran away, and went the over-night, and wanted to see one of my fellow-apprentices to give him the money, to take back again, as my master would not let me see him.</p>

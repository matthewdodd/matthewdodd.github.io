               <p>Q. What do you know of this transaction? - A. Upon the 16th, the day before the transaction, I lent Pobjoy two pounds; he was a customer of mine for two months before that, he lives in the same street; I told him, when I lent it to him, I should want it the next day: On the 17th he brought it back - the two pounds; I believe it was between ten and eleven o'clock of the day; I had given him an order for a suit of cloaths; he brought them home the same day - the coat and waistcoat. He brought me the two pounds an hour before he brought the clothes - it was a one-pound note and a guinea he brought me; I wrapped up the one-pound note, and put it in my right-hand waistcoat pocket. When he brought the clothes home, I was going to try them on in the bar; he said, as they were acquaintances of mine and his in the parlour, he thought I had better put them on in the parlour, as they might see how they fitted. I went into the parlour, and pulled my coat off, and laid it on one chair, and my waistcoat on another; one was about a yard and a half distance from the other, as near as possible. I observed the one-pound note and the guinea was in my pocket when I laid it down; when I was fitting them on, I turned, and said to him, do not be a thief, not suspecting any thing of that kind, I went on putting my clothes on.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had said do not be a thief, had you any suspicion? - A. No, I spoke it as a joke; I have seen him take an handkerchief out of my pocket, and he has given it to me again; I do not know why I made use of that expression, only from seeing his hand at my waistcoat; I said it as a joke, I did not suspect being robbed at that time. After I had fitted the clothes on, I took off the new ones, and put on the old ones again; I did not feel in the pockets immediately. Soon after, I had to go out of the room to give Mr. Chartery ten pounds; he wanted me to lend him that sum; he was in the room at that time; I went to my wife, and said, if you have eight pounds, I have two pounds; I went to feel for it, and it was gone; I then felt in every pocket I had. Chartery called me on one side, then I suspected Pobjoy, and I directly went to his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner near the waistcoat? - A. I saw his hand at the waistcoat, I had no suspicion at the time; I only suspected that he had took something out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to look immediately? - A. I could not suspect a tradesman in the neighbourhood; I know that I had that money in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You never looked nor searched while he was present? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Strange conduct - did you find it afterwards? - A. No, I never found it afterwards; I accused Pobjoy of it afterwards, and he appeared to be a little agitated, as if some guilt was on him; that might be imagination; he said he knew nothing at all about it after some little agitation; it might be a minute or two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You never were charged with any felony? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him? - A. About three or four months.</p>
               <p>Q. He uses your house? - A. Yes, he has a club in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose there was nobody there but Mr. Chartery? - A. Yes, there was a Mr. Curtis and a Mr. Harris.</p>
               <p>Q. And they had the same opportunity of seeing, as you had? - A. I do not know that they had; one was reading the newspaper, and the other was looking over his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, do not be a thief? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. It is no joke in your license in your house, to say, do not be a thief? - A. There is no such thing in the license.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Chartery did not shake the coat, and take it up? - A. He did take hold of the coat, and shake it.</p>
               <p>Q. He never touched the waistcoat? - A. He never did; nobody touched the waistcoat but Mr. Pobjoy.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to separate the waistcoat and coat? - A. I laid the coat down on one chair, and the waistcoat on another.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he seemed to be very much agitated? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up? - A. I did not take him up at all; I was at Guildhall; I believe Alderman Boydell was the sitting Magistrate that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110038"></xptr>day, and while the warrant was making out, Pobjoy came and surrendered himself, and said, there was no occasion for taking out a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Pobjoy, at the Justice-room in the City, came and said, he would surrender where he expected to find you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it then? - A. The Alderman said that the evidence did not go to commit him, but he must find two bails sufficient.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the story before the Alderman, the same as you have to-day? - A. Yes, word for word.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did the Alderman say? - A. He said there was no evidence for him to commit; he recommended me to advertise the note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How long did he stay in the house after you had said, do not be a thief? - A. About three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink together? - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you drink, for God's sake, together? - A. We had, I believe, a bottle and a pint of mulled wine between four of us.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had called that man a thief? - A. No, before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not drink together after that? - A. We finished the remainder of the bottle; we had nothing more in; Mr. Curtis and Mr. Harrison was not there all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You sat down together check by joul, and drank together very comfortable? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner after that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say, if you could get the notes, you would say no more about it? - A. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you never say that if you could get the notes, you would say no more about it? - A. Upon my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He desired you to go into the parlour, did you ever accuse him of having robbed you? - A. I accused him of having robbed me in the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, in the room where Curtis and Harrison were, in that room did you ever charge him of having robbed you? - A. No, not in that room.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There were persons present - you were staying three quarters of an hour together; the question is in the presence of those persons there - did you ever say that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were before the Magistrate, the Magistrate said there was no evidence to commit him? - A. He did not commit him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not shuffle with me? - A. Mr. Smith gave him a good character, and he said he would not commit him; he advised me to advertise the note.</p>
               <p>- CHARTERY sworn. - I am a victualler: I live in Water-street, in the Strand; I was present when Mr. Pobjoy came to Mr. Fulcher's house; I saw him take a piece of paper out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Fulcher see that? - A. I do not know whether he saw that, or no; Mr. Fulcher saw his hand at his waistcoat pocket, and turned round, and said, do not be a thief; Mr. Pobjoy put his hand behind him, and put the paper in his great coat pocket, and when Mr. Fulcher missed the money, Mr. Pobjoy was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to Mr. Fulcher? - A. I did not say any thing then, I did not think it was money; Mr. Pobjoy went away then.</p>
               <p>Q. Immediately? - A. Very soon afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon? - A. He stopped a few minutes, and then he went away out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you remain in the house? - A. About an hour, or an hour and a half, after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if Pobjoy staid an hour and a half you must have known it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had staid an hour you must have known it? - A. I was not out of the house the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had staid half an hour you must have known it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he did not stop half an hour after that? - A. He went away a very few minutes afterwards, that I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the loss was found out? - A. Very little time after Mr. Pobjoy was gone, it might be half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think it very strange, that a tradesman and a neighbour should commit a felony of this kind? - A. I did not know it was a felony.</p>
               <p>Q. You were all upon good terms? - A. I never heard them quarrel.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. It was a mere accidental visit of your's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go there for the purpose of borrowing ten pounds? - A. Yes, I did; there was ten pounds between us, and I went for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that? - A. There was a difference between us of ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Upon your oath, what purpose did you go there, to get ten pounds - did you go there to borrow ten pounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any account between you? - A. There was; I cannot exactly tell what it was, some little scores.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by telling me that there were ten pounds between you? - A. I cannot say that there were ten pounds between us then.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he in your debt? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, is there any thing between you? - A. Yes; I owe him, it may be, near two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you go to borrow ten pounds - what did you borrow that day? - A. Ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you owe him at that time? - A. I had some liquor of him, and what it was I cannot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110039"></xptr>say; it was ten pounds at that time, I went to borrow it, and he lent it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near the waistcoat at all? - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you examined first as a witness? - A. I cannot tell well the day of the month I went before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards? - A. How long afterwards?</p>
               <p>Q. What is the occasion of your repeating what is said to you - it is only to think of what you shall answer - was it the 18th.? - A. Yes; the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the Alderman? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You never heard? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The Counsellor has done every thing that I could wish; there has been a great combination against me; I beg you will grant me a copy of my indictment; I have a great many witnesses here.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him the best of characters.</p>

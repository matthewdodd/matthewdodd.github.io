                  </hi>. I am a merchant's clerk, and live in Devonshire-street, Stepney—I am secretary to a German Instruction Society, which meets in Goodman's-fields—the prisoner was a member of it he had not access to the library—here are some books belonging to the society—I had the care of them partly, and partly another person, who was the librarian—I had the most care of them—the librarian gave them out, but he had to give me an account of where they were gone to—I missed books several times, every time the account was given to me—I think the last time was the middle of Oct.—I made the list out, and there were books lost—I had some conversation with the prisoner—I said it was very strange that there were so many books lost—he said it was very strange that I did not look more after them—on 2d Feb., I was sent for to the police-station—I there saw thirty-nine books, I knew them by the mark in them—this mark was made when there were about twenty or thirty books lost, then this mark was ordered—I should say these were lost in May, June, or July—this one book belongs to me; it had my name in it, but the prisoner has made his own name in it—I should say this was safe about twelve months ago—the prisoner had no authority to take away any books—some of them have been num<lb></lb>bered by the catalogue.</p>

I am a teacher of the German language, and live in Goodman's-fields—these books are the property of the German Mutual Instruction Society—the librarian and secretary have the care of them—here are four volumes of Shakespere in German, which are my own property—I sometimes lecture on different subjects—I used them in the society—they were not the property of the society—the prisoner had no right to take these books—I was sent for to the station, and in consequence of what I heard I went to 10, Goodman's-yard—I found these books belonging to the society, and these of my own in a box there.</p>

I am sure I did, and on the 28th, I saw him at Hatton-garden, but the prosecutor not having come from the country, he was discharged, he had not left the office twenty yards before the prosecutor came and he was taken again; when he was discharged, he asked me how it was Millard did not appear against him - I said I did not know, and said,"Harry, did you think of keeping this money, and spending it before you received it;" he said Yes, I did; I concluded what I would do with it as I came along; I thought Millard could afford to lose it, and I stuck to it like a cock, and spent every farthing."</p>

I went out on the evening of the 24th, and returned between the hours of seven and eight, and saw a person standing at my door; I instantly collared him, and he gave me a great deal of resistance. By this time, the prisoner came out of the shop, and was passing between the door post and my knee, and I held him there, and let the other go; I had a child two years old in my arms, but held the prisoner until such time as the officer was sent for. My hall door is always open, for the accomodation of my lodgers. There is a wainscot divides the shop from the passage; this wainscot is all in one piece, and was secured by two spike nails; it was six feet long, and five feet high; the space between the top of it and the ceiling is filled up with shelves; no person could get over the top of it; one end of it locks into a piece of wood. This wainscot was forced in from the bottom, and by that means, part of the piece of wood into which it locks, was forced off. The prisoner was coming out upon his hands and knees where the wainscot was shoved in at the bottom.</p>

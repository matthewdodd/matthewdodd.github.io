"July 25th Ealeigh Club. Deliver to Mr. Calisher or his order, my five horses. Send with them clothing.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I returned from Russia on 10th August by myself, Mr. Parland went one way and I another—I left on the Sunday morning, and he on the Sunday night—I came through Poland, by way of Warsaw, and he arrived I think the night before I did—I heard of the summons about five or six days after my arrival—I did not hear it from the defendant—I knew that there was a summons returnable on the Saturday, at the West<lb></lb>minster police-court; he did not tell me why he did not appear, he was in Scotland at the time—I was present when the application was made for the warrant, and I offered to pay the debt—I did not attend, I was simply there, because I heard of the summons—I was not there for the defendant, I was there of my own accord—I heard that it was returnable on that day—I did not know where the defendant was, it was either in Glasgow or Edinburgh—I asked Messrs. Bailey to present the cheque again, but they said they could not, they considered it a fraud—that was on the 22nd. July—on the 25th I arrauged it to be-taken up to-morrow, that was an arrangement with Mr. Calisher—I left on the 25th, the day I wrote that: letter—I had arranged to go to Russia with the defendant either on the Friday or Saturday before I started on the Tuesday—I had been consider<lb></lb>ing a journey to Russia before that, in. the December previous—I did not know of the other cheques that were outstanding—I knew nothing of Mr. Olivier's cheque, or the other cheques for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not aware they were outstanding till I was at the Westminster police-court—I think the defendant owes me about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I paid 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash to him—I have no-security for that—the prisoner's mother and sister are interested in the Russian property; according to the Russian law his share is 11-14ths of the 1 whole amount, the mother's 2-14ths, and the sister's 1-14ths.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi> I have lent him more than 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I always found him an honourable man, be has always repaid me—I was at the meeting of his creditors on 25th August, he was not there, I represented him—the warrant was applied for in my presence, and at the time of the application I offered, to pay the money—I was asked if I would give a guarantee for the costs—I thought those costs might be rather fabulous, and I said I would not—I am aware that there was a question in dispute between Mr. Parland and Mr. Page.</p>

On the 11th of December one of my servants brought me up a black wrapper, containing about 100 lb. weight of black silk. I found a great quantity missing out of it, near 30 lb. weight. I was surprised to find such a quantity missing. I immediately enquired among my servants if they had sold any, they said no. I went to the London coffee-house in the evening, when I returned, they said, if I would give them leave they would watch the <rs id="t17790113-8-deflabel45" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>On the 12th of December, in the morning, I concealed myself in a little wine cellar to watch the prisoner. The wrapper of silk was in a locker in the cellar. About seven in the morning he came down with a candle to get some coals; I saw him come round to the locker, and put his hand in, and take something out, which I supposed to be a head of silk; his back being to me I could not see it; he went backwards, and I heard him wrap it up in paper. He carried up three or four baskets of coals, he then came back and looked at the locker again; there were some potatoes lying by the locker, he filled his pocket with them; then he went to the locker and straightened the wrapper; he then went up stairs, but returned immediately and drew some small beer; he then went up into the shop and went out, and Mr. Hunter and I followed him, and took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130012"></xptr> him by the Old Bailey, and brought him back; when we brought him into the shop, he pulled the silk out his pocket, and was going to drop it; I caught it as it was falling. It was a head of silk, about eight ounces.</p>
               <p>(The silk was produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>I went to get some coals. Looking about for a basket, I found this silk lying on the ground; I put it into a paper to bring it up into the shop, and went out and forgot it.</p>

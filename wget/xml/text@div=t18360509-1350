                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery. The prisoner was my comrade—I went out on the 7th of May, at a quarter before nine o'clock, to drill—my boots were standing by my bed-side, in the barrack-room, No. 82—the prisoner is married. and is out of the barracks alto<lb></lb>gether—I missed my boots at half-past twelve o'clock, when the man was going to clear out the room, and reported the circumstance—the boots were brought back at a quarter past four o'clock, and laid on my bed by some<lb></lb>body—I did not see them brought.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sergeant-major of the 9th Battalion. On Saturday, the 7th of May, it was reported to me by Corporal Watkins, that Bain had lost his boots—I called the cook of the room, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he said, I spoke to the prisoner, pointed out the situation in which he stood, and told him it was a pity an old soldier like him should commit himself, and I was bound to make him a prisoner—he said he would much sooner give up his own regimental boots, than have any dis<lb></lb>grace—I said there was no occasion for that, if he was innocent—he said he would sooner do it, then have his name brought in question—I asked if his son had been about the barracks—he said, "Yes"—he was sent to the guard-room—I after wards sent two officers with him to his own house, where they saw his son and his wife—his son was examined before the commanding officer, on Sunday, and said that he himself watched his opper<lb></lb>tunity, and went into the room and stole the boots, while the cook was gone out with the ashes—the son was taken into custody, but there was no bill found against him.</p>

On Saturday, the 7th of May, Bail told me the boots were gone—I reported it to the sergeant-major—he told me to take the prisoner into custody—I did so—the prisoner said, if his boy had been and taken them, if he was allowed a quarter of an hour, he would go and get them out of him—I was afterwards sent to the pri<lb></lb>soner's house, and his wife and son were there—they denied all knowledge</p>

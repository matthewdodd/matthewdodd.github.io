            . The Prisoner brought the Mare to my House at Islington on Sunday Morning, October 17, about Nine o'Clock; 'twas the same that Mr. Davis claims.</p>
               <p>- Turner. The Prisoner came to my House in Grays Inn-Lane, to set up the Mare 'till he came from Market, for he was going to Smithfield with 11 Sheep, which he call'd Crocks. This was about Four in the Morning; and he told me he had travell'd all Night with his Sheep. I ask'd him why he did not come yesterday, as other Men did: He told me it was not so proper for him. I set up his Mare, but he not coming for her that Day, I took her to the White-Bear and put her into a Stable there. Mr. Davis happen'd to come next Morning, and he own'd her.</p>
               <p>Davis. The Man from whom the Prisoner had stole the Sheep, gave me Notice where the Mare was set up.</p>

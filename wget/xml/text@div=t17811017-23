               <p>I am a watchman, employed by the prosecutors to watch the craft. Upon Sunday, the 30th of September, about nine in the evening, I went down to look at the craft. I saw the three prisoners in a lighter of my master's, moving the staves. I told them they were too fine for them. Rutt said, D - n your eyes, how can you tell that? Then they came on shore. I went afterwards to the Watermen's-arms. The prisoners all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170024"></xptr> came in together. They continued there some time, and abused me very much for what I had said before; and two of them gave me a slap on the face. After that, I went to the craft again, and saw Currant carry off two men in a boat. He came back again. The other two prisoners were looking-out at Shadwell-dock stairs. Rutt said, D - n my eyes, we will have some staves now. Accordingly they came into the craft. Each of them had a boat. Currant took twenty-six staves out of the craft, and put them into a boat of Mr. Bowler's, of St. Olave's: I sat in the lighter, and counted them. Wellings stood on one side of me, and Rutt on the other. They d - n'd my eyes, and said, if I made any oration, they would be the death of me. I went, after that, and informed the gentlemen the staves belonged to, and then went over London-bridge, and found Currant putting some staves down the cellar of a public-house. On seeing me, he ran off. I cried, Stop thief! but he was not taken. I am sure the prisoners are the three persons.</p>

               <p>I am young master to Currant. Coming through London-bridge, as we put the craft in, Klappenberg came running down, and said, I have you! I have you! there are twenty-six staves there: he said that to my father: upon which I ran directly a-shore. I said, Very well; there I am. I turned my dark lanthorn round: I said, Who have you? He said, he had been robbed of twenty-six staves; there were three of them that had robbed him. He said he believed he knew one of them; and he went and got Grimes, and another watchman came and took the staves out.</p>
               <p>When you held up the lanthorn, he did not say it was you took the staves? - No: I believe he did not think it was.</p>
               <p>(Currant called one witness, who gave him a good character).</p>
               <p>(The other two prisoners said, in their defence, that they had committed another felony the same night, and were in custody before the time they were charged with committing this offence.)</p>
               <p>(They called two witnesses, one of whom swore that they were taken by half after twelve, and were in the watch-house either ten minutes before or ten minutes after one; the other swore that they were in the watch-house about twelve.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 31, King-street, Old Kent-road—I was in the Old Kent-road on the night of 10th June—I saw the prisoner there—I left the Old Kent-road to go home—the prisoner accompanied me till we got to the Albion-road—there are some gardens there—when we got there she demanded some money—I told her I had none—she said she knew I had, and she began to fight and to scratch—she scratched my face—I took her by the arms and held her, and she began to holloa out—a man came up, I can't say from where, and knocked me down directly, and while I was down my money was taken from my right hand trousers pocket—I cannot say who took it—I know that I had a purse and a half-sovereign and some silver in it—the prisoner and the man ran off as soon as I recovered myself and made an alarm—a policeman came to my assistance almost directly—I told him I was robbed by a man and a woman—he went and brought the prisoner back, and he had my purse in his hand—I had seen the prisoner previously in the Kent-road, but had not spoken to her—her face and figure were known to me quite well.</p>

I was in Gloucester-place on the morning when this occurred—about 1 o'clock I heard a man call "Police!"—I went to the place, and saw the prosecutor—he said he had been robbed by a man and a female—I ran up the Albany-road as far as Charles-street—I overtook the prisoner, and told her she must come back with me; I be<lb></lb>lieved her to be the person who had robbed a man—she said she did not know anything about it—I saw her moving her hand about, and heard the purse drop in the Albany-road—I took it up—this is it—it contains a half-sovereign and half a crown—I opened it when I got to the prosecutor.</p>

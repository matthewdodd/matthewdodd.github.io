                  </hi>. I am a waterman, and live at 3, Charles Street, Bromley—on 7th February, at 10.30 in the morning, I was in a barge in Limehouse dock—I saw the deceased, Smith, in his beige, and the prisoner in his—I heard them having a little conversation about the turn, who should go through the dock first—the prisoner shoved his barge's head over to Smith's barge—he got into Smith's barge, and struck him on the nose and knocked him down, and caused his nose and mouth to bleed—Smith got up and kicked the prisoner in the privates—the prisoner then went back to his own barge—they used some very bad language to each other—the prisoner came back to Smith's barge, and struck him again and knocked him down, and while Smith was lying down he heaved a piece of wood called a rowing-tack at the prisoner, which caught him in the side—he had it in his hand when the prisoner struck him—the prisoner picked it up and heaved it back at Smith, and it hit him on the head—Smith was lying down at the time—I went and lifted him up, and took him ashore, and the prisoner went back to his own barge.</p>

               <p>previous to that I saw the deceased challenge him to fight—he then put his barge's head across, and went in and had a round or scuffle—they fell nearly together—the prisoner was uppermost—they were then out of my sight, as I was in a loaded barge and they were in empty barges, but directly Smith recovered himself he jumped up and kicked the prisoner in the lower part of his body—the prisoner sat down as if in great pain for a few minutes—the prisoner then came back to his barge's head, and the prisoner threw a tack at him—he threw it back again—I don't think that hurt either of them—Smith picked it up again, and threatened if he dared to come there what ho would do to him—the prisoner then picked up another similar piece of wood, and went over to Smith's barge—they had a scuffle, a sparring match, you might term it, and Smith struck the prisoner with this piece of wood in the side—they each had a piece of wood in their baud—the prisoner did not retaliate with his piece; be threw it down, and struck Smith with his fist—when Smith recovered himself again he still had this in his hand, and he was going to do something, aiming or going to strike the prisoner—the prisoner took hold of it and they had a scuffle for the possession of it, and on the impulse of the moment, just as the prisoner got hold of it, he struck him in that way, and that was the end of it—he did not throw it at him—he was clone to him—Smith was endeavouring to strike him with it, and the prisoner took hold of it—ho was in danger of being struck—he was struck once with it when it was in Smith's hand.</p>

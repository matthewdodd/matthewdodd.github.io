                  <hi rend="italic">Prosecutor.</hi> My name is Patrick Henry—I am called Patrick Henry, since the day I was at the office—I went by that name, because they said it was necessary—before that I used generally to be called Henry—I was confirmed in 1827—before that I was called Patrick only, and after that I was generally called Henry—my mother used always to call me Patrick Henry—I generally call myself Patrick Henry, but before I went to the Police-office, Henry, generally—my mother always called me Patrick Henry after my confirmation—I was confirmed by the name of Henry only—I did not give up the name of Patrick—the bishop called me Henry, by my desire.</p>

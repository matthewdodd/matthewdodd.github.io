             sworn. - I am cowkeeper to Mr. Biggs, Mile End: On the 23d of March last I saw a man in a field; we were walking to meet each other; when I got to the bank, I saw a heap of things lay where he was; he took some of them and left some.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he seem to be doing when you first saw him? - A. He was moving the mould about; he was either hiding or taking out, I cannot say which; I stopped him, and found seven candlesticks on him, and two copper-lids for little saucepans; he said he was going to his master's with them; I told him he should go down the road with them, and when I got down into the road with him, the officer took charge of him and the things; I went back to the place where I first saw him, and there I found two candlesticks and a coffee-pot, which I gave to the officer.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Shallard.) Did he tell you he had found them? - A. No, he said he was going to his master's.</p>

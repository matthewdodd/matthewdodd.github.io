                  </hi>. I am a railway-porter at the Bricklayers' Aims Station, and live at 1, Barron's place, Waterloo-road—about half-past 5, on 7th February, I received my wages at the station, some gold and some silver—I put all the money I received in one pocket—I left the station, and walked towards the Elephant and Castle with my mate, Henry Brown; that was very nigh half-past 1, when we had done work at night—two more of our mates who were going home left us—my mate and I were walking down the Old Kent-road; he left me for a short time; I stood under a lamp-Post to sort my money, and I saw the prisoner about two yards behind me—I shifted the sovereign and half-sovereign away from the silver, and put them in my watch-pocket, and left the silver in my trousers—I had walked about twenty yards on, when the prisoner came behind me, and struck me out the head, very hard indeed; it very nigh stunned me—I turned round and seized the prisoner, and we both fell to the ground; he then tried to get his hand into my watch-pocket to take the gold out—there were no more blows struck—he could not get the money out of my pocket, as I had him so tight round the neck; and he drew a knife, or scissors, and stabbed me in the face—I called out that I was stabbed—a policeman came up—I gave the prisoner into custody, and went to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Howitt, a surgeon, of 8, York-place, Walworth-road—I was called up at 2 in the morning, and ex<lb></lb>amined Ferris at the police-station—there was an abrasion on the left cheek and an incised wound on the left ear, about a quarter of an inch in breadth and half an inch deep—that could not have been inflicted by a fell on the stones; it must have been caused by a sharp-cutting instrument.</p>

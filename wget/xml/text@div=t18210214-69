            . I am a cabinet-maker, and was with the prosecutrix in Thornaugh-street, seeing her home. Mr. Doughty, and three other gentlemen, stood in the street; and as we passed them, Mr. Doughty took her bonnet off. I asked his meaning; he made an evasive answer, saying, he would serve me the same, if I troubled my head about him. I gave him in charge - they all ran - I pointed him out; and insisted on his being taken, the other gentlemen held the watchmen, to prevent his springing his rattle. Some officers came up - Courtney Philips struck one of them. They were taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner tear the bonnet to pieces immediately - A. Yes - I do not suppose he meant to steal it for any purpose.</p>

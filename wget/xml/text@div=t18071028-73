               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose seven yards of linen, and the other articles mentioned in the indictment. - A. Yes; they were missed on the 30th of September; the linen was missed first; there were thirteen yards missed, seven yards I found upon the prisoner; the others were found, in consequence of her being taken up on the 10th of October; the prisoner had chaired for me for several months. When I first missed this, my suspicion tell on the the prisoner. On the 30th of September the prisoner was in the house; I thought there was something about her, that shewed guilt. On the Saturday following she sent word that she was ill and could not come to work; between that and the next Saturday my servant went into the back place and discovered a pair of breeches concealed between two casks; I ordered her to put them there again. On the Friday I sent to the prisoner to know if she could come to work on the Saturday; on the Saturday evening, about the time of her going away, the apprentice was put down in the kitchen, and was desired to dissemble as if he was asleep, while I and the man was in the parlour; the boy immediately upon her quitting my house, went into the kitchen to see if the breeches were gone, they were gone; he informed me; I sent my foreman after her, she came back; I was sitting in my parlour, she asked me if I wanted her; I at that same moment saw her throw something on the stairs, out of her hand; I asked her what she had throwed on the stairs, she said it was only her dirty apron; I looked at it, and shook this pair of breeches out of it; she said she did not know they were breeches, she thought it some dirty rag, she had swept up in the kitchen; I asked her where the linen was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her it would be better for her to tell where the linen was. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must not tell what she said. - A. She was then taken by the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. This linen was taken at a different time from the breeches. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Confine yourself to those pair of breeches, do you know them to be yours. - A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. On the day this woman was taken up, did you see these breeches that have been produced; where was they before this woman came into the house. - A. They were between two barrels, against the wall, I had seen them there in the middle of the week, that she was taken on the Saturday. After she left the house, I went to the casks and found they were gone; I told my master of it; he had her brought back; I saw her drop them from her apron; I picked them up.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Three yards of linen was taken from round her body, and three yards cut to pieces were found in the privy; I saw it down the privy. I had lost linen exactly of that sort.</p>

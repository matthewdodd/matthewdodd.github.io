                  </hi>. I am the wife. of Thomas Slocomb Black-man Maddox, and live in Smith-street, Marlborough-road, Chelsea. In June last I had two ponies at my stable for sale—the prisoner came about them three times—I cannot exactly say the first day he came, but it was in June—the last time he came was on the 26th of June—he at first said he came recommended by Mr. Hetherington, who he supplied with hay and straw, to look at the pair of ponies—he did not tell me his name the first day—he afterwards told me he was a farmer, living at St. Albans., that his name was Comber, and that he formerly lived at Silverton, in Northampton-shire he looked at the ponies—they had been looked at by a variety of persons before—he did not buy them the day—I had other parties in treaty for them at that time, and told him so—he made no offer for them then, nor on the second day—I did not tell him what the persons in treaty had offered—when he came on the 26th he said he had come to see whether I had disposed of the ponies—I told him I had not—he never had the ponies out of the stable, he only looked at them in the stall—he said if he could not buy horses from looking at them in the stall, he was not worthy of buying horses at all—he offered 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think first—I said it was a very low offer—I wanted 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were thirteen hands. high, very</p>

               <p>handsome, particularly good, they were bay, without spot or blemish, black legs, manes, and tails—he said other persons might offer more money, but they would give me bills—I said bills would not be accepted, for I would either take money for my ponies, or I would keep them—he then offered 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I called my mother to know whether I had better let him have the ponies—she said no, I should certainly be doing wrong—I had him into the parlour—he put his hand up to his head, and said, "Well, I must have them, I will give 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, but I cannot give any more"—he said he wanted them for a lady who was returning from France, and that she was such a kind woman, the ponies would have such a good home, and they would be kept in a meadow in front of his house till she returned—I was very fond of the ponies, having had them three years—they were my husband's property—I agreed that he should have them for 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also a large Newfoundland dog into the bargain—he then took out a cheque-book, and said he had a very large account in the Southwark branch of the London and Westminster bank—a great many cheques were gone from it, and it appeared to have been worn—he said he was a very large dealer in horses, that he supplied the Duke of Newcastle, Mr. Han<lb></lb>key, and a variety of other persons he mentioned in Wales and else-where, and he always paid in cheques, for he never carried money about with him for fear of being robbed of it—I am sorry to say this imposed upon me—he wrote the cheque, and gave it to me in my mother's presence—this now produced is it—he said that Mr. Hetherington had been kind enough to lend him a man to assist him in leading away the ponies, and that he was going with the ponies straight to Mr. Hetherington's—after unfastening the horses, he cast his eye round the stable, and asked whether I would lend him one of Peat's hunting-bridles, which was hanging up, until the Tuesday following—I lent it him, but he never returned it, and I never saw him again till he was taken into custody—before the 26th of June I had seen a man named Peter House, but I did not know at that time that it was House—I had not the least idea I had such a set about me—a man named Beament also came—I permitted the prisoner to take the ponies on receiving this cheque, and on the faith that it would be paid—I should not have parted with them, except on the belief that he had authority to draw the cheque, and that there would be money to meet it when presented—I considered it exactly as cash—I have since seen one of the ponies in the streets of Oxford, with Mr. Rack straw, an attorney, riding her—they could be ridden as well as driven—they were remarkably good-tempered and docile, from never having been knocked about or ill-treated, and yet they would go at about fourteen miles an hour.</p>

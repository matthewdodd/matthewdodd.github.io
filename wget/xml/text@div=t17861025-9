               <p>Did Mr. Loosely shew the horse to you and ask you if that was your horse, or did you walking along the stalls find out the horse? - He asked me if that was my horse, and I said it was, and I desired it might be led out into the yard, then I knew him perfectly, and am sure of him.</p>
               <p>Describe his marks? - He is a black cart gelding, about fifteen hands and a half high, a white blaze down his face, one white leg behind, the off leg, there was some hair worn off the near foot before, by wearing a log; I knew the prisoner before; I had no suspicion of any harm of him; he came to me on the 11th of July last, which was on a Tuesday, to enquire for labour; I employed him as a labourer that week and two weeks after; I never saw him after he went away; the horse was kept in my grounds, an inclosed ground.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You thought the horse had strayed? - I thought he might have broke-out.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. How old are you? - Twenty-one.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I object to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you never learn your catechism? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>What will become of you if you tell stories? - I shall come to the gallows.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, it is the perception of moral good and evil that makes him a competent witness; he must be able to know what the solemnity of a Christian oath is.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I object to his being sworn; if a man says he is an Atheist, and does not believe that there is a God, but believes that we made ourselves, and that the world formed itself out of chaos, would your Lordship swear such a man on the Christian testament?</p>
               <p>Court. I will hear some other witnesses; I may ask him some questions after the trial.</p>

               <p>I was fetched to buy this horse by the prisoner at the bar, who wanted to sell it; it was the 13th of September, it was about half after eleven; I saw the horse about twelve at the Angel Inn, Fleet-market; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250026"></xptr> went there by the prisoner's direction; it was between a cart horse and a coach-horse; it was a gelding, it was what they call a hog's eye horse; he had a speck in one eye, the off fore leg had been bald with having a log on, he had some white about one leg; I saw it run up the street, then I asked him if it was a found one; he said, as far as he knew it was; he said he had it to sell for a man that lived four miles from Tyburn; I asked him what business the man was; he said he was a gardener and was in trouble, and wanted some money to make up a debt; then I asked him the price of the horse, and he asked eight guineas for him; then I asked him if it was honestly come by; and he said he was sure it was; then I looked at the horse, I thought it looked at that time as if it was touched in the wind, rather broken winded, it was very thin, he coughed like one; says I, you must take eight pounds for him, for he is touched rather in the wind; no, he said he must have eight guineas, for the man ordered him to take no less; well then, says I, bring it up to my yard; he brought it up to my yard; I am a dealer in horses; I kept it till the Monday afterwards, that day I went down into Fore-street to one Loosely that is an officer, and I asked him to come and look at this horse, whether he thought it was honestly come by; Loosely came, and said he thought it was not, and he stopped the prisoner; the horse was advertised by the prosecutor; the prisoner was carried before the Alderman the same day; the prosecutor came to my yard about three or four days after, and the officer shewed him the horse; he said, it was his property.</p>
               <p>What do you think may be the real value of the horse? - At that time he was not worth eleven pounds, hardly so much.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What are you a licensed dealer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And your stable is in Grub-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where is your house? - In Fore-street.</p>
               <p>This man came about half after ten in the day time, and he told you publicly he had a horse to sell? - Yes; the horse was at the George in Fleet-market.</p>
               <p>Not in a little dark stable? - No, Sir, No.</p>
               <p>He was brought and run in hand; the prisoner stood by? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He told you he could not take less than eight guineas, because the man had told him not to take less? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He did not say absolutely that he was found, as you and I jockies do when we go to sell a horse of our own? - No, he said he believed he was found; the man told him he was found; he continued at my house waiting for me half an hour, while I was gone for an officer.</p>
               <p>Was he in custody of any body? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he tell you the name of this gardener? - Yes, he did, but I have forgot it; we found by the people in Covent-Garden market that there was such a man.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you or the officer take any pains to go where the man was supposed to reside? - I did not.</p>

               <p>I am an officer in the parish of Cripplegate; on Wednesday the 13th of September, I was standing at my own door in Fore-street, and Mr. Newbank came up to me, being an acquaintance, and said, I have bargained with a man for a horse, I wish you would come and be a witness that I pay him the money; he went to his own house, which is nearly opposite, to fetch the money; he called on me as he returned, and I went with him to his stables, in Grub-street, where he shewed me the horse; it was a black cart gelding, about fifteen hand and a half high, with a long tail, a blaze down his face, and both his legs wore with a logger a little, but one more than the other; he had white I believe about three of his legs; I am positive to the two, one before and the other behind; I told him, I thought he was stolen; the man was coming up, and I said to him, my friend, where did you get this horse? he said, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250027"></xptr> man gave it me on the road by East Acton; before the man came up, I told Mr. Newbank, I should stop the horse on suspicion; I stopped the horse, and took him before Alderman Curtis; it was then late in the day, and the Lord Mayor and Aldermen had done sitting, but I saw them walking in the hall, and I told them, and Mr. Alderman Curtis was kind enough to sit directly, to make an end of it; the prisoner said, a man gave it him; he said, it was a man in trouble, and he said, that a man would be at the pump at Charing-cross to receive the money of him, or an answer, whether he could dispose of the horse that night punctually; I prevailed on the Alderman to let the man go with me, to see if there was any such a man; the prisoner went with me very quietly, only he wanted to step aside now and then; I kept close to him; I went into a public house; we sat in a box that was nearly opposite that place, in case such a man should come, to apprehend him; we had two pots of beer; the prisoner did not seem very contented with that; we went out and looked all about; he then said, if that man is not there to receive the money, another man in the same coloured coat as he will be there; neither one nor the other came; we staid there about an hour and an half, or two hours; I brought the prisoner back, and put him in the compter that night; the next morning looking in the paper, I saw a horse advertised answering the marks, colour, and description of that horse; I went up to Bow-street, and gave information; I went to the prosecutor on the Saturday, and he came to town on the Sunday morning at seven, and I went with him to Mr. Newbank's stable, and shewed him the horse; he looked all round, and said, he was his, and the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What sort of a mane and tail had this horse? - A long tail, a full mane; the mane was not hogged nor the tail cut short.</p>
               <p>He told you first and last, that some other man had given him the horse to sell, you went there, the man waited anxiously at last you came away, and he still continued in the same story? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. The horse's mane and tail were not altered? - No, not a bit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Suppose they had hogged his mane, and docked his tail, should you have known your long tailed nag? - Yes, I should.</p>
               <p>Perhaps if they had cut his head off, you would have known him? - Not so perfectly I should not.</p>

               <p>Court. What did you give for this horse? - Eleven guineas; I have had him three years, and worked him at cart and plough.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were any two legs white? - All his four legs were white.</p>

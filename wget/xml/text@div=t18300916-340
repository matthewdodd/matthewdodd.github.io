            . The last witness left me four sovereigns and a friend of mine wrote this paper; I gave it to the prosecutor - the prisoner brought it next morning, and said he came for the money, which I gave him; there were three sovereigns and 16s. 6d. - he had had 3s. 6d. of me the night before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He got drunk the day before, and I took him from this lady's house - he would have a cab, and sent me back for 3s. 6d. to pay for it; he then sent me back for 1l., but I could not get that - he told me to call on him the next morning, which I did; he got out of bed, and told me to sit down - he sent for some gin, and we had four half-pints one after the other; he had promised me some time before, that when he got this money he would assist me - I asked him then to do it; he gave me this paper, and told me to go and get it, and to pay him so much a week.</p>

               <p>W. L. THORNBORROW. There is not a word of truth in it - I had not seen him for nine months before; I wrote a petition for him to get re-established in the Police, where he had been before, but lost his situation; he showed me some names of characters - he had an unfavourable answer sent back; I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>ANN CROUCH re-examined. Q. Did the prisoner come back for 3s. 6d. the same night? A. Yes; he returned in ten minutes, said the man must have a cab, and requested me to let him have 3s. 6d., which I did - he wanted a sovereign, but I would not let him have that.</p>

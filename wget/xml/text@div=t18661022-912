                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of No. 3, Mermaid Yard, Chelsea—on 13th September, about two o'clock, I was walking in George Street when Keefe jumped out from a corner, and struck me on the chest twice with his fist—the second blow knocked me across the pavement against some shutters—he then closed on me, put his arm round my throat and hurt me—two other men came up—one seized me by one hand and one by the other—Graham is one of them—I knew him by sight before, but not by name—two constables came up, and while they were coming up the prisoners ran away—I missed 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from my trousers pocket, which was turned inside out—I stood against the shutters insensible, which was caused by Keefe throttling me—he held me four or five minutes by the throat—I heard money drop on the pavement.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Keefe. Q.</hi> Was I standing there when the policeman ordered me away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was insensible, I cannot say—I had threepence in copper—I stated before, you mentioned dropping some coppers—I was perfectly sober—I was not talking to a, prostitute—I was leaning against the shutters after you struck me—I was excited, but, when I came to, I told the constable I had been robbed.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman 116 B). On the 23rd September, about two in the morning, I was with another constable in Queen's Road East—a woman told me something—I went towards George Street, and just before I got there heard some money rattling on the pavement—I turned the corner and saw Jones leaning against the shutters of a house—I could not see him till I turned the corner—Keefe was standing by him picking up some money, and Graham and another man ran away as soon as I ap<lb></lb>peared—I told Keefe to go away, because he had been creating several dis<lb></lb>turbance in the course of the evening—I did not know then what had hap<lb></lb>pened—Jones could not speak then, and I thought he was drunk, but after Keefe had gone, Jones made a communication to me, in consequence of which I ran after Keefe, and could not catch him, as he ran round into a courts—I went with Smith in search of the prisoners—I took Keefe, and shortly afterwards Graham—they were together when we took Keefe in the Grosvennor Road, but they were not apprehended together—that is about 200, yards from, where the robbery was—I did not take Keefe, because I had not had a description of him from Jones—they were walking deliberately along the street when I went up to them—Jones's trousers pocket was hanging out.</p>

On the 23rd September, about two o'clock, I received information, and went in search of Keefe and two more men, and I found the prisoners together in Grosvenor Road, Pimlico—Keefe had been described to me, and I was told there were two more—we gradually got round them, and I took Keefe—I said, "Keefe, I shall take you into custody for being concerned with two more in a highway robbery, with violence, at the corner of George Street, at two o'clock in the mor<lb></lb>ning"—he said, "You won't take me by yourself"—I put up my hand, and Husden came across, and we took him to the station—Graham followed us there—from what Husden said, I thought it would not be safe to take any more until I had seen Jones, as I did not know anything about it, or where he lived—Husden did not say that it would be desirable to take Graham—we took Keefe to the station and then went to Jones—he came to the station, and we asked him if he could describe the others—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he said, I took Graham ten minutes afterwards—I said, "I shall take you for being concerned with Keefe in committing a high-way robbery with violence, at two o'clock in the morning"—he said, "I know nothing about it. Where did it happen?"—I said, "At the corner of George Street," and pointed out the spot—he said he was drunk on Chelsea Common at two o'clock in the morning, and that he could prove—Jones identified him as soon as he saw him.</p>

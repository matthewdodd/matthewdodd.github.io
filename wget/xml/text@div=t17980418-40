I waited white he wrote the note, and I went after my master with it to St. Bartholomew's Hospital; I might be gone about an hour and ten or twenty minutes; he was to wait till I came back; when I returned, he was gone; I missed a silver ink-stand, which I put upon the table for him to write the note with, four table spoons, and three desert spoons. They were all in the parlour before dinner-time; I never found the property again.</p>
               <p>*The indictment stated it to be in the parish of St. Giles's which destroyed the capital part of the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again? - A. I look upon it about two months afterwards: I was coming up Holles-street, Cavendish-square, behind my master's carriage, and saw the prisoner half way up the street, I knew him directly; I called to the coachman, and told him; I got down, and ran to the top of Holles-street, the prisoner was then out of sight, and I saw no more of him; he ran away instantly upon his seeing me, and I lost him. He was not taken upon our account at all; he was taken for another offence.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt as to the man? - A. No; I am perfectly sure he is the man.</p>

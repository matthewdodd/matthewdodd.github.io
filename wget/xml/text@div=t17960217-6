               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. It might be an hour or two before you light candles, that you were up stairs? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. The window was not fastened when you went up stairs? - A. Yes, it was; it had not been open all day.</p>

               <p>On the 28th of January, I went down to order some beer at the Barley-mow; I was talking with the landlord and Mr. Seally; the landlady came out of the back parlour, and said to Mr. Scally, I wish you would go up stairs with me, for I think I hear somebody in my room, they went up stairs, and I went to the back door; before we got there, we heard the cry of murder, thieves, stop them, we then went back to the stairs-foot door; Mr. James cried out, shut the door, the door was shut; as soon as the door was shut, Hoppe, the little short one, was let out from the stairs; there was such a noise, we thought there were a great many more than there were; while we were securing him, Williams slipped down stairs, and got into the back room, which is a long room; I said to Mr. James, when conducting the other into the tap-room, there is one gone into the backroom, and he was standing against a back door that leads into a bye street, and he said there is nobody here; Mr. James caught hold of him by the hair, and he said, if he did not let him go, he would fire; and in the scuffle, at the further end of the passage, a pistol dropped from his pocket; I told him to see, for there was a pistol, it was snapped then in the passage, and I saw the fire; I cannot say who it was did it, but Mr. Seally has told me since, it was he that snapped it himself; we searched his pocket, and found a phosphorus-box, and chiffel, knife, with a hook to it, and then we tied his hands and his legs; that is all I know.</p>

               <p>Williams's defence. My Lord, I refer my defence to my Connsel.</p>
               <p>Hoppe's defence. It is the first offence, and I hope for mercy; as for the prisoner Williams, he knows nothing of the robbery, and I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>For Hoppe.</p>
               <p>JAMES MARSY, sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a taylor in Houndsditch, I have known Hoppe ever since he came from the Bluccoat-school; from that time he has borne a very sober, honest, industrious character; his parents are very hard working, Industrious people; within these few months I have not known any thing of him.</p>

               <p>Q. That is almost all his life; is it not? - A. Yes, before he went into the Bluecoat-school; I never heard any thing to his detriment in my life, till the present charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bear a general good character or not? - A. When he used to work at home along with his father, I never saw any thing amiss of the man; he is a tinman, and lives two doors from me.</p>

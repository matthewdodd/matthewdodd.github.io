               <p>Cane. From out of a cellar where I live.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was there last Tuesday was se'n-night?</p>
               <p>Cane. I am sure it was there last Tuesday was se'n-night; my wife saw it, but I did not. The pawnbroker that she pawn'd it with told me she brought it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he tell you so ?</p>
               <p>Cane. Last Wednesday was se'n-night, and she acknowledged that she stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the gown was found?</p>
               <p>Cane. I was at the place where the gown was found; it was found at the pawnbroker's house.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see it?</p>
               <p>C. Cane. I saw it in my cellar that morning, about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you missed it?</p>
               <p>C. Cane. I missed it about ten.</p>

               <p>C. Cane. I saw it again the day after at Mr. Welch's house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Cane. Because the man next door pected her, and said that nobody went out but she; I went to the pawnbroker's, and there I saw her come in; and mistrusting her I took hold of her, and carried her before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the gown?</p>
               <p>Cane. The pawnbroker that she pledg'd it with has it here. (The gown produced in court, and deposed to.) I know it is mine, because it is a new one and never was mended; the prisoner told Mr. Welch's servants that she took it.</p>

Justice Welch sent his man to our house with the prisoner at the bar, where she said she would pay for the gown, and desired I would speak to the justice of the peace to be as favourable to her as possible. I told her it was not in my power. She told me she would pay for the gown if she work'd her fingers to the bone, if I would interceed with the justice to forgive her.

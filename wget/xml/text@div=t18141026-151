I was at Knightsbridge-green. I had my supper at the Marquis of Granby, being soon to go to bed; I took a walk with two men and two women into the town; the prisoner was one of the women. After they had persuaded me that it was too late to go to bed, I laid down on the green with one woman on each side of me, I saw the prisoner step over the mans' back; she put her hand into my pocket, and took out my purse with the money. I understood she took a coach. and drove off to St. Giles's. I saw her run away; she threw her shoes away, and ran away. after she had got my purse. I told the other woman she had better go with me, and shew me where to find the prisoner. The prisoner took a coach; the coachman has come forward; his name is William Fox.</p>

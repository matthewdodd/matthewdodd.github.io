She came into my apartment and seemed rather in liquor; when she came in, I was lying upon the bed; she gave me one shilling to fetch three half quarterns of gin; I returned her sixpence, and then she wanted some more; and on the same day, she gave me a cloak an bonnet; I pawned it for two shillings the corner of King-street, and then three half quarterns more were drank; she abused me, and said I had got more money on the cloak than I gave her, and I went out of the place, and never went into it any more till the next morning; I left

            (To Bagley.) What had you been drinking that day? - A. Only a pennyworth of porter; and I had walked from Somers-town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you the duplicate? - A. No; I had neither duplicate nor money; when I came out, I threw the gown over my shoulders, without any thing upon my neck; and a person in the neighbourhood saw me, and sent a little girl to ask me in there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hughes, or any body else, give you a duplicate for any part of your things? - A. No; the constable found the duplicate upon the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever give her the cloak? - A. No; I did not give her any part of the things.</p>
               <p>Downes's defence. She gave this woman at the bar the cloak to pawn; she gave one shilling for liquor, and wanted more; she was so intoxicated in liquor that she could not walk; and she gave that woman the cloak to pawn to get more liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to have the constable here that found the duplicates? - A. I thought he would be here; I did not see after him.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, a circumstance struck my mind very sorcibly, in the evidence: she says, that upon the shilling being extorted from her she gave her no change; it struck me that no change could have been expected.</p>
               <p>Court. She said, they would have money of her to get drink, and did not bring any change.</p>
               <p>Bagley. My Lord, the woman is here that I lodge with, to prove I was not in liquor.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the prisoners.) Q. You say that this woman was in liquor; now you shall have your choice, whether she shall be examined or not, as to whether this woman was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Hughes. She certainly was in liquor very much; I cannot pretend to say what time she got home.</p>

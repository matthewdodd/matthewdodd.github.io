                  </hi>. I am the wife of Owen Sweeney, of 4, Providence Place, Fulham—the prisoner lived in the next room to me—I had a baby about ten months old, called Honora Sweeney—on 27th February she was sitting in the cradle in my room—I went out to chop some wood—the prisoner was in her own room, putting her baby to sleep—I left no one with my baby but another baby a year and nine months old—from the place where I was chopping wood I looked into my room, and saw my baby sitting on the prisoner's lap, agin' the fire—after that I heard a little low scream, but I took no notice, because she had been in the habit of slapping it to quiet it—I heard her say, "You little—r, she is not your mother to be crying after?"—on that I went in doors, and she was coming out of my door, meeting me—my baby was sitting on the floor; it did not seem able to cry then; it did not appear sensible—I took it up and looked at it, and it was all burnt, back and front, and the blood was coming down one side of its little thighs—the prisoner came back, and I said, "You wicked woman, why did you burn my baby like this?"—she said, "You b—r, I did not burn your baby," and took up, a chair to hit me—she was violent, and wanted to kill me—another woman took the child to a doctor—the fire was composed of coke; it was alight when I went in—the baby's clothes were not burnt a bit.</p>

I am married, and live at 2, Royal Oak, Fulham—on 27th February I heard a screaming, ran to the house, and found Mrs. Sweeney in her room, and the prisoner, halloaing, trying to get in to hit her, but I prevented her—she looked excited, and her hair hung down about her—I threw her into her own room, and knocked her down several times to keep her in—she had been drinking, and was very violent—the child had gone to the hospital before I came.</p>

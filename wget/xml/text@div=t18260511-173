On the 17th of April a customer called out that a man had stolen a shawl and ran away; I ran out - the lady pointed out the man, and I cried Stop thief! the prisoner ran up Aldersgate-street, and dropped the shawl; I lost sight of him for not more than a minute, while he turned the corner of Fan-street; I gained sight of him again - he was stopped. I am quite sure he is the person who took the shawl; I saw him as he turned the corner. The shawl was picked up, and given into my hands while I was running - this is it - it is the property of Joseph Thompson. When I came back I missed it from the place where I had seen it about five minutes before.</p>

            . I live in Fann-street, about two hundred yards from Mr. Thompson's. I was in my shop between two and three o'clock; I saw the prisoner running in the middle of the street; I pursued, and stopped him; he said it was for a window which he had broken, and he wished me to let him go, because the people were coming after him. I saw Baker and others pursuing him. I did not see the shawl.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 27th, at the Pavilion theatre - I took him to the station, and told him I wanted to know where the box was which he took from the shop - he said he knew nothing of it, but before we got to the office he voluntarily said he had taken the box, and sold it to a Jew -I found on him two letters and a pair of traces, and 5s. 6d. - he had a shirt on, which Howard claime.</p>
               <p>JAMES HOWARD. These letters were in my box; the traces are mine, and my name is on the shirt.</p>

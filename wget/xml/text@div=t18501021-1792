                  </hi>. I am a hawker, of 123, Wentworth-street, White<lb></lb>chapel. I have charge of the house, and conduct it—it is a lodging-house—the prisoner lodged there—on 27th Sept., about eleven o'clock at night, I was in my kitchen, and saw the prisoner in the yard, haring words with his woman and my woman—I went out, and found him using bad language towards them—I spoke to him—he commenced abusing me—I said I would not put up with such insulting language, and caught hold of him to turn him, out at the side-door—at that moment I felt a pain in my left side—I thought it arose from a cold, and went indoors, and got the landlord's wife, who lived next door, to come and make all quiet—I went out to shut the shutters, and felt pain still—I remained in the kitchen till twelve, when I went to bad, and found my side saturated with blood—I became faint, and was not able to undress myself—I found a wound, and was in the hospital from that Sunday to the next Saturday—the woman I live with is not here; she was afraid of being punished for perjury.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 18). I took the prisoner—he was m bed with a female, at 6, Plough-court, Whitechapel—I saw a knife under the snacking of the bed, and a handkerchief, and piece of rag with some halfpence in it—the woman said that the knife was the prisoner's—I remarked to the sergeant, at the station, that the small blade was broken—the prisoner said, "The blade was broken when it was given me by a man a few months ago; if the large blade is broken, I am guilty"—the large blade was not broken—he appeared to be recovering from drunkenness.</p>

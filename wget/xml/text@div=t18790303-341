I am in the service of Mr. Owen, bottle and packing-case maker, of 38, Minories—I shall be 74 on the last day of the month—on Saturday, 15th February, I was in Haydon Passage, Minories—I had been to the London and Westminster Bank, City branch, and was returning with a black bag containing 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—some one seized my left hand and dragged the bag from me—I could not see because my head was doubled down under me—there was more than one man—I was on the ground, and called for assistance—my arm was hurt—I saw a man before me, and went to take hold of him, and he said he had nothing to do with it—I saw two more men go down the passage—I gave information to the police.</p>

I am the wife of John Wood, of 30, Trinity Square Tower Hill—I was going through Haydon Passage, and saw three men standing at the corner, and Harvey met me half-way in the passage—shortly after I heard cries of "Murder" and "Police"—I went to his assistance, and the three men ran past me into Mansell Street—I first saw Harvey on the ground struggling with the three men—James is one of them—I recognised him amongst others on the 19th in the station-yard—he had a beard on the day of the robbery, and at the station he was clean shaved.</p>

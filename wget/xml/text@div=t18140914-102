               <p>Q. On Tuesday, the 6th of September, had you received any bank notes - A. Yes, at Messrs. Fullers I received them, there were near two hundred pounds altogether; they were ten's, five's, and one's. I put the notes into my pocket-book when I received them, and my pocket-book into my breast pocket; I left the Exchange about five o'clock; as I was leaving the Exchange,

               <p>Q. Was there any other person in the room at first - A. There was a little girl of twelve years old. The moment I saw the door locked, I was afraid; I wanted to go directly. Ferguson asked the little girl to go down, and ask the other lady to come up;

             came and set on my left knee; when she came up, she got a working my coat outside, so as to raise the pocket-book up to the top of my pocket; then Ferguson came close, and looked over my shoulder, took the pocket-book, and ran down stairs. While Ferguson was down stairs, Dobson kept her arms round my neck. Ferguson came up stairs, and tried to put the pocket-book into my pocket, it fell down; I picked it up, and found all the notes were gone. Ferguson then took out the key, and said I might go if I pleased. After I picked up the pocket-book; I said to Furguson, you have taken my money away; they told me I was wrong, I said, yes, one of us must be wrong; I shall go and find a constable. I saw a man of the name of Kippax; I asked his assistance. I took one, he took the other, to the office; we secured them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you more money than what you received at the bankers - A. Yes. I had one hundred and ninety four-pounds, or two hundred and four pounds, I am not sure which.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. This was an aukward cruise that you had; how many notes did you get at the bankers - A. One hundred and sixty-seven notes. I cannot recollect what notes I had besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the girl took your pocket-book, why did not you take it out of her hand - A. I was afraid there was some people below; I was afraid of being killed.</p>

            . I am a Greenwich pensioner. On Tuesday, the 6th of September, I was at my brother's house, in Church-lane; there is an alley by the side of our house, I saw the Captain and Ferguson came down the street, about five o'clock, he had hold of Ferguson by the hand; I saw them again in about ten minutes afterwards; he was singing out for a constable. I went to the door immediately; he came up our steps with Ferguson in his hand; he said, these girls had robbed him to a great amount. I saw Dobson, she had a key in her hand. I went for a constable; I could not get one. I told Dobson to come along with me; she threatened to knock me down. I said, come along to the magistrate. I assisted in taking the prisoners to the office; I delivered them over to Dalton, the officer.</p>

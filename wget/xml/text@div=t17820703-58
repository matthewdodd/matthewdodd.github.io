               <p>I am the wife of the last witness. On the 27th of May, I went to bed about nine o'clock. At, I believe, between twelve and one o'clock, a man came into my room, and fell upon me, and covered my face. I screamed out. He d - ned me, and said, You are a dead woman, if you make any noise. I begged him to spare my life . He said, I will not hurt you, you bloody b - h, if you don't speak. He asked for my silver spoons, my Bank-notes, and keys. I told him I had no Bank-notes. The man that lay over me talked to another man. They broke open a box, but did not take any thing out of it. They took my ring off my finger . Then they tied my hands behind me, and said, If I stirred, in less than half an hour they would come back, and blow my brains out.</p>
               <p>Did one man lie upon you all the time? - Yes; for about half an hour. When they were gone, I lay some time. Then I got up, and alarmed some of my neighbours, and sent for my husband.</p>
               <p>(I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment, repeating them.)</p>
               <p>There are two back-doors to the house; one goes out of the yard into the City-road, the other out of the kitchen into the yard: that door I bolted the night before. There is a window close to it: that I left secure. The door out of the yard into the City-road is usually kept locked, and the key hangs behind the street-door. On the next morning, the door out of the kitchen into the yard was open. The window was taken quite out . The door into the City-road, was locked, and the key taken away. My husband came home about five o'clock, and we sent for some of the Justice's men. They found on the kitchen dresser some brown paper, in which seven yards of scarlet cloth had been packed, which had been left in my care by a Mr. Jones. They had unpacked the truss, taken the cloth out, and left the paper behind them.</p>

I asked where they were going with that bundle. They said, to a waggon. I said, they must go to the watch-house, and give an account of themselves. They said, they would do that willingly. We went together till we came to the end of the street. Then one of them said to the other, Go on with the bundle, as fast as you can, to the left. I said, No, gentlemen, you must not go to the left; to the right is the way to the watch-house. Upon that, one of them stepped back,

I followed them till I met with these watchmen.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178207030042"></xptr> I called to them to stop the man with the bundle, for I was mortally wounded. Upon that, I saw him drop the bundle; and he was taken. I was carried to the hospital. My life was despaired of for a fortnight. I believe the man in blue (Lee) to be the man that had the bundle. I followed him from Brick-lane to the upper end of Mitchell-street . The other prisoner walked by me the whole length of the street. We had a good deal of conversation. From the whole of his appearance, his visage, his stature, and his voice, I believe him to be the man. When I was taken to the Office, I gave a description of the person by his visage and stature, and said I should remember his voice. Upon my description, he was taken up. I saw him eight days after, and gave the same account. I now believe he is the man, but I cannot swear positively to him.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I apprehended Baker. I broke open the door, and found him and his girl in bed. There was a little trunk in the room. I asked who it belonged to. He said, to him, and gave me the key out of his pocket. I found in it a silk handkerchief, and a pair of buckles. Mrs. Pritchard described the handkerchief before she saw it.</p>

               <p>About the 27th or 28th of May, having an information, I went with some other officers, to take Baker. We broke the door open, and went in. There was a trunk in the room. Gippin asked him whose trunk it was. He said, Mine, and gave him the key; and he opened it, and found a silk handkerchief and a pair of buckles. Baker asked what he was apprehended for. I said, for cutting a watchman. He said, he wished he had cut his head off. He was dressing himself, and trembled very much at the time .</p>
               <p>Was Gippin present? - Yes, but was searching for fire-arms, and might not hear that.</p>

I am in the employment of Dr. Hunter, of Upper Seymour-street, as hall-porter—I know the prisoners—on Thursday, 2d November, Jones came there about ten minutes to 1—he was then alone—Merrick came about half an hour afterwards—when Jones came, he asked me if he could see Dr. Hunter—I told him he was engaged; if he would wait, he could see him in his turn—I showed him into the waiting-room, and he was there when Merrick arrived—Dr. Hunter was still engaged, and unable to see them—Jones said he could not wait any longer, and I showed him into Dr. Melville's consulting-room—he had a consulting-room in the same house—Merrick was following him—I said to him, "Can't you wait?" he said, "I am Mr. Jones' brother"—I said, "You had better go in there too, and I will go up and see Dr. Hunter, and tell him"—Jones got very excited—I told Dr. Melville that Mr. Jones was getting very excited; he had better go and speak to him—he went in and told him that he must wait, that Dr. Hunter was engaged—I was standing at the banister, and he rushed out of the room and said, "You are all d—d scamps, "and knocked me down, and ran upstairs—Merrick followed—they both rushed up two stairs at a time, as fast as ever they could go—directly they rushed up stairs, I went out for a policeman—I did not see one, but Dr. Hunter's coachman was at the door, and I asked him to get one—I then ran up stairs to try and give assistance to protect Dr. Hunter from further violence—I went and stood between Jones and Dr. Hunter—Jones took me round the waist and threw me away—I did not see Merrick do anything—he was in custody of a police-constable—the policeman got there almost as soon as I got there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a graduate of the University of Edinburgh, of the year 1837—in the month of October I knew Mrs. Merrick, a patient—I have a consulting-room in the same hones as Dr. Hunter, and assist him—Mrs. Merrick lived at 52, Upper Baker-street—I visited her in company with Dr. Wills, on the 21st October, and on 23d, 24tb, and 27th—I visited her alone on the 27th—the last time I went there, I saw Jones—I understood him to say he was the brother of Mrs. Merrick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In consequence of directions you had received from Dr. Hunter, did you tell Jones that you wished Mr. Merrick to call on Dr. Hunter and see him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say it was in consequence of directions I had received, but I did request him to do so—I at first addressed him as Mr. Merrick—he said, "I am not Mr. Merrick, I am Mrs. Merrick's brother"—I then said, "Will you be kind enough to ask Mr. Merrick to come down and see us to morrow; the attendance now I think no longer necessary, and we should like to see Mr. Merrick on the subject—on the following Tuesday morning, I received a communication from Dr. Hunter about these people—on Thursday, 2d November, about 2 o'clock, the last witness came to me, and said, "Mr. Jones is in a very excited state, he seems very angry"—I said, "You had hotter show him into my room"—that was the front room on the ground floor—I came down from up stairs to see Jones—I found two other persons in the hall besides Jones—I recognise Merrick as one of them—Jones said he wanted to see Dr. Hunter—I replied, "You can't see him at present, because he is engaged with a patient; you will have to wait"—he was at that time sitting on the chair, and he rose up and said, "I will see Dr. Hunter," and he rushed quickly out of the room—I followed him—he went up stairs—as he went up stairs I heard his voice, but I could not catch exactly what he said—at that time Merrick was in the hall—the servant was in a state of great excitement, and I said to him, "William, you bad better go and get a policeman"—there was some other person in the hall, and I addressed him and asked him to walk into the reception-room—I then went up stairs, because at that time I heard a confusion and noise upstairs—I went directly into Dr. Hunter's room; at least, I attempted to enter it, but I could not get in—as soon as I got to the top of the landing, I saw Dr. Hunter with his head against the wall; Jones on his right hand side, with Dr. Hunter's ear in his mouth; Mrs. Hunter standing between the two; Merrick in front of Dr. Hunter, with his hand extended to his throat; Dr. Hunter's daughter on the other side, and Dr. Munns just at the side of Jones, endeavouring to disengage him—I did not at any time see anything in the hands of either of the parties—I endeavoured and succeeded, I think, moving Merrick—I got him by the arms behind, and drew him back-wards</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186512180005"></xptr>
               <p>—believe Dr. Munns was instrumental in removing Jones—he again rushed to endeavour to assault Hunter—Merrick at that time was standing quietly enough on the landing, where there were several others, and the policeman was there by that time—I noticed the state of Dr. Hunter's ear; there was a lacerated wound which was bleeding very profusely—I heard Jones, before he was removed, say why he had come there—I was remon-strating with Merrick and said, "You know you" have laid yourself open to a criminal indictment for this proceeding"—Jones, I think, overheard me, and he said, "You don't suppose I came here not knowing the consequence; I came here to give him a licking"—I think he called the doctor an infernal scoundrel—they were subsequently removed by a police-constable—I have known Dr. Hunter very nearly eleven years.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 3, Queen's-gate-terrace, but I have a professional residence in Upper Seymour-street—I am a registered licentiate in medicine and surgery, and a Doctor of Medicine—among many patients there was a person of the name of Mrs. Merrick—I first saw her, I think, on 25th September—she came to my house to consult me—she made seven or eight visits—Dr. Melville is associated with me in practice as a partner—subsequently to these visits of Mrs. Merrick's, she took a severe cold, and had an attack of pleural pneumonia, and was obliged to keep her house—two of the gentlemen associated with me visited her—on Monday, 30th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186512180006"></xptr>
               <p>October, Mr. Merrick called upon me—he stated that Dr. Melville bad left word for him to come down and see me in regard to the payment of fees—I explained to him that he was indebted to the medical men for their visits, that the mouth had expired by four days, and it was impossible for us to go on, unless the regular fees were paid—he disputed the right of the medical men to be paid for their visits—I called his attention to the fee-card, which distinctly states that all out-visits are extra—he then said, "You won't continue attendance, unless I pay this?"—I said, "Certainly not, unless you arrange for them, and pay the monthly fee, inasmuch as the expense we have already been put to is considerably more than the amount received in fees"—he again asked me whether I would not allow the fees to remain unpaid, and continue my attendance—I told him I would mention the matter to Dr. Melville, but, so far as I had any connexion with it, we would not continue the attendance—he left very much dissatisfied—Mrs. Merrick had been supplied with an inhaling machine and medicines, and so forth, which had been rendered necessary by this attack of illness—on Thursday, 2d November, I was in my consulting-room from an early hour, perhaps half-past 10—I think it might have been after 2 o'clock when I heard a loud excited talk in the adjoining room, in which my wife and daughter, and Dr. Munns were sitting, and, thinking that the servants had had some dispute, I went to the door to ascertain what it was—immediately upon opening the door I received a heavy blow over the top of the head with this cane (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these are the pieces—the blow was struck by Jones, with the cane held in this manner, the moment my head appeared at the door—before I was conscious of what was taking place, I must have received two blows, as there were two heavy ridges over the head afterwards; but of course, in the excitement of the moment, it was not possible to say—Merrick, being a smaller man, was in front of Jones—Jones struck over his head—both of them rushed into the room—I succeeded in defending my face—Merrick got round on my left-hand side—Jones was on the right—Merrick got under my guard—I held up my arms to guard my face, and I turned towards him, and struck him down against the table—as I did so, Jones worked in upon me, his cane having broken in his hand, and fastened his teeth in my right ear; he bit the ear almost quite through—it bled very profusely, so as to saturate my coat and shirt, and even the floor—Merrick recovered himself, and seized me by the throat—almost at the same instant as Jones fastened his teeth in my ear, Mrs. Hunter and my daughter rushed from the adjoining room, and seized hold of my arms with a view of pro<lb></lb>tecting me—with their assistance, and that of one of the medical gentlemen and the policeman, I was released from them—they were then given into custody, and taken to the police court—they were committed on that very day for trial at the Middlesex Sessions on the ensuing Monday—on the Saturday night before that Monday, at half-past 10 o'clock, I was taken into custody, on a warrant, on a charge of rape, and locked up—upon an appli<lb></lb>cation being made to postpone this trial of assault at the Sessions, I in<lb></lb>structed my Counsel to oppose it.</p>

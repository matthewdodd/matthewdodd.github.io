                  </hi>. I am a Greenwich pensioner. I was in the Infirmary and got leave to go out for a few hours, on the 19th of May—I went to the Red Lion—I had a pint of beer—I paid one shilling, and had sixpence and four penny-pieces in change—I put my beer down in the parlour, and went into the tap-room to light my pipe—I had then 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, four penny-pieces, and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in a leather purse, in my waistcoat pocket—probably the string might be hanging out, I cannot say—I was not three minutes gone into the tap—I then returned and drank my beer up—I went out, and did not walk above three yards before I missed my purse—I do not know who took it—I am nearly blind.</p>

About two years and a half ago I bought a quantity of them, about three hundred weight, they came to my house with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Camper. I keep a publick-house upon Wapping Wall, Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of sugar was this you speak of, about three hundred weight?</p>
               <p>Camper. It was coarse sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give them for it per pound?</p>
               <p>Camper. I used to give them twopence farthing or twopence halfpenny per pound, what I gave for that I cannot tell now.</p>
               <p>Q. What might that sugar be worth?</p>
               <p>Camper. At that time the same sort of sugar was worth five pence per pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that at the same time you bought it?</p>
               <p>Camper. Yes, I did; I knew they did not come honestly by it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know that?</p>
               <p>Camper. They told me they stole it, for people that deal that way make them all alike that trade with them; they used to come at unusual times of the night.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to give this information?</p>
               <p>Camper. To clear myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How, to clear yourself?</p>
               <p>Camper. There was a great deal of noise about the water side, was the reason I gave information; and, please your lordship, one of the prisoners is the only man in England to open and shut up a hogshead.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was your fall in Cheapside in consequence of your having spent the evening out, or some sudden illness? A. I am subject to giddiness - I think it happened from giddiness - I had not power to save myself - I had been drinking a glass of wine, and some spirits and water - I really believe I was not the worse for liquor - I had been spending the evening in Fleet-street with some friends - I joined them about nine o'clock- I did not feel the worse for liquor - my money was safe just before I joined my friends - I was picked up near the west end of Cheapside, about a stone's throw from St. Paul's Church-yard - I fell about the second turning on the left hand side, in Cheapside, in going from St. Paul's - I do not know the name of the street - I have lived in London ten or eleven years - I know my money was safe when I left my friends, as I knew no one had taken it - I put the sovereign and twenty shillings in the paper just before I met my friends - I counted it, and put it into my left waistcoat pocket - I had accompanied a friend part of the way from Fleet-street; and it was my intention to go over Southwark-bridge to Charlotte-street - I left my friend at the turning leading to the Post-office - that was the place as near as I can recollect - but we do not attach any importance to common-place affairs - my nearest way home would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200068"></xptr>have been over Blackfriars'-bridge; but I frequently go the other way, and when you are very late, it makes no difference - I do not recollect falling down after I parted with my friend, till the time I was picked up by the watchman.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What was your object in crossing, and going along on the left hand side of Cheapside, if you were going over the iron bridge? A. I had parted with my friend on that side, and kept on there - I did not speak to any one.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where had you spent the evening? A. At the Boar's Head, in Fleet-street, on the left hand side as you go up - I crossed the street near St. Bride's avenue - it was about there; I really cannot recollect exactly - I think I crossed near the end of Fleet-street - I was not drunk; to the best of my belief, I had all my senses about me - I might be a little the worse for liquor, very likely I was - my memory was not affected - I have told you as near as I can where I parted with my friend - I am a printer.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Who took your money from you? A. I do not know - I did not object to its being taken - there were three or four persons in the watch-house - it was by a person representing himself as an officer.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You stated you were no worse for liquor; and now you state, "Very likely I was:" how do you reconcile that? A. I was not drunk - my friend and I came away together - there were five or six other persons at the public-house, but they dispersed - I parted with my friend at the end, near the Post-office, to the best of my belief.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Farringdon Within - I saw the prosecutor brought into the watch-house, when he had been picked up at the corner of Gutter-lane, by a man, named Shield - he was a little in liquor, but he knew what he was about - the prisoner was the night-constable - I went up-stairs to my mother to fetch a wash-hand-basin, as the prosecutor's hands and face were covered with blood - I washed his face and hands, and Laws, who was there, asked him where he lived, but he could not give him any answer - Laws then put his hand into his pocket, to see if he had any direction there; and he took out a paper with two half-crowns in it - Mr. Smith said, "You have got 5s. of mine, where is it?" - Laws said,"On the table" - the prisoner then began to search the prosecutor, and from his left hand waistcoat pocket he took his watch, and broke the guard, which was round his neck- when he had taken that watch, he gave it to a friend he had in the room with him - Laws then said to the prisoner, "If you are not capable of taking care of it, I will"- the prisoner then put his hand into the prosecutor's left-hand trowsers pocket three different times, and put his hand into his own pocket; and the third time he did so, I called to Mr. Laws, and the prisoner seemed confused, and dropped one shilling from his hand - Laws said, "Hutchinson, pull the property you got from the gentleman out of your pocket;" and he then threw 7s., or more, out of his pocket on the table - Laws said, "That is not all, Hutchinson;" and he threw out 11s. more; and he said, "I changed a sovereign over at Mr. Colburn's;" and he then pulled out some other silver out of his right-hand trowsers pocket, which was not the pocket he had put his hand into before - the prisoner then said to me, "You have no business in this room, Mr. Charley;" and he knocked me down, and tried to lift me out of the room, but he could not - he then took hold of my collar - Laws then said, "I will not have this, Hutchinson;" and the prisoner then took Laws by the collar, and Laws sent the prisoner to the Compter by the inspector - I went with him, and he sat down and put his hand into his pocket, and some silver was taken from under him by the inspector - the prisoner tried to put three half-crowns and two shillings on the bed- he was drunk.</p>

Yes, and my wife's name is Ann - I have a little boy named Springhall, and his Christian name is John - I am a porter by business, and live in Green Dragon-court - my wife's name is Springhall - my father married two wives, and I did not know my name was Springhall for eighteen years - I always went by the name of Jones - I have been a watchman five years - my beat is in Alderman Kelly's ward - I was married in the name of Springhall.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever here before? A. Only as a witness, never for anything else - I will swear that - I was tried here for perjury, but I was quite a youth at the time - I did not know what things were.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you mean by saying you were never here but as a witness? A. I came here as a witness, but they cross-questioned me so, that they made me say first one thing and then another, that is seven or eight years ago - I was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you in prison? A. Seven weeks - I never was in prison before nor since - I was at that time committed by the order of the court - I was never charged with stealing a box or anything else - I did not put my hand into the prosecutor's pocket - I never said I did.</p>

            . I am inspector of the nightly watch, of Farringdon Within - I was on duty when the prosecutor was brought in - he was very tipsy - I think he was beyond knowing what was going on - he was searched by the prisoner, (who was the night officer,) and myself - the prisoner took a purse, containing £3 odd in silver and gold, from his trousers pocket, and he took his watch from his fob, to the best of my knowledge, and he broke the guard - he was going to hand the watch to a friend he had in the watch-house - I objected to it, and said if he was not capable of taking care of it I would - I insisted upon having it laid on the table, that every one might see it - the prisoner was not sober - I then took a paper, containing two half-crowns, from the prosecutor's pocket, and laid it on the table - Jones then said that the prisoner had taken something from the prosecutor's pocket, three times, and I accused the prisoner of it - he said he had taken it, but it was his intention to put it down - he then put down 9s. 6d. - I told him that was not all, as I felt some more outside his pocket - he then took out 11s. 6d. more - he then told Jones he had no business there, and he knocked Jones down twice - I assisted in getting Jones up, and the prisoner took me by the collar - I then ordered my brother inspector to take him to the Compter.</p>

For robbing the prosecutor - I never divided any money which had been taken from a prisoner - I never received any money from Mr. Colburn's, the profits of bringing a man to the watch-house - I got 6s. about a month ago, but it was made me a present of - a young man was walking in St. Paul's Church-yard with a woman - he took an umbrella from her, and was given in charge for it, and brought to the watch-house - the prisoner was the night-officer, and I am the inspector - it was the night-officer's duty to discharge him, but I had nothing to do with it - I left the room - I waited outside in the passage - the young man said to me, "I have no money," and he went to Newgate-street and got a sovereign - I was in the public-house, having a glass of ale - the young man came in, got change for the sovereign, and laid 6s. down on the bar - it was for drink, but whether he said it was for the men to drink, I cannot tell - I took it up from the bar - we had 2s. worth of brandy and water - the prisoner Hutchinson had some of it - I gave the watchman 2s. and I had 2s. myself - it never occurred to me that this was compounding a felony - I have been an officer four years - I have been asked to drink, and now and then a shilling has been given to me - I never took money from a stranger, but I knew that young man, he was a respectable person - I do not know his name, but he lived at Mr. Moules's, a cheesemonger - I never took money from a prisoner to let him go- I do not recollect that the prosecutor said anything to me when I took the 5s. from him, nor in my hearing - I gave my evidence before the magistrate in this case.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send the prisoner to the Compter for felony, or for knocking down Jones? A. I sent him there for the assault - I do not recollect which I sent him for - I believe it was for felony; to the best of my belief it was- I gave the order to John Smith - I did say before, that I sent him for the assault; but you confused me at the time- I believe the prosecutor did not swear that I was the person who took the purse from him; but I will not be on my oath he did not - I took the two half-crowns, as I saw the paper in his pocket; and I thought his name might be on it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How many times did the prisoner give you money? A. Twice; and he then knocked down Jones - I did not give him in charge till after he knocked him down.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was the reason, when you had seen a felony, you did not give him into custody till after he had knocked down Jones, and that then you sent him for the assault?

I will not be on oath whether I sent him for the felony or the assault - I went to our gentlemen the next day, and they advised me to go and see the prosecutor, which I did; and I told him he had been robbed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it your duty as an inspector of the watch to see that the watchmen do their duty, and that the prisoners do not escape? A. Yes, certainly - I have been outside while Laws was examined, I did not hear a word of the examination - the prosecutor was brought to the watch-house and he was drunk - he could speak - Laws asked him his name - he said he would not give his name - he did not remain silent, and would not speak while I was there - Hutchinson was the first who began to search the prosecutor to my knowledge: he shoved the money and the watch he found on him to a friend of his who sat there to take care of it - there were two half-crowns in a paper, which I believe Laws took - Laws said, perhaps the paper would tell where the gentleman lived - that was before it was put on the table - Laws said to Hutchinson, "If you cannot take care of it, I will" - Hutchinson was drunk, but not insensible - I saw him put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket - I did not see him take anything out, nor put anything into his own pocket, but I was not looking - Laws had before said that no stranger ought to interfere - Laws then told the prisoner to produce the money - he pulled out 9s. 6d., and said he had got no more; but he afterwards produced 11s 6d. more from one of his pockets, and said he had changed a sovereign at Mr. Colburn's, and he had 18s. 9d. - when I got him to the Compter I found 2s. 6d. and 11/2d. in the seat, and three half-crowns and 2s. on his person - I remember a man being brought to the watch-house charged with stealing an umbrella from a woman - I was there with the prisoner, and the watchman who brought the man in - I do not know whether any one else was there - the woman charged him with stealing the umbrella - I was there before the man went away - I cannot say that he was present when the woman gave the charge - the man was let go - Laws afterwards went to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200070"></xptr>Colburn's - he did not tell me he had got any money there - I did not see any money there; but Laws told me the prisoner who was discharged for stealing the umbrella had left some money, and there was something to drink - I had some brandy and water, and there were other persons drank of it; I cannot say how many - Laws took me over, and told me the gentleman had left some money for brandy and water - he told me he had given the watchman 2s. - Hutchinson was not at the public-house with me - Laws told me he had kept the other 2s. himself.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Were you present when the young man was discharged? A.

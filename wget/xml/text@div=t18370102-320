I am a brewer, and live at Plaistow, in the parish of west Ham, Essex; it is my dwelling-house—I have no partner, on the morning of the 23rd of December I was called up by a servant who is not here, at a little after seven o'clock—I went down stairs, and observed the place in great confusion—the closet door in the back parlour forced and several I glasses, decanters of wine, cruets, and some cake on the table which had all been taken out of the cupboard—the cruets and liquor bottles were out of the frames, and the frames were missing—I saw the shutter of</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of Lambeth-street Police<lb></lb>office. On Saturday the 31st of December, the prisoner Langton came to the office of his own accord, and stated that he was afraid he had got him<lb></lb>self into trouble, or was likely to get into trouble on account of some sil<lb></lb>ver spoons he had purchased of a man dressed in a brown coat, about thirty-two or thirty-three years of age—he stated hat he asked him at the time he offered him the spoons, the particulars whether they were his won and the party seemed very much offended at the question, and stated that he had a bill to make up, and was ashamed to go to a pawnbroker's with the articles to pawn them—that the man asked him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, which he refused to give, but gave him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, and a half-crown for a set of fire-irons—I asked him where the spoons were—he said, "At Mr. Wil<lb></lb>liam's, the pawnbroker's"—1 said he bad better go with me to Williams's and I would make inquiry into it—on the way to Williams's, the prison's house being on the road, I called there and saw his wife, and in cones<lb></lb>quence of what she said, I understood a policeman had gone to tell wil<lb></lb>liams to come to the police-office—I told the prisoner then we night as well go to the police-office at once—he said he was quite willing to go be<lb></lb>fore a Magistrate to clear the point up—I went with him as far as the police-office, and gave the statement I have now done here—I stated there that he had come to me for advice—he was not aware that the officer had gone to the pawnbroker's till I went with him to his wife—I learnt in the mean time that Andrews was gone to the pawnbroker's—Langton brought some fire-irons, and I told him he had better take them down with him, and they were taken down—I produce a cap, a shoe, and a knife—I received</p>

               <p>the cap and shoe from Mr. Sewell—either of the prisoners could wear the cap, being torn at the back—it would fit either of their heads—at the Thames Police-office we were directed to take Goddard and Knowlan out<lb></lb>side, and fit the shoes to their feet, and we fitted them to both their feet—either of them could get them on and wear them, but they fit Knowlan pro<lb></lb>perly, they are too long for Goddard—I received a pair from Mr. Sewell at first, but detained one, and sent the other to be tried, respecting another burglary.</p>

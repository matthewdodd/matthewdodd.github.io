                  </hi>. I have been in the workhouse since last Friday week. On the 25th of June I slept in Catherine-street, Vinegar-ground—on the 26th I got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with a gentleman—the prisoner drove that <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to Portman-square, I believe—the gentleman got out there—I also got oat, but got in again, and told the prisoner to drive me down to the City-road again—it was a close <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I had got in at the end of Old-street-road—the gentleman paid the fare up to Portman-square—the prisoner drove from the square some distance—he pulled up, and I went and took part of a quartern of gin with him at some public-house—I do not know where it was—he ordered it—I got out—the "public-house was closing—it was just before twelve o'clock—I got in again—he got on the box, and went on to some square—he then pulled up, got off the box, put the reins inside the front window, and got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to me—he took liberties with me—I resisted, and told him if he would not drive me to the City-road, I would walk—I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he struck me, and put bis hand inside the front of my dress, which was open, and tore my pocket off—he struck me on my hack, and kicked me on my hip, before he took it—I asked him for my pocket—he said he had not got it—I said he had—I called "Police"—a policeman came—I told him the prisoner had taken my pocket, which had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a duplicate pinned in the corner—I gave him in charge—the policeman put me into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and I went to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 157.) I went into Dorset-square on the night of the 26th of June, at half-past eleven o'clock—I saw the prisoner on the box of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and the prosecutrix clinging to the side by the door—when the prisoner saw me he got off the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and said he had lost his whip—I heard the prosecutrix say before that, "You give me my money, you have robbed me"—I asked what was the matter—he said he knew nothing about it—she was clinging to the side of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at the time—I went up to the prosecutrix, and asked her what was the matter—she told me the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>

               <p>had attempted to take liberties with her, and she had refused; that he then put his hands up her clothes, and snatched her pocket from her side, which contained two shillings and a duplicate—I asked the prisoner whether he knew any thing about the pocket—he said, "I do not"—I then asked him to allow me to search him—he said, "Certainly you may"—I searched him, but found nothing—the prosecutrix was staggering at the time, in liquor—I told her to get inside the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—she was reeling about—I was afraid she would fall down—I opened the door to hand her in, when the prisoner came behind her, hit her a violent blow on the neck, and kicked her on the back—I laid hold of him by the collar, to drag him away from her, and threw him down—I then told him I would search the boot of his <hi rend="italic">cab—</hi> I then saw him go round the side of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> nearest to the iron rails and hedge of the square—I then saw something white hanging on the iron rails—I saw him throw it over the iron rails, across the hedge, into the. garden—I then went round to him, collared him, and asked what he had done with the pocket—he said he knew nothing about it—I said, "I just saw you throw it over into the garden"—he said, "For God's sake, policeman, say nothing about it, the girl is drunk, and there is no-body will see you, here is 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for you"—I told him I would take no such thing—a coachman was coming by at the time—I asked him to hold the prisoner while I got over to see what he bad thrown over, and I found this pocket, with the duplicate inside—when I was getting over the iron raite again, he was struggling with the coachman—I laid bold of him and shook him—he said, "Policeman, there was only two shillings in the pocket, and that you will find in the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; you shall have that, and half-a-crown besides, as there is nobody about if you will let me go"—I told him I would do no such thing, he should have thought of that before—he then attempted to struggle with me again to get away—I shook him again, and told him he must come to the station-house—he said, "If I most go, I will go quietly"—I told him to get on the box of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he did so, and I followed—he took the reins in his hand, and told me he would drive—I took them out of his hand, and said I would drive to the station-house—he turned about to put the whip inside, then jumped off, and made his escape—I jumped off after him as soon at I could stop the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and hallooed, "Stop thief"—he was taken in Edward-street, by a constable, (Butler, D 66, I believe)—he ran down where there is no thoroughfare—I ordered the constable to take the prisoner to the station, while I took the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> down—I searched it there, and found two shillings at the bottom, inside.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go straight from here to the workhouse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She had had nothing to eat all day long, and no money—of course I took her in to have something to eat and drink, I could not let her starve—I suppose we might be three hours there—I was with my friends and brother constables drinking and singing—she did not sing, to my knowledge—I think she had some biscuit, cheese, and ale, and perhaps some cherries and some<lb></lb>thing else—that was after five o'clock—she told me the prisoner had ill-used her before he took the pocket—she said nothing about striking or kicking—she said he had been taking liberties—she was out of my sight after leaving the Court on Monday—I went after her, and found her at a turning going out of Ludgate-hill—I saw her come out or the door of what appeared to be a house—I went after her, thinking she might have been decoyed away by the prisoner's friends, and seeing that gentleman there, (<hi rend="italic">pointing to a person in Court</hi>,) very anxious at the time—she had some one with her when she came out—it was not one of the prisoner's friends.</p>

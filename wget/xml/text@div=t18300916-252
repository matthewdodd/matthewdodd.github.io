               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the prisoner behave in the most savage manner possible? A. Yes, he was more mad than drunk; he never gave the man that was knocked down the slightest assistance - I was quite sober; the man was taken home before the number of the cart was given; the prisoner was not one of the persons who helped him home - he went to the man's house after his cart was let go; I was at the Inquest, but I did not see him there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know he did not go home with the man? A. Because I stood with the cart till the man went home; he was taken home before the prisoner jumped out of the cart.</p>

            . I am ostler at Mrs. Snow's, Manor-street. I was at the stable door, heard a cart coming round the corner, and then a person call once or twice, after it got round, but I was fifty or sixty yards off, and did not see what happened; I almost instantly heard the poor man groaning dreadfully, by which I suppose the wheel must have been nearly on him at the time I heard the calling out - I went to his assistance; the cart was stopped, and Bennett held the horse's head; I cannot say whether the prisoner had stopped the horse - I and a pot-boy assisted in getting the man off the ground, and in a minute or so a person, who I believe on my oath was the prisoner, came to him and said, "I hope you are not hurt, my friend, (or) you are not hurt" - Love was taken home; I went for a light to take the number of the cart, and did not see who went home with him - I should think the cart was not going at a much less rate than nine miles an hour, which is very fast.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was rather a dark night? A. Yes, it was half-past eight or a quarter to nine o'clock - I did not see the cart, but heard it; there were several empty casks in it - the prisoner asked the man in rather a kind manner, if he was hurt; I was behind the cart a considerable distance at the time the witness says he was knocked down.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Queen-street, King's-road. I was going up Manor-street, and heard a horse and cart coming down the King's-road from Sloane-square. I should judge after the rate of eight or nine miles an hour, and all in an instant there was a cry that a man was run over, but I did not see him at all - I went up to the cart - the prisoner then stood alongside the horse; he appeared to me to be drunk - I told him so, and he said, "I always am;" I told him he had better keep a civil tongue in his head - a Policeman came up - I asked him to take the number of the cart, which he at first seemed unwilling to do; I said if he did not I would take his number and letter - he then took it; he was not present at the accident - I told the prisoner it was a serious accident, it was more than probable the man would die, if he was not dead; he said, "What is that to you?" or something of that sort - I never saw the deceased.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose he was taken away while you were talking to the prisoner? A. He was removed a short distance; I have not offered a bet about this trial - I have not offered to bet a bottle of wine, or a sovereign - not to my knowledge; I should not like to swear I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not offer to Mr. Morrison to bet a bottle of wine that a true bill would be found, and a sovereign that the prisoner would be found guilty? A. I am sure I do not know it to my recollection - I will not swear that I did not; if Mr. Morrison proffered such a bet to me, I might give him an answer, but I was not the offerer of it - I know Morrison, an oilman; I do not think he was summoned in the Coroner's Jury - if I proposed such a bet to him, he first proposed it to me, but I really cannot say any thing about it; I do not recollect any thing of the kind - I believe I saw Morrison at Clerkenwell, and he first proposed it to me I believe; I remember it now - he offered to bet me a bottle, or I never should have offered it; I do not remember that he proposed it - he said something respecting filing the bill; I think be proposed the bet, but should not like to swear it, or that I did not.</p>

            . I am not in business - I live in New Manor-street, immediately opposite the spot where the accident occurred. Between eight and nine o'clock I heard the noise of the cart, which was very loud, as if the horse was going very fast - there were a quantity of empty barrels in it, which made a great noise; I was in-doors - I ran out immediately without my hat, as I thought a horse had broken loose; when I got out the man had been run over, and the cart stopped - I saw two or three persons raising the deceased from the ground; I sent for a doctor- the deceased was on the right side of the road, and the right hand of the cart, which was rather on the left of the road, not quite out of its proper side; it is a wide road - it had passed the man a few yards; my impression was, that the cart was going eight or nine miles an hour, but it was stopped before I got out - I went to the deceased's house within a quarter of an hour of the accident, and saw him in bed, in Wellington-street; he expressed himself in great pain - the surgeon was bleeding him, and fomenting his stomach; I saw the prisoner there, and told him his servant had conducted himself in a detrimental way to him as a man of business - when I left the house I pointed the servant out to him; the prisoner then put himself into a pugilistic attitude, and challenged me to fight - he was decidedly in liquor; he told me he was a <rs id="t18300916-252-deflabel1293" type="occupation">coal-heaver's mate</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not in the room while the man was being bled? A. Yes; he did nothing expressive of any kindness while I was there, on the contrary - I was there about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you begin to abuse the prisoner yourself in such a manner that the widow was obliged to remonstrate with you? A. I did not, on my oath; the surgeon said it was not a proper place for such a conversation, and I withdrew.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was that when the prisoner challenged you to fight? A. No; I was telling him of his servant's conduct.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I attended the deceased between eight and nine o'clock that evening; his left hip was considerably bruised, which was the only external mark on his body - I did not examine any other part, as he complained of that part only; the injury extended five or six inches - he was suffering a great deal of depression, which is the usual effect of internal injury; I bled him, and applied fermentations - he lived till the Wednesday; the Coroner would not allow me to open the body - I asked permission to do so by the beadle of the parish; it was never opened - there was external injury, but it was impossible to say what caused the death without opening the body; I should say the injury was caused by the cart going over him.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that occasion death? A. I should say Yes, but it is impossible to say the extent of the injury without opening the body - as the man was in tolerable health before, and died so soon after, I should say the injury was the cause of his death - it must have been internal injury<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160113"></xptr>caused by the external, no doubt; in my judgment his death was caused by the wheel going over him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you, as a medical man, venture to swear what was the cause of death without opening the body? A. I have said I could not - I can only speculate on the extent of the internal injury; I have known the spleen ruptured from the blow without any external marks- Mr. Stirling was the Coroner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state this to the Coroner? A. He asked if it was absolutely necessary to open the body - I said it was necessary, to examine the exact nature of the accident, but not absolutely necessary to enable me to say he died in consequence of the accident; I have seen one person who burst a blood vessel, without any previous appearance of disease, and which occasioned death, but that was not the case in this instance; I have read and heard of such instances - I once saw a case in which the spleen was ruptured, without any visible external appearance; there are some internal injuries which produce no external marks.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When had you attended this man before? A. Upwards of twelve months since; he had taken no medicine since as I am told - he was suffering from asthma- that would not cause sudden dissolution.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his Defence, stated, that seeing the deceased near the wheel he had called out to him, and pulled up immediately, but not in time to prevent the accident, and that he had paid him every attention in his power, and carried him home - that Vernon had abused him very much at the deceased's house, and had taken great pains to injure him.</p>

            . I am the deceased's widow. The prisoner assisted him home, and remained in the room nearly an hour and a half - he treated him with kindness and concern, till he was disturbed; my husband in his dying moments said he believed it was an accident - he was afflicted with deafness; he was perfectly sensible he should not get over it - he told me he was like a child when the noise was, and the horse was against his shoulder; instead of running out of the way he most likely ran into it - this was the day before he died; he might have been called to in the road, and not hear.</p>

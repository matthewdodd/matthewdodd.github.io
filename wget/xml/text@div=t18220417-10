On the night of the 5th of April, I was the last person up, and saw the house completely fastened. I went to bed about twelve o'clock. Under the window which fronts the street, there is a door, which opens for the drovers to put their ropes in; it was fastened by a lock. I was called up at three o'clock by the watchman, and found this door forced, and the lock off; there is a door inside, opening into this place, and that was also forced open, I am sure it was safe overnight - the inner door had not been opened for five years; it leads into the bar, and on examining the bar, I found an empty drawer standing on the counter, which had been robbed of between 5 s. and 10 s. worth of copper; it was in its proper place over night. I then found another till taken away, with about 45 s. in copper in it; the lock of a door in the bar was picked, which was locked when I went to bed, and the bar parlour had been entered, and from a cupboard there, was taken two table and six teaspoons, a pair of sugar tongs, a cream pot, a pair of salt-spoons, and a punch ladle, all silver; and 6 plated spoons, two table cloths; and a bundle was taken from a dresser, which did not belong to me. The value of the whole is about 7 l. with the money. The watchman took me to a court within two doors of my house, and in that court was a privy; the floor of which was taken up, and the whole of the articles and money stated in the indictment where found down there, but only part of the copper. Newman brought me a small crow-bar and chisel two hours after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The privy does not belong to your house - A. No. The court leads to two private houses, and the privy belongs to them; I do not know whether it is always left open. The tills were in their proper places at night - the outer door of this place door was locked; one drover, named Nicholls, has a key; it was not a night on which he would have occasion to come there. I tried the door on this night, and found it safe - if that had been open, they would have to force the inner door.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Sepulchre. On the night in question I was near Cock-court; was walking by my box, which is opposite Cock-lane, and the Fortune of War, - the court is two doors below, down Cock-lane. At half-past two o'clock, Bartho-lemew came over to me; he appeared to come out of the side door of the Fortune of War, in Cock-lane; he said,</p>

               <p>"Watchman it is a cold morning," I said,</p>
               <p>"We cannot complain for the time of year;" he said,</p>
               <p>"I am locked out, I live down at the bottom of the lane," I said,</p>
               <p>"Can't you make them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170009"></xptr>hear," he said, he did not like to disturb them - we talked for near half an hour; he kept his eye on the Fortune of War - I went down Cock-lane, at three o'clock to cry the hour; he remained by my box. I came out of the lane into Giltspur-street, and down a court to cry the hour; I took off my hat, having suspicion of him, and looked out of the court, and saw him cross over to the Fortune of War. I went into Cock-lane, and could see nothing of him; presently I heard a gingle, which seemed to proceed from the court, where the two houses are; then Close came out of the court - I crossed over and asked what he was doing there; he said he lived there; I said I thought he did not, he persisted that he did, and wanted me to go in and see that he did; I took him by the collar, and said I would take him to the watch-house, and have him examined, but as he persisted that he lived there, I let him go, and he went up the court, which is no thoroughfare; I remained at the end. Cook (a watchman) came up; I placed him there to prevent any one coming out while I went to the watch-house for a reinforcement - I brought Godfrey, and found Cook at his post; we went up the court, looked about, and could see nobody; presently Cook put his stick through a hole in the privy door, and said there were persons there; we demanded entrance, but could not obtain it, then we heard a noise inside like breaking of wood; we broke in at the door, and found the prisoners there; we secured and took them to the watch-house; then returned to the privy to see if we could find any thing; I looked about the yard, found nothing, and put my lantern down the privy, and discovered linen, plate, and broken wood, down in the soil. We went to the Fortune of War, and found the side door open - I had examined that door before one o'clock, and found it safe. We alarmed Mr. Gardner; he got up, and looked over his house; we took him to the privy, I got a chisel and hammer, pulled up the floor, and found the property stated in the indictment there, and gave them to Godfrey.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. At what time did you first see Bartholemew - A. At half-past two o'clock - he appeared quite sober; he did not ask leave to sit in my box, or where he could get a night's lodging; he was alone then. He asked if we allowed people to sit in the watch-house, I said</p>
               <p>"No, provided we found you drunk or at housebreaking, we would give you a night's lodging." I knew there was a privy in this court; any one might get to it, it has only one seat, I believe.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you observed any body go up the court from the time you first saw Bartholemew, till you heard the gingle - A. No, my Lord.</p>

            . I am the inspector of the watch. Hogan fetched me to the court in Cock-lane. I found Cook standing as a sentry; we all three went up, and all was silent; we looked about and found nobody in the court or in the inner yard where the privy is; it is in an inner yard, which is enclosed by a door - it might have been left open. We found the privy door shut - Cook put his stick through; we forced it open, and found the prisoners there; Bartholemew came out first, and desired we would not use him ill; I laid hold of him; the other came out, and said the same and surrendered; we had not charged them with any thing. Before the door was open, we heard a great noise like the breaking of timber. We found the property; and some implements of housebreaking in a green bag in the privy. Previous to searching the privy, we took the prisoners to the watch-house. Both gave their names - Bartholemew gave his residence No. 30, Onslow-street, Saffron-hill, as a baker; I asked what he did in the privy; he said he went for a necessary purpose. Close said he had no residence in London; that he was a shoemaker, and had come from Devonshire that day. They were taken to the Compter. We then went and found Gardner's house broken open. We searched the privy immediately after taking the prisoners to the watch-house, and found the articles stated in the indictment; also a broken till, a green bag, containing 3 s. in silver, and seventeen picklock keys, 16 s. 4 3/4 d. in copper, and a chisel were picked up, a small box, and a bottle - and in the yard we found 8 d. in copper loose on the pavement. The property was given to Pike. On entering Gardner's house, by the door, we found a small dark lantern, and a large door key; a gimblet was stuck in the outer door under the window, with a string tied to it, which would enable them to keep the door close after they had got in; we found the lock of this door wrenched off, and the inner door open; there are two holes to the privy.</p>

               <p>BARTHOLEMEW'S Defence. I am totally innocent. I had been over the water with some friends, stopped late, and on coming home, about two o'clock, I was intoxicated - I found the street door locked, did not wish to disturb the other lodgers, and meant to walk about till morning. As I crossed Smithfield, this watchman stood with a man in his box, I asked if I might sit in the watch-house; he said the officers would not allow it - we talked a few minutes; I then went up the court into the privy, and to the best of my recollection fell asleep there. I never saw this person before, and to the best of my knowledge was never in Gardner's house in my life.</p>

Bartholemew came to our house on Good Friday, he had a bad foot; I asked him to sit down till my husband came in, which he did till about eight o'clock - I asked if he was not hungry, and gave him some pork and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170010"></xptr>a pint of porter. He stopped till half-past one o'clock - I believe he was rather intoxicated; he and my husband had three pots and a pint of beer between them; I had some of it - we were drinking from about nine to half-past one o'clock; he fell asleep part of the time in the arm chair, and I awoke him. I thought him intoxicated - he smoked three pipes; I asked him to stop, but he said he would go home to his wife and child. I have known him five or six years; he was an honest steady man. He lived some where about here, but where I do not know.</p>
               <p>One witness gave Bartholemew a good character.</p>

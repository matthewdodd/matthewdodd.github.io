               <p>I am an officer at Whitechapel. On Monday, the 20th of October last, I was walking up Winfield-street, in the parish of Spitalfields; I saw the prisoner at the bar, about two or three yards from me, coming down as I was going up, I met him, it was about two o'clock in the day, when I met the prisoner he was walking pretty sharp, about two or three yards before he came to me he made a sudden stop, and leaned on a post at the corner of a street, I did not seem to take any notice of him till he got exactly opposite of me, he had got a smock frock on, and under his left arm I thought I saw some little bulk, I then laid hold of him and asked him what he had here? then I put my hand under the smock frock and pulled out the two shifts, he said he had them from a sister at Bow; I told him his sister would not give him them, and that he must go along with me; I took him to the Cross Keys public house to search him, because I could not search him in the street, because the mob began to get around, in searching of him I took off his hat, and in the crown of his hat I found the shirts, I then took him to the office and we enquired all round Stepney and Bow, and enquired if any body had lost any thing, and we found it by advertising once; I have kept them till now.(The linen produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix, They are my property.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have no doubt but it is my shirt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I help to make ropes in the rope ground, I went to one ground, and when I had done I was going to another ground, and as I was coming along I see this property laying by the side of a ditch, and so I picked up the property, and this man met me and took hold of me.</p>

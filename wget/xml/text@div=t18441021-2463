I am the wife of Edmund Henry Kent—he is land<lb></lb>lord of the Prince of Wales, at Kensington—Louisa Harding lived in my service since last May—I lost these spoons—I had them in my possession on the 1st of Aug.—they were then in the kitchen, where they are not usually kept—they were brought there to be used but they were not used—I supposed that I put them away with the remainder of the spoons in a drawer in a closet on the second floor—when I missed them I spoke to Louisa Harding about them, but Mary Harding was not present—I have seen Mary Harding at my house in the passage and the lobby when she has come to see her daughter, but I have not seen her up stairs—these are the spoons—this plate and saucer, and other things, are toys of the children—they are all my husband's.</p>

I went to Town Mailing, in Kent, and apprehended Mary Harding in a hop field—I told her the charge—she denied all knowledge of it—I then took Louisa Harding, and she said on the way to the court, "O mother, if it had not been for you this would not have happened "—Mary Harding said, "Never mind, child, don't cry, you can't help it"—at the station Mary Harding said she pawned them, and that the girl found the spoons opposite the Prince of Wales, three months ago—I searched Mary Harding's lodging, and found a number of duplicates, and amongst them this which refers to the spoons—she directed me to her lodging, and I found her husband there.</p>

I then went to Town Mailing, and when I was asked about them, I said I knew they were in the house, but I knew no more of them. I have been thirty years in the neighbourhood, and worked for the first of families.</p>

               <p>I lost a watch on the evening of the 3d of this month; I was coming from Smithfield, and as I came down Cow-cross, I met the prisoner at the bar and she told me she wanted to speak to me; I knew nothing of her person before, it was between twelve and one in the morning; I then walked on and took no notice of her; she came up again and laid hold of my arm, and insisted on speaking to me; she drew me into a court, called <placeName id="t17921215-56-crimeloc322">Colledge-court, Cow-cross</placeName>

               <p>- CAMPBELL sworn</p>
               <p>I am a watchman, I was going my beat at half past twelve; I heard this young man call watch, accordingly I went to his assistance, and found he and this woman together, in the scuffle they tumbled down together; and he gave me charge that this woman had robbed him of his watch; accordingly I took the charge and took them to the watch-house; the watch was found close by the place where they tumbled down; a girl went out with a lanthorn and picked it up; I did not see it till I saw it in the officer's hands the next morning. The girl is not present, she is in the country.</p>
               <p>Court to Neal. Was you present when your watch was found? - Yes, I am sure it did not tumble out of my pocket; I was quite sober.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; I heard this man call out watch, and I went to his assistance; and he told me the prisoner at the bar had picked his pocket of his watch; we took her to the watch-house, and she was searched, and the watch was not found</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the watch was found? - No more than I heard that a young woman, Mrs. Spencer's maid, found it and brought it to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ostler to Mr. Henry Clark, job-master, Bean<lb></lb>mont-mews, High-street, Marylebone. About eight o'clock on Saturday evening, the 8th of December, hearing the dog bark I went to the coach-house, and found the prisoner there in a carriage—I had a light with me—I caught hold of him, shook him, and asked how he came there—he said he did not know, he had been drinking—he asked what it was o'clock—I said about eight o'clock—he immediately jumped out of the carriage, and went away—I looked in, and saw the cushions were cut open, and the horse-hair taken out—on examining further I found four cushions in another carriage cut open and the hair taken out, two gig cushions cut open and the hair taken out, and six cushions gone away altogether—my son took up a wrong person on suspicion—I am sure the prisoner is the person I saw in the carriage—I have not the least doubt—I don't think he had been drink<lb></lb>ing—I let him run away, as I did not know any mischief was done till I looked into the carriage, and found the cushions cut open—I had seen then at twelve o'clock that day quite safe.</p>

             sworn. - I am an apprentice to the last witness and his partner: On Tuesday, the 7th of February, about half past one o'clock I believe, I was sent to one of our men of the name of Smith, he lives in Holborn, for a gold inside<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150016"></xptr>watch-case, called a box; I received the case from him, and put it in the inside pocket of my great coat; I then went to two or three places in Clerkenwell to others of our workmen, and from thence to Pentonville to my grandmother to dinner; it was then about half past two o'clock. When I got there, I pulled off my great coat; I am not certain whether I hung it on the hook in the passage, or threw it over the bannisters of the stairs; I felt for the watch-case before I went through the garden-gate, it was there then; I staid at my grandmother's about four or five hours; it was near eight o'clock when I went away. I went from thence to Bell-dock; I put my great coat on before I went out; I cannot recollect whether I took it from the hook in the passage, or from the bannisters, I took it down myself. I did not miss the watch-case till the next morning; then I went and pulled down my great coat, and looked for it, I found it was gone; I had not an opportunity of going to Pentonville that day, but the day after I went. I went down stairs to the servant, the prisoner lived with my grandmother, and told her I had lost a gold box, and asked her if she had seen it; I explained it to her what it was; I told her she might have found it amongst the dust, and if she had, or did, I would give her three guineas; she said she had not seen it. I got one made four days after that; I went down stairs, and shewed it her, and told her that was the pattern of the one I lost; she said she had not seen it; I never saw it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had felt it in your pocket on going into your grandmother's garden-gate? - A. Yes, I put my hand in, and felt it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went home from your grandmother's, did you never put your hand in to feel it was safe? - A. No, I had my two brothers arm in arm with me; I never told my master; then I got another made to supply its place.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the gold box? - A. The original value of the gold box lost was five pounds seventeen shillings; the one I got made cost five pounds five shillings and ninepence.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the weight of the one lost? - A. This one I had made was the weight of the other lost - one ounce three penny-weights; I had no conversation with the prisoner after that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you came down stairs to me, it was on Wednesday? - A. It was on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Court.) He asked me whether I had such a thing as a gold box; I asked him if he had lost one; he could not tell whether he had lost one, or no.</p>

             sworn. - I live at Battle-bridge, and keep a horse and cart; I knew the prisoner about a month before Christmas, my wife has known her longer: One evening the prisoner came to our room about seven or eight o'clock; I was in bed, we have but one room, my wife was there; she asked us how we did, and said, she was going for some treacle; she said, see what a find I have had, mistress, the other night; she said she had been to town that night the snow fell with her young mistress, or her mistress, I cannot say which; she told us she found the case by the Blue Lion, coming down Gray's-inn-lane; she saw something lay by the snow, she kicked it with her foot, and heard something rattle; she stooped, and picked it up; it happened to be this case or box. She said, she shewed it to Mr. Todd, the cheesemonger, in Battle-bridge, Mr. Todd looked at it, and said, he thought it was not gold. After that, she said she shewed it to a man that keeps a potato-warehouse, he cut it with a knife, and said, he thought it was gold; she asked me if I would sell it for her, as she had no opportunity of getting out; if I would, she would satisfy me for my trouble. I asked her if it had been advertised; she said, no, it had not; I asked her if her young mistress was present when she picked it up; she said she was.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know when it was? - A. No; to the best of my knowledge it is about five weeks ago or thereabouts; it was in two pieces, it was not rivetted; I took it to the Maidenhead public-house, Battle-bridge, two days after, and asked the landlord if he had seen an advertisement of a gold watch case; he said, no, have you found one; I said, no; there was a gentleman in the house reading the newspaper, and I shewed it to him. After that, I took it home again, and kept it there for three or four days; I sold it at last to a Jew in Chancery-lane for one guinea and a half. I brought the money home to my wife; I never saw the prisoner after that till I saw her at Hatton-garden.</p>

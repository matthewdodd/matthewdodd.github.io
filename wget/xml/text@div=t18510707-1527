                  </hi>. I am a farmer, at Wanstead. On 15th June I missed three ducks off my premises—I believe I had seen them safe the day before—I did not see them again till last Thursday, when the policeman showed them to me—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are them—I swear to them by certain marks—this mark on the leg of this one was here before I lost them—every Muscovy duck is not marked in the same way—I have the fellow one to this, with the same mark on it.</p>

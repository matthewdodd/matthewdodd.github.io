               <p>J. R.. On the 28th of last May. I had been at the New-Wells, and was coming from thence to the Black-Bull in Whitechapel; when I met with the Prisoner Eliz. Eccles.

She shewed me up a Pair of Stairs, and when I came into the Chamber, I saw the Prisoner Eades, and the 2 other Women lying on the Floor, covered over with a Blanket or Rug. After I had sat down a little, I desired Eliz. Eccles to fetch me a Quart of Beer, and when I had drank part of it, they drank the rest, and I fell asleep, and they robbed me of the Goods mentioned in the Indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had all those Things about you, when you fell asleep?</p>
               <p>J. R.. Yes, I am sure I had them when I went into the Room.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time did you awake?</p>
               <p>J. R.. I can't say, because I had lost my Watch, but it was past 11 o'Clock before the Wells broke up, and after that I went into the Tap-House, and sat till it was pretty late.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not been drinking, or were you sober?</p>
               <p>J.R.. I could not be very sober to be sure, but I had my Senses enough to know that I had my Things when I went to sleep, because I looked out of the Window, and saw People milking their Cattle, and I thought to get some Milk, but I fell asleep, and when I 'wak'd, I missed my Goods, and the Prisoners were all gone off. These two Boys were in the Room at the same Time, though I did not see them because they were covered over and hid. The Prisoners were taken and carried before Justice Manley, and when I came there, I found all these Things which are in the Custody of the Constable. These are the Shoe-Buckles; here is one Knee-Buckle, and the Tobacco Stopper, and this is the Bag which contained the Money, but here is not half the Money I lost.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Eccles. Ask him if he knows this Shilling?</p>
               <p>J. R.. Yes, this very Shilling was taken from me with the other Things: It is a leaden one, and I put it into my Fob-Pocket because I would not put it off. This Silver Portugal Piece was likewise taken from me.</p>

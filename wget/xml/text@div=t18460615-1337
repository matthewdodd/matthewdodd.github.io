On the morning of the 16th of June I found the prosecutor in Blue Anchor-yard—in consequence of what he said to me I went and found the prisoner at the bottom of the yard—I knew him, and asked what he had in his left hand—he said two or three half-pence—I asked him to open it—he said he would see me d—d first—I forced his hand open, and found this bag containing two shillings, 2 penny pieces, and two half-pence—Conner came up, and claimed it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been from Ireland about six weeks, and live in Blue Anchor-yard—the prisoner's sister kept the house. On the night of the 15th of June I walked outside the door, and sat down there talking with the neighbours—the prisoner was at the door, very drunk—his sister told me to go in to bed—I did not go in; and as she told me some time after, I was going, and he being a bed-fellow of mine called me over, and asked if I had some money—I said I had none, but a trifle I should want next morning—I said I had none, and invited him to see that I had none—he felt me down, and I think took it from me—I went to look for my bag, and did not find it, till the officer was behind, and asked me what it was about—he went after him; but I was sure of getting it next morning from him—I was reconciled to his having it—I do not think he intended to steal it, but he was drunk.</p>

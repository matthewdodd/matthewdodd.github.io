            , ESQ. I have a house at Edmonton, Middlesex. This is a correct plan of my premises, (producing it) the laundry is about eighty feet from the dwelling-house, a wall incloses it with the house, on the East side of the house, and extends round it, the laundry is within the wall, which is joined by an iron fence, and the whole incloses the premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. On which side is the laundry - A. On the West, beyond that is the wash-house, dairy, and a coal place - the wall is a continuation, it is completely inclosed with the dwelling-house; my garden is inclosed by a wall, and the drying ground by a paling.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are we to understand that the garden, and dairy, are under the same protection, as the other part of the dwelling-house - A. Yes, nobody could get at them without breaking over the fence or wall.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Ray. I and two other servants had been washing on the 30th of October, I was the last person in the laundry - I was there at nine o'clock at night, locked the door, and took away the key; the articles stated in the indictment were there, part of them were Mr. Ray's, and part belonged to the other servants.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. In what state was the wash-house window - A. I cannot say, I know the laundry window was shut. The wash-house communicates with the laundry.</p>
               <p>COURT. A. Do they communicate internally - A. Yes, you go from one to the other without going out. I locked one wash-house door, which is an outer door, but not the door between the laundry and wash-house - the window has iron rails before it, and nobody could get through it into the wash-house or laundry, without breaking them. It appeared in the morning, that they had entered through the wash-house door, which I had left secure.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Ray. On Wednesday morning the 31st of October, at five o'clock, I came to the premises, and found the Lodge gate open, it is in the high road - I came up to the passage door leading to the coal room, which was burst open, and the bolt of the lock out from the lock, the catch was wrenched off - I found the wash-house door broken open, and there was a mark of a tool, on the door close to the lock, and I found the coulter of a plough there, which I applied to the marks, and it fitted, it was Mr. Ray's coulter, and was in the plough which lay under the haystack the night before. The laundry and wash-house windows have iron bars - I did not find them broken, the persons must have come in through the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far are the bars apart - A. About four inches. The haystack is at the further side of the field, you go through the lodge gate into that field. It was very dark when I came in the morning.</p>

            . I am a constable. I accompanied Harland and Bramhall with a search warrant to the prisoner's house on Saturday, the 3d of November, at noon; he lives at Bow's Farm, about two miles from Mr. Ray's. I found him and a woman there, I was reading my warrant, and Ray's servant said, in his hearing, "There is some part of the property," which hung by the fire. In a drawer I found some lace, a cap, and handkerchief. I went into the bedroom, and found a sheet hanging up to dry, and under some sacks there was a wet bundle containing towels and handkerchiefs, cut to pieces. I found other property in a chest in the same room, and up stairs, I found a pair of sheets hanging on the line wet and dirty, as if they had been in the dirt. I took the prisoner in custody, he said I need not touch them for they were his property, he said so when I found the handkerchief or frill in the bed-room. I said "We will touch nothing but what we want" - then he said "A manbrought them here for my wife to wash, and gave her 5 s. to do them." I took the things to the Magistrate, and they were dried there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you said you was come to search the house - A. Yes; he said he had nothing there, and I was welcome; I began to read the warrant, and the servant said some of the things hung there - He spoke of a handkerchief or frill as being his, I did not take that.</p>

            . I am a publican, and keep the Black Bull, public-house, at Edmonton. I remember the Tuesday night that Mr. Ray was robbed; I do not know what month it was in, it was on the Tuesday before the prisoner was apprehended. I saw him at my house on that night, he appeared to be intoxicated, and left my house about half-past nine o'clock - there is a dirty ditch by my door, and I took out my lantern to light him. He lives nearly two miles from me.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. How long was he in your house - A. I cannot say, it might be two hours; I did not see him come in, he had a pint of beer and gave some of it to the people.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after he left did you go out with the light - A. About twenty minutes; three men who carry fish about were in his company, they left him at my house. Mr. Whitbread's men were being paid at my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you recollect when you heard of this robbery - A. On the Wednesday, I think. I heard they had got in at the laundry, but what was taken I did not know.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and lodge at Bow Farm. The prisoner was taken on Saturday - on the Tuesday evening before that, I was at his house when he came home very much in liquor; I helped to put him to bed, as he could not put himself to bed, he sat in a chair, and drunkenness came on more, and Mrs. Deakin had a good deal of trouble to get him to bed - we got him to bed about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then leave the house - A. No; Mrs. Deakin having a good deal of ironing to do, I sat in the house all night; he got up about six o'clock in the morning - I then asked him about carrying me some potatoes.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Where did you live - A. About one hundred yards off, at the Old Cock, public-house. I thought I was locked out, and stopped there - I did not like to trouble them by knocking them up; I went to Deakin's about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go there for - A. I used to dress his wounds when he was scalded, he had no wounds then; I went to sit there an hour or two, as I often do.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you sit - A. By the fire; Mrs. Deakin was ironing till about three o'clock, she was ironing Mr. Miller's things, who they wash for. His bed is in the back parlour - I live a mile and a quarter from the Black Bull, public-house.</p>
               <p>MR. RAY re-examined. My family went to bed about eleven o'clock; I do not know what time I went to bed. The outhouses are about eighty feet from the house.</p>

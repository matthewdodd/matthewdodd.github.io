I knew that he kept his purse in his pantaloons; the purse was gone; then I challenged the nurse, the house-maid, and the prisoner they all denied it; I sent for an officer; when the prisoner saw the officer at the door, he pulled the purse out of his pocket, the prisoner said here it is, and I shall take care of it; he said the captain owed him two pound for his sister's washing, he would take it to pay his sister.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. I believe there where other people to whom the captain owed money. - A. Yes, he owes me a good deal of money myself; he had been at my house upwards of six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Kelly of Jermyn-street. - A. I have heard of captain Fitzmorris going there sometimes; Mr. Kelly sent by the prisoner a one pound note to captain Fitzmorris.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the room when the captain died. - A. No, he was out about a quarter of an hour, and he returned in about three minutes after the captain's death.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course he might have disposed of it. - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no conversation about what the purse contained before the officer came in. - A. Yes, when the officer was in the passage, he told me what the purse contained.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know in point of fact whether his sister washed for the captain. - A. She did wash for the captain; she denied being his sister; she claimed one pound seventeen shillings, or two pounds.</p>
               <p>MRS. MUNRO. Q. You nursed the deceased. - A. Yes, I came on the Saturday evening as he died on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that he had a purse in his pantaloons on the Sunday morning. - A. Yes.</p>

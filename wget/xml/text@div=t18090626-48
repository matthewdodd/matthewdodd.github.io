On the 5th of May I came up to London; I went to Smithfield, I found her in possession of a lad, he was on another horse, the mare was by the side of it; the lad brought a man to me as the master of the horse; he offered the horse to sell.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of April last, did he give you any animal to sell - A. Yes, two horses; I cannot tell the date of the month; it was on a Tuesday, almost three months ago; they were delivered to me at Bethnal-green; I was not in the house, the prisoner took the poney out of the public house at Bethnal-green; the gentleman's name that keeps it is Green. It was in the forenoon I took them to Mr. Dixon's in Barbican; and I received one of his son; that third horse I was stopped with.</p>
               <p>Q. You received two horses of the prisoner, and one of his son - A. Yes, this last horse, there is no owner for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the two that you received of the prisoner, that you took to Mr. Dixon's - A. I was to do nothing, but to put down my name. A boy rode them up there.</p>

               <p>Q. But the horse that belonged to Mr. Pierce was not that horse - A. No, it was one of the other two; they were both brought out of Mr. Green's house in Bethnal-green. I took one to Mr. Dixon's, the other horse a man rode it there; they both went in Mr. Dixon's about the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were both left, one by you and one by the man the same day, are you certain of it - A. Yes; I only booked one, I know nothing about the other; I received the money for the one I had booked in my own name on the next sale day. I received two pounds one shilling; I gave the money to Mr. Thurston in Barbican; he and his son came up to me there; and Thurston went to Barbican at the time I took the horse there, and his son was with him. I received the money for another horse, not the horse that the man rode the same day, it was another about ten days afterwards; I received for that eleven pounds two shillings.</p>

            . On the 5th of May I went with Mr. Pierce to Dixon's repository, and there I saw the horse that was detained by Mr. Pierce. On the following Saturday morning I went to No. 15, Montague-street, White Chapel, by the direction in Mr. Dixon's book; I could find no person there of the name of Harding. On Tuesday following, I attended at Mr. Dixon's repository; the woman came in, I apprehended her the moment I saw her I told her I knew the rest of the parties. This saddle and bridle were left at Bethnal-green by the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am entirely innocent of the charge alledged against me; I never trusted a horse in her hands; I never received a halfpenny of her in my life. I leave myself in the hands of the jury.</p>

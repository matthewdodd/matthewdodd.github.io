            . I was behind the Chariot, and on Monday in the Afternoon, between Hyde-park Corner and Pimlico Turn-pike ; on a sudden I heard somebody call out to the Coachman to stop, and looking behind me, I saw a Man mask'd, with a Pistol in his Hand; he rode up to the Chariot Door and said, Ladies, your Money in a Minute, or I'll shoot you dead, for it's a Case of Necessity, and no Time is to be lost - Your Watches, Rings, and Snuff-boxes. Mrs. Banks told him she had no Watch, and soon after I saw him take a Gold Watch out of the Coach, and then turning his Horse, he said, your Servant Ladies; and shaking his Head and Pistol at me, as he went off, he swore if I turn'd back he'd shoot me dead.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know who he was?</p>
               <p>Orson. The very Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Orson. I am certain he's the Man, for when he was gone about 100 Yards, I got down and pursu'd him a-Foot. I ran faster than he rode, and when I came within 20 Yards of him, his Hat and Mask fell off. He turn'd back his Horse, and I had a full View of his Face. He turn'd again towards Piccadilly; I follow'd him thro' May-Fair, by the Course of the People, but before I came to Charing-Cross, I lost him, and the People were at a Stand, and did not know which way he was gone. I enquired of several, if they had seen a Man without a Hat, on a Bay Horse, and in the Hay-Market, I heard, he had left his Horse, and taken Coach, and one

            , who belong'd to the Reading Coach, knew the Man. Clark and I went to the Bolt and Tun-Inn, in Fleet-Street, where the Reading Coach put up, and there we found Bunch. Says Clark to Bunch, The Man you saw riding without a Hat, has robb'd a Coach, and you said, you knew where he liv'd ? Yes, very well, says Bunch, I have known him several Years - And do you think you can take him? - Yes. So we went together to Temple-Bar, and then, they said, they'd proceed no farther, except I was absent, for they were afraid he would know me, and they told me, they'd give me notice when to come again. So I went home; they sent me word, the same Night, that they had seen him, and desired me to come down to Temple -Bar. I acquainted my Master with it, and he, and a Friend of his went with me to an Alehouse in the Butcher-Row. We sent to Clark and Bunch, and Clark came, and said, they had decoy'd him into a Brandy-Shop. I went back with Clark, and we brought the Prisoner to my Master. The Prisoner fell on his Knees, and begg'd my Master to have Mercy on him, and said, he was the Man who robb'd the Coach. My Master ask'd him, where the Things were? He said, At home, and he'd fetch 'em. My Master sent us with him: Clark and Bunch went in with him, and I waited at the Door. In a little Time they came down, and we all went to my Master. The Prisoner pull'd out the Gold Watch, the Snuff Box, and 5 s. 6 d. in Money, and laid them on the Table. He fell on his Knees again, and begg'd Pardon, and Bunch and Clark desir'd Pardon for him too. My Master said, he could not do that, for if he did, he should be liable to be prosecuted himself. Then we went in a Coach, to a Tavern by Golden-Square, where my Master left us, and return'd with Justice Lambert, who order'd the Prisoner to be Hand-cuffed. The Prisoner fell in a great Agony, like one distracted, and stampt, and swore, that if he had a Pistol he'd shoot himself, and that he was sorry he had not brought one.</p>

I bid Orson go home, and told him, I'd send him Word as soon as we wanted him: He went away. Bunch and I waited about the Prisoner's Door for his coming home. It was near two Hours before he came, and then he went in, stay'd about a Quarter of an Hour, and came out again, and went towards the Temple. We follow'd at a little Distance, and he return'd in 5 or 6 Minutes. Then I went into the Shop, and cheapen'd some Herrings; and after some Talk about 'em, I ask'd him how he came to lose his Hat? For God's Sake, says he, hold your Tongue, or I am a dead Man I told him, he must go with me, and so we and Bunch went to a Brandy-Shop, where we had nine penn'orth of Punch. I ask'd the Prisoner, what was become of the Gold watch, Snuff-box, and 2 Purses, that he took from the two Ladies? He said, he took but one Purse, which was a Red one, with 5 s. 6 d. or 6 s. he could not tell which, and he had that and the Watch and Snuff-Box at home, and would go and fetch them. While we were there, the Porter, whom I had sent to Orson, came back, and told us, the Gentleman was come to an Alehouse in the Butcher-Row; we all went thither. The Prisoner fell on his Knees, and ask'd the Gentleman's Pardon. Bunch, and I, and Orson went thence, with the Prisoner, to his House. He went up two pair of Stairs, brought down the Watch, Box, and Purse, carry'd them to the Alehouse, and laid them, and 5 s. 6 d. on the Table - I know him to be the Man I had seen riding without his Hat.</p>

            . Coming towards the Town, in the Reading Coach (which sometimes I drive) I saw the Prisoner come riding by, betwixt Kensington and Knightsbridge, I pop'd my Head out of the Coach, and said, How do you do, Master? For I knew him when he was 'Prentice. How do you do? How do you do? says he, and rid along. At Porter-Street End, in Piccadilly, I saw him come shooting out without a Hat, and twenty People after him, crying, Highwayman! I stopt at the White-Bear, in Piccadilly, and then went to the Bolt and Tun, in Fleet-Street, where, as soon as I had taken my Horses off, Orson and Clark came to me, and ask'd me to shew them the House. I went with them, we took the Prisoner, and carry'd him to the Gentleman. He confess'd the Fact, return'd the Watch, Snuff-box, Purse, and 5 s. 6 d. and fell on his Knees and begg'd Pardon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This was my first Fact, and the greatest Necessity drove me to it. I owed to much Money, that I was almost distracted. I had not the right Use of my Senses, and was about to shoot myself; but, at last, I thought it was better to take this unfortunate Way, which I find, too late, instead of relieving me from my former Misfortunes, has plunged me into greater. I have a great many Neighbours here to give an Account of my Character before I committed this one desperate Action.</p>
               <p>Court. The Court would by no Means prevent you from offering any Thing that might be of Advantage to you; but as the Fact has been so plainly proved, and you, yourself, have confess'd it, your former Character cannot avail you in this Place, where the Law must take its Course, tho ' it may have its Influence elsewhere. The King is the Fountain of Mercy, and he will extend it to proper Objects, and therefore I know not any Way so likely for your Friends to do you Service, as to represent your Case in a Petition to his Majesty.</p>

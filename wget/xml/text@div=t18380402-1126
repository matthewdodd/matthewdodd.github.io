On the 8th of February, I had occasion to go down into my cellar, to the water-closet, about three or four o'clock in the afternoon, and left my watch there—I did not miss it till about nine o'clock at night—I had some bills printed next day, offering a reward for the watch, and on the 7th of March I received two letters—I went over to a place where I was directed to go, to receive a watch, seals, and key, on leaving 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not leave any money, but saw the landlord of the house, and informed him of it—I did not see the prisoner—he was in the habit of using my house.</p>

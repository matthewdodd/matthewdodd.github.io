               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving any silk of Messrs. Garsed and Co. on the 10th of September? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it after you received it? - I took it home in an handkerchief, it was not for me, it was for my sister; as I was coming along Lamb-street, I heard something of a whistling behind me which caused me to turn about; it was within a quarter to ten, or not quite too much.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a pretty light night? - It was a pretty light night. When I got a little way down <placeName id="t17931030-27-crimeloc149">Wheeller-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17931030-27-crimeloc149" type="placeName" value="Wheeller-street"></interp>

               <p>Q. From the view which you had of the persons that committed this violence on you, should you be able to say who they were? - Campbell knocked me down, and the other took my bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoners before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure now as you was then? - I am sure of them because I had a full view of them in Lamb-street, and I saw them follow me down Wheeller-street, and also I saw them at the grocer's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me caution you, these mens lives depend on your evidence, are you sure they are the persons? - I am quite sure, I would scorn to say it if I was not quite sure.</p>
               <p>Court. How soon after the robbery did you see the prisoners, either of them? - About three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else present besides the prisoners? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else present when you saw them in custody? - No, Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them directly? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you give information? - The next day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Campbell. I should be glad to know whether it was a dark night or a light night when this woman was robbed? - The shops were all open, it was not a very dark night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Southflat. Was I in the same dress I am now? - When they committed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300031"></xptr>the robbery Campbell he had a brown coat with whitish buttons, and white stockings, Southflat had a blue jacket on.</p>
               <p>Court. How near were they to you before they attacked you? - About half a dozen yards behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lamp besides the grocer's? - Yes, all the way down Wheeller-street.</p>

               <p>I live in this neighbourhood at the corner of the passage were this robbery was committed. On the 10th of September, about a quarter before ten o'clock, I was sitting at my table at work, it was about the middle of the room, I heard a scuffle which drew me to the door; when I came to the door, I says to my girl bring me a candle, and as I was opening the street door I heard somebody run, and when the door was opened I had the candle in my hand, and I saw a man pass me, and his face was turned from me, and he had got on a brown coat, with white metal buttons; he was about five feet high, a broad set young man, broad across the shoulders; I see no man but that, I heard the other man run, but I did not see his face, I turned about and I saw a woman on the ground, Mrs. Venables; I had heard several blows hit, one came against my shutter; I was very big with child, or else I might have taken more notice; I went to Mrs. Venables, and she said two fellows had taken away the silk from her; I see some ribbons and things, but the silk was gone.</p>

             the 19th of September, at a public house in Shoreditch; I think it is the Three Pidgeons; I did not find any thing about him, but I went to his apartment, as he told the magistrate it was; he first of all told the magistrate that he lived in Westminster, but the magistrate thought it was not satisfactory enough, and he said he lived in Acorn-alley, Bishopsgate-street; in consequence of that I went to that loding, and I found some files, keys, and a dark lanthorn, and five bad shillings.</p>

I have an acquaintance and I asked her did not she remember my drinking tea with her on Tuesday the 10th of September,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300032"></xptr>I asked her would she come on my trial so and so? for fear she should not I have subpoened the woman to speak the truth as far as she knew; I have also two others who came out of their apartment, and to whom she said there were three of them, one of which pulled a hat over her eyes.</p>

On 18th Oct., about half past 3 o'clock, I saw a constable named Smith, at the door of the house, No. 51, Mornington-row—I looked through the key hole, and saw the prisoner come out of the back study with this crowbar in one hand, and a light in the other—he went down in the kitchen—I went to the back of the house, and got over five walls—I got into the yard and saw the study window standing open, I saw the bottom bar had been taken from it—I heard the prisoner strike a lucifer match—I took off my boots, and got in at the study window—I then saw the prisoner coming up the kitchen stairs to the back study, where I was standing—lie had this crowbar in his hand, and a writing desk under his arm, and two scarfs wrapped round the writing desk—I turned on my light and the prisoner turned round, and ran down to the back kitchen—I followed him down, and when I got to the bottom of the stairs he struck my lantern from my hand with this bar—he was just in the kitchen, and I was outside the kitchen door—I was in the house—I called to the prisoner to surrender, and he struck at me with the bar—I parried the blow off with my right arm—it bruised my arm—the mark was on it for three weeks afterwards, and the arm is very tender now—there was a little light, and by that I saw that he took the crowbar out of his breast and struck me—I took him by the collar, and threw him on his back—he struggled and got up, and I threw him a second time—the persons in the house were roused by the other officer knocking at the door—the other officer came to my assistance, and we took the prisoner to the station—when we were outside the house the prisoner said if he had thought well, he could have killed me with the crowbar—at the time he struck me, he had got this writing desk under his arm wrapped round with some scarfs—the writing desk belonged to Mr. Ranger, and the scarfs to Mr. Byron.</p>

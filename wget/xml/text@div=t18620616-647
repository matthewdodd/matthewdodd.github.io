                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Smith, and keep the George public-house, Broadway, Hammersmith—on 10th May, about 11 o'clock, the prisoners came there with a woman—one of these men, I do not know which, called for a pint of beer, and paid for it with a shilling—I do not know which put the shilling down, or whether it was the same man that called for the beer—I put it in the till, and served the beer—they drank it—there was no other shilling in the till—I gave them the change—Leary took it up—they all went out, but they called for a pot of beer before they went out, and had it, and the woman paid for it with another shilling, which I afterwards found was not good—they then went out together, and all came in again afterwards with another man in plain clothes, and Ryan called for a bottle of soda water for Leary to drink—Ryan gave me a two-shilling piece, which I tried in the detector and found bad—I returned it, and said, "This is not good"—he said he thought it was; he had only just taken it from his landlady for his billet-money, and if it was not good, he must take it back again to where he received it; but Leary said, "Give it to me; I will take care of it," and he gave it him—a half-crown was then tendered by Ryan, and I gave him the two shillings I had previously taken—I had put them in the till—Ryan looked at them, and while I was giving the coppers, he said, "Oh! I think I will not change the half-crown;" and the woman said, "Oh! if you say you have no change, I have some small change; I will pay for it for you," and she paid with fourpence in coppers—they parted without drinking the whole of the soda water, and it struck me directly that I had taken two shillings of them, and I thought I would see</p>

               <p>if they were good, and I found they were bad—that was before they were out of sight—I sent a lad and the ostler after them—the two men were brought back directly, and I gave them in charge with the two shillings.</p>

Q.</hi> You had never seen these men before, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they belong to the militia, I believe, that is in that neighbourhood—them were a great many militia about at that time—Ryan said that he was billeted—the publicans give them money some<lb></lb>times to get rid of them—this was about 11 o'clock at night—there was no other money in the till; no more shillings—I never keep a great deal of money in the till—I have two tills—I had silver in the further till—I cannot say how much—one is at one end of the counter, and the other at the other—a very short time elapsed between the first and second times of their coming—I had not received any other money between the two times—I do not know how the woman came to order the drink on the first occasion—I never saw the woman pay for the drink much—there was not another woman that gave me the other shilling—there was only one woman—the first shilling was not given by the woman—Ryan did not give me either of the shillings—all that he had was the florin, which he said he got from his landlady.</p>

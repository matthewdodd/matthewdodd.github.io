On 11th May, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty near the Bald-faced Stag, at Finchley, and saw the prisoner going in the direction of the rick, and about 500 yards from it—about ten minutes afterwards he came running back—I stopped him—he said, "Do you see that light?"—I looked, and said, Yes—he said, "I have set that on fire"—I asked him what it was—he said, "<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> hayrick"—I took him into the station—I found on him two boxes of fusees, fourpenny, a knife, and a bit of copper wire—he said he set the stack on fire with the fusees—he gave no address.</p>

Yes, just before dark; I locked them up on Monday evening in the workshop, the door was not broke open; I fancy the man got in by the shutter; the shutter has a piece of wood or nail to fasten it, any body can put their hand in and open it; when I went into the yard, I missed the cock, I looked for them, and they were gone; I fetched four of the fowls from Mr. Dimsey, No. 8, Albion-street, Spice-island.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Perry.) Did you find the pocket-book? - A. No, my lad found the pocket-book.</p>

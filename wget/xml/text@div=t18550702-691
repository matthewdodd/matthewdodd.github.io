                  </hi>. I am a coal porter, in the service of Lee and Company, who trade under the name of the North London Coal Depdt—the depot runs along the railway about 200 yards, along the Kingaland station—some palings run along the top of the embankment—I know the prisoner, and have driven him off the line before—last Thursday evening, at a few minutes past 6 o'clock, I was on the line, walking towards the station, and saw the prisoner creep under the palings from outside, and as I walked towards him, he walked underneath a stage, picked up this iron chair (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and laid it on the rail; a train was passing me at the time—he then turned back again—I was about seventy yards off; and walked to<lb></lb>wards him—he must have seen the train; it was coming up at the time he laid the chair on the rail, and he turned back directly he had done it, and went out through the same hole that he came in by—the train made a noise in coming along—he was creeping up the bank as the train passed, and the fence was over his head—the stage is close to the fence—I was seventy yards from the stage when I saw him, and I kept coming nearer—I was fifty or sixty yards from him when the train passed—I saw the life guard of the engine strike the chair, and saw the chair fly away—I then went in pursuit of the boy; he was not out of my sight above two or three seconds; I am confident of him; I have seen him frequently—I found him concealing himself behind a big stone; he had just got through the fence, and as soon as he saw me, ha went behind the stone—I went up, and said, "You are the boy I want, you have just been on the line"—he said, "You are a liar"</p>

               <p>—I had driven him off the line two or three tiroes before—he has got through that hole two or three times—the children have scratched the dirt away underneath the palings, and then they slip themselves underneath—it has only been there a short time—I did not inform the Company of it, because I was not employed by them, but by Mr. Lee.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fireman on No. 4, North London engine. I was with the train out of London, at a quarter past 6 o'clock this day—I shut off the steam about 500 yards before we get to the Kingsland station—I did so on this occasion, and when we got about 200 yards from the station, I said to my mate, "Hold, we are off the line" (we were not off the line)—as we came to the chair the iron life guard knocked it off, but if it had not been high enough to have been struck by the life guard it must have thrown the engine off the line—the life guard comes down within three or four inches of the rail, but it does not always succeed, it is according how it lies—if the wheel of the engine had struck the chair, it would have thrown us off and endangered the safety of the passengers—when I saw the chair I used the screw, more than I should have done if I had been going to pull up at the station—I attribute our escape from the danger to my extra exertions to pull up the train—the faster we were going the greater would be the danger—when I saw the chair, I put the break on much earlier than I other-wise should have done, and by that, mitigated the risk.</p>

On the 30th of March the prisoner, Randall, came to the shop for a quarter of a pound of soap, which came to two-pence-halfpenny - She gave me half a crown; I sounded it, and asked her if she had not got halfpence; she said, "No; do you think it is bad." I told her I did not. I put it in the till, and gave her the change. Gardiner then came in and asked for a pennyworth of pickles - I told her we did not sell so small a quantity, and she went out. Randall then said she had got halfpence, and I might return her her half crown; I told her to keep the change, as I had put it into the till and mixed it. She then took up the shillings, bit them, and said one was bad - She had taken them up before, while Gardner was in the shop. I said it was not the same that I gave her; she said it was, for she had no other. I then changed it, and she went out.</p>

            . I am a porter. I was in the shop when the prisoners came in, and heard the whole. When they went out I went to carry some salt into Threadneedle-street, the same way that they went; as I returned I met them, talking together; I watched them into Holt's wine-vaults in Threadneedle-street, and after that to a fishmonger's opposite-Holt joined me; we watched them into a bookseller's. I then saw Randall go up to a Jew, Gardner waited on the other side; Holt got an officer, who came up. We saw them at the Bank counting money, and changing it from one to the other; we followed them to a coffee-shop in Honey-lane-market, and when they came out the officer took them. I saw them both drop money-one parcel was in a handkerchief, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181804010035"></xptr>other in a glove, which I picked up and gave them to the officer.</p>

            . I keep a wine-vaults in Threadneedle-street. The prisoners had some liquor at my shop. From what Blackford told me, I watched them, and saw them changing money-both of them were ringing it on the ground-it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening. We followed them to Honey-lane-market, into a coffee-shop - They came out again, and Brady laid hold of them. Gardner threw down a glove containing counterfeit money, and Randall threw a paper down with counterfeit money in it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I watched the prisoners with the two witnesses, and saw them changing their money at the Bank; I followed them into a coffee-shop in Honey-lane-market-as soon as they came out I laid hold of Gardner, she put her hand into her pocket and threw out a glove, and Randall threw away a paper, both of which contained counterfeit shillings and half crowns; on searching them, I found two half crowns and three bad shillings on Gardner; and a bad half crown and three bad shillings on Randall. The whole of the counterfeit money amounted to 2l. 5s. 6d. They had 7s. 6d. in good money on them.</p>

On the 4th of March, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoners came to the shop, and asked to see some calico, which I shewed them. I was stooping to get some more, turned my head, and saw Parsons take something from his greatcoat and put it into his pocket - I then missed a shawl, and told them so; Wilson said,</p>
               <p>"Nonsense!" I jumped over the counter, and stamped with my foot for assistance; Wilson pushed me aside, and both ran out - they threw a handkerchief down. I pursued them; Parsons was stopped in Shepherd's-market. I followed Wilson and secured him, but found nothing on him. The shawl was never found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Where was the handkerchief - A. It hung in the shop - I did not see them take it; they might have brushed it down as they ran out. I never saw the shawl in his hand - it was in the shop when they came in.</p>

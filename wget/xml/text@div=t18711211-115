On 24th November, about 2.30 a.m., I was in High Street, Borough, and saw a man in Great Dover Street, in a Crossching or kneeling position in the centre of the pavement—I heard something fall, and went towards the man—he came across the road on seeing me coming—I stopped him, and asked him what he was doing there at that hour of the morning—it was Savage—he said he had been with some women—I had seen no women about—I searched him, and detained him until Mould came up, who called my attention to the cellar flap of the Swan Hotel, within two dozen yards of us—there were marks of its having been forced with some instrument—I took Savage to the station—on my</p>

               <p>return I heard a rattle—I called for assistance, and found Mould kneeling on the cellar-flap, keeping it down against the efforts to escape of someone who was in the cellar—the flap was raised—I jumped into the cellar, followed by the sergeant—I found Ambrose, and took him in custody—I afterwards saw Regan taken in the cellar, by Mould—on Ambrose I found this large clasp knife, and a pair of new braces; and on Savage, a little money—I took them to the station, and returned with Inspector Mason.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was nearly 50 yards from Savage when I first saw him—it was so dark that I could not determine his position—I was in uniform—he came towards me—he told me he had been with some women, and intended to have some coffee—there is a coffee-stall there, and he asked me to have some—I walked towards the stall with him, not to have some coffee, but because I did not wish to have the responsibility of taking him in custody, as I found no house-breaking implements on him—the coffee-stall was not in the direction where Regan was afterwards found—I took Savage to the flap—he did not assist me in searching, but he assisted in trying to start off an area grating—he assisted me in searching the houses.</p>

About 2.30 on this morning I was in Great Dover Street, and saw the three prisoners—Regan was lying down and the other two got hold of him and pulled him on his legs—Ambrose and Savage pretended to be drunk as they came towards me—I fancied there was something wrong, went round my beat rather sharper than usual, and met them again in Napier Street, they were all sober then—I went round my beat again and met them in Kent Street, they were all sober then—when I came round again I found Bassett holding Savage in custody—I said that his two mates were not far off—Savage made no answer to that—I said "I will have a look down these areas," as I saw one of them lying down—when I got to the Swan Hotel I saw marks of a sort of <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> on the cellar flap—Bassett took Savage to the station, and I remained to watch the flap—after a minute or two I saw a light in the cellar—I rang the bell to awake the people, the light was then put out, and someone came to the flap, and whispered, and raised it up—I knelt on it and sprung my rattle—No. 295 came, and afterwards Bassett, and a sergeant—he then raised the flap, Bassett got in and took Ambrose, and 295 took Regan.</p>

On the 8th of December I had some oats which had been threshed, and were in bulk, in an old barn, where Carter was threshing. I sent Miles with a load of straw - this barn was in his way - I followed him and saw him stop at the barn - he had no business there, and I suspected he was taking some oats. As I got up to the cart he came out with a quantity of oats in a sack, and his nose bag; he could not see me till he came out of the barn - I told him how wrong it was- that I had caught him at last, and had long suspected him; he begged my pardon; I told him to go home - I got another man to go on with the load; Carter was in the barn, and I do not suppose he heard what I said; I then went in and asked Carter about it, and he said Miles was determined to take them - that he had told him not, and he would take them; I then took him before a Magistrate - he was doing his work, and was paid by the bushel.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you permit them to put oats into a sack or a nose bag? A. Yes, but not from that barn; I never give my horses oats which are not clean; there had been some measured out for him that day - the corn is measured out for him twice a week, and he takes what he thinks sufficient for the horses.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOOT. I am the constable. I took Carter before the Magistrate. I heard him and Miles examined; I saw them sign these depositions (read).</p>
               <p>Joshua Miles being asked what he had to say, says 'I took them from the barn for the use of my master's horses.'</p>
               <p>Charles Carter being asked how he came to suffer them to be taken, says 'Joshua Miles would take them against my will.'</p>
               <p>CARTER's Defence. He came to me for some oats - I told him I was not going to be blamed for it - if master knew it there would be a piece of work - but he took them against my will.</p>
               <p>MILES' Defence. I took them for my master's horses.</p>

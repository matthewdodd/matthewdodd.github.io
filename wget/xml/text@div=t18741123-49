I live at 47, Green Street, Bishopsgate, and am a hawker of furs—I am a Pole, and have been only three months in England—I went into a beershop in Woolwich with my basket and furs—the public master said "Show what you have in the box"—I said "I have boas to sell"—I opened the box and showed them, and he wanted to buy one from me—the prisoners were in the bar—the man took a black one and put it in his pocket—I had three black boas, and I saw that I had only two—I said "Why do you take my goods?" and he said "Go on, I will fight you"—I said to the public master "He has got my boa, and <hi rend="italic">does</hi> not want to pay me"—a policeman took him afterwards—I sold one boa to the public-house master for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to give to the woman, that is, another woman—when I went into the public-house I had fifteen boas altogether, and one dozen, that is twenty-seven—when I got home I only had thirteen.</p>

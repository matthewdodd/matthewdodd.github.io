                  </hi>. I am a single woman, living with my mother, at No. 4, Paradise-street, St. Pancras. On Wednesday morning, 27th Feb., I met the prisoner at the Bell public house, with my sister, between 8 and 9 o'clock—my sister was lived with him for ten years—she had come to our house the night previous, and stopped all night—after leaving the Bell we went home—we live just through the Bell—the prisoner came to my mother's—my sister was down stairs when he came in—he first went up stairs into my mother's room, and he made use of very bad language towards me, and he then directly ran down stairs and fetched the knife, and cut me across the skull with it—he said, "You b——wretch," and said he would cut my b——throat; he had got his revenge then, and he thought he would do for me then if he possibly could—he had the knife at the time he said this—he ran down stairs to fetch the knife after he said this, and he beat me down stairs as well—he did not come back again after going down stairs—I took the knife out of his hand, and then he ran away—when be went down stairs to fetch the knife, he came back again with it—he beat me first upstairs in my mother's room, and then down stairs in the back parlour—he cut my head with the knife, and attempted to cut my throat, and had I not taken the knife out of his hand, he would have done so—he said, "I have got my revenge of you now, and I will cut your throat"—I said, "Oh! pray Dick, don't do that, for the sake of my poor old mother"—he beat me several times across the top of my head with the knife—it is a rusty knife, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he held it by the handle in this way, and chopped me several times on the top of the head—the blood is on it now—there was no handle</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185603030073"></xptr>
               <p>to it—when I got the knife out of his hand he ran away, and I went after him—my sister was not present while he was beating me with the knife—she ran away to get the constable as soon as she saw him commence beating me—she saw him chop me several times across the head with the knife, and she was frightened—she did see it—I had not struck him at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Were you sober at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—I had not pawned your boots that morning—my sister pledged them—they were her own boots that she worked hard for—I did not take up part of a paving stone, and attempt to hit you on the head with it—I did not then go into the back parlour and take up the knife, and attempt to strike you with it—you did not wrest it out of my hand, and I did not seize you by the ear with my nails—you attempted my mother's life as well as my sister's, and it is not the first time you have attempted my life.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of the last witness. I have been living for ten years with the prisoner—I was at my mother's house on the morning of 27th Feb.—I remember the prisoner coming there—he first struck me outside the Bell—he afterwards came to my mother's—I heard him say to my sister, "I will have my revenge of you now, I will take your life"—this was in the first floor back room—there was no one else present besides myself, my sister, and the prisoner—I held the handle of the door in my hand—I saw him going to strike her—all she said was, "For God's sake, <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, don't hurt Martha no more than you have done," and he took the knife, and repeatedly chopped her across the head with it—I think he got the knife from down stairs, but I cannot say—I met him on the stairs with it, and he went up into my mother's room and repeatedly struck my sister there on the head—he chopped her several times on the head, and, being afraid, I ran away—I cannot say what he was doing with his other hand—he is a bad man, and I have forgiven him many times.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Where did I see you that morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Having part of half a quartern of gin, when you struck me a blow at the back of my head—that was at the Bell—I was quite sober—I had pawned my boots to get some breakfast—you struck me twice in the face with a half quartern leaf—you did not ask me to go home with you and make up the money that I had pawned your coat for—you unlaced my boots, and took them off my feet, and even took my bonnet—I did not tell you I had pawned my boots, and released my scarf—I had not pawned my scarf—I did not ask you to get my boots before I went home with you—my sister did not come up and prevent my going with you—she did not call you abusive names—you struck me twice outside the Bell with the half quartern loaf, and you struck another female—my sister did not take up a stone to you—I suppose this knife belongs to my mother, I do not know—I only saw you make use of it, I cannot say who it belongs to—Agnes scratched your face—that was when you were chopping her, to save her own life—she rescued the knife from your hand, I believe, but I was not there then, I went for a policeman—I brought two policeman, because one said he was so much afraid of you, that he would not take you without another one to assist him—you have several times attempted to out Agnes's throat—you did on this occasion—I heard you say you would have your revenge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital, Gray's Inn-road. Agnes Williams was brought there on the morning of 27th Feb.—I found a severe contusion on the left side of the forehead, a contused wound, about half an inch long, on the top of the head, and several contusions on the sides and back of the head—the skin was broken of the wound on the top of the head—I believe the injuries I saw might have been produced by such an instrument as this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> All of them, or only the contused wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The contused wound might, but I should rather say that the contusions were effected by some blunter instrument—I do not think any of them, except the contused wound, could have been inflicted by it—I treated her for these injuries—scalp wounds are always more or less dangerous—they did not go to the bone—they may turn out unfavourably—they are not in themselves dan<lb></lb>gerous—if erysipelas comes on that might make them dangerous, not other-wise—no ill symptoms have shown themselves at present—the wound on the top of the head is not quite healed yet—the contusions might be pro<lb></lb>duced by a fall—the wound was a cut, not a bruise only—the edges were abraded as well as cut—it was such a wound as a blunt instrument would effect—I think there were five or six separate contusions on the head.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, stated that he had lined with the prosecutrix's sister for ten years, and that when sober he had no fault to find with her, but that her sister was constantly tempting her to pledge her things and spend the money in drink; that she had done so on the occasion in question, and also pledged a coat with which he had been entrusted; that he went to try and per<lb></lb>suade her to return home with him, and found both herself and sister very tipsy and violent; that the prosecutrix took the knife to him, and on his wresting it from her, scratched his face, when he hit her on the head with the flat part of the knife.</hi>)</p>

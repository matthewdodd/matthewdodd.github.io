                  </hi>. I live at 35, Friendly Place, Mile End and am a plumber and painter—on Tuesday, 31st August, I went to bed about ten or eleven o'clock—my window was then fastened with a latch and a bolt outside the shutters—on Wednesday morning I woke, and opened the window and shutters—I looked at my watch, it was twenty-five minutes to five—I thought I would have another half-hour in bed, and I closed the window and fastened it—about twenty minutes past five I was awoke, and saw the prisoner in the act of taking my coat from behind the door—there was another man standing by the window, which was open—I jumped up and said, "What is this, and who do you want?" and the pri<lb></lb>soner jumped out at the window—I looked round, missed my watch and guard, jumped out after him, and ran, with nothing else on but my shirt—a policeman stopped him, and he was taken—the other man got away—my watch went away as well, it was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a pane of the window cracked, just behind the fastening.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you ever seen the prisoner before? A. Not that I am aware of—I saw him and two others run away—there was no one else about there at the time; there were three of them running, two ran one way, and this one ran the other way—I dare say he had fifty yards' start of me—I did not lose sight of him when he jumped out of the window—I was in the act of jumping over the foot of the bed as he jumped out—I was out as soon as he was—they ran together—when they got about 200 yards off they parted—I hallooed out, "Stop thief!" all the way.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman K 78). I was in the Mile End Road on this morning, and saw the prisoner running, followed by the prosecutor in his shirt—I stopped the prisoner—the prosecutor was about 40 yards behind him perhaps, calling out, " Stop thief! "—when he came up he charged him with stealing his watch—first he said he knew nothing about it, on the way to the station he said, "You have taken the wrong man"—he gave me a false name and address—his name is Taylor.</p>

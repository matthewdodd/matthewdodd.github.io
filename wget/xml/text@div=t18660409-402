I am a publisher—the prisoner was in my service—I did not receive 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or two sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Atkins—I did not receive these sums on November 16, February 1, and February 14—it is not true that the cash-book was brought to my house—it was brought there with the ledger by Mr. Wise, that we should go through it on Sunday—that was the Sunday after the prisoner was in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it brought to your house on Sunday, 25th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the Sunday previous to the examination—I went there with Mr. Wise and my son—it was taken back to Mr. Wise's office, I think by Mr. Wise—I do not remember when—it was in the counting-house on Monday, and on the following Wednesday evening it was missed—I saw it on Wed<lb></lb>nesday morning at ten o'clock, in the counting-house—the charge about Simpkins was, I think, discovered the day after the first examination—I think on 21st or 22d—in Atkins's matter a number of omissions were dis<lb></lb>covered—the charges were made on March 1, not on the 8th—I feel con<lb></lb>fident of that, as far as my memory serves.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATKINS</hi>. I paid these two sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each.</p>

Q.</hi> If the prisoner received that 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Simpkins, would it be his duty to hand it to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, to Mr. Harrison—if not, it would be his duty to enter it in the cash-book—this is a town account—at the time you are speaking of, it was a country account—at times he would enter that in the cash-book without saying a word to me—I am responsible for what is entered in the cash-book in my writing—Absolem does not enter in the cash-book at all—it was only me and the prisoner who entered in it—if he received a town account, he would enter it in the cash-book—I swear that he has half a dozen times—the prisoner has perhaps a dozen accounts a month to receive—I do not receive town accounts—I have not had money in my hands that I have not entered.</p>

             was the last that went out - it was after three o'clock. The prisoner was invited, but said he could not come. He and his wife came at night. My wife and I had been down in the back kitchen, and when we came up Burn was standing behind the door, my wife asked him what was the matter - he said there was a man in the passage with a sword, and he was afraid of his life. I told him I would see him safe out. My wife was before me with a light, the prisoner stood in the passage with a sword, he made towards me, and made a blow at me with it, my wife put her hand up, and received the blow on her hand - it cut her fingers - he made a second blow, and cut my head; he rose his hand, and struck again, I ran up, and caught him - we struggled and fell, the light was put out, my wife went and got another, and as soon as she brought it it was put out again; she fetched some people to my assistance, and we took the prisoner to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a wound was that on your head - A. Not very deep, it was about two inches long. I had not not got my hat on. I got well without a doctor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. There were a great many people - A. Yes; some were tipsy, I was sober. There was some talk between my wife and the prisoner about producing 50 l. - there were no blows between them; he gave me some blows and, I dare say, I gave him some - that was down stairs. The company were all gone when he cut my head with the sword. I did not throw a quart pot at him. Anglin was at the wedding, Conner, Welch, nor Duffey were neither there; they might have called in and gone out again.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor. At three o'clock in the morning, when all the company had left, except Burns, Burns was going out but turned back, went behind the kitchen door, and said there was a man in the passage with a sword, and he was afraid of his life. I and my husband came up, the prisoner made a blow at him, I put my hand up, and received the blow, which cut two of my fingers - he made a second blow, and cut my husband's head; the candle was immediately put out, I got another, and it was put out again. I went out and got assistance, the prisoner was brought into the court, and the watchman took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had there been any dispute about a wager - A. I heard none. There was no scuffle or fighting between him and my husband that I know of.</p>

            . I live in Calmell-buildings, and was at this wedding. I was there until two o'clock in the morning. They were going to dance on the first floor, but the prisoner told them it would injure the building, and they might dance in the kitchen. Lucett offered to bet the prisoner 5 l., and the prisoner said he would give him 20 l. if he could produce 5 l. His wife said if my husband has not got 5 l. I have 10 l., and more. One word produced another, and Lucett took up an empty pot, and told the prisoner to get out of the kitchen immediately, or he would strike him with it. I took him by the breast, and said it was a shame to strike the man - he got angry with me, and got from me, then his wife took up a candlestick, and said she would let him know she had got some blood. They collared Shehee, and turned him out of the room. I went to bed in about five minutes, and saw no more. Lucett was a little in liquor, when he first came in he took up a glass, and said it was the thirteenth he had had that day.</p>

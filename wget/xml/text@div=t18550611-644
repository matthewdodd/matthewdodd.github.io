                  </hi>. I am a gold and silver refiner, of St. James's-street, Clerkenwell, in partnership with my brother. On Saturday afternoon, 5th May, about half past 4 o'clock, a man, whom I have not seen since, came with this assay paper, and asked me to purchase this bar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—(<hi rend="italic">Paper read</hi>: "May 6th, '55. Mr. Anderson, parting assay, 2 ozs., 6 dwts., 6 grs.; 7 ozs., 3 dwts., 12 grs., in 1 lb. Troy S. palladium. <hi rend="italic">Stamped</hi>, Hatton-garden, London Office.")—I knew that the persons who issued this paper were assayers, and I knew the writing on the stamp by seeing it occasionally; it is Mr. Staples, clerk to Johnson and Matthew; he makes the assay for them—I weighed the bar, and just rubbed it on a stone to test it, but did not cut it—it weighed 66 ozs. 8 dwts., and I purchased it of the man for 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him twenty sovereigns, and a cheque for 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>on the London and Westminster Bank, Lothbury—that was the value of the bar, assuming that there was that amount of silver and of palladium in each pound troy—the man said that he came from Anderson, of No. 29, Skinner-street, Clerkenwell—I showed the bar to my brother in the evening when he came home, and from what he said I went to No 29, Skinner-street, Clerkenwell, and found that the person did not live there—it was Saturday evening—on Monday morning I cut the bar, and found inside a quantity of copper—it contains the cut that I then made in it—it is a mere casing of valuable metal, and copper in the centre—my brother then went to the bank to stop the cheque which I had given—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I should not have given that sum for the bar unless I had believed it to be all the metal described in the assay paper.</p>

On the morning of 7th May, I saw Mr. William Thomas Abud; from what he told me I went to the London and Westminster Bank, Lothbury, where the witness Martin was pointed out to me—I took him into custody—he was standing at the counter where cheques are paid; at the same time this cheque for 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was handed to me by one of the cashiers—from what Martin told me, I went to the prisoner's house, No. 46, St. John-street, Clerkenwell—I found him there; I did not take Martin with me, I left him in the custody of Brett, another officer—I said to the prisoner, "Did you send one of your men to the London and West<lb></lb>minster Bank this morning with a cheque for 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "How and when did you obtain possession of it?"—he said, "On Saturday last, in the afternoon, a man named Anderson came to my shop and purchased 5 oz. 11 dwts. and 9 grains of fine gold, and he gave me the cheque in payment"—I had the cheque with me at the time, I am not positive whether I held it in my hand at the time I put the question to him—I might, I do not remember showing it to him—I had mentioned it—I told him he must come with me to Mr. Abud's—I told him I was an officer, and that the cheque had been obtained from Mr. Abud; but I do not remem<lb></lb>ber the words in which I stated it—when we got to Messrs. Abud's, I produced this second bar to him—I got it from Martin, he gave it me in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, on the way to Messrs. Abud's from the London and Westminster Bank—Martin was at Messrs. Abud's, and the prisoner saw him—I am not certain whether I said I had taken it from Martin, but I showed it him in Martin's presence, and said, "Does this bar belong to you?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked him whether he had any objection to its being cut; he said, "No"—the other bar that had been presented to Mr. Abud was shown him; I am not sure whether it was directly handed to him, but he had an opportunity of seeing it, and I have no doubt of his being in possession of all the particulars with respect to this bar—Mr. Abud took the bar away, and brought it to me in a few minutes afterwards, cut as it is now; it con<lb></lb>tains</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Robert Walker, a pawnbroker of St. John-street, Clerkenwell—I know Martin quite well; he came on 17th February, and brought a bar of gold, or to represent gold; it weighed about five ounces. I advanced him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it, and afterwards 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I should not have done so if I had not believed it to be gold—I had lent Mr. Groves money on gold before, therefore asked if it was of the usual quality of Mr. Groves' gold, and he said "Yes"—I should not have advanced the money unless I had believed it to be of the same quality—when Mr. Groves was taken into custody, I took the bar to a jeweller's, and had it cut in my presence—he is not here—there was copper inside—it was redeemed after that on 9th May—I did not know that I could hold it, as it was not stolen goods—Groves' wife redeemed it—I went up, and found Groves was not at home, and it was redeemed about two hours after that—I have had no conversation with Groves about it—my shop is about five minutes walk from his house.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">AS</hi> far as you believe, do you know whether Mr. Groves knew? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not know; I believe he is as ignorant as myself—I cannot say whether my master bought bars of gold; but he bought gold of all sorts, of any person who came—I believe he has bought a bar; I cannot swear it—my duty is watch-case making; I had nothing to do with this department unless my master directed me—I know sufficient of the trade to say that it is extremely common for strangers to come to sell ingots, and bars, and dust; it has been for years and years, since the great discoveries of gold—refiners buy bars like this of strangers without asking who they are.</p>

               <p>Hudson. She had worked for me about half a year, and I missed goods; I went to people that kept frames, and desired them to stop them, if any were brought to them. I will take my oath that is my worsted; it was found at one Wagg's; there are seven ounces and a half of it, and

               <p>Meads. One is hard and the other soft, the hard is the dearest and the soft is the cheapest; I believe the knitting yarn is not so good as the weaving yarn.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you take that worsted to be worth?</p>
               <p>Meads. Three pence half penny, or a groat an ounce.</p>

            . I live in St. Martin's Legrand , and keep a stocking warehouse; I have known Lloyd above two years, and he has dealt with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he would buy goods, knowing them to be stolen?</p>
               <p>Bascomb. I believe there is no man of any character that would, and I do not think he would.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he is a judge of worsted?</p>
               <p>Bascomb . I believe he is not; he only deals in two penny halfpenny, and low sorts of worsted.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a man of a fair and honest character?</p>
               <p>Bascomb. He is a man of as fair and honest a character as any I know.</p>
               <p>Q. What would you give an ounce for it?</p>
               <p>Bascomb. I would not give four pence an ounce for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you give seven farthings?</p>
               <p>Bascomb. Yes, Sir, to be sure, it is worth more than that; but this is tumbled , and I would not give above three pence for this worsted, for it is not worth more.</p>

            . I have known Lloyd several years, and he bears a very good character; I have not an honester juster dealer belonging to me than he is.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade are you?</p>
               <p>Hales. I am a hosier.</p>
               <p>Q . Look at that worsted. What do you take it to be worth?</p>
               <p>Hale. As it is tumbled in this manner (though it may be better than it appears to be) I have as good for three pence an ounce, and I think I have as good for something less.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he is a good judge of these goods himself?</p>
               <p>Hales. Unless he deals in it very much, I do not think he is; but I am informed he does not deal much in this article, and that he is not a judge of the goodness of it.</p>

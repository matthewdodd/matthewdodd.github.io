                  </hi>. I am a farmer at Bedfont Middlesex. Then coppers were fixed in a house of mine which was let to Mr. Bayley—I had not seen them for some time myself—they were missing on the morning of the 3rd of December—Allcott was in possession of the house at the time—there had been a distress against Bayley.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the parish. I received informa<lb></lb>tion, on the 4th of December, of the coppers being stolen, and on the evening of the 5th I got information, and went to a field some distance from the main road, between Feltham and Ashford, more than a mile from the house, where I found them in a ditch—I found two persons watching—they showed me where they were concealed—I then laid in watch from half-past-five o'clock in the evening—I observed two men come up—one got into the ditch and began to remove the copper—he threw out a large piece—the prisoner stood by—I could hear the man trying in lift up an<lb></lb>other other piece—the prisoner came up to the spot where we were concealed, and saw one of our party—he hallooed, "Halloo!"and ran away—I di<lb></lb>rectly followed him—he ran some distance, and threw himself into a hedge, and there I secured him with assistance—I found two coppers cut to pieces, and some lead in the ditch.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do I understand that you took the prisoner into custody near where the coppers were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, not more than twenty yards—the persons are not here who were watching with me—the prisoner was living with a woman in the poor-house at the time, about half a mile from where he was taken—I did not see him do any thing to the copper—he came up with the other man.</p>

            . I am gate-keeper at Aldgate, and have been twenty years, and I always make it my business to stop people that I think suspicious. On the 25th of March, the night the fire was, after I had been several hours at the fire, with my Lord Mayor, I went to my watch house at Aldgate, and just under the gateway, about five o'clock, I saw the Prisoner coming along with a bundle; I asked him what he had got, he seemed a little surprized, and desired I would let him go; I asked him where he had them, he said, he had been at the fire, and the people were throwing their books out of the windows into the street, and that a man gave them to him; (they were very wet and dirty) and said, for God's sake take them away, and carry them to the owner; he said he was a gardener, and had been a fallading at Newgate-Market.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I found them in the channel, in Leadenhall-street, and there were a great many more, and a strange man gave them to me, and desired me to carry them away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 180.) On the 19th of Aug. I was on duty in High-street, Deptford—I saw the prisoner driving a cart—I knew him before—I did not notice whether there was anything in it—he went with it to Hedges', a marine-store dealer, in High-street, Deptford, he got out of the cart, and went to a side gateway, attached to Mr. Hedge's shop—after remaining there about two minutes, two of Mr. Hedge's men came out of the yard, undid the tailboard, and took from the cart a basket covered with a cloth, and carried it into Mr. Hedge's yard (I did not see the prisoner at that time)—I followed into the yard, and saw the basket on the ground—the prisoner stood by it—I asked him what it contained—he said, "Copper"—I asked him to let me look at it—he said he would with the greatest pleasure—one of Hedge's men undid the cloth—I looked, and saw this copper in the basket—here are a great many pieces, weighing in all about 126lbs—I asked the pri<lb></lb>soner how he accounted for it—he told me he bought it at different shop a Woolwich—I told him I was not satisfied, and should take him before a Magistrate, which I did—I examined the basket at the station, and found one piece with the broad-arrow on it—this is it—I knew the prisoner to be a marine-store dealer.</p>

                  </hi> I am a clerk in the store-keeper's office, in Woolwich Dock-yard—I have looked at the copper produced—here is one piece with the broad-arrow on it, marked distinctly, and there are other pieces in which the broad-arrow appears to be defaced—these bolts generally appear to have been operate upon with a file—I conclude they have been field for the pur<lb></lb>pose of obliterating the mark, never having seen bolts so operated on before—the value of this copper would be about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this pieces that is marked weight about 14lbs. and is worth 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound—materials of this kind are never sold by Government, they are all sent to Portsmouth or Chatham to be re-manufactured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It must have been a very broad-arrow that has been filed out of this piece. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The broad-arrow is stamped all over them, at about two inches or two inches and a half distance—it is not all over this piece, this may not have been a manufactured bolt—it is used for the purpose of sepa<lb></lb>ting materials—I went to ask the men what it was used for to satisfy myself and any one that might ask—I did not know without asking.</p>

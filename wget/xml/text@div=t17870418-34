               <p>"That the prisoner, as he was going to see a young woman, at a Mrs. Lowe's, No. 2, Philip's-court, Grub-street; mistook the court, and went into No. 2, Hanover-court, in the same street, both courts adjoining; when he went into the passage, he was accosted by a child, who asked him what he wanted; he replied, No. 2, Philip's-court; when he found his mistake; it being then the hour of seven of the clock in the evening, of the 26th of January last, and it being then dark, which was the cause of his mistake; he returned out of the house; as he got better than half way down the court, a man came up to him, and collared him, and made mention of many opprobrious language, and called him a thief, and accused him of being in a strange house, and said he wanted to rob some apartment in the said house, and kept him in custody, until he sent for an officer, and sent him to the Poultry Compter, and would not listen to any thing he could say on his own behalf. Such irregular and arbitrary proceedings have been too often practised by designing persons, merely for the sake of having a reward.</p>
               <p>The prisoner is a young man of reputable parents, who will step forward on his trial to give him a character; he therefore humbly submits his case to your Lordship's interference, soliciting the favour of your Lordship's influence in his behalf.</p>

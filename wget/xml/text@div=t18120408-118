            . I live at 62, Watling-street. On the the 23d of February last, I saw the prisoner in <placeName id="t18120408-118-crimeloc632">Budge-row, Watling-street</placeName>

He then said, sir, I will give you another, a good one, which I took and put along with the other four shillings, I had no other shillings about me. In about three quarters of an hour I examined these shillings, I discovered two of them to be bad. In about two hours afterwards, I saw the prisoner near the Royal Exchange, I went to the Mansion-house and procured an officer, and had him taken in custody. I delivered the two shillings to the officer, the other three shillings were good.</p>

            . Mr. Page pointed out the prisoner to me. I took him to the compter. I found two dollars in his right hand waistcoat pocket, or the right hand breeches pocket; and nine three-shilling pieces, and seven six-pences. Mr. Page delivered to me these two bad shillings, and I found on him nine eighteen-penny pieces, and nine three-shilling tokens, all good; I found also on him two counterfeit shillings and five good one's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a contractor, of Cumberland Market, Regent's Park—I have known the prisoner about twelve months—I met him in May in Great George Street, Westminster—he asked me if I had anything to do—I said that I had not—he said, "I know of a nice job for you; do not say anything to any one about it; it is quite private, but meet me in the city to-morrow morning at nine o'clock"—I did so, and we went to the station to meet Mr. Blackie, but did not meet him—we then went to 62, Cornhill—the prisoner went into the office, and came out and said Mr. Blackie was not there—as soon as we got out we met Mr. Blackie—the prisoner and he went into the office, and stayed ten minutes or a quarter of</p>

Will you be the contractor?"—I got a person to fill up the papers in the specification—he had got his prices on a piece of paper, but he took them away with him—we went to Charing Cross, and the papers were filled up by a young man whom I knew—the prisoner then asked me for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay Mr. Blackie for writing the specification—we then went back to Cornhill—he went and left me outside—he came back and told me he had left me the money with Mr. Blackie, and it was all right—he made an appointment to meet me on the 17th at Mr. Blackie's office—I met him there—he went in, and brought out a letter, which he read to me—it was about 50 guineas for binding the contract (<hi rend="italic">a notice to to produce the letter was here put in</hi>)—the prisoner said I was to pay 50 guineas to be bound to the contract—I said I could get it—he said, "It is to be deposited with Mr. Blackie, and if you do not get the contract the money will be returned"—I went home and got 50 guineas, and we went by the Underground Railway to Aldersgate Street—I gave the prisoner the money as we were going into the station—he went to Mr. Blackie's office and said that he was going to give it to him—I waited outside—he came out and told me he had left the money there with Mr. Blackie, and made an appointment with me to meet him there on the following Saturday to sign the contract, as they were getting all the papers ready—I went on Saturday, but the prisoner was not there—I found Mr. Blackie there—I next saw the prisoner on the 1st June at my house, and asked him what he had done with the money—he told me he had put it into Coutts &amp; Co.'s bank, Strand—I asked him for a receipt for it, and he gave me one—on 2nd June he came to my house again and wanted 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I would not give it him—I did not see him again till he was in custody—I went down to Southend and made inquiries for Squire Lomax, and could find no such person, nor any land on which building operations were carried on for him—I ascertained from Mr. Blackie that the money had been paid to him—I parted with the five guineas to pay Mr. Blackie for writing the specifica<lb></lb>tion because I believed the prisoner was speaking the truth, and that he was engineer to the works—I parted with the 50 guineas to bind me to the contract, as he told me there was no one in for the contract but me, and that the contract was mine—I have never got my money back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor's clerk, at 63, Cornhill—I have known the prisoner about twelve months—he came there originally to sell part of a patent or to raise money upon it—in April last he gave me a draft specification, all ready prepared, which I was to copy; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of it—he told me he wanted it for a Mr. Lomax, whom he had known for many years, and who was about building upon one of his estates at Southend, and that he was appointed engineer to see to the sewage and the building, and the water and gas mains; that several of his friends wanted him to get the contract—he mentioned Mr. Offord and Mr. Smith, who had offered him a premium of, 50 guineas to do so—I made two copies of the specification, and sent them by post, at his request, to the two addresses—I never received five guineas for doing so—I did not get 50 guineas, and never heard of it till Mr. Puddefoot came—I did not know that he had any money from Mr. Puddefoot—I had never seen Mr. Pudde<lb></lb>foot—I have seen no contract or anything like one, nothing but this speci<lb></lb>fication—the prisoner gave me an address-card, 41, York Terrace, Regent's Park—I could not find him there, but I heard of him through a gentleman of position, who said that he had no right to issue those cards.</p>

Can I see him?" I said, "Do you wish to see him?" He said, "Yes, to ask him if he means to <hi rend="italic">lay me up</hi>." I said, "Do you mean, lock you up?" He said, "Yes; if he does that he will not get his money back; if he don't do it he might get it back. Where are we going now?" I said, "To the police-station." He said, "Then I reserve all I have to say"—I searched him, and found copies of the specification and letters upon him—he said that he had no fixed residence.</p>

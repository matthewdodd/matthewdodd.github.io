                  </hi>. I am a rope-maker, my dwelling-house is No. 164, Old Gravel-lane, St. George's-in-the-East—the prisoner M'Carthy was in my service for a fortnight before this happened. On the 29th of February I and my wife went out about seven o'clock in the evening, leaving M'Carthy in care of the house—she was the only person—as far as we know, we left all my property secure—I returned to the house first, in about two hours, and found two of the trades-people ringing at the bell—they could not get in—I rang once at the bell—it was not answered—I went into the next house, and got over the wall—I found no one in my house, M'Carthy was gone—I went to my cash-box, and found that was safe, and I did not search any further—my wife returned afterwards, and she missed the articles stated—the next day, which was Sunday, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was with a friend, and saw M'Carthy—I told her I was very glad to see her, and I should take her into custody—she said she would confess all she had done, and if I would go to No. 31, Rose-lane, she would give me up what she had stolen, as she had not parted with any—(I had not made her any promise, or threatened her)—I said I would not—I took her to Whitechapel-church, and gave her into custody—we then went to No. 31, Rose-lane, and found various things that are here, and are part of what I lost—the value of what I lost was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at least—Graham was taken afterwards—I know nothing of her, but she was with M'Carthy when I took her—she ran or walked away directly, and I had</p>

I was at the station-house when M'Carthy was brought in—I went to search the house, No. 31, Rose-lane, and there found the property here produced, with the exception of this gown and bonnet, which M'Carthy had on—I could not find Graham at that time, but I stopped at the house after the others were gone, and in a few minutes Graham came in at the back-door, and I took her—I asked where the shawl was that she had on when she was with M'Carthy—she said she did not know M'Carthy—I said she was with her when she was taken—she then said she was with her, and had borrowed M'Carthy's shawl, and lent her hers—M'Carthy was afterwards brought back to that house, and she asked Graham where the suit of clothes was that had been in the bundle—Graham denied that they had been in it.</p>

I went into the Magpye Alehouse, just by, and calling for a Pint of Ale and Gin, I filled my Pipe and smoked, and pulled my Snuff-Box out of my Pocket. Said I to my Landlady, I believe you are a Welsh-woman. This Woman, (the Prisoner) sat by me, I gave her my Box to take a Pinch of Snuff, she return'd it, and I put it up in my Breeches Pocket; when I had paid my Reckoning I went out to the Door, and the Prisoner at the Bar came to me and took me by the Arm, and walked with me over Clerkenwell-Green towards St. John's Wall. I put my Left Hand about her Neck, and gave her a Kiss; while my Left Hand was round her Neck, her Right Hand was in my Pocket; I presently missed my Box, but away she ran, and I said give me my Box. She d - n'd me and said, touch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174601170006"></xptr> me if you dare; which I was afraid to do, as she might have some Accomplices. I said, I will never leave you till I bring you to Justice. When I got her into St. John's-Street, there I was inform'd of an Officer. It wanted but a Quarter of an Hour of Nine o'Clock before I could get it settled. After she had been charged about an Hour, she walked out under a Pretence to find my Box; she sent a Watchman to fetch her Landlady; who answer'd, what is the Matter? I'll be hang'd if she has not picked the Gentleman's Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. So, you lost your Box?</p>
               <p>Rutter. Yes, she did her Work very quick.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not find her Hand in your Pocket?</p>
               <p>Rutter. I felt her Hand, and then follow'd her, and said, I would not leave her till I had my Box again.</p>

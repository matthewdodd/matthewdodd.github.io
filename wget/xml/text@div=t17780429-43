They had cutlasses, or pistols, or something of that sort, in their hands, and a dark lanthorn slipped half over the light. The first that came into the room, pushed me down in the bed, and covered me up; they told me to lie still, or else they would shoot me. They covered the rest up in bed; I could not see them, but I heard them cover them up. They asked my fellow-servant his name; he told them it was

               <p>I am the son of the prosecutor, who is a farmer at Finchley. On Sunday night, the 1st of March, between twelve and one o'clock, I heard a terrible noise; I got up in my bed directly; my room door stood open; it generally stands open all night; three men came in at first; the first of them I have never seen since; the second man that I saw I think was Fryer; I believe he was one of the three; then there was one came up to the farther side of the bed, who flung the clothes over my head, and struck me across the back with something that I took to be a little iron bar; then two of them went out of the room into another room, where my father lay, and some went into all the rooms on that floor; two of them came back again, and told me I must get out of bed, which I did; they made me hold my hands over my eyes all the while they took me into my father's room, and I went to bed to him; I lay about half an hour, while they rifled my room.</p>

               <p>Did any of the people stay in the room with you? - Yes; I believe two were in the room all the while; there were three in the room afterwards; one of them bid me go to bed again; they said, I need not hold my hand over my eyes, for there was nobody in the room they were afraid of my seeing. I went into the room, and turning myself to get into bed, I saw one between my father's room door and mine, which I believe to be Fryer. They had several lights; he had a red and white handkerchief over his eyes; sometimes he twisted it on one side, and I could then see part of his face; he was just about the size of Fryer, and had such a coloured great coat on as I have now.</p>

               <p>How many lights were there? - Three or four. The first, I believe, was a large candle, at the end of a stick; they were all candles, I believe; I did not see any lanthorn. I believe Horner was one of the persons that came in afterwards; they came to take my breeches from under my pillow; they had before taken my watch out of my pocket, and laid it in the chair by my bed side; one came in, which I believe was Horner, after I was in my own bed again, and said, if I would tell where all the money was, he would not take my watch; but I afterwards looked, and the watch was gone. In about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after they left the house, I came down and found the stair-foot door fastened up; they had drove a staple in over the latch. The servants and I broke it open; we found all the other doors open; there were the marks of instruments which had been made use of to open the doors. They got in at the back door, which was bolted and barred, I believe; the staple of the bolt was wrenched out, and lay at a distance from the door. They took away money, and plate, and a watch, and about thirteen or fourteen guineas of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290038"></xptr> mine, and a 30 l. and 20 l. bank note. There was a silver cup and silver pint mug taken, and several other things, (but I don't rightly know how many of the drawers were broke open) and some boxes opened, and the things taken out.</p>

I was alarmed on Sunday the 1st of March; I lie on the first floor; hearing a noise I got out of bed, and went to the top of the stairs, and saw three men come up stairs; I saw a pistol in the hands of one of them, and a little dark lanthorn; it gave a light; I called out to the men servants up stairs, and then went back into my room.</p>

               <p>Did any body sleep in the room with you? - Yes; my mistress. I observed Condon; I know him to be one of the men; they came up together side by side; they went up stairs; they did not come into my room. Condon said, If I made any noise, he would blow my brains out.</p>

               <p>Did you take so much notice of his face as to be certain that he is the man? - I am sure of it, he had the pistol; the man in the middle had the light; he had his own hair tied up behind.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you speak with certainty? - It is with certainty; I am very positive they are the men.</p>

               <p>Did either of them speak? - Yes; Condon spoke a great deal.</p>

               <p>Who was the man that struck Quick? - I cannot positively say which it was. Fryer was dressed in a brown coat, of a sort of French fashion; he had a bit of a linen handkerchief over his forehead, and his hair hung down over it.</p>

               <p>Did not the handkerchief hinder your seeing his features? - Not in the least; it was but a little bit of a thing; they are certainly the men.</p>

               <p>I work at Finchley. On fast day, which was before the Sunday that Mr. Clewin was robbed, I saw Fryer at one Mrs. Clary's, near Finchley church; he asked if a Mr. Clewin, a farmer, lived there; I said yes. He asked me what circumstances he was in? I said, I believe a pretty big one. He asked about his maid servant, and said he believed she had a brother who died and left her a trifle of money and a gold ring.</p>

               <p>On his cross-examination he said the prisoner was dressed that night the same as he was then; that his hair was clubbed behind, but that he did not know how it was before, because he believed he had not his hat off; that he believed that he sometimes used to wear his hair combed back, and sometimes with a toopee.</p>

On the 19th of June the prisoner came to buy some leather - he went up stairs, and selected two pieces; he brought down one piece to me, and asked the price - I said the price was marked on it; he said it was 3s. - before he came down one of my men had come down, and said they had suspicion of him; I sent up to know the price of the leather - the prisoner said he would go up too, and he did go; I sent for a constable, and these two pieces of leather were found, one in his hat, and one in his pocket - the one in his hand he was going to pay for.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Gibletts. The prisoner came up stairs to buy some leather; I watched him, and saw him put this piece in his coat-pocket - I then saw the person who served him cut this piece, which he took down in his hand; I did not see the third piece - I told my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Then you did not see the third piece? A. No - it is usual to mark the leather up stairs, that the person below may know what to charge; I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160033"></xptr>not state I saw him take this piece out of his hat and put it into his pocket - he took it off the place where the man cut it; this other piece he took out of his hat - he has come to the shop these twelvemonths; I know this to be my master's, by his taking it from the place where it was cut, and putting it into his pocket.</p>

            . I attend the cutting-room. The prisoner came and asked me to cut a pair of patent leaders, and then got me to change two pieces which he had had before - he said I need not tell the master; I said No- they are about the same price; he then wanted two strips of harness leather - I took a hide from behind me, and run out these two strips; he rolled them up separately - I took one of them, and marked 7s. on it, as it is my place to mark on it what I think it is worth; the customer goes down and pays the master; he took them down with him - this third piece I did not sell him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Will you swear this third piece is your master's? A. I cannot, with a clear conscience; it is a great deal like my cutting - there were between forty and fifty of them there; there are other leathersellers not far off - he ordered these two pieces of me; he might have carried them off without my detecting him as he took them down stairs - if my master had asked me I should have accounted to him for two pieces.</p>
               <p>MR. GIBLETT. The prisoner produced to me one piece and said it was 3s.; I said, "Let me see the mark" - he became alarmed, and said, "I will go up;" my brother sent a man up with him, and the man who saw him put one piece into his pocket, saw him take this piece from his hat - I asked him if he had any more; he said, with an oath, he had not - to the best of my belief, this piece, which was in his pocket, belongs to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You did not cut it? A. No - I will not swear that I should have known it if it was off my premises.</p>

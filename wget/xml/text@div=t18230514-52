            . I live in Silver-street, opposite to Butcher. I saw the prisoner lurking about the house for five or ten minutes, about half past seven o'clock that morning; I watched him; another person was with him, who looked very hard at me. The prisoner stooped down towards the key-hole of the prosecutor's door, and went away very hastily as if something interrupted him; the door was shut then. I went into the parlour, so that they could not see me, and directly I was gone in he returned to the door, and opened it, and went in; I could not see what he opened it with; when he was in, he beckoned with his finger to a man who was on the opposite side of the street; he went across to him, placed his back against the door, and kept it open. I saw the prisoner put a roll of carpet in front of the window by the side of the door, and during the time of his going from the window, a little boy went into the passage to go to his work; I then saw the man who stood at the door leave it and come across the road, and go down the street; the prisoner then came out with the roll of carpet on his shoulder, and went in a direction for Golden-square. I went over, and asked if they had sent anything away, but the servants were so long answering me, that I could not overtake them. I saw no more of him till the Saturday morning, when he and another man, (not the same as before) came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140022"></xptr>to the same spot - he had been in my sight on the Thursday for quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. I secured him with the assistance of the square-keeper. I am certain of his person. He opened the door as easy as if he had a proper key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You could not tell how it was opened - A. No; I am sure it was shut. I saw the milkman go away three minutes before. I often joke with the servant, and had been at the door with her that morning. I am positive the prisoner opened the door; he stooped, and put his hand to the key hole. I observed his face before he went in; he was dressed in a black coat, and blue pantaloons - I could swear to him among a thousand.</p>

            . (This witness was nine years old, but appeared fully to understand the obligation of an oath.) On Thursday morning I went to work at Mr. Butcher's - there were two gentlemen in the hall - I was going to ring the bell; but they let me in. The prisoner is one of them - I do not recollect how he was dressed. I saw him at the office on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not remember his dress - A. I know he had new blue trowsers, a blue coat, and blue buttons, and a broach in his handkerchief. His coat was not black.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said you did not recollect how he was dressed - A. I have thought of it now.</p>

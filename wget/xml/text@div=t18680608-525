                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Walham Green—on 22nd May, about 7 o'clock, I saw the child's body at the police-station, Walham Green—it was tied up first in newspapers and then two or three linen or calico wrappers—a thick cloth was completely round the head or over the head and face, and tied under the neck so tightly in two or three knots that I had some difficulty in undoing it—the nose was pressed down flat to the face by the pressure of the cloth—there were several pins, to keep it closer I presume, and in two or three places the cloth was stitched; it was stitched all over the body, and on the head and face as well—the tongue and eyes were protruding, the lips were swollen, the nostrils compressed, and there was bloody fluid issuing from the mouth, which had stained the cloth; the neck was discolored where the cloth had pressed; the fingers were drawn in and pressed on the palms, and the nails were discoloured and black—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination at the workhouse, but found no evidence of disease—the age was from two to twelve months—the brain was very much congested, and the vessels of the brain in the same way—the lungs were collapsed—suffoca<lb></lb>tion, such as would be caused by these wrappers, was the cause of death—it had been dead about two days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there any doubt that suffocation was the cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have no doubt of it—there was merely one opening in the bandage when I saw it, as if made with a knife, which the gardener explained by saying that he cut a little slit to see what it was—I do not think the flattening of the nose could have been caused by a fall, because the cloth was so tight on the face—I will not say that it is impossible—it is possible</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186806080035"></xptr>
               <p>that it might have been caused by the woman carrying the child falling on it, or laying on it—I should say that a fall would not produce what I saw unless it had fallen on its nose and remained so for some time, and that would not account for the suffocation, because a child of twelve months old would have strength enough to move—I have no doubt that the same cause which produced the flattening of the nose caused suffocation—compression by a cloth or any other means would produce it—it did not seem a well-nourished child, the limbs were thin and the abdomen inflated—I should say that it was a delicate child, certainly.</p>

I am the wife of James Stokes, of 11, Sladeburn Street, Chelsea—some time in April, I cannot recollect the day, the prisoner brought a child to my house, which she called William, and told me he was eleven months and a fortnight old—I made an arrangement with her to keep the child at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, a week—she paid me two weeks—on 13th May I went to her at Mrs. Biddecomb's and asked her why she had not been to see the baby—she said that she came on Sunday but I had moved away—I said that she might have asked a friend of mine" where I had gone—she said that she would come on the Sunday—I said that he was very weakly and I wanted a trifle more to keep him—she came on Monday, the 18th, and said that she had been talking to a friend of her's about Willy, who advised her to take him to an old doctor of her's to see if he would ever be stronger on his leg—I said, "There is no occasion for that, for I have taken him to a doctor myself, and have got a powder for him and some castor oil"—she said that she would come on Tuesday, but she did not—she came on Wednesday evening, the 20th, between 8 and 9—the child was then undressed ready to be put to bed—she said, "I have come for Willy"—I wanted to know where she was going to take him—she said that she had got a situation where the mistress had a family of her own, and had given her consent to take the child there—I begged of her not to take him that night, because I was afraid he would catch cold, as he was undressed—she said that she must take him to-night, She could not come again—I said "Well, he must be dressed"—she said, "Do not dress him, roll him up in some old shawl, or I shall have the trouble of undressing him again"—I said, "I must dress him, or the poor little fellow will catch cold, and I put on him a linen shirt, a pair of white shocks, a pair of shoes, a flannel petticoat, a white petticoat, a grey petticoat, a pelisse and cape, and a black hat with blue strings; and I gave her a clean spotted pinafore for him, which she put into her pocket for the next day—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the articles—I said, "Wherever you take him I hope you will be have kind to him"—she said, "I will"—I saw the child dead on the 22nd, at the workhouse.</p>

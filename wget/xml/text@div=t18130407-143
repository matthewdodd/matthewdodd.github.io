On the 8th of March, about half after eleven at night, the prisoner went into my house; he called for a glass of porter, and was served with it. After he drank it I stood with the door in my hand to let him out. He snatched the watch out of my pocket, and ran off. I pursued him, and called stop thief. The watchman stopped him, and took him to the watch-house. I am sure he is the same person. I had seen him several times before at my house.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BARKER. I am a patrol. The watchman brought the prisoner to me. I took him to the watchhouse. He called me of one side, and told me where to find the watch. The watch was about thirty yards from the watchhouse, in the kennel, and there I found it. I then took it to Mr. Price. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Since I have pleaded not guilty, I have considered my situation. I am determined not to insult my maker nor the court. I joined the company of those which I thought to be my friends. I therefore implore the mercy of the court to send me as a marine, and it shall be the constant study of my life to be a useful member of society.</p>

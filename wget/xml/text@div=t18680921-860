                  </hi>. I live at 3, Prospect Place, Rotherhithe, and am a hairdresser—on 19th August, about ten minutes before midnight, I met Wheatley in Hen and Chicken Lane—I knew him before, by sight only—I went with him to the Bedford Arms, and had part of a pint of beer—we then went to the Castle and had a pint of porter, then to the King's Arms, I believe, where we had some more porter; previous to going into the third public-house, I said, "I wish I could get a lodging"—he said, "You can come and sleep with me"—I said, "No, I shall sleep by myself"—he said, "There is a coffee-shop here;" we found it closed, and I said, "I will give you a pint more beer for your trouble"—when we came out of the King's Arms, I was going to my own home, we walked and talked, and I said, "Now I will bid you good night," and made an attempt to cross the road; I got a</p>

I could neither speak nor see—Mr. Bridgman came up, and they all three ran away.</p>

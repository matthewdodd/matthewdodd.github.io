I looked for it on the ground, but it was not there - Saunders held the lemons up almost close to my eyes - I had seen Lyons with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is your sight not defective, Sir? A. Yes; I missed it directly they were gone; nobody else had come against me - it was in my waistcoat pocket - it was safe a few minutes before - nobody came near me but them. I advertised it as lost, and offered 15l. reward for it.</p>

            . I am a confectioner, and live in Petticoat-lane. On the 11th of July, about seven o'clock I saw Lyons give a watch into the hands of Henry Levy; he looked at it, went into his house, and returned with some sovereigns, which he gave into the hands of Saunders - they then all three went into a public-house, at the corner of Arrow-alley, Petticoat-lane. I heard some silver ringing - I went to Taylor's house, but he was out; and at night I saw him and gave him information.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you known Taylor long? A. Yes; I knew he was at Aldgate watch-house - I was never locked up there; I have sometimes been out late, and Taylor let me in there; that is not once in a year - I do not go by the name of Tyo; they call my brother so. I work for my brother - I knew the prisoners by sight - I knew nothing of a reward till afterwards; I expect nothing - I do it for the good of my country - Levy lives at No. 1, Petticoat-square.</p>

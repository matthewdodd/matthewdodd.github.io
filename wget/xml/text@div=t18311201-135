I went to Cranston's dwelling-house - Cranston was not at home; he was at his shop, which is about a hundred and fifty yards from his house - I went there, and saw Cranston in the counting-house at the shop; I asked if he had had some yarn brought there that morning - he said Yes, in the name of Thompson, and it was to be made up into points, or something of that kind, and it was so expressed in the note; I asked who Thompson was- he said he did not know, nor where he lived, but when it was done, he supposed he would come and fetch it away - I then said I had stopped that boy with some yarn that morning, and he had told me it came from Mr. Robertson's; I was then speaking of a boy who was in the shop at the time, similarly dressed to the boy I had stopped, and I thought it was him; Cranston then said he had spoken to Faulkner on Saturday night, and that the yarn came from Mr. Robertson's - Mr. Robertson, who was with me, then desired me to take Cranston and the boy into custody, and I did so; there was only the pad of new yarn in the counting-house - Cranston said the other pad was at his dwelling-house; we went, and found it there - I then took Cranston and the boy to the station-house, and went to Mr. Robertson's, where we found Faulkner getting his breakfast; Mr. Robertson questioned him whether he had sent any yarn away that morning - he said he had not sent any away, except two coils of rope, which went by a cart to some boat; Mr. Robertson said, "Here is a Policeman, who has stopped a boy with some yarn this morning, and he rather suspects it came from here;" he said he had not sent any thing away - I then asked if he had not sent any to Cranston's; he said No - I asked if he had made any arrangement or seen Cranston on Saturday evening; he said No, he had not seen him - I then left him with Mr. Robertson, and went away; I went to the station-house again, and found Faulkner there - Mr. Robertson came there soon after; I went with Cranston to Mr. Robertson's, and Mr. Robertson called all his men and boys down - Cranston said none of them had brought the yarn to him; Swansbury was the last boy that came down - Cranston looked at him, and said he was not the boy who brought it; I said he resembled the other boy, and they were so much alike that I could not swear which was the boy, nor can I now; it was a dark morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had you (Anderson) the boy you took into the counting-house, in custody? A. I could not swear to the boy - I told the Magistrate so; I never said positively he was the boy - I could not see his features; the yarn was so much over his face - I spoke from his dress; I said, at Cranston's place, that he was the boy - that boy was in custody, I suppose, three or four hours; Swansbury had a hairy cap on, and a fustian jacket and trousers; the boy I met had the same; he was stooping at the time,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183112010075"></xptr>but his hairy cap came through the yarn - I will not swear that the boy did not tell me that Faulkner had sent the yarn to be done for a Mr. Thompson; he might say so - this new yarn was laying just on the left-hand side at Cranston's counting-house, and the other in a back wash-house at his dwelling-house.</p>

The Policeman came to my house, and I went to Cranston's dwelling-house - I heard he was down at his shop, which is a marine-store shop, and he has a yard, where he makes up spun-yarn - this pad of new yarn was laying in the shop; the Policeman said, "This is part of the yarn which I stopped the boy with;" Cranston and Anderson were then in the shop - I said to Cranston, "Where is the other?" and said it was an infamous transaction - Cranston said, "You need not make a bother about it, I had it from your foreman;" the Policeman said, "This boy (meaning Anderson) exactly resembles the boy I stopped, in dress and appearance" - Anderson said, "You know, master, I am not the boy;" and began to cry - Cranston said the other pad of yarn was at his dwelling-house; we went there and found this - I had property of this description on my premises, and this new yarn, to the best of my belief, came from my premises - I had yarn of the same description as this old- Cranston and Anderson were then taken to the station; I went with Cranston and the Policeman to my premises, and what the Policeman has stated is correct - Faulkner distinctly stated that no yarn had gone from my premises - I went down to the station-house with Faulkner, and Cranston said, "You know, Mr. Faulkner, I saw you on Saturday night, and I told you I wanted some yarn: you agreed to send me some" - Faulkner replied, "That I deny, it is no such thing:" I showed all my men and boys to Cranston, and I pointed out Swansbury to him in particular - he said he was not the boy who brought the yarn; Cranston had before told me that the boy, who brought the yarn, was on my premises - I had some communication from Swansbury the day the prisoners were examined, in the morning at breakfast time; he was then taken, and examined before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How many examinations were there? A. Two; the first on the 21st of November, and the next on the Thursday following - it was on the second examination that Anderson was let go; Faulkner can write - when I went to Cranston's house I asked Mrs. Cranston for the note, which the boy had shown to the Policeman, and I believe she gave it into the Policeman's hands - the Policeman gave it into my hands; I did not know the hand-writing; Cranston does not spin yarn like this - he lives about a quarter of a mile from me; he said the boy, who took the yarn to him, worked for me, and he thought he could point him out -I took him there for that purpose.</p>

            . I was in the service of Mr. Robertson. On the morning in question some yarn was pointed out to me, and I took it, but I cannot swear whether it was Faulkner pointed it out to me - it was dark in the morning; I carried the yarn from Mr. Robertson's premises, but I cannot say who I received it from - Faulkner was there, but I cannot swear whether any one else was.</p>
               <p>Q.You know you were examined before a Magistrate; what you then said was taken down, and my Lord has it, mind what you are about; what did you do with the yarn? A. I took it to Cranston's house, as I was ordered by the foreman, to the best of my knowledge - there was a note on the yarn, and I suppose the foreman put it there; when I got to Cranston's I saw a man in his night-clothes, who took it in of me, but I cannot say who it was - I believe it was Cranston; I was stopped by the Policeman, as I went there; I showed him that note, and he let me go on- I was called with the other boys and men for Cranston to see me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you put down the yarn when the Policeman spoke to you? A. No, Sir; it was on my two shoulders - I did not look up in the officer's face; the note was in my pocket - my head was not through the yarn; it was dark in the morning - I gave the note to the person I saw at Cranston's, and then went to my work; I saw Anderson on the Monday - I do not know whether he is younger than I am; I had fustian trousers on that morning, and a baragan jacket - I do not know whether Anderson was pitted with the small-pox; there was no disguise about the person who took the yarn of me.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What is the difference between a baragan jacket and a fustian? A. It is thicker, but they are the same colour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What did you say when you gave in the note? A. I told the man who took the yarn in, that I had been stopped by the Policeman, and I had shown him the note - I believe the man I saw was Cranston; I had never been there before - I saw Cranston the same morning; I had never seen him before - I knew the house he lived at, by the same party who gave me the yarn directing me there; I cannot swear who that party was, it was very dark - I have worked for Mr. Robertson three years; I thought by the voice the person who gave me this yarn was the foreman - I know what I carried was yarn, and that there were two bundles of it; the person who gave me the yarn told me to go up Limehouse-causeway, and then across Spread Eagle-street, and to take it to Cranston's house; it was the first job I had that morning - I cannot swear whether there was any more than one person present when I received the yarn; I cannot swear who it was gave it me.</p>
               <p>Faulkner's Defence. I never sent any thing out of the premises of Mr. Robertson in my life, unless it was by his orders; he can testify that himself.</p>

               <p>Who came away with you? - My daughter and four other small children; I sent the four small children to town first, my daughter and I left the house about four o'clock; when we left the house, the doors and windows were all as secure as they possibly could be made; the windows were secured with iron bars, and had iron plates on the inside of the shutters. I heard it was broke open on the 7th of January. I sent my daughter to the house on the 4th, when she returned she said that every thing was safe. I went down on the 7th, and found the shutters of the window that looks into the garden broke all to pieces, both inside and out; the iron bar that fastens the window was broke. I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) they were all safe when I left the house on the 24th of December. I was informed a woman was stopped with some of our chairs upon her. I saw the prisoner at a publick-house in Shoreditch, and went with her before Justice Wilmot.</p>

               <p>I keep a chandler's-shop at Kingstand, rather more than a hundred yards, from the prosecutor's house; as they dealt with me and the house had been broken open twice before, I made it my business to go now and then and look at the house. I went and looked at the house on the 6th of January, between four and five o'clock, all the doors and windows appeared then to be fast.</p>
               <p>Could you see the window that looks into the garden? - No, I could not, because the garden gate was shut. Between three and four o'clock, on that day I had seen the prisoner and two other women go by; I looked after them and saw them take particular notice of this house. About half after seven o'clock in the morning of the 7th, as I was opening my shop, I saw a man and woman coming with some goods about a hundred yards off; presently after I saw the prisoner come by with two chairs; when I had fastened my shutters back, I walked down to Mr. Allen's house and met the prisoner coming out of the gate with two chairs; I let her pass me, and then went into a field and round to the back door and found it was fast, I got over a ditch and pushed the gate that goes into the yard, and found it was broke open, the back window was broke all to pieces, and the iron plate bent; I immediately followed the prisoner; and between my house and the gentleman's which was broke open, I met a man, and asked him to assist me to take a person that had broke a house open; he went on before and took her on the other side of Shoreditch turnpike, and stopped her till I came up; when I came up to them she had one of the chairs upon her head, and the man had the other; she asked me if they were mine; I said no, but I would keep her in custody till I sent for the gentleman whose house they had been taken from.</p>

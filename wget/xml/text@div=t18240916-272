            , he came on a visit by the invitation of Mr. Askew; I am quite certain Mr. Askew invited him. Those letters are Mr. Askew's writing (looking at them) I know his writing very well; indeed when Mr. Bertrand came, in the latter end of April, or beginning of May, 1824, he placed some money, and some French Billet Banques of the Royal Bank in my hands. I went to Cheltenham on the 4th of July; the prisoner and I were then on very good terms. I did not take all my property to Cheltenham; I left the bills in my chest of drawers in the bedroom; they were in a piece of whitey-brown paper, together with this letter, which is from a nobleman. I know a gentleman of the name of Hubert, but I never told him the signature of this letter before he saw it. I also left all the property stated in the indictment. (enumerating them.) Mr. Bertrand had put the promissory notes into my possession, to take care of. All the jewellery was given to me, but two rings, which I bought. I went to Cheltenham on the 4th of July, and received all these letters from Mr. Askew. I remained on good terms with him until about the beginning of August, when a disagreement began, of which jealousy was the cause. I received a gold watch from Mr. Askew, as a present, a fortnight before he had me arrested; he arrested me on Saturday, the 14th of August, for the money I had received for him at Cheltenham, which amounted to 55 l. he at that time owed me about 70 l. I gave the 55 l. and 10 l. to gentleman who arrested me. Mr. Askew came down to Cheltenham, and caused me to be arrested himself. He turned me out of the house on Saturday evening; he signed a paper before I went out of the house; this is the paper (looking at it.) It was signed at the desire of my attorney at Cheltenham.

             J Askew." At the time he signed this paper, he owed me 70 l., which he has never paid me. I returned to London on Monday, and made application for my property to Mr. Askew, with a witness - (Mr. Hutchings,) but I never got it. When I went to Cheltenham, I left my drawers locked; I left an inventory of some things, but not all: this is it - it was written by Mr. Bertrand before I left Paris. In consequence of this refusal to give me my property, I sent Mr. Hubert for my property; Mr. Askew said,</p>
               <p>"I have no objection to deliver to you your clothes, which are in the drawers, but not the bedstead and chest of drawers;" he said my clothes, were a few stockings and a few shifts, which I should have, but the furniture was not mine. I went a second time with Mr. Hubert, about three weeks after. Mr. Askew then said he would not deliver anything without his attorney; he did not deliver anything then to me. About a week after that, part of my property was brought by Mr. Hubert - a pair of diamond ear-rings, some stockings, and a few dresses, but no shifts. I had no other jewellery; the earrings were in the inventory; they are worth about 5 or 6 l. I was not present at the opening of my drawers. Before Mr. Hubert went to Mr. Askew's, I described to him something that was in my drawers; I told him there was a letter from a nobleman; I did not mention the inventory, I did not know that it was there; I received these ear-rings on the Saturday, about six o'clock in the evening, and made the complaint on Monday. I went to the magistrate with Bertrand; the magistrate decided the cause at the second sitting; my attorney was there and counsel, and Mr. Askew had advice likewise. When Mr. Hubert brought this property, I did not tell him that was all that I had left; I was very much hurt; I have never got my property; I am sure I left the bank-bills wrapt up in a paper with this nobleman's letter; I gave Mr. 
               <persName id="t18240916-272-person2321">Hubert</persName>
             an inventory of my property as well as I could make it out; part of it is written by myself, and part by Bertrand; this is it (looking at it.)</p>

            . He desired me to direct to him as His Excellency. I never heard him called by any other title but Excellence or General. I did not bring all these things from Paris: Bertrand brought some things. The clothes were not all included in the inventory which Bertrand made out in Paris; there are some things in Paris still. Bertrand brought me 29 shifts from Paris, a black silk dress, and some jewellery; the comb, the cross, and the small chain, the opera glass, the three spoons and three forks, another gold chain which I now have, and some other things which I cannot recollect: that is not all the linen and clothes he brought over; he brought over a lace veil. I never made an inventory of the things he brought over. I lived at No. 4, Rue de Grenelle, at Paris, when the prisoner came and engaged me. This letter is Mr. Bertrand's hand-writing (looking at it;), the direction is his writing.

            ; she was brought by Mr. Askew as a witness. That letter has never been in my drawer. This is also Bertrand's writing;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160106"></xptr>it is a declaration to Mr. Abraham, an attorney, who lives in the City, near Temple Bar. He told me he had written it; I was close by him when he wrote it, but it was not by my direction; he did not read it to me. I saw Mr. Abraham several times with him; I don't recollect that I ever read it or saw it till now; I swear that; I don't recollect hearing it read; I don't know when it was written; it was written since my return from Cheltenham: I think it was before I employed Mr. Hubert. I had been con sulting Mr. Abraham about Mr. Askew's not delivering to me my chest of drawers and all the furniture of my bed-room. I went to Mr. Abraham before I employed Mr. Hubert. I don't know whether this paper was written to Mr. Abraham as instructions what he was to do; there is no part of my writing on the outside of that paper. I applied to Mr. Abraham perhaps about a fortnight before I went to Mr. Hubert, to whom I was recommended by the French Consul. I never mentioned to any one about the 9500 francs as being too much for me to lose: I mentioned it to Mr. Hubert when I begged him to apply for it. I never mentioned to Mr. Abraham or his clerk the particular things that were in the drawers. Mr. Abraham gave me an order to fetch my things from Mr. Askew, but not the jewellery: he was not employed for the jewellery, but for my agreement and the furniture of my bed-room. I may have told him about the jewellery, but as I expected to get the furniture, I thought I should get that. I don't recollect that I told him about it. I told him of a bill which I had paid Mr. Askew for my furniture. I don't recollect whether Mr. Abraham asked me for particulars, that he might make a demand; I can't swear it. This is the list I made out for Mr. Hubert to make the demand; part is my writing and part Bertrand's Mr. Bertrand lived in the Rue de Grenelle, No. 39; he is no relation of mine; he was a grocer; I have called him my brother by the order of Mr. Askew. Mr. Askew told me so in the carriage from Paris to London. Bertrand was not coming to England then, but he was invited to England by Askew. Mr. Askew gave me a particular reason for calling Bertrand my brother; I used to write to him very often: Mr. Askew desired me to call Bertrand my brother, for the reputation of his house, after Bertrand arrived in London, but not before; I said so at the Police Office; but the first time he told me to call him my brother was in the carriage. He then gave me no reason at all for it. I had never called Bertrand my brother before I came to London, but always spoke of him as such at Mr. Askew's. Mr. Askew told me in Bertrand's shop,</p>
               <p>"My desire is to make you happy when you come to London, and Bertrand will be there by and by." Bertrand gave me the Billet de Banque in the beginning of May; he brought them with his own things in his trunk, which was locked: it was kept in my bed-room, and I always had the keys; there were two locks, one was a padlock. Bertrand had been in London but a few days when he gave me the Billet de Banque; I was in my bed-room when he gave them to me out of his pocket-book to keep for him. Mrs. Hudson saw them one morning, and Bertrand came in and scolded me for it; that was about a month before I went to Cheltenham. Bertrand had some French and English gold beside. He never borrowed any money from me or any body to my knowledge. He had some bills which were not Billet de Banque, and I think he had some other Billet de Banque; he gave me more, and he used to go to the drawer, and take out what he wanted. I will not swear that I have seen him with any other Billet de Banque; I do not recollect when Bertrand came to England. He used to sleep in a warehouse at Mr. Askew's house; he removed from there about three weeks before I went to Cheltenham; he went to live in Berwick-street, at Mrs. Broadfoot's; Mrs. Askew took the lodging for him. I have sent him sometimes little different things, when he used to give me the money; Mr. Askew gave me permission to do so; he had a quarrel with Bertrand before I went to Cheltenham, and Mr. Askew forbade him the house, but gave me permission to send him some victuals; after I was at Cheltenham, Askew told me that he continued to send him things, and wrote so to me. He continued to lodge at Mrs. Broadfoot's, and I lodged there on my return from Cheltenham. Mrs. Broadfoot had never turned him away up to the time I left London for Cheltenham. Although Bertrand was not in the house, I continued to supply him with provisions, but not at Askew's expence: Bertrand paid very dear for it; the Billet de Banque were left in my possession because he went into furnished lodgings, and they are not always very safe. I told Bertrand on the Saturday evening, that I should bring them to him on Sunday morning before I went to Cheltenham, but did not, because we went too early - myself and two young ladies. I went on Sunday morning; I knew that I was going on the Thursday; Mr. Askew had before desired me to go, but I always refused, and even on Saturday night, when my box was packed up, I had not agreed to go. On the Thursday, or the day before, Mr. Askew returned from Cheltenham, and said he had taken a house, and he hoped I would go to oblige him, but I had not agreed to go; I was very cross with him on Saturday night; I had been to Bertrand, and promised to give him his billet de banque on Sunday morning; I saw him between ten and eleven o'clock at night; he lives but a little way from Mr. Askew, who lives at No. 85, Oxford-street, nearly opposite the Pantheon. Mr. Askew went to Bertrand for him to come again, and persuade me to go to Cheltenham; he had before talked of taking a house in the country, and wanted Bertrand to go and keep it for him; I did not, upon my oath, see Bertrand on the Sunday morning, before I set off; I went at six o'clock, and it was a wet morning, which was the only reason I did not give him the Billet de Banque; I had to dress myself and to breakfast, I never left any direction with Bertrand to go and take any of these things. I never took any account or number of these bills - it is not the custom in France. There were some of them like this one, but I cannot tell whether they are all alike; I did not look at them particularly. I did not take many white stockings to Cheltenham; I took five or six pair, and was obliged to buy some there. Mr. Askew told me not to take much with me, because unless it pleased me, I need not stay there. I did not take even a white dress; I was obliged to buy some. I did not write to Mr. Askew for any of my things; I was afraid to give up my key, because I had some money and some jewellery there. Some people<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160107"></xptr>have seen my jewellery; I have worn the ring bearing the portrait of the Emperor of Russia, but I do not know whether any body saw it. I had another ring of somebody else. I never wore any diamonds since Mr. Duland was here; I would not dress myself like a lady to be in the showroom; Miss Hudson saw some of my jewellery in my drawer; I may have taken her to show it her, but I do not recollect. I had a coral neck-lace, but I never said or swore that it was one of the things that was taken from me. I have said, that Bertrand had some other Billet de Banque and some gold. I live now in Berwick-street, at Mrs. Broadfoot's house. I never told Mrs. Broadfoot that I was married to Bertrand; but she is a woman to swear that which is untrue, because she is paid for it: I know it, a man told me so; I do not know his name, but it was the man that arrested us for the lodging; it was a distress, and my attorney has been kind enough to pay, because Mr. Askew has taken my all. The day Mr. Askew was taken to the Office, Mrs. Broadfoot's young boy was there, and said all manner of things. The man said that he saw another man who came to Mrs. Broadfoot's house, and spoke to Mrs. Broadfoot, and she said she would swear anything against me. Mrs. Broadfoot's son said he got 5 s. and his mother 5 s. and their victuals, and a coach to fetch them, and so they would swear any thing, and that is the truth. Mrs. Broadfoot never asked for her rent until Mr. Askew was arrested; that was in the presence of Bertrand; it is since Mr. Askew went to Newgate. I have not told her upon any occasion that I had 15 l. in my drawer at Askews, and with that I would pay her; but when we came from Cheltenham, Mr. Bertrand said, we have no money, but if she would be kind enough to let us into her house, we would pay her in November, or when we got our furniture and things from Mr. Askew's. When Mr. Askew had refused to deliver my things, I have said</p>
               <p>"That is 15 l. out of my pocket;" because Mr. Askew had not delivered to me my furniture, which was worth 15 l.; I paid for it, and have got my receipt. I have said to Mrs. Broadfoot</p>
               <p>"I will pay you with 65 l. which is in the hands of a man at Cheltenham." I had a letter from Mr. Askew, communicating the contents of this French letter, and I was afraid of it; it was not a long time before he was arrested; it was before I sent Mr. Hubert to demand my goods, but after I applied to Mr. Abrahams. The night that I came from the Office, I saw Mrs. Broadfoot at her house; it was on the 15th of September Mr. Askew was committed; I saw her every night. I never said,</p>
               <p>"I will have my revenge; I will hang him," though he has robbed me, it is not my wish to hang him. I never said to her,</p>

               <p>"Askew has gone to Newgate; I will have my revenge! I will have his life!" Mrs. Broadfoot did not say,</p>
               <p>"Stop, stop, not so fast! he is not tried yet." I know Mr. Unit, but I never told him that Bertrand had brought over 2,000 francs only, and had changed them at a shop in Regent-street; but I told Unit, to prove that Bertrand had brought some money with him, that I myself had changed 200 francs for him in St. James's-street. Bertrand never told him that he had brought over 2,000 francs only; but he told him, in my presence, about the 200 francs. I did not tell Unit that the produce of these 200 or 2,000 francs was locked up in my drawer at Mr. Askew's, nor did Bertrand; but I said I had exchanged 200 francs about three weeks ago. Mr. Askew said, his reason for forbidding Bertrand his house was, because Bertrand was my friend, and it was on account of jealousy. I had none of the jewellery at Cheltenham.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You said to Mr. Adolphus that you had lost 15 l. through not having the furniture; is this the receipt for it? - (Looking at it) Yes. I told Mrs. Broadfoot, after I had a letter from Mr. Askew, that I would pay her in November, with the 65 l. in the Sheriff's hands at Cheltenham. The letter from Mr. Askew is not signed, but his own servant brought it; here is a translation of the French letter. I went to Cheltenham in July; Mr. Askew and I had quarrelled. Bertrand was then receiving things from Mr. Askew; he was still trying, notwithstanding the quarrel, to get 
               <persName id="t18240916-272-person2324">Bertrand</persName>
             a situation. In July, when I went to Cheltenham, I had but one key to my drawers, and I took it with me. I am sure I left the bills and jewellery in the drawers. When I was with Bertrand on Saturday night I did not know I was to go so early as six; Askew never told me the hour. Mr. Abraham never got me any thing, and then the French Consul recommended me to Mr. Hubert, and I employed him. Some of the jewellery was not in the inventory in the drawer; it was only of the things I brought with me to London. I heard the Russian gentleman called His Excellence, and that is why I called him a Nobleman. When I was travelling in the coach with Askew, he was very kind and attentive to me, and I objected to it, because, I said,</p>

               <p>"You are married, and I am engaged to Mr. Bertrand." I used to write to Bertrand very often, and Mr. Askew said,</p>
               <p>"You must call him your brother." I said,</p>
               <p>"He is not;" and Mr. Askew said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, you must call him so." Miss Dulan came with Mr. Askew; I did not desire it. I don't know whether she was examined on my part or not.</p>
               <p>A. WATTS. I

             this agreement (looking at it), by the mutual instructions of the prisoner and Miss Perrot; Bertrand was there but gave no instructions. It was left in the possession of Miss Perrot; there was a copy of it, which Mr. Askew had. I don't know whether Miss Perrot had it then; for while it was in our custody, a message came from Mr. Askew, not to deliver it. That was about two days after we had it. It was five days or a week before Miss Perrot got it: she had called twice in that time. I mean positively to swear that there was a copy of it, and Mr. Askew had one part of it at the time of the execution, and I think he put it in his pocket. I am not certain whether I took it away with me, or it was given to us afterwards by some other person, one of the parties. I do not know how many times Miss Perrot and Bertrand called for it before they got it. I will swear they did not use threats to get it; there were two parties to it. Mr. Askew had one, and the other party one; it has not been altered in any way since I wrote it.</p>

            . I came to England in the end of April this year. I know Miss Perrot. Three or four days after I came to England, I put into her hands seven billets de banque, of 1000 francs each, and five of 500 francs each, to take care of. I have never got them back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Are these your handwriting (handing some letters.) - A. I think they are; but I do not very well know my own hand-writing. I have known<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160108"></xptr>the last witness four years. I do not know how many times she has seen me write; I have written many letters to her. I came from France in the month of April. I am sure I was not here in March. I did not make any memorandum of the notes I brought with me; it is not the custom in France; they were of the Bank of France; I do not know what Bank they were. The bills for 1000 francs were the same as the 500 franc bills in all respects except the amount. The 1000 franc billets de banque were like this one. I was a grocer at Paris. When I came here I left the business; I do not now carry it on. The bills I left with Miss Perrot were seven for 1000 francs, and five for 500 francs; I do not know whether I left more with her. I made an inventory for her when I was in Paris. I do not recollect whether I told her the amount of the bills; I gave them to her all together to take care of, in her bedroom. I have seen her open the drawers in my presence. I recollect they were put into a drawer; but I cannot tell what drawer. There was a box in her bed-room. I have no doubt that this is a translation of one of Miss Perrot's letters, made by herself - (looking at it) - I was at Mr. Askew's house at the time I gave the bills to Miss Perrot, and continued there about a month. I gave her the bills to take care of for fear of losing them at my furnished lodgings. I am not sure whether my box was in that room then. I did not put the bills into the box, because it is not comfortable to put them in with clothes. I received the bills in my shop. I cannot say that I took them all in the shop, but when I got 500 francs I have exchanged them in the Rue de Banc. I cannot tell the name of any one person from whom I received any one of them. I have been to an agent of exchange several times, but I do not know his name. I received one 1000 francs bill from a servant of the director of the prisons, Mons. Ronne; he is not a changer of money. I had more money in England. I had one more 1000 francs bill; I changed that near the Haymarket three or four weeks after I came here. I have not changed any other French paper money. I have not frequently received money from Perrot: I have never received any of her. I never received any communication respecting a situation as teacher, through a person named Pascan; I do not know the name. I never received any communication respecting my becoming teacher of French in a school, or heard any thing of it; and never applied for 30 l. to enable me to take it. When I became acquainted with Miss Perrot she was a very respectable person. I never went to her drawers to take money. It is possible I might have her keys, but I do not remember it. I had some French gold in the drawer. Sometimes I went to her drawer - very seldom - two or three times. Mr. Askew told me I should pass as her brother: he did object to my intimacy with her; that was always the subject of our quarrel. I have lodged in the same house with her, at Mrs. Broadfoot's. I did not say to Mrs. Broadfoot yesterday, that if she proved any thing against Miss Perrot or me, I would say she had asked me to sleep with her. I have said to her in her house,</p>
               <p>"Your conduct is abominable; you send your son to the Magistrate and destroy my character, and you know what I know, and what I can say." Mr. Askew took the lodging for me in that house; I had no quarrel with Mrs. Broadfoot till I found she was to be a witness against me. I was once going up stairs at Mr. Askew's, and Miss Perrot was showing my bills to Miss Hudson, and I said,</p>
               <p>"Why do you show them?" Miss Hudson was then in the room or on the same floor: Miss Hudson has told me she has seen them. I never said at Cheltenham, in Miss Hudson's presence,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Askew is a very bad man, and I will bring him as low as the ground." I never had any thing good to say of him. I have conversed with Mrs. Broadfoot, but won't undertake to state what I have said of Mr. Askew; I have always looked at him as the dirt. I never said I was married to Perrot, or that we were man and wife, nor has she in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. When you intended to come to England, did you keep a sum of money for that purpose - A. Yes. I brought near 11,000 francs. I gave some gold to Miss Perrot; I have been to her drawer for it. The Bank in Paris is a public Bank; I did not know the name of any person there. The gentleman who's servant brought me one of the bills, is a director of the prisons. I had never quarrelled with Broadfoot, till after Askew was complained of; on our arrival from Cheltenham she treated us as her children.</p>

            . I am an attorney. I was engaged by Miss Perrot about the 1st of September. I went by her direction to Mr. Askew's, and demanded the property, of which she had furnished an inventory; this is the inventory; I believe I did not produce it the first time I went, but I requested a settlement of accounts between them; I claimed upwards of 70 l. for wages, and also the property she stated to be in his possession. He said what property she had was locked up in her chest of drawers; he said he had great complaints to make against her - she was a bad woman. I asked him how he could convince me of that; he said he had documents in his possession which would prove it; I requested him to show me them; he said</p>
               <p>"If I knew you better I would." I said</p>
               <p>"One document would be more convincing than anything he could say." Before I went to him, Madamoiselle Perrot had described a certain document which she said was in a chest of drawers, and when I asked Mr. Askew to show me the document on which he relied, he went up stairs, and brought down a letter; I read it two or three times. He said, perhaps, I did not understand the French language; he had a translation of it. I did understand it, and I said it was extremely extraordinary that he should be in possession of a confidential letter, and asked him how he had obtained it; he said it was of no consequence how he had obtained it; but he had got it. Madamoiselle Perrot had described a letter from a foreign nobleman, as being in her drawer, and this is the letter; the translation corresponds with the letter; the signature had not been told me; Madamoiselle Perrot said it was in French; she told me the name of the person who wrote it, but there is no name on the letter, nor does it appear to have come from a foreign nobleman. Nothing further passed about it, and soon after I went away; this was on Saturday, the 4th of September, and the next time I saw him was on Tuesday, the 7th of September; I had in the mean time seen Miss Perrot, and she had given me a document, which I have now in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160109"></xptr>hand. I see by an indorsement on the back of this paper, that it was the first time I saw him that I showed it him, and demanded the property. On the second interview, I waited on him with Miss Perrott, and requested him to pay her the wages which she claimed; and also, to deliver the property in her chest of drawers; and I said I thought, as the parties had complained against each other, the best way would be for him to give up the property she claimed, and then I should advise her to have the agreement given up, and it should be cancelled. He said she had already broken the agreement. I said I would not discuss that subject then. He said he would do nothing without consulting his solicitor; I then left him, requesting him to name an early day to settle the business; he named the next day, at four o'clock, but I did not go, in consequence of some intimation from Madamoiselle Perrot, but I went on the following Saturday alone. I had met him in the morning in the City, and it was agreed, that I should wait upon him at four o'clock. I requested that she should go with me to identify her property; he strongly objected to that; I urged it several times without effect; but he said, if she would write an order for him to deliver the property to me, and give me the key, it should be delivered to me. I am quite sure he mentioned the delivery of the key. I went at four o'clock, and took an order which I had written, and Miss Perrot had signed. I had shown him the inventory on the first occasion. At the third interview I was shown into the room, but just as I had opened the drawer, he went away. I believe there were two ladies and a Gentleman in the room. I did not find the goods corresponding with the inventory, but I found some of them, and I made an inventory of what I did find. Here is the inventory I made. I found a pair of diamond ear-rings, which are these, but no other articles of jewellery. I found an inventory in the drawers, in French: here it is. I did not search the drawers for any other articles than what were in the inventory she had given me. I could find no Bank Bills or the confidential letter she described.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. When did you see Mr. Askew first on this business - A. On the 4th of September; I had two interviews with him before I saw Etherington and Gregory. I did not leave the inventory or a copy of it with him, nor a demand in writing, but read the articles from the inventory. I said, I came from Miss Perrot, and the Consul had written me a letter on the subject. I did not say, I came from the French Consul. He afterwards showed me the letter; it was the third interview, I had the key, and went into room, but at the the first interview, he produced the letter. When I demanded the goods, at the second time, I proposed that they should give up the agreements, and they should be cancelled. If Miss Perrot had received her property and wages, we should have had no ground of complaint. I read the letter twice over: it was such a one as, perhaps, a Lady would not like to have made public; I should think it was of a nature to irritate the mind of Miss Perrot; she has been very much vexed at its being in Mr. Askew's possession; she has not expressed to me that it has been shown to other persons. I went before a Justice, about the beginning of September. I cannot recollect the date when I was requested to attend at Marlborough-street, by Miss Perrot. I saw Mr. Conant on the subject; it was before the goods were delivered up to me, I believe, but I cannot swear it.</p>

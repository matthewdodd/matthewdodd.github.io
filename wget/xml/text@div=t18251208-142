            . My uncle keeps this eating-house. I remember Goodliff coming to the house - I did not see him bring the umbrella and basket there, but I saw him in the box; the prisoner and a man who was with her came in just as the witness was going out, and were waiting to take their seat in the box when he left; they staid about five minutes to eat their soup; I saw the prisoner take up the basket and umbrella, and say, "Whose is this?" While they were contending about whether the soup was paid for, she went out. I asked my uncle if those articles had belonged to her - he said, No, they belonged to the old gentleman who went out before. The prosecutor came the next morning about it; the officer came afterwards - I described the prisoner, and she was taken.</p>

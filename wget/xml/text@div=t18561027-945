On 11th Sept., in the evening, Wilson and Pearce came to my house—Wilson asked for a pint of half and half, and gave me a sixpence—I gave her 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change, and put the sixpence into the till without noticing I it—the women drank the beer and went out—while they were there, Twiss, the constable, came in, and, in consequence of something he said, I looked into the till, and found in it a bad sixpence—I can swear it was the one that Wilson gave me—I had looked into the till two or three minutes before they came in—there were some sixpences in the till, but none like the one I received from Wilson—they were old ones, worn, and the milling was all off, and this one was a new one of Victoria—this is it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—Watts was afterwards brought in by Sturgeon, and Twiss afterwards came back with the two women—next day Thomas Harry Ford brought me this bag, which contains eleven shillings and three sixpences, all coun<lb></lb>terfeit, and wrapped up separately in pieces of paper—I gave the bag and it contents to Sturgeon, after I had marked them.</p>

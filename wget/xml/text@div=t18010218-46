A. I know the horse-shoes to be mine; I also found a pick-lock key; that was found in the prisoner's bed-room; I saw the officer take it up from the bed-room window.</p>
               <p>Q.Had the lock been forced? - A. Yes, with a punch or a crow, or some such thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Was it the door that was broke open? - A. They broke in at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. A picklock key would be a very useful thing to break open a window with? - A. No; they got at the key afterwards.</p>
               <p>JOHN NUTTMAN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a smith and farrier, at Hampton; I work upon the premises of Mr. Marston; he has kept the key of it ever since I have been there: On Saturday morning, the 7th of February, the horseshoes were shewn to me; they were found by my boy in a bag upon my premises; I knew them to be Alcorn's shoes from the make of them; I had heard of the robbery on the Friday morning; I went to Marston, and asked him if he knew any thing of that iron that was there, and he said, no, I said, either you, or somebody belonging to you, must; he then went up to the fire with his two hands in his pocket and said, work them up; I could not rightly hear the first word, but he said, work them up; I said, sharply, what I and he said, d-n you, you can't hear nothing, nor yet understand; he called me out, and said, I want to speak to you; I went out backwards, and he said, d-n it, if you had not said any thing to my boy Jack, you might have worked them all up, and nobody been the wiser; I told him I would not do it if he would lay me down 2001.; do you want to hang me; I said, I would go and inform the constable and Mr. Alcorn; and he said again, as I understood him, d-n you, work them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he said that? - A. Yes; I then went to the constable, but I went first to speak to two men about it, and he followed me in, and looked very solitary.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long have you had this shop of Marston? - A. A twelve-month in April; I had a key, and he had a key; he would not let me the place without he could have a thoroughsfare through it; his cart always stood there.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there not a great deal of talk about this robbery, at Hampton? - A. No; I had a little conversation with a sarrier of the name of Franklin about it; and on the Friday morning I saw some gentlemen going to search the farries' shops.</p>
               <p>Q.How early on the Friday did you hear of the robbery? - A.About seven o'clock, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear a great deal of talk about it that day? - A. No; I was at work all that day with my boy; I drank at a public-house on Friday night with some farriers, who told me their shops had been searched.</p>
               <p>Q. You were then a little uneasy, for fear your shop should be searched? - A. No; I had no doubt of that.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy found them in the shop - perhaps you sent him to the shop first in the morning? - A. He always does go first; I found three bars of iron at my own house that were carried home by my boy, which did not belong to me, and that gave me the first suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say he told you to work them up, nobody heard him, I dare say? - A. Yes, my boy heard it.</p>
               <p>Q.What, when he took you on one side to speak to you privately, did he speak loud enough for your boy to hear it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not fear that you might get into some trouble about it yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q.How came your boy to take this iron home? - A.Because I was afraid of being robbed myself; I ordered him to take every thing home.</p>

               <p>Q.What do you mean by so on? - A. He told me I must tell the truth.</p>
               <p>JOHN RUSSELL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a constable of Hampton: On Saturday morning, the 7th of February, about half past seven o'clock, Nuttman came into my house, and said, did you not come and search my premises yesterday; I said, why do you ask me such a question; he said, the whole of Alcorn's property is there; upon going with Mr. Nuttman to the shop, I found a bag, containing forty-nine new horse-shoes; we then went to Alcorn's, and Alcorn shewed Nuttman a tool called a pritchell, which Nuttman said belonged to him; I went to Marston's about ten o'clock in the morning, and in his bed-room Thorpe found a picklock key; I was in the room.(Produces the shoes and the tool.)</p>

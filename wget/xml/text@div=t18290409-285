I went to bed about eleven o'clock at night on the 13th of March, and got up about a quarter-past six in the morning; I had left my house quite secure, but found a piece cut out of one of the shop shutters, round the corner in Baldwin's-gardens - it had been cut by an orger, and I found the piece inside that had been cut out; they then broke one of the squares of glass, and brought the property through the hole - they must have put a hand in to have got the property; I missed property worth 25l. or 30l. - I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 14th of March, about half past twelve, or one o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner going down Sun-street, with this bag in a bundle-handkerchief; she was threequarters of a mile from the prosecutor's; two men were ten or fourteen yards behind her, and then went in front of her; I cannot say they were in her company - she went in a direction for Petticoat-lane - the two men then got in front of her; I knew one of them, which excited my suspicion, and in a street leading to Petticoat-lane I went up to the prisoner, and asked what she had got there; she said she did not know - I asked her where she had brought it from; she said she had met a man in Smithfield, who asked her to carry the bundle, and he would give her a shilling - I asked her where she was to carry it to; she said she did not know, but the man told her to follow him - the two men had then got in front of her, as far as they were before from her; I asked her if either of the men walking in front was the man who gave it her - after some hesitation she said it was the stoutest, and at that time one of the men looked round, and both walked fast; they turned the corner, and were out of sight in a minute - I took her to the office, with the bag, which contained this property.</p>

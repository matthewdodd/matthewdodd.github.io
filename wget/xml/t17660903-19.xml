               <p>Q. What goods did you find?</p>
               <p>M. Burch. I found a good many yards of silk, some muslin, laced caps, stockings, and many more things than I laid in the indictment; I found them in the woman's box that came, I don't know her name, she is a chairman's wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at the time you found them?</p>
               <p>M. Burch. She was by.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say?</p>
               <p>M. Burch. She said nothing at all; we found a gown at one pawnbroker's, and some silk, not made up, at another's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the chairman's wife with her when she lived with you?</p>
               <p>M. Burch. The chairman's wife used often to be about our house; I believe she drawed her in.</p>

I was sitting at breakfast in such a position that I could see the shop door; it was shut, I am sure, and latched. I saw the prisoner enter, I saw him make a scramble at the boots and shoes in the window; he entered by the door. Those goods were bespoke made boots. My son was sitting in the same direction, and said something, and I immediately pursued. I followed him myself; I saw him, and my son said there is a man stealing boots. I saw him take the boots; he went out with them; I pursued him immediately after; I lost sight of him in the pursuit for about a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181610300011"></xptr>quarter of a minute in my going out of the door; when I regained sight of him, the boots were dropt in the street; they might be not more than ten or a dozen yards from the shop. I looked at them; I picked up one immediately, and my son another; they were mine, and in my shop that day. I know them by the number and name that is within them; together they are worth considerably more than thirty shillings; I should have lost two pairs of boots in point of value; it would render both pairs useless. I now look at the prisoner, and I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness. I was with him on the morning in question. I saw a man go through the door; that man was the prisoner; I have no doubt of his being the man. I saw him go out with two boots; I pursued him myself immediately; he dropped them in the street upon my calling stop thief; he was stopt, and I came up. He dropped the boots before that. I am certain I saw him take them, and drop them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along the Strand, and I came past the gentleman's house, and there was a man came out of the door almost violently enough to knock me down, and dropped something, and a young chap was coming after me, and I was running after the man, and I was stopped, so he said, I was the man, and I said, I hope you will forgive me, because I am not the man, and you are wrong.</p>

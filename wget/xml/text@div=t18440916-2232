                  </hi>. I am pot-boy to Abraham Belasco, who keeps the Gun and Star public-house, Middlesex-street, Whitechapel. In consequence of a communication from my master, I was on the watch on the 11th of Sept.—the house was shut up at half-past twelve o'clock, and the parties retired to bed I went to my own room, but did not go to bed—I slammed my room door when I went in—I came out, and there was a candle in Parker's room, and the door was open—he lodged in the house, on the second floor—I slept on the third floor—he bad gone up stairs with me, and went into his room, and shut the door—when I had been up stairs about five minutes, I came out again, and saw Parker standing on the landing, watching—I came out again, and saw him go down stairs—I returned to my room, took ray clothes off, then came down stairs, and did not know what had become of him—I returned to ray room, got a short pipe, as an excuse to go into his room for a light, to see if he was there—I went into his room, struck a light with a lucifer, and then saw he was gone—I went up to my room, got a candle, and as I came down the candle fell out of my hand, and then I saw a light through the skylight of the skittle-ground—I leaned down, put my head through a broken square of glass, and saw Parker and Jacobs come out of the skittle-ground into the yard, and I saw one of them go into the pot-house, which is by the back door in the yard—I can<lb></lb>not say whether he brought anything out of there—they then went to the cellar flap—I saw them lift it up with something long, which appeared to me like a shovel—I saw them both go down into the cellar—they were not many minutes opening the flap—they propped it up with something—I then alarmed my master—I saw nothing more, as I went for the police.</p>

In consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion I received, my potman watched on the night of the 11th, and alarmed me about a quarter-past one o'clock—in consequence of what he told me I went to the cellar in the yard—I found the cellar-flap propped up—the cellar com<lb></lb>municates with the house—it opens into the spirit-cellar, and leads up into the bar, and so through the house—we can go into the cellar without entering at the flap—I had been in the cellar two days before—it was then fastened with a padlock and hasp—on this morning I found it open—I entered with the police, and found the prisoner Jacobs crouched down behind the door which was in the cellar—in an adjoining cellar I found Parker crouched down behind an old door—I said to Jacobs, who had formerly been my pot-boy, "Are you come here to rob me, who have been so kind to you?"—he said, "Yes, I am here"—I said, "Tell me who has got my property, it may get you off a little punishment"—(I had been robbed five days before)—he said he would tell me—the policeman said, "No, don't do it now, you had better go to the station, that is an after consideration"—I said to Parker, "I am sorry to see you here"—he had lodged in my house for six or seven weeks—I believe he buys old clothes—I was formerly a pugilist—I have kept this public-house two years, and am the landlord—I missed three or four dozen of port, sherry, and champagne from the cellar.</p>

                  </hi>. On the afternoon in question, I was standing in the road near the door of the Wellington public-house, and saw the prosecutrix and all the three prisoners—I saw Adams, but he went away and I saw no more of him till he was taken—after he went away the three prisoners came into the public-house, and one or two more followed immediately afterwards—they were drinking there—Batchelor took a leather purse either out of her hand or off the counter, I think it was out of her hand; he took, out some silver, I can't say how much, and returned the empty purse to her, saying, there was only a ticket and a halfpenny in it—she asked for the purse—the other prisoners were there at the time, and they all left after that—I thought I afterwards saw that same purse in the hands of Batchelor, but I am not quite positive of that—they all went out of the public-house together, and went up a passage—there was a lame man with them called <hi rend="italic">Hoppy</hi> Doyle; he was in the public-house all the time—Hawkins took up the prosecutrix's parasol from the counter, and I think Miss Timbrell told him to put it down, it did not belong to him—he put it down directly—I had seen the prosecutrix with that parasol when she was along with Adams, and she was all right then—when she went out of the house she was accompanied by the lame man and the three prisoners—she then appeared to be drunk—she was between two of them as she came out; Flaherty was</p>

               <p>one, and I think the lame man was the other, but I would not be quite positive—I was obliged to keep a little way from them because they are a dangerous lot—I followed to see what became of her, knowing the con<lb></lb>sequences—I followed them to another beer shop at the corner of Hastings, street, looking all the time each way to see if I could meet a constable to inform him—in going from the one house to the other, Hawkins wag carrying the parasol; he took it from her again outside the door and carried it under his arm—they stayed a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes in the beer shop—I remained outside at the further corner—before they came out, Hawkins put the parasol down his trousers and buttoned his coat over it, and then he and the lame man assisted her, and Flaherty and Batchelor followed—while they were in the beer-shop a female with red hair came and called Hawkins and gave him a bottle, it was a very short thick-necked bottle, not like a phial, it was very short and stumpy, more like a pomatum pot in shape—I could not see the contents of the bottle—Hawkins put his cap between his knees, put his hand on the top of the bottle and wiped it on his head, but I saw nothing wet; he then took a comb out, and appeared to be combing his hair, he looked about and I drew further back fearing I should be seen—he then went to where the men were having some beer, and moved his arm as if he was putting something into it, and then handed it to the female to drink, and the rest, all she did not drink, they threw out of the pot into the road—Batchelor and Flaherty were outside the house at this time, the lame man was inside—the girl then drank out of the quart pot, and then slipped back quite helpless into the street; they threw the remainder of the beer into the street, and had a fresh pint for themselves—she was so helpless that Hawkins and the lame man had to lead her, with her legs or feet dragging upon the ground—they took her down to the middle of the first court—Flaherty said, "It is all right, come on," and in the court Flaherty took off her cloak and gave it to another female, and then the four went into a room with her, the three prisoners and the lame man, and the blinds were drawn down—there were screams of murder, and I went for the police immediately—I went to the police station direct when I heard her call murder—this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is very similar to the one I saw.</p>

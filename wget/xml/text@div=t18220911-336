            , JUNIOR. My father sent me with a bag - I met the prisoner in Oxford-street - he said he would give me 2 d. to go with him, to take a parcel for him to the Hummums, Covent-garden, which I did; he sat down on the step of the coffee-house, and asked me to let him mind my bag, as it looked so for me to take it. I gave it him, and when I came out, I found him in custody with it, about 150 yds. off - the parcel was taken in at the hotel; he went part of the way with me.</p>

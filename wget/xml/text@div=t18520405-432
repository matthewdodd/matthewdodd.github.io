On Sunday evening she came home, and could not open the gate—she had had something to drink at 5 o'clock—the prisoner came in, and they quarrelled—she asked him for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he did not owe it—she called him many names—he said he would hit her if she did so again—she hit him on the face—he said he would beat her if she beat him—she threw a knife at him—he ran to take up a poker, and I ran out—she ran out after him, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> part of a shovel at him—before she came out I heard her cry out, "Police!"—she said if she caught him she would kill the b—y b—r—her head was bleeding—I saw the prisoner take hold of the poker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon of Westminster Hos<lb></lb>pital. I examined the deceased about half past 10 o'clock on Monday morn<lb></lb>ing, and found a scalp wound about an inch long on the left side of the top of her head, exposing the bone—I examined it with a probe, but could detect no fracture—she appeared to have lost the use of her lower limbs—I sent her to the ward, and in order to make a more careful examination I enlarged the wound, but could detect no fracture—she was very noisy and clamorous, and resisted my endeavours to examine her—internal remedies were given to her, and a blister was applied to the nape of her neck—her limbs continued, more or less, in a senseless state till night—I sat up till 2 with her, and desired the nurse to call me if any change took place—her body was convulsed on the left side; she went off into a sleep, and I was not sent for—next morning I went to the dead house and made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there were no marks on the body, except that on the scalp; the hone was exposed, and the <hi rend="italic">periosteum</hi> knocked off; there was no internal injury besides that—the brain was apparently healthy, with the exception of a small spot of softening in the lower part of it, not at the part corresponding with the wound, on the opposite side to the convulsion; it was an old affair, and unconnected with the blow—the spinal marrow was healthy, the heart was extensively diseased—I cannot form any judgment as to whether she was in the habit of drinking or not—there was a large abdominal aneurism of the aorta—the kidneys were dis<lb></lb>eased; the lungs were healthy—the smaller vessels of the brain were diseased—it was the same description of disease which pervaded the heart, arteries, kidneys, and the softened part of the brain—she was thirty-two years old, I believe—having been told that a blow was given, I am bound to say that was the cause of death—I believe the blow would have caused her death, although these was no internal disorganisation; I am bound to say so by common tense and reason—a blow of that kind, though not attended with any fracture of the skull, would be likely to prove fatal to a person in that state of disease—the least shock in a diseased state of the system might proof e fatal—she was most extensively diseased; microscopically, there was not a sound tissue in the body—the disease was a fault in nutrition—a blow like that might be inflicted with an instrument of this kind—it would be likely to produce the symptoms on the skull, and the loss of the use of the limbs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Not except the party had been diseased in the way you have described? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; a blow which gave no fracture at all would be likely to produce such appearances in the limbs—I have seen instances of death with not a symptom externally and scarcely any internally; and I have seen many cases where death has been produced by a blow where there has been hardly any external and no internal trace—I believe a woman being in a violent passion, swearing, and gesticulating, would, if in a state of disease, accelerate death, and so would anything that would produce a great effect to the mind, any shock to the nervous system—I nave heard that she was swear<lb></lb>ing violently at the prisoner, and that she struck him twice with her fist—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185204050106"></xptr>
               <p>that would have a tendency to accelerate death in her state; but still I think a blow would have a tendency to have that effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing you had found no marks of a blow, and had heard a description of her violence and passion, would that be sufficient to account for death in such a subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I believe it would—my opinion then would have been that she died from excitement, some shock to the system which I could not trace—if I had not heard of her being in a passion, but saw the marks of the blow, I should have given a confident opinion that death was caused by the blow—it is a constant thing for people to die of inflammation of the brain, and yet we cannot detect microscopically any cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having evidence of a blow, and of her being in a passion, can you state which of those two caused the death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The blow was on the left, and the convulsions were confined to the right limbs, and when one side of the brain is injured, the opposite side of the body always is affected—she bad not lost the sensation of the left leg, only of the right.</p>

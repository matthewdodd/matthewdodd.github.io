                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 53, Mint Street, Borough—on 24th September I was with Mr. and Mrs. Butler in their first-floor front room, 5 Vine Yard, St. George's, and two other persons—we went in about 11.30 p.m.—we had about half a gallon of beer, and were thinking of going home, when a knock came to the door—I, being the nearest, got up to answer it, but just as I put my hand on it it was pushed violently open and a man's hand came in with some weapon—I gave way, and the prisoner stood over me with something in his right hand and struck me in my right eye—I said that I was hurt, and Mrs. Butler came and took a piece of a knife out of my eye—I gave the prisoner in custody—I bled—a good deal and taken to the hospital.</p>

I am the wife of William Butler, of 5, Vine Yard—early on this Sunday morning my mother, my husband, and Mr. Barnes were in our room—the prisoner knocked at the door, Barnes went to open it, and the first stroke came against the wall—the prisoner pushed the door open and said "You b——s—, I mean killing one here," and struct Barnes in the eye—he said "I am stabbed"—I saw a knife in the prisoner's hand—I took this piece of a table knife out of Barnes' eye and gave it to the sergeant.</p>

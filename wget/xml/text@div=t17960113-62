             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a foreigner; I have lived in Crown-street, soho, these eight years; my master is a smith, I have worked for him all that time; he is a foreigner; I lodge in the same house with him: Yesterday was a week, by accident, I went into a public-house, not far from St. Giles's; I don't know the name of the street, it was Dyot-street, or somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. What public-house had you been at before? - A. I came from the Crown, in Crown-street; I had been there pretty near the whole day.</p>
               <p>Q. What took you to this other public-house? - A. By accident I went in and ordered some beer, between ten and eleven o'clock at night; I saw these two women and many more, in the public-house, and I asked the prisoner, M'Carty, she with the child in her arms, if she would drink; and she said, yes, and she did drink; I asked her, whether she was single or not; she said, she was single; and I told her, that I was a single man; I told her, it was a pity, a young woman like her should be single, and we might have an alliance together, if we had a little time to talk; then, she said, if I would go with her, to her room, we would talk about it; but I would not go; I did not like to go; I asked her to come along with me, but she would not; and, at last, I went along with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it when you went away with her? - A. It was not quite eleven; but it was very near; I went along with her, and the other woman followed us; they brought me to a room in <placeName id="t17960113-62-crimeloc354">Gerrard-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17960113-62-crimeloc354" type="placeName" value="Gerrard-street"></interp>

               <p>Q. Where were you when you felt for your money? - A. I believe it was in the passage of the house; I had some other money besides that; I went in with both of them, into a parlour, upon the ground floor, and a candle was got directly; I don't know whether it was lighted before I went in or not; as soon as we were in the room, M'Carty said, she had heard that I had been injured with venereal complaints, and therefore she would not have any thing to do with me, till I shewed her whether I was or not; she stood far from me; the other woman stood quite close to me; at last, I found myself robbed; I missed my money in an instant, as soon as I gave her an opportunity to put her hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you allow her to put her hand in your pocket? - A. I don't know how she got it; she must have put her hand in, but I don't know how she did it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the room before you missed your money? - A. Eight or ten minutes, not more; as soon as I found myself robbed, I caught hold of the woman, Torbent, and told her she had robbed me, she said, she had not: I directly ran to the door, and called watch, the other woman did not come near me; I do not suspect upon her so much as the other, I made as much noise as I could, and then M'Carty begged that I should not be served so; says she, you robbed him; no, says the other, I did not; Torbent said I had the money about me; I felt again, and said, I had not got it, and I made more noise for the watch, I felt in my pocket again, and found a half crown, a bad sixpence, and a few halfpence; I am sure I had not any money at all when I said I was robbed; I had some halfpence in another pocket, I said, if you will give me the guinea, I will let you go about your business; Torbent said, she would not give me any, and she had not got any, and the watchman came in directly, and I charged them with the watch; we went to the watch-house; I searched down upon the floor, but I did not find any thing,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130109"></xptr>I did not see any thing found upon them at the watch-house; the watchman let me go, and told me I must come up to Marlborough-street to-morrow; I never had my money again.</p>
               <p>Q. How that half-crown came into your pocket you don't know? - A. No; she said I had got my money, and I felt in my pocket and found half a crown, a bad sixpence, and some halfpence, I had no sixpence before.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not say that you was in any degree sober, when you went into the house in St. Giles's? - A. I had been drinking, I cannot say I was quite sober, but I was sensible enough.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sensible enough to go with them to their lodgings? - A. I was sensible that I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know that either one or the other had her hand in your pocket? - A. No; I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your trowsers were loose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>M'Carty's defence. My Lord, this young woman and I went into a public-house, called the Maidenhead, this man was there, calling for a gallon of purl, and a gallon of beer, there were a great many people in company with him; he asked me to drink to my sister, as he called this young woman, which I did; he asked if I was married, I said no, and he said he should go home with me, he took a liking to me, and as we were going along, there was a woman quarrelling with him, she said he had got the bad disorder; I went away from him, and just before I got to my own door, I turned round and saw him behind me; we got a light and he followed us in; says he, I shall go home with you, and give you a shilling; I said, what has that woman been jawing about, he said she had charged him with having the bad disorder; he said he had had it, but was got well; he had a place in his groin you might put three fingers in; then he said we had robbed him, and he called the watch; he said first he had lost half a guinea, and then at the watch-house he said, he had lost a guinea, and a half guinea, and a sixpence; he gave the constable of the night sixpence to get us something to drink, and he said it was a bad one.</p>
               <p>Torbent's defence. When we went to the watch-house, he said, if you will give me a guinea, I will let you go; says I, how can I give you what I never had, and he said he would keep us both till the morning; he came with another man next morning, and said, if you will give me a guinea I will not prosecute you; I said, I had not a friend in the world, and he said he would certainly prosecute us; he said, he had a guinea and a half when he went into the room; when he shewed me what he had, I said, how can you be such a man to go with a clean woman as she is, in such a condition, and he gave me such a blow as almost knocked me down; I did not see a farthing that he had.</p>

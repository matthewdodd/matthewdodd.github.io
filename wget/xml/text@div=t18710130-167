                  </hi>. I am a widow, at 23, Tredegar Street, Stepney—in August last the prisoner came to my house, and said that he was employed by Bache &amp; Co., Government contractors—he said that Earl Granville had summoned him from Hamburgh for writing to England for a supply of guns to supply the Prussians, and that he was to be examined on Wednesday—he asked me to give him board and lodging, and I took him in—he went out on Wednesday, and when he came back he said he had undergone examination by the attorney, who had reprimanded him severely for his conduct, and said that he was a pretty representative to come from such a firm, and all sorts of disagreeable things, which he felt very much hurt at—in September he said he was ashamed of his shabby appearance, but he accounted for that by saying that he had left his clothes in Hull, by reason of bringing over a quantity of cigars to give as presents to his friends—he said he had not sufficient to pay the whole duty, and would I lend him the money, so that he could make a better appearance—I lent him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he left on 21st or 22nd October to go to Aberdeen—he did not pay for his board and lodging, but he said he would pay when Earl Granville paid him for being a witness, and that he was to write to Bache &amp; Co. when he wanted money—I agreed to board him for 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he said it was too little; I said it would do, but he could give me any more he liked—he had every meal in the house—I had a letter from him at Aber<lb></lb>deen, and he inviegled me down there, but I could not find him—I did not see him till I saw him at his lodging in Southwark—I said, "You wretch, I have discovered you; you inveigled me all the way to Scotland; if it had not been for an accomplice you could not have acted as you have done "—he said, "That is quite right, I could not help it; you can do nothing with me if you try your best"—I lent the money to him, believing his whole story, and I gave him his board for the same reason.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody at 27, Southwark Bridge Road, on another charge—the prosecu<lb></lb>trix saw him when he was in custody—she said "What hare you robbed me for in this manner?"—he said "You can do your best or worst, you can do nothing with me now"—she said something about his representations to her about his coming from Hamburg at Earl Granville's request—he said it was quite right—while I was conveying him from Southwark Police Court, he admitted he had never been to Hamburg at all—he said it was his inten<lb></lb>tion to go as soon as he got money enough—he said he had come from Hull to London direct, and had never been to Hamburg.</p>

That is all I have to say.</p>

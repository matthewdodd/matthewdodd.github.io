            . I am president of the Inland division at the General Post Office. On the 24th of November, 1818, the prisoner was employed in the Post Office as a charger of letters; he was on duty that evening. He was in the Dover division.</p>
               <p>Q. The letters are faced, stamped, charged, and sorted all in one large room - A. Yes, for the whole kingdom. Facing, is turning them on their faces, they then are stamped with the date of the month and year, and then taken to tables, and sorted for different places.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all the persons that are round the room for the purpose of charging go to the sorting table to take their letters - A. Occasionally; there are boxes all round the room where the chargers sit. Messengers take them, or the chargers fetch them from the sorting table.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this a correct plan of the office - A. It is - (looking at it).</p>
               <p>(The plan was then handed to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is it in the power of any of the chargers to secrete a letter belonging to his own division, or any other - A. It is in their power. It occasionally happens that a charger finds a letter in his place, which does not belong to his division, and each sorter has what is called a blind box, to put the mis-sorted letters in, and they are then resorted.</p>
               <p>Q. This letter ought to have gone to the Rye division - A. Yes, it could more naturally be mis-sorted to the Dover division than any other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. There are a great many men employed in that room - A. A great many - this letter did not belong to the prisoner's division; he would not have received it into his division if it had been sorted correctly. The charger occasionally goes to the sorting table, and has an opportunity of taking any letter.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the prisoner was in attendance that night - A. I refer to the attendance book, which I keep myself, and find that he was in attendance that evening - his name is signed by himself in this book as being in attendance, and countersigned by me. He leaves the office at eight o'clock.</p>

Yes, on a Wednesday evening, between eight and nine o'clock at night, About half an hour after he came he gave me a 5 l. bank note to change, and told me to buy any thing to drink. I went to Mr. Hicks, who keeps the Bell, public-house, in Friar-street, and applied to 
               <persName id="t18191027-53-person561">

             for change. I saw her take a pen and ink in her hand when I gave her the note, but did not see her write. She gave me the change, which I took to the prisoner with the liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any purchase of you that evening - A. Yes, he bought a pug dog of me that evening for 1 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometime after, did a gentleman call upon you from the Bank about the note - A. Yes, with Mr. Hicks - I think it was on the Saturday before Christmas day - I did not then know the prisoner's name or residence. After that I saw him go by the top of Flint-street, and told him that a gentleman from the Bank, had told me to send for Mr. Hicks whenever he came again. He told me he had been extremely ill - he appeared ill, and I told him I thought it might be his death to be taken by surprise for passing a forged note, which I then supposed it to be. He said he was very much obliged to me for not doing it, and that he would behave like a man of honour, and come and pay me the note on Friday week, but he never did. I did not see him again until I saw him at the Post Office on the 9th of August - he was then taken into custody. I was ordered to attend there.</p>

               <p>Q. Were any other persons in the room when you saw him at the Post Office - A. Yes, a number of other gentlemen - about a dozen, I should think. I knew him again. He has called on me a great many times in the course of the last three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen your pug dog since - A. Yes, Vickery shewed it to me. I knew it again, and the dog knew me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You say, unfortunately, you have known the prisoner four years - A. Yes, I often had money from him - he made me a present out of that 5 l. note. Nobody was present when he gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a 5 l. note from any other person about that time - A. No. I have not seen any of the notes that I got in change for it.</p>
               <p>A. Then you know nothing to ascertain that he gave you the note, except your own statement - A. No. I often change notes at that public-house. I have changed 5 l. notes more than once for gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not odd that you should ask money for the dog - A. I told him it was promised, and he asked me how much I was to have for it? I said 1 l., and he gave me a 1 l. note for it - it was quite a pup.</p>

               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Did you give Bridgeman the same note he gave you - A. Yes, I had received no other from any one about that time, and had no other.</p>

On the 27th of February the prisoner slept in the same bed with me; I got up before him and missed this money from my pocket, which was safe over night; I told him nobody could have got into the room to take it besides him - I had gone to bed first, and put my trousers under the pillow and found them laying just at the top of the pillow; he said he knew nothing about it - he got up and went out, leaving me looking for the money; he was taken on Saturday; I have known him nine years - it was his father's house, and there was nobody in it but his mother; I am sure the money was in my pocket when I went to bed- I was sober.</p>

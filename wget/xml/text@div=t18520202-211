                  </hi>. I live in Castle-place, Tottenham. Petter lodges with me; he has a shed at the bottom of the garden, in which he keeps rabbits. On 10th Jan. I was in the water-closet, about 11 o'clock in the evening, while there I saw some person go towards the shed where the rabbits were—I heard a scream like the scream of a rabbit, and I saw a person come away from the shed—I went to the shed and found the door open—I cannot say whether it had been closed before—I went out at ray front-door—I went round towards the back of the premises, and came up to the prisoner—he was not coming towards me, but going down the back—I said it was a wet night—I believe he made no answer—I saw there was something struggling in his pocket—I did not say anything about it, but he said, "I am very near drunk to-night, some one has been stealing a rabbit, or taking a rabbit, and put it down, I came out of Chalkley's and picked it up in the road, you may have it if you like"—I took the rabbit, and tried to secure him, but he ran away.</p>

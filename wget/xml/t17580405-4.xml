They lay in the room where the drawers were; the young man got up about eight, and the prisoner came down about ten. I missed the things between ten and eleven, we suspected the prisoner, I took him up, and told him I was robbed of five crown pieces, and the other things; he seem'd to lay it very hard upon the other young man. I went with him to seek for the young man, and found him in the prisoner's lodgings, they both lodged together, the prisoner opened a drawer of his, and took some things out, and after that a shift of my wife's was found in his bed, which since he owned he took out there, and put into the bed. He owned in the prison before me, that he took the three pair of cotton stockings, and had made away with them, that they might not appeared an evidence against him. He owned he had had the five crown pieces, and he had changed them, and that I could not have three of them again, for he had changed them to different people. I have two again, which I gave 10 s. for to two people that said they had changed them for him. They are not here.</p>

The prisoner was at the house about three weeks after Christmas; he was there all day - he came into the kitchen about five o'clock, and said my master wanted me to put the child to bed; I went to my master in the bar; the prisoner was there then, and I found I had not been sent for - I went up to put the baby to bed, returned in ten minutes, and one of the children asked me for an orange- I went to my trunk, which is on a shelf over the kitchen cupboard; I found the lock broken, and every thing taken out - I had put them into the box after the prisoner came into the kitchen - he was gone before I came down.</p>

            . I am between seven and eight years old; my father kept this public-house at the time in question; the prisoner lodged there - he came into the kitchen, and told Lyons my father wanted her to put the baby to bed - she sent me to tell my father she would be up directly; Cosgrove pushed me back as I was going, and went into the bar himself; Lyons afterwards went to put the child to bed; I went up to the lodgers, and came down in three minutes, and saw people dancing in the tap-room; I rapped at the kitchen door - nobody answered - I looked through the key-hole, and saw Cosgrove on the table; he came out in about five minutes, went and staid in the bar for about half an hour, and then went home - I had not seen him take any thing. I heard of the loss in about an hour, and told what I had seen; I did not see him take any thing, or see any thing about him.</p>
               <p>The Court, upon referring to the witness' deposition, found she had there stated that she had seen the prisoner take the property.</p>

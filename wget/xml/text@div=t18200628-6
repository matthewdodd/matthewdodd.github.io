            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On Friday morning, the 16th of June, I was with Izard, at Hornsey - I heard somebody coming, got behind a tree, and saw two men, one had a bag, and the other was walking about two yards before him. I came from the tree, and got in front of them - I saw the prisoner rather wished to make his escape, and laid hold of him. I asked them two or three times what they had got there, and both said</p>
               <p>"Nothing." I called to Izard to be sure and hold the other, but he threw the bag away and we could not catch him. I searched the prisoner, and found two knives in his pocket, which I produce; one of them was all over fat and blood. I found a small whetstone on him, and a bag under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the bag which the man left behind - A. A sheep. I asked the prisoner about the sheep, he said he found it lying by the road-side, about three hundred yards from where we took him. I took him to the cage with the sheep; when we got there I saw his hat was greasy, I took it off, and found about four pounds of fat inside it - a handkerchief was between it and his head - it appeared to be the fat of a sheep. He said his name was

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know whether it was a ewe or a wether - A. No, it was so mangled. They both said they had nothing.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was with Davenport, we met the prisoner and another man, who threw down the sheep, and ran away; I pursued, but lost him. I returned, and took the carcase of the sheep to Mr. Booth's, which is about fifty or a hundred yards from where we stopped them. I afterwards found the skin and head of the sheep in Mr. Booth's ground, about three hundred yards from where we stopped the prisoner. It was very warm, as if it had just been killed - in fact it smoked when we took it to Mr. Booth's. The skin was marked with a B. The entrails laid close by it, the fat had been taken from them - they were both very warm. I produce the skin. I believe it was a wether sheep.</p>

             re-examined. It is the skin of my master's wether sheep; he has four hundred with that mark, but all the rest are at home. None of them had been sold.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We had been out all day looking for work at haymaking - At night I got tired, and laid under a hedge; the other man came back to me and said,</p>
               <p>"Let us walk down the road" - as we were coming down we saw this bag laying on the bank. He said,</p>
               <p>"You take the fat and I will take the sheep;" I objected to it - he said,</p>
               <p>"Take it!" I said I had rather not; he said I should. We came along, and these men met us. The other man said,</p>
               <p>"There is nothing in the bag," but I told them that what was in it we found on the bank side.</p>

On the 22d of June. I was standing by the compting-house; I saw two boys just within the door of the warehouse; there was a person at that time in the compting-house about business. As he went out at the compting-house, they went out at the warehouse-door. About ten or fifteen minutes afterwards, I saw one of the boys stepping out of the door very quickly. I was afraid they were upon some bad design. I went up stairs to the servant in the kitchen, and asked her if any boys had been with any message to her. She said, No; but that she had heard a door open. Upon examining, we missed Mr. Loader's watch out of that room where it was hanging. We sent immediately to Justice Fielding and had it advertised. On the 17th of July, Underwood came to our house with Sproser the evidence, and told me, the watch was at Islington at the Angel. We searched the house, but did not find the watch.</p>

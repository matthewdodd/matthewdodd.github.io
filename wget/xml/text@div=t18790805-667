On 1st July about 10.45 p.m. I watched the prisoner and another man in Long Acre for half an hour—they were getting into dark doorways and then separating and meeting again—Berry joined me—they went down Hanover Court, and Berry followed them—I went a different way and met them and said, "I am a detective officer, and shall take you in custody for loitering and being a suspected person"—</p>

               <p>they said nothing, but struggled and tried to get away—I saw Davis put Ins hand into his left trousers pocket and try to get something out—I called out to Berry, who took hold of his left hand, and we took them to the station, charged them with being suspected persons, searched them and found in the prisoner's left trousers pocket these two half-crowns done up in newspaper, and another under the lining of his jacket—I could not find any hole in his pocket—I said to Berry "Here is some bad money"—Davis said, "I picked it up against the hoarding in Hart Street"—there was a rag round it and papers between—nothing was found upon Gold, the other man, and he was remanded for a week and discharged.</p>

I have heard Bennett's evidence, it is correct—I followed the prisoner down Hanover Court and Hart Street, and separated from Bennett, who took them both when I was 15 or 16 yards off—he called my attention to the prisoner putting his hand in his pocket, and I held his hand till we got to the station—I saw them stop at the hoarding, but neither of them stooped.</p>

Some time after another came, and asked if two gentlemen had been there: I told him yes, but they were gone; he said they were coming again to spend the evening. He went into the parlour, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176604090027"></xptr> asked me to make him a pint of brandy hot; it was carried into the parlour by the boy in the pint silver mug; I said to the boy, mind that mug in the parlour; he said he would; I was busy in getting the supper in the kitchen for the waggoner, and some gentlemen. I went to the parlour door, it stood a jar; I looked, and there was neither mug nor man. A gentleman lent his horse, and he was overtaken, being the only person they took.</p>

I saw him take something white from under his coat, and throw it over a camshot wall into the road; I said here is the man, he has thrown the mug away: I called stop thief; we took him: several people went along with me, and we found the mug where I saw him throw it, (produced in court.)</p>

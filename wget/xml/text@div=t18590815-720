                  </hi>. I live at 26, Long Acre, and am a potato salesman, carrying on business in Covent-garden. On 11th July I went to bed with my wife about half-past 10 o'clock—the house was then fastened, and every window was down—about half-past 2 o'clock I heard a rustling noise, and thought I saw a man—I raised myself up, and found a person in the room—I got out of bed, collared the prisoner, and ordered my wife to go and raise an alarm in the front room—during that time the prisoner said to me, "My friend McIntosh is in the front room; you had better liberate me and go and look after him"—I would not do so—my wife gave an alarm in the front room, and during that time the prisoner tried to get away, but I held him till the policeman came, and gave him into his hands—I examined my trousers, and missed my purse, containing 2 cheques,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, S</hi> 13). I was on duty in Long-acre about half-past 2 o'clock that morning—I heard a call of police—went to the house and found the prisoner in Mr. Cousins's bed-room—Mr. Cousins was holding him—I took him in custody and searched him—when I came up he stood about the centre of the room—I heard a noise, pushed the prisoner on the bed, and looked down and found this purse—the prisoner said that his friend McIntosh was in the other room—I took the prisoner to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I got into a public-house and got the worse for liquor. I remember speaking to some person; as to breaking in I don't know. The Magistrate asked if there were the marks of nails, they said "Yes," and I had no nails in my boots. The prosecutor said to me, "What do you do here?" I said, "Some person let me in;" he saw I was the worse for liquor. He went out of the room for ten minutes and came back and put on his stockings. The policeman searched me and said I had nothing, and when we got to the station he said, "What did you do with the sixpence you had?" I can swear I never saw the purse; it must have fallen out of his pocket after he had overhauled my clothes. I was in the house but I did not break in.</p>

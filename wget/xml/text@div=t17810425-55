On Sunday the 18th of March, at about half past seven o'clock at night, I caught the prisoner in my house, as he was coming into the kitchen where we were sitting. He had a candle in his hand: Mr. Braly and Mr. Brooks were with me: they came there to sit with me, because we suspected my house had been attempted before. The prisoner came as far as the door: we had a light in the kitchen; we heard a little noise about a quarter of an hour before, but we did not go to see what it was. When the prisoner came to the kitchen-door, we jumped up, and took him in the passage; upon which one or two men ran away. We found the street-door open at that time: they had opened it, for I had locked it about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Had you taken the key out? - I had not taken the key out, nor indeed locked the door; it was only upon the single spring-lock; I suppose they got in by opening the door with a picklock-key. The kitchen-door had been kept shut; somebody opened it; we jumped up, and catched the prisoner in the passage near the door; there was an hair-cloth upon the passage, which I suppose prevented our hearing him when he came in. We picked up the scabbard of a cutlass in the passage: the prisoner was searched, but no arms were found upon him; but we found a picklock-key in his pocket, and a skrew-driver knife: there were three or four locks picked up-stairs; and we found the things mentioned in the indictment in the passage, in a bag as they now are.</p>

               <p>When we went up stairs, we found the drawers open, and entirely empty. The prisoner was brought into the kitchen; at first he appeared much frightened, and could not speak; he was in a faint sweat; he asked for a glass of water, which was given him; then he said, he heard a noise in the passage, and came in to see what was the matter: the next morning he said, he came in to avoid a press-gang.</p>
               <p>(The witness, upon his cross-examination, said the first noise they heard, they judged to be the opening of the door, for they never heard it shut again; and for what he knew, it might remain open all that time, a quarter of an hour; that they found a piece of burnt coal in the passage, and a burnt match upon the stairs.)</p>

               <p>I was coming by Leather-lane, in the afternoon, about seven or eight o'clock; some fellows ran by me with cutlasses, and there was a noise; I found the door open; I stepped in; upon which these men took hold of me by the neck, and dragged me along a long kitchen; they frightened me; I did not know what they meant; in a quarter of an hour after, they brought in a bag of clothes, and said I was up stairs; one of the men said he left the door open on purpose to catch somebody.</p>
               <p>To Ivey. Did you say you left the door open on purpose to catch people?</p>
               <p>When the kitchen door was open, Brooks jumped up and said, You are the gentleman we are waiting for.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the street-door was s hut, and the bolt of the lock shut? - Yes; I am quite sure it was shut; I pulled it to. There is a passage goes to a neighbour's.</p>
               <p>Does not the door of that passage generally stand open? - Yes; but I am certain the passage-door was shut, because I was at the door at six o'clok, and shut it when Mr. Braly came to me.</p>
               <p>It might be opened afterwards for what you know? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What state was the back-door of your own house in? - I am sure it was barred.</p>

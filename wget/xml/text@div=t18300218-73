On the 18th of January, between ten and half-past ten o'clock at night, I was sitting in a room be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180041"></xptr>hind my shop - the window was open, and my attention was fixed on it; I saw the prisoner put the whole of his body in - he reached over, took this large piece of twelfth cake, and instantly ran off with it; I saw him, ran after him immediately, calling out Stop thief! and never lost sight of him - I had a pair of slippers on; when he came to Giltspur-street he threw the cake into the road, and by the Compter I took him without losing sight of him - the cake was worth 10s.; I gave him to the watchman -I asked why he stole the cake, for if he was hungry there were buns and smaller things; he said he did not want buns, he wanted something more than that, for he would only have four months at the tread-mill, and that would not suit him - he used other taunting language in the street.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH. I am a watchman. I heard an alarm, and ran up - Notley gave the prisoner in charge; he went back, and picked up the cake.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When the prosecutor stopped me he said he should have me whipped up and down the street at the cart's tail - I told him I woul! rather he would do any thing than that.</p>

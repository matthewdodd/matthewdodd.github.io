On 14th September I was in Kingsland-road about 3 o'clock in the morning—I was at the corner of King Edward-street, about five or six houses from the prosecutor's premises—I heard a noise like a wrench of wood—the corner I was at stands rather back—I stepped from the place to the kerb, so that I could see to the end of the Kingsland-road, and I saw a man standing opposite the prosecutor's premises with a bag under his arm—it being dark where I was, he could not see me—I went towards him, and immediately he saw me he made off—I was about making after him when the prisoner came out of the door of the prosecutor's shop, and seeing me, he went into a coffee-shop and I went in and took him—I took him into the prosecutor's shop and called the prosecutor—from the time I saw him come out of the shop till I took him in again, he was never out of my sight—I saw the moulding of the fan-light of the shop—there was a mark of a chisel or something round it—the wrenching of that would cause such a noise as I heard—it was either that or the falling of the fan-light.</p>

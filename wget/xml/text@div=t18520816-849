                  </hi>. I live at Greenwich, and am publisher and proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Greenwich Observer.</hi> I know the prisoner—he applied to me to become collector of advertisements for me—the terms agreed upon were twenty per cent., of course that was for genuine advertisements—he brought me an advertisement to insert for Mr. Burnby, a china and glass dealer, at Deptford—I inserted it—I have a copy of the paper in which it was inserted—this is the advertisement he brought me (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he called my attention to the writing on the paper, that it was to be inserted once, but the type was to stand, with the expectation that it was to be inserted again—I had not inserted any before for Mr. Burnby—it was inserted on 2nd July—this is it—I asked the prisoner if he had arranged with Mr. Burnby as to the price of the advertisement—he told me no, it was to be arranged according to the scale of prices—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. commission on that advertisement—I sent the account to Mr. Burnby, which was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I would not have paid the prisoner that 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if I had not thought the advertisement was genuine—the prisoner had presented an account, including several advertisements, charging twenty per cent, on the gross amount, but Mr. Burnby's was omitted in that, and he brought it to me afterwards, and said it would be 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I reminded him that I had paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. excess on a former account, and that would account for it—I would not have allowed that account afterwards if I had not believed that he had obtained authority to insert that advertisement—he brought me this account of commission on advertisements—(<hi rend="italic">this being read, contained William Youens</hi>, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and John Anthony Waite</hi>, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.)—I believe he brought this account about 1st July—before he brought this account I had inserted two advertisements for Mr. Waite and Mr. Youens—I asked the prisoner whether he had made any arrangement with Mr. Waite—he said no, it was to be inserted according to the scale—I settled this account on the supposition that these two accounts were genuine, in fact that they were all genuine—I after<lb></lb>wards applied to Mr. Waite, Mr. Youens, and Mr. Burnby for payment—I was not able to get either of those moneys—this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is the pri<lb></lb>soner's writing—the commission on Mr. Waite's and Mr. Youens' advertise<lb></lb>ments would be about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

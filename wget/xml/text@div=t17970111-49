             sworn. - I am an officer; on Monday the 28th of November, the prosecutor came to our office in Worship-street, and told me he had been robbed, and that he suspected the people that robbed him, and I and three other officers went to Ratcliff-lair, pretty near the public-house door, and there we saw the prisoner and Everitt together, we apprehended them, and took them to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Everitt.) How light was it in the court, at the time that you and Bates opened the door? - A. I cannot rightly say how it was in the court, I did not notice, but it was so dark in the room that we could not see any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see a man's face in the court? - A. Yes; I dare say I could.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the Friday night that this robbery was committed on the Saturday, I went, with Everitt to take home an iron book-case of fourteen hundred weight; Everitt was sent back, and when I came back to work I did not find him at work, but I went to Mrs. Robinson's, the public-house, and, as usual, he was there playing at shove-halfpenny, and I could not get him to work. The next morning I tried to get him to work, but could not. I told Mrs. Robinson to beg of him to come to work, that he would lose his place if he did not, and my young master came to call him; he knew very well that I could not go on with my work without him. In the afternoon, I was sitting with my father, and some man came in, and Everitt knocked the man's money out of his hands, and the man and he went to fighting; and I asked him again to go to work; and he said he had sprained his thumb, and could not; and then he went out a considerable time before me, we did not go out together; it is true he changed a guinea with Mrs. Robinson that he had received for his wages. I went out for a little while, and came back again to the public-house; I told Mrs. Robinson that I could not pay her, because I should not receive my money till Sunday. On Monday morning he called me to work, and I thought it was very strange, as I had always had to call him, for I never could get him to work; and he told me, that every body that was in Mrs. Robinson's tap-room on Saturday were going to be taken before a Justice; and I went to Mrs. Robinson's to ask her about it; when Mr. Harper apprehended me, they searched me, and found two shillings upon me, and very near a guinea upon him; I was taken before the Justice, and the Justice did not think I was the man that did it, and I was committed till the next day, and the next day I came down again to the Justices; I know nothing of the property; I had not even money to pay for the beer that I had had of Mrs. Robinson.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Robinson.) After Hewitt was gone from your house, did you see the prisoner and Everitt go out together? - A. I cannot say I saw them go, I missed them both; neither do I know whether they came back together, but Everitt brought me the guinea to change, and then I heard Bates's voice in the tap room; Mr. Hewitt had been gone about a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes, when I missed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110075"></xptr>Q. Had they been at your house in the morning? - A. Yes; and their young master came to call them to go to work; they came about eight or nine o'clock, and went away about ten; they returned again about two, and staid till after Mr. Hewitt had left his key.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner applied to you to tell Everitt to go to his work, and not be so idle? - A. He certainly did, on the Friday evening.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- PARNELL sworn. - I am a clock-maker, and keep a house, No. 8, Taylor's-row, in the Pipe-field. The prisoner lodges in my house, he came to lodge with me about this time last year; I have only to say, that I have ever considered him as a hard-working honest man.</p>
               <p>Mrs. STEVENSON sworn. - I am a smith: The prisoner has worked with me about seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his character during, that time? - A. He never wronged me to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character? - A. I don't know any harm of him; he is a very hard working industrious man, losing a day now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character? - A. I never knew any thing ill of him till this happened.</p>

             sworn. - I live in the house in which the robbery was done, I know nothing of the robbery, I had heard a very indifferent account of the house before. On the day of the robbery, I heard the door burst open; I went down, and saw the skirt of a blue coat go in, I supposed it was Mr. Hewitt, I spoke to him but he made no answer; I sat down in my room, and, in ten or fifteen minutes, I heard the latch go, I ran to the top of the steps, and saw a man, in a blue coat, going by my window, with a bundle; and then Mr. Hewitt's daughter came in, and said, my father is gone out and left his door open; says I, he is in the room, for I saw him go in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see more men than one? - A. No; he was rather a tallish man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough to see the colour of his coat? - A. Yes; he had a blue coat on. On the Monday afternoon, I came home, and saw a great mob; and when I came in, I saw two women big with child in my room, one of them was a woman that Everitt lives with.</p>
               <p>Court. You must not tell us what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Robinson.) How were they dressed when they were at your house? - A. They both had jackets on; Everitt's was a blue one, I cannot recollect what colour Bates's was.</p>

On the 24th of June I lost a gelding and a mare from a pasture field, near my house - my son turned them out the evening before. I missed them between four and five o'clock in the morning; they were in an inner field; the outer field next the common was locked. On the following night, about eleven or twelve o'clock my son brought them back; they are the same as I lost - I had had them some time.</p>

            , JUN. I am the prosecutor's son. I turned the mare and gelding into the field at three o'clock in the afternoon of the 23d of June - I went again in the morning, a little after five o'clock, and they were gone. I traced them out of the pasture, and found the posture gate taken of its hinges; it had been locked. I came to town about eleven or twelve o'clock, and about one or two I found them at Mr. White's stable, Back-hill, near Hatton-garden. I am certain they are my father's.</p>

            . I am a licensed horse-slaughterer, and live in Coppice-row, and have stables on Back-hill. On the 24th of June, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I was called up by the prisoner, to purchase two horses; he brought them to be slaughtered. I did not know him before. One was a young horse, between four and five years old, not fit for slaughter. He offered them both for 6 l.; I said they were too good to be killed, what was his reason for wishing them killed, and had he got any note? - he said the two horses had run away, and broken a child's leg, and were to be killed for that. He at first said they belonged to Mrs. Whittle, of Chelmsford, and then to Mrs. Wickham, of Rickle, Essex. I told him to walk down to my stables with the horses, which he did, and I called up Read, the officer, who lives opposite to my stables. I sent to the toll man at Whitechapel turnpike, who gave Poole information when he enquired about them.</p>

            . I am servant to White. About half-past five o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoner in Cow-cross, with the horses - he asked a man where there was a knacker's; I went up, and asked what he wanted, and told him they were too good to be killed; he said they must be killed. I took him to Mr. White. Poole's son saw the horses in my master's stable, and took them away.</p>
               <p>MR. POOLE. The two horses were worth 40 l.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody, and asked where he brought the horses from; he said he had them from Mrs. Wickham, at Rickle, and if I would let him go he would bring a note to me about them. I saw Poole, who claimed them. I went again to fetch the prisoner before the Magistrate, and said,</p>
               <p>"You have been telling me falsehoods, for they came from Upminster, and it was there you took them from" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I did; I think the devil was in me; I took them through distress." I found only 3 1/2 d. on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a lady and gentleman; I had neither money or victuals - I was telling them my story; they gave me 1 s., and said if I would take these two horses to town, (and told me where to take them to,) and they would give me 6 l. I took them from Upminster-common. The gentleman told me to stop there till he fetched them. I brought them up, and the young man asked what I was to have for them; I said 6 l. I did not know what was to be done to them. I have had a hurt in my head, and am not quite so right in my mind as I ought to be.</p>

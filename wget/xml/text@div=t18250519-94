I was on shore on the 14th of May, and lodged at the Ship, public-house, in Shakespeare-walk - I had seen the prisoner a few days before; after supper I came into the tap-room: she asked me to go home with her - I refused, and said I had no money; she took hold of my jacket, and said, "Never mind, come with me;" I went and staid with her all night: I awoke in the morning about half-past six o'clock - I missed my jacket, trowsers, and shoes. I was quite sober. I have seen the shoes since.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He had no money, and took his jacket and trowsers off, and said he would pawn them, but it was too late that night, I might take them in the morning. I had sent my own shoes to mend, and had no others to put on but his; I thought I could give them to him again.</p>

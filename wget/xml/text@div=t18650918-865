                  </hi>. I am a waiter at the Civil Service Club, <hi rend="italic">St.</hi> James's-street—on Friday, 18th August, about half-past 11 at night, I went with Richard King into a public-house in Little James-street—the prisoner was there, quarrelling with another man—I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself, because he was going to strike this man, who was very old, between sixty and seventy—the prisoner made no answer, but went outside—I left about half a minute after, and when I got outside he struck me with a knife—I did not know he had a knife in his hand—I thought it was his fist—he struck at my breast—I put my arm up, and the knife went into my elbow, and came out at the top—he then ran away—my coat was cut open, and the blood was running very fast—the knife went in right through the muscle, about seven or eight inches—I ran after the prisoner, and when I caught him, I struck him several times—I gave him into custody—I had no quarrel with him before I left the public-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Civil Service Club, and I was with the last witness on the 18th August, in this public-house—the prisoner and another man were having some words—he called the man a liar three or four times, and wanted to fight him, and the prosecutor said, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself," and the prisoner told him to mind his own business—the prisoner then went out of the public-house; directly we got outside I saw him strike the prosecutor—not a word was said to him out-side before he struck him—I never struck at the prisoner at all—the prosecutor did after he had stabbed him—I followed him, and gave him into custody—he said that he was very sorry for it.</p>

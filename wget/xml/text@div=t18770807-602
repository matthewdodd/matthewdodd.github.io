I am cashier to Joseph Causton and Son, of East-cheap—the prisoner was manager of a West-end department, at 18, Parlia<lb></lb>ment Street—at the end of each week he was supposed to make out what we term a requisition for cash, for the amount of salary due to the employees in Parliament Street, any amount due for overtime, and his own salary—he handed me this requisition for the week ending 14th July, it amounts to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and is made up of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. charged for wages, meaning over-time, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for management, that means wages, fixed salaries, and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his own salary—he kept a wages' book in which he entered the par<lb></lb>ticulars of the overtime—in the week ending 14th July, the overtime is entered as 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Mr. Calver, 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Webb, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Printer—in the week ending 21st July, the requisition is wages 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., manage<lb></lb>ment 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the prisoner's own salary 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is made up in the wages' book of 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Mr. Calver, 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for Mr. Webb, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for Mr. Cross, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner had the entire management at Parliament Street—I should consider Webb and Calver under him—the word wages signifies overtime and work done by men out of the house—he would have a bill of the overtime handed to him by the different parties and he would enter it in a book of his own—he was not there on 14th July—Mr. Calver used to take the management in his absence; he has not succeeded to the prisoner's post, one of the gentlemen from Eastcheap has been sent to take the management for the time being, I can't say whether Mr. Calver is to succeed the prisoner—the prisoner's salary was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he was at Bristol on the 14th on business of the firm-—his duty was traveling principally, besides managing the affairs of the West End branch; he was traveller and manager, he would have to keep both accounts, it is a pretty fair business, the whole business is very large, the branch has only been opened about two years—there is no reason why the business should not be very large.</p>

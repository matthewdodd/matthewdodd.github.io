                  </hi>. I am a seaman, living at Green's Sailors' Home, Poplar—on Saturday night, 14th November, about 12 o'clock, I had been drinking a little—I had a parcel, which I took home, and came out again—the prisoner and another man stood at the door till I came out—I asked them where I could get something to drink—they said they would show me, and went with me to a house—I treated them, and after we came out we were joined by two or three other men—I wanted to part company with them, but they would not leave me—they wanted me to go up a street, and I did not want to go—they pushed me, and said, "Come this way"—I said, "No"—one man kicked me on my legs, and the prisoner put his hand in my pocket—I shifted a 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note into my watch-pocket, and I had some silver as well—I said "Keep your hand out of my pocket," and sung out for the police, and told a policeman I was robbed of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner came up, and I recognized him, and gave him in custody—I am able to say that he is the man who had his hand in my pocket—I had been in the public-house with him ten minutes, and we had two glasses of rum each—I swear positively he is the man, but the other three men I know nothing about.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not put my hand in his pocket at all. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes you did—I had a fight in the Sailors' Home, about a watch and chain—I gave it to a man to keep, and then wanted it back, and he would not give it to me—I had both the watch and chain, and a sovereign, in silver—I had a glass of stout and some beer—I do not know how much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman—on Saturday, at the closing of the houses, I came out, and this gentleman gave the sailor a chain to mind—he wanted it back, and the sailor would not give it to him—he drew out the chain and a pair of kid gloves, and then they went up the court, and I went to the gate, and when he came out he asked me where he would get some drink, and we went and had two glasses of rum each—when we were going home he would not go down the street but went a little higher up—three more <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> came up and wanted to shove him down one of the streets—the prisoner was not one of those three—he was by my side—I saw the gentleman talking to a policeman, and said "Why do not you go into the Home?"—the gentleman said "This is one," and he was locked up, and I was taken, too, but was freed—I have a card in my pocket of where he changed the other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—one he changed with the Superintendent of the Home, and the other at Mr. Ruff's.</p>

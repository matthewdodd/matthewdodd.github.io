                  </hi>. I am eighteen years old—I am suffering imprison<lb></lb>ment for this offence—I was in Mr. Cherrill's service—I took two bags of jewellery from there, and took them to a public-house in Whitechapel, with Charters, who parted with two chains, a key, a locket, and some ear-rings—I then went with him to a coffee-shop opposite, where we slept and had the jewellery in the room—next morning we went to Levin's house in Mill-lane, Deptford—Levin has also another place there, a picture-frame shop in the Broadway—the house in Mill-lane was a lodging-house; there were bed-rooms in it—the bags were torn up when we went there, and Charters carried the jewellery in a handkerchief—when we got to Mill-lane we saw several people sitting there, and Charters' woman who was living with him, asked him whether they had got a lodging—that was Richardson; she went with us, and I saw Levin, but nothing took place that night—this was Saturday—on the Monday night Charters sold Levin a pair of emerald ear<lb></lb>rings for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which were worth two guineas, in the presence of Richardson's wife and myself—the bundle was at that time up stairs—I cannot tell whether Levin saw it, but he asked Charters what he had got—he said that he had got some things—Levin asked him whether they had come from town or London—"Town" is Deptford—Charters made no answer—Levin then said he had got a brother-in-law at Brighton, who would buy the jewellery if he could not sell them in London—the money was not paid; Levin said that he would give it to him by and by—on the Sunday night before this Monday, I went with Charters to Clark, who lives two or three doors from the corner of Dunk-street, Whitechapel—it is a private house—we knocked at the door, and went into the front parlour; it was between 8 and 9 in the evening—it is a sitting-room—Mr. and Mrs. Clark were there—Charters produced six Alberts and three guard chains from his pocket, which had</p>

               <p>come from Mr. Cherrill's, and said he had got soma nice things to tell—Clark asked him to let him look at them, and said that he would give him 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce for them—they were weighed—Charters said he had got some more, and Clark asked him to bring them there, which he said he would on Monday night about the same time—I went and sold him the remainder of the chains, at the same price—they were weighed and sold for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Clark paid him 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that night—Clark asked him where they came from—Char<lb></lb>ters said, "From the City; I have left the boy at home"—Clark said, "That's right, don't bring him here, so as he won't know the house"—I went on the Tuesday, between 8 and 9, and sold him some coloured gold ear-rings, and some pins belonging to Mr. Cherrill, part of what I had taken—I went every night up to the following Monday night—it began on Sunday, and Monday week was the last time we went with the goods—Charters received about 90<hi rend="italic">
l</hi>. altogether—the ear-rings and pins, brooches and lockets were not sold by weight—Mr. Clark said he would buy a lot of keys to attach to the Alberts so that they should not be known, because the Alberts had no keys—the sale took place by candle light—the outside shutters were sometimes closed when I went there, and sometimes when we went there he would close them—I went backwards and forwards to Levin—Clark's wife was in the parlour at the time the goods were sold—when Levin told Charters that he had a brother-in-law at Brighton who would buy the jewellery, Charters said that he did not want him, he had plenty of men in London who would buy, and he had a man in London who would buy any amount—on the Monday when he sold him the ear-rings, Charters gave Levin a seal and key and a turquoise pin; they came from Mr. Cherrill's—I remained at Levin's a fortnight, and when I left I went to New Norfolk-street, Commercial-road, and stopped another week with Charters—after that I went home and surren<lb></lb>dered myself—I am now suffering imprisonment—on the Thursday, the day after I left Levin's, I went with Charters, and he asked Levin for the jewel<lb></lb>lery and money—Levin said that he had thrown it over the bridge—Char<lb></lb>ters said, "You don't mean to tell me that you have thrown 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stuff and 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. away—after a good deal of talking, he gave him 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and offered him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the goods—he said he had not got them, he had thrown them over the bridge—I never saw Mr. Cherrill's goods again after that.</p>

On 4th December, about half-past 3 in the afternoon, I was with sergeant Evans and private Fall in the City-road, and saw Clark and Cullingworth together, going very fast towards the City, as we were going towards Islington—I knew them both by sight—it is a very wide road—we consulted together, crossed over, and stopped them—I took Cullingworth, searched him, and found in his waist<lb></lb>coat pocket, this gold watch with a dog's head on it, which has since been owned, and this carbuncle pin; in his coat-pocket I found these two plated salts and this gold chain—he was trying to get away, and I saw Fall take from his other waistcoat-pocket this gold watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him how he came by them—he said, "Well, they were given to me by another person to carry"—I said, "Who is that person; do you mean your friend Clark?"—he said, "Well, you know all about that"—we took him to the station, where he was searched, and a pocket-book found by Evans containing eight duplicates—I went to the pawnbrokers they represented, and we have the property here—I saw Evans take from his pocket at the station a watch movement without the case; it was going—some silver was, I believe, also taken from him—he gave his address, 82, and afterwards 22, Pelham-street Spitalfields—we did not go there, because we knew his address was in Church-street, but we went carefully into the neighbourhood, and ultimately went to 6, Union-street, and made inquiries—we found his daughter in the second<lb></lb>floor front room—Sergeant Evans and Fall were with me—we remained in the room, and heard, I think, three knocks at the door—Evans went down instead of the girl, and let Mrs. Clark into the house—she came upstairs before him; went over towards the girl, who was holding a baby, and passed something to her—Evans said, "That won't do; what have you given to the girl, "pulling her hand from under the child's clothes, and taking from it a gold watch, which was wet with aquafortis, having just been tried and not wiped off—I searched the room, and found in the middle drawer of a chest of drawers the two halves of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which I have not been able to trace; also five sovereigns, a quantity of linen handkerchiefs, pieces of silk, and other articles, which are not owned—I took Levin in custody, and we apprehended Charters the same morning, brought them together in the station, and charged them together—Charters said to Levin, "Oh, you are here, are you?"—Levin said, "I do not know you"—Charters said, "What don't you remember the 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you gave me at Deptford"—he said, "No, I do not remember it"—he said, "Do you remember the 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stuff which my girl took to your house in Deptford-bridge, and the 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with it, and if I had not threatened to put myself away with you for the lot, you would not have given me up the money, would you?"—he said, "I don't know anything about it"—he said, "Well, you must be a villain; do you recollect the gold emerald ear-rings I sold you for your wife for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>, <hi rend="italic">on behalf of Levin, objected that in this Indictment Levin was charged with receiving, whereas by common law two persons could not be charged with stealing and receiving, but only under the Statute</hi> (24 25 Victoria, c. 96), <hi rend="italic">that there must either be Counts charging a substantive felony, or Levin must be charged as an accessory; the Count either charged him as a receiver accessorially, or charged a substantive felony, and it did not charge the former because it did not disclose that the goods were stolen by any principal: it alleged that he received goods which had been before then feloniously stolen, which goods might have been stolen by Charters, but not received from him: and the Indictment not showing who was the principal to whom Levin was accessory, was therefore bad. Next, if the Count amounted to anything, it was a Count charging Levin as a receiver substantively; therefore the prosecution must be put to their election, there being no Statute by which they could charge the substantive stealing by one person and the substantive felony of receiving by another person in the same Indictment: and further, that as the Count was in fact intended to be accessorial, there was nothing to connect the goods in the second Count with the goods in the first: it simply said that they were stolen; they might have been stolen by some<lb></lb>body else, and Levin was entitled to know who did steal them.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. T. ATKIN<lb></lb>SON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted, that as the articles in the first Count were repeated in the second, the Indictment saying</hi> "<hi rend="italic">the said two leather bags" it was not necessary to add the words "so stolen.</hi>" <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HAWTHORNE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">on the same side, stated that the words of the Act were, "knowing the same to have been stolen," not "to have been so stolen" which under the</hi> 92 <hi rend="italic">Section were unnecessary; that by Lord Campbell's Act the receiver might be indicted with the thief, or separately; that there was enough on the face of the Indictment, to identify the goods in the second Count with those in the first, and that the word "</hi> so" <hi rend="italic">had been purposely left out by the Legislature.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">in reply urged that there must be some connexion of the property, and that though Mr. Hawthorne's argument would be good were there only one prisoner, it was not so when there was more than one, and contended further, that there was no evidence to go to the Jury, as Levin was charged with receiving the said leather bags, and other articles, that the word</hi>" said" <hi rend="italic">might only apply to the leather bags, and as an accessory after the fact, he must be told what property he was charged with receiving: also that there was no evidence of his receiving any bags. Lastly, there were four witnesses who were all accomplices either in the stealing, receiving, or disposition of the property, and as the evidence of one accomplice must not be allowed to strengthen the evidence of the others, they were unconfirmed. The only corroboration was that Levin denied knowing Charters, whereas he did know him, but that corrobora<lb></lb>tion not being on a material point, was no corroboration at all.</hi>

            , at the Globe, in Fleet-street; I asked a watchman, and I turned on my right hand towards Temple-bar, where he thought I could get such a thing; I then asked another watchman, and some gentleman directed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150124"></xptr>me across Shire-lane; a little up Shire-lane was the prisoner; she accosted me, and said, she would shew me where I could get it; with that she brought me up the lane, and desired me to turn up on my left hand, she then desired me to turn again on my left hand, which brought me into <placeName id="t17921215-84-crimeloc475">Ship-yard</placeName>

               <p>Q. Had you any connexion with the woman? - No, none at all; I was too anxious in my business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I met him in Fleet-street, the city side of Temple-bar; he asked me, if I could tell him where he could get some whiskey; I went with him up Shire-lane; they were shut up; he turned down, and went to Ship-yard; they were shut up there, and he and I stayed at the end of a court together; he asked me, where I lived; I told him; he said, it was too far; he said, he would give me a shilling, if I would let him have connection with me in this court; it was close by a necessary; he wanted me to lay down in this necessary; I told him no, I did not chuse to do any thing of the like; he said, if I would, he would give me another afterwards; I said, I did not approve of it; he said, I might be damned, and the 1 s. too; he went away from me; I set on the necessary about a minute, having occasion to make water; I heard him speak to the watchman; says he, did you see a woman go by here; no, says the watchman; then she must be in the place where I left her, he said; he came to me, and said, I believe you have picked my pocket of three guineas; Lord, sir! says I, I have not told gold this good while, I have only this shilling you gave me; says he, watchman, I give charge of her; I was taken to the watch-house; the constable asked me, what money I had about me; I told him, but 1 s. the constable asked him, if he gave me a shilling; He said, yes, for charity; the constable asked me to strip my clothes off; I did to my shift; he searched even my bonnet and cap. The constable said, I have found nothing, and if, you think, I have not done you justice, take and strip her again. The gentleman at Bow-street told him, it was impossible for me to rob him if he had no connexion; he said, he believed, I must come on the side of him in some odd manner, and take it out of his pocket; he asked him, what he gave the shilling for; he said, he gave me the shilling out of charity, and had nothing at all to do with me, nor I had nothing to do with him, than I have to do with him this moment; if I had robbed him, I would not have stopped in the same place as where he left me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She deceived me, by not directing me to the place I thought she would; she tore my things all open.</p>
               <p>Q. How could she get her hands into your pocket? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your money? - In my left hand breeches pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you in the house?</p>
               <p>Badcock. They dragged me into a house, and into a room on the left hand side.</p>

               <p>Badcock. Yes, we had but three pints betwixt three of us; I went and got a constable, and went and laid hold of Gray; then the other two prisoners came up and struck me; then the constable laid hold of one of them, the other got off; we got them to the watch house, and then the constable went out and took the other; the constable searched them, and found 7 s. 2 d. and two farthings upon them; I lost two farthings, one a plain one, the other a remarkable one; them found upon them were such; I had been eating some cheese, and some stuck to two of the shillings; and two of the shillings found upon Carney, had cheese stuck to them.</p>

            . I am headborough; going my rounds, I got in, and sat down in the watch-house; the miller came, and said he had been robbed; he showed me the house; (a very bad house) there was no body in the house; I heard the voice of a woman in the street; the miller said that was one of them; we went and he took Gray: after that, I took the other two, and upon Carney I found 7 s. 2 d. and two farthings; I persuaded the man to make it up; we took them down to the lower watch-house; they wanted to make it up, the miller would not; ( the money produced in court.) The prosecutor swore to them all; he described the man, but I cannot meet with him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Badcock. Did you sit down in a chair?</p>
               <p>Badcock. They dragged me into a chair.</p>

               <p>The other two prisoners said the same.</p>

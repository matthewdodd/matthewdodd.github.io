I made an excuse for the prisoner to call on me in the morning, for me to give him the vender's ticket, and as soon as he had set off I looked at the coals, and found they were altered, and deficient, and among the rest I missed two of the lumps which I had marked the night before, I went after the waggon, which the prisoner was driving with three chaldrons of coals - the front one was for Mr. Snark, the middle one for a new customer, and the hind one was for a smith, and was a particularly small coal. When I got to Holloway the only thing I saw in the waggon, beside what he ought to have, was a truss of clover hay - I followed it on to Upper Holloway, and when it got to a house which I thought was a receiving house, I stopped the waggon; the prisoner came to the back of it, and I said, "James, I am astonished that you should continue robbing us in this way, after the lenity we have shewn you, in forgiving you in the former instance, and I insist upon knowing what you have done with the coals taken from the first shed" - he hesitated, and I thought from his manner he was about to run; I said, "Don't run, as I am armed; but I insist upon knowing what you have done with them;" he said, "I hope you will forgive me, Sir - they are upon the waggon, and I will never do so again." I said he had made the same promise before, but it had now become too serious a matter: I then called to the man who was with him, and desired him to get into the waggon, and put the coals on James' back, as he should carry them back to the wharf; the prisoner said, "They are not in the sack." I then desired the man to take the whip, and go back with me to the turnpike gate. I got into the waggon, and in the hind chaldron the mouths of the sacks had been held up, and filled with round picked coals, and in one of the sacks was one of the lumps which I had marked the previous night - the bushel measure was likewise filled with round coals, and a corn sack had above a bushel in it; the whole of them was two or three bushels altogether.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did you tell him you were armed? A. Yes. - I did not tell him I would shoot him - three porters had loaded the coals - he might have had them, and some other person have put them into the sacks.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far was he from your premises when you began to watch him? A. I suppose he was a mile and a half.</p>

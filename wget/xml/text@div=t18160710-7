As I was going up Petticoat-lane; a person rushed right across me; he ran against me; as I was endeavouring to defend myself, the person suddenly pulled my watch out of my fob, and ran off immedieately; he came from the opposite side of the way, and ran across me in a side direction. I had not observed him on the opposite side of the way; I have every reason to suppose he ran from a door against which he stood. The push was violent; I did not fall by it; it moved me from the position I was in; it moved me on one side. I immediately hallooed out to the watchman, and called stop thief. The watchman called stop thief; I did not at all perceive the countenance of the person who ran up to me in this way; the person who was running from me, I lost sight of. He was pursued, and taken within two or three minutes; I learned that he was taken, and that my watch was safe. I have had my watch ever since. The watch was delivered to me the next day by the officer; it is worth fifteen pounds. The person I found in custody was the prisoner; he was a stranger to me quite. I was quite sensible of what was going on.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner in the evening of the 7th of April; I saw the prosecutor that evening also. I did not see him before the complaint of being robbed; I first heard he was robbed, about ten minutes before eleven o'clock that night. I saw the prisoner cross upon Mr. Wood; he walked over to him; I was then about ten yards behind them, and expected there was something going forward. The prisoner was alone; I kept my eye on him. A scuffle ensued between the two parties; he caught hold of him, as I suppose. The prisoner, as I suppose, by the collar, and I saw his arm drawn, and I expected he had a watch at the same time; I did not see what it was. Mr. Wood cried thief, several times. Petticoat-lane is partly in the City, and partly in the County. That part were they were was in the County part. I proceeded after the prisoner; I saw his person many times before; I went after him when there was a call of stop thief; I lost sight of him for a short time, but caught it again; he was the only person who ran at the cry of stop thief. I laid hold of him in a turning which leads out of Petticoat lane into Gullstone-street. When I was about two yards behind him, I saw him stoop, and he put the watch down in the corner of a step of a door; it was a moon-light night, and when he had taken his hand from the place,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100008"></xptr>I saw the watch glisson; I perceived it was a watch. I caught hold of him immediately; he asked me what was the matter, and I did not make him any reply, but secured him. I stooped down, and picked up the watch; it was the same watch which was afterwards returned to the prosecutor. I then brought him into Petticoat-lane, and took him to Aldgate watchhouse. The prosecutor came up in three or four minutes. I shewed the watch to the prosecutor, and he owned it to be his, as the watch he had been robbed of.</p>



               <p>Joseph Wood. Re-examined. I was very much in liquor, I will allow; I have no knowledge of the man taking hold of my collar. I know there was something of a scuffle, and in that scuffle, I lost my watch.</p>

               <p>Q. You admitted that you were the worse for liquor, but said that you knew what was going on. Now have you ever said, at any time, or in any place, that you were seized by the collar - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you be so seized without knowing it at the time - A. It might have taken place without my remembering it; as to being collared, I don't recollect it.</p>

               <p>CHARLES HAMBLETON. I am a watchman. Just before eleven o'clock, I was standing against the door; I observed Mr. Wood standing opposite me, with his chain and seals hanging showey out. There was a man stood along side of me; I don't know who he was; be seemed to take greatnotice of Mr. Wood, very much. I then saw Mr. Wood advance towards Whitechapel, on the right hand side. This man rushed into the Black Lion, and then the prisoner came out; the prisoner was not the man who stood by me; I knew him well before; I had seen him very often about the place, As soon as I saw him go forward, I called to Kinley, and said, that gentleman will lose his watch before he goes any farther. I had a light in my lanthorn, a candle was pretty fresh, and the moon shone pretty light. Kinley called me back, and said stop with your light, I will go forward. I did not go forwards enough to see what was done. I heard the cry of stop thief; he was not quite in my sight then; nor was Mr. Wood quite. I stopped momentarily, for I knew which direction they would take. I heard Kinley's rattle spring, and came up directly, and the next I saw of the prisoner was when he had hold of him. The prisoner came out of the Black Lion alone, and crossed the way alone.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am totally innocent. There was a cry of stop thief, or something of that, and I was running with the others, and there was a man near where the property was found.</p>

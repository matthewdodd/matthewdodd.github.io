            . I am an officer of Mile-end. On the 19th of August, I met the prisoner in Mile-end-road with a bundle, and asked what he had got in it, he said, some things which he had brought from Colchester. I asked who from, he said from a friend, and was going to take them to his sister at Limehouse. I said he was going a direct line from there, and asked what was in the bundle, he said there was a curtain, and he could not tell the rest exactly. I secured him, and found out the prosecutor - he was three miles from Stratford.</p>

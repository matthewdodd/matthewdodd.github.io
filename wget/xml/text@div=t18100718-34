Yes, a draft of an hundred pound on my banker in Pall Mall; I sent the prisoner to the banker's for the purpose of receiving cash for it; he returned with an hundred pound in bank notes, fifty two pound notes; after I had received these notes, I put six pound in my pocket, and put ninety-four pound into my writing-desk; it stood on a table upon another writing-desk.</p>
               <p>Q. What apartment did you occupy there - A. The first door. On Saturday, the 16th of June, about half past eight in the evening, I left my apartment, I did not return home that night; I was informed of the fire the next morning, I went home immediately, I went up into my room, I saw there had been a fire between the boards and the ceiling; and the papers had been on fire near to where the couch stood, it was almost on the other side of the room. My writing-desk, the hinges had been broken open and there was not one note remaining in the desk.</p>

               <p>Q. You keep this house in Sackville-street - A. I do, I lived in that house twenty years, it is in the parish of St. James's. On the night the fire happened, I went to bed about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that the prisoner was in the house - A. I do not; I did not come in till half after eleven, I did not see him. A little before four o'clock in the morning, I awoke with smoke about my bed, which got into my throat and awoke me; the smoke came into my room, it is a two pair of stairs room, immediately over Mr. Tufton's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180025"></xptr>room, in the first floor. I immediately touched my daughter, who was in bed with me, and told her there was a great smoke, and went into the front room, and in one corner of the room, where there was a cupboard, I perceived a great deal of smoke, and in the other there was but little; I ran immediately down stairs to the first floor, front room, and opened it, a torrent of smoke rushed out but no flame whatever. I turned round to go up stairs to get something to cover me, and to see my child was safe, I saw the prisoner behind me, he was about three or four stairs behind me when I looked round; I went up to put my clothes on, I found my daughter upon the top of the stairs coming down, my daughter passed me; I went into my room to put my petticoat on, and ran out of the house immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say how he was dressed at the time you saw him on the stairs - A. I think he was in his shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day following you had some reason for searching of different places to find the notes - A. I searched the things all round the kitchen, after the prisoner was taken up, and at night, Mr. Roton, a neighbour, found a tin canaster in the chimney piece, in a nook on the left hand side, that canaster contained some notes, and the notes were counted on the kitchen table; I think there were ninety-two pound, they were all two pound notes, I saw them counted.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner before you went to bed - A. Yes, in the kitchen, sitting by the fire with the maid-servant. When my mother awoke me she told me she smelled a smoke, I got up immediately, I dressed myself and went down to Mr. Tufton's room door, I saw the prisoner there, he was in his shirt, he opened his master's bed room door, and then the drawing room door; he said, here it is; he turned round and went up stairs, he left both the doors open, I said, gracious God why do you leave them open; the smoke came so strong that nobody could come down stairs; I shut both the doors and went into the street immediately, and gave the alarm at the Dutchess of Rutland, and asked for the assistance of the porter who slept in the hall. On Sunday, after the prisoner was taken up, I found a two pound note amongst some rubbish and papers in the back kitchen.</p>

On this night I went to bed at half past twelve o'clock, I heard two o'clock strike, and three o'clock strike; about three o'clock I heard a noise on the stairs, as if somebody had been coming up stairs; the next thing I heard was Mrs. Thompson's servant, saying, Lord have mercy upon us, that was a little before four o'clock; she then called out my name and called out fire. I heard Mrs. Thompson say, the fire is in the drawing room, pray shut the door; and the first thing I saw when I got out of my door, was the prisoner coming up stairs; I returned to my room, which by that time was full of smoke, I put on my pantaloons and coat and went out as fast as I could, with a bundle that came from my washerwoman, and went through the prisoner's room, and the first thing I saw was the prisoner sitting on the leads; I went across the leads to the other house, and went down that house into the street; I saw some loose men's apparel laying on the leads.</p>

            . Q. You were a servant in this house of Mrs. Thompson's, at the time of the fire - A. Yes. On the evening before the fire, the prisoner came home earlier than usual, I cannot tell what time it was. He went into Mr. Tufton's apartment, and from there came into the kitchen; I said, you have been a good while in your master's apartment; he said, he had been reading Mrs. Clarke's book. The prisoner went to bed before me; I went to bed about half past twelve, and nigh four o'clock, my mistress alarmed me, I put on some of my things and cried fire. I ran down into the kitchen and drawed water as fast as I was able.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the morning after the fire happened, seeing the prisoner in the back kitchen - A. Yes, sitting in a chair in the back kitchen by the screen, the screen was before the fire place, that was not a place he used to sit in, he used to be in the front kitchen. I was in the kitchen when Miss Thompson picked up a two pound note, I saw it in her hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When you went up stairs to bed, do not you know that the prisoner was in bed - A. Yes; I had some conversation with him, I saw no light; I sleep on the same floor with him; I did not see any candle in his room.</p>

            . Q. You are a fireman at the Sun fire office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the night you was stopped going to another place, on the morning about four o'clock, you came immediately to Mrs. Thompson's house - A. Yes, the engine stopped by the door; I ran in doors and went up the first flight of stairs and opened the drawing room door, the smoke came out very thick; expecting that the fire was in that room, I shut the door and went down stairs again; I saw Dr. Brown moving some of his things out of the front parlour, I desired him not to move any more, but to supply me with water, I could stop the fire, I thought. At that time Butler brought me up water, I opened the door and saw a fire to the right, I have three or four buckets of water upon it; Butler, one of our people, crawled upon his hands and knees forward from the door, and by that felt another fire on the floor; he told me of it, I desired him to come back, and threw three or four buckets of water on it; I then felt with my hand to the left side of the room, and felt a frame of a picture, I passed it by to the door, and I think Mrs. Thompson took it of me, she said it was a valuable picture, she was very happy to think it was saved; I put my hand as far as I could with any safety, and felt a table, I took the table by the leg, I had no opportunity of knowing whether there was any thing upon it or no; I passed, the table along; I then took the corner of the carpet and found there was something that stopped it, whether it was stuck down, I cannot say, we could not get it away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180026"></xptr>easy; I then desired Butler again to open the window to get the smoke out of the room; he opened the two upper shutters of one of the windows, he was obliged to retreat; I went and got the lower one's open, and throwed my head out of the window to get some air, the room was full of smoke, I went to the other window and did the like; in a little time the room was cleared of the smoke, and having the light we could see, and with the axe we ripped up the floor to see the extent of the fire; we thought it safe, we got to the extent of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that the part where your companion complained of heat - A. Yes, of that side.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had the boards up, could you distinguish whether any fuel of any sort had been placed under the boards - A. No, but the fire appeared to me to have been underneath.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Did you see the prisoner at this time - A. When I was in the act of ripping the boards up, the prisoner stood to my right, he had got a writing desk in his hand; he asked me whether I thought it was the effect of the fire that had damaged the desk, he opened it, and said the hinges were broke; there are two catches to the lock, I saw one of them were broke; I asked him where it stood, he said on the table; I said, it might fall when I moved the table, and might sever the hinges by falling on one corner, that is all that past between him and me. I cannot recollect I heard any thing fall when I moved the table, I did not see it before I saw it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the desk, does there appear on that desk any damage occasioned by fire - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Had the prisoner, or any body else, an opportunity of going into the room after you were there, and bringing any thing out of the room, between your going in and opening the drawing room door - A. There was no opportunity, before the windows were opened nobody could get into the room, they could not have lived there. I saw the prisoner in the room with the box, while I was in the act of ripping the floor up, about four or five minutes after the window had been opened.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tuston. That is my box that I locked my bank notes in.</p>

This plan was made under my direction, by the surveyor of the Westminster fire office; I went in the room about ten o'clock the Sunday morning of the fire; when I went into the room the boards had been taken up, as in this plan; I saw the girders were exposed and burnt on each side of them; the boards of the floor were laying loose about the room, just as they had been taken up by the firemen; I directed the men to replace them in the same situation as they were before, which was very easily done; which being done, I was enabled to judge in what manner the fire has been put to that part of the flooring; the upper part of the flooring boards were not burnt, and in one of the boards an aperture had been made, and the under part of the boards were burnt to charcoal in some parts nearly through.</p>
               <p>Court. How large was the aperture - A. About three inches by four; the hole had not been originally so large, but the fire having burned through had made it so large; the joints of the boards were also burnt, but no part of the upper surface, I made the men, and I examined myself under the boards, but as a great deal of charcoal had fell from the upper boards, it was impossible to see whether combustible matter had been put in or not. That part of the girder where most of the fire had been, and that was near the aperture, was almost burnt through. Finding that the carpet had been over this floor, I directed the men to spread that carpet out, and I found an aperture in the carpet, and also the carpet burnt in those parts that were over the cracks, and in no other parts except corresponding to the hole. I supposed that it was probable these girders might run into the chimney of the next house, that fire might communicate; I went into the next house and found no stack of chimneys of that side, and therefore it was impossible for the fire to communicate from that house; from all the circumstances that I have mentioned, it did then appear to me that the fire was caused by something having been put in this aperture. I then cast my eyes on the other side of the room, and saw a sopha standing up in the corner, one half of which that is the furthest from the fire, was burnt, the back of the sopha was burnt out and part of the bottom, the most distant part nearest the wall; but that part of the sopha near the fire in the floor was not burnt; the distance from the other fire, to that part of the sopha that was on fire, was twelve feet. There was a table stood between the fire in the floor and the sopha, with two candles upon it, and them candles not melted, so that no fire could have gone across the room; from all these circumstances, it appeared to have been set on fire in two parts; and recently before the men went into the room, because they found the papers on fire when they went into the room.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. As they told you - A. I am going further than I know of my own knowledge. I did observe some peculiarities of the prisoner, he seemed to attend to every thing that was said.</p>

            . I live in Vigo-lane. I sleep in the first floor; the leads of the second floor nearly adjoin the house that was on fire. About four o'clock in the morning that the fire happened I was awoke by a noise, it was as if the cieling would come through.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that more than once - A. Twice. I went up to the leads afterwards, and saw two boxes lying upon the leads of the house where I live.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On Sunday I went to Mrs. Thompson's house. Mr. Tuston had the prisoner called into his parlour. I asked him what time he came home the night before. I am not quite correct to the time; he came home, he said, a long time before the fire, and went to bed: then, I said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180027"></xptr>it seems there is no doubt but somebody belonging to the house set fire to the house; can you account for it in any way. He said no, he could not, he supposed I suspected him. I said, we suspected every body, until it was traced to its proper soure, and desired to see his box. He said he would be d - nd if he had done it. I searched his box; he ready let me look at it. One was locked up; I could not then see it. I sealed it up. The other one he opened himself; in that was this glove, containing some stone brinstone. I searched the back kitchen, and then I took him to the office. After I had taken him to the office, we had a fresh search in the back kitchen. I found nothing there. In the front kitchen I found another piece of brinstone in a drawer, that I understood was his drawer Mr. Tufton shewed me the writing desk, I thought it had been broken open by a chisel. I asked if any chisel was lying about the house. Mrs. Thompson brought me this chisel. I applied it to the impression made upon this desk; it is exactly the size of the impression; it his the appearance of two impressions on it. I found some linen of Mr. Tufton's in the prisoner's room.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Thompson. The officer has produced a chisel, is that the chisel you gave him - A. Yes, I found it in the basket where such things usually are kept, in the back kitchen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. to Mr. Brown. You was stating the search you made to be to ascertain the cause of this fire. Had any brimstone been made use of to cause that fire - A. No, I am certain of that, there was no appearance of sulphur, brimstone always leaves a smell a long while.</p>
               <p>MR. ROTON. I live at No. 5, Sackville-street. I happened to go into Mrs. Thompson's house on the Sunday evening. After searching about the house and finding nothing, I looked up the front kitchen chimney; on the left I saw a hole; I saw this canister: the maid put her hand up and took it down, very much terrified indeed. I immediately went up stairs with it and counted the notes, they were two-pound notes to the amount of ninety-two pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, the first alarm that I heard was, the maid was making a noise in the room. I got up, and saw the maid dressing herself. I asked her what was the matter: she said there was a fire in the house. I ran down with my shirt and night-cap on. I went to the drawing-room and opened the door; the smoke came out so strong it nearly stifled me. I went down to the street door to see if it was open, and then I ran up into my own room, and took all my clothes and trunks and put them upon the leads. I let them down by a cord that belonged to my wife's trunk, and it stuck by the way on the railing. I put my clothes and trunks on the leads for safety. After I had done that, I ran down and assisted in extinguishing the fire. The first thing I saw was the fireman on his hands and knees. He drawed out the table and a picture of my master's. I heard the fireman call out, that there was no occasion to take the things out, he wanted water. I assisted in carrying up water as much as any body else did. I went into the room. The first thing I saw was this desk broken open. I asked the fireman if he could give any account of the desk being broken open, he could not. Mrs. Thompson was in the room at the same time that I was there. She said, why did not I take care of this desk, as the property was in it. I stationed myself in the room, to see that nobody took any thing out; I thought it was the properest place. When my master returned, he saw the desk was broken open and questioned me about it, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

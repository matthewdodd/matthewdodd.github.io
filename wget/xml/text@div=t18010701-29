             sworn. - I am a widow, at Hoxton: On Saturday last I lost a snuff-box, an old night-cap, and one shilling and sixpence; I left the snuff-box upon the bench in the public-house, and a night-cap, with one shilling and sixpence wrapped up in it; I did not see the prisoner take them, but he gave me back the snuff-box and the night-cap; I did not know him before I saw him in the public-house; the landlady called out, stop thief, and he was immediately taken up; she is not here.</p>
               <p>- HOUGHTON sworn. - I am a carpenter, in William-street, Curtain-road; about a quarter of a mile from the public-house I heared the cry of stop thief, and being an officer, I took charge of the prisoner; I asked him what was the matter; he said he had only picked up a snuff-box and an old night-cap; the old woman came up, and told me, in the hearing of the prisoner, that she had lost these things from the Hare, at Hoxton; she said he had also taken from her some duplicates, and one shilling and sixpence; he acknowledged he had taken the box and the night-cap, which, he said, he had given her back, but the one shilling and sixpence and duplicates he said he never had seen; they have never been found.</p>
               <p>(To Osborn.) Q. How came you to leave the things upon the bench? - A. I put my hand in my pocket for some halfpence to pay for my beer, and put these things upon the bench at the same time, and went away and forgot them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in the public-house, and saw the rag and the snuff-box, and the old woman said she had lost them, and I gave them her; there was no money in it. <rs id="t18010701-29-verdict169" type="verdictDescription">

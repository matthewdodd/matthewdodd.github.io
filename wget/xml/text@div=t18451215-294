                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Poplar. I went into the Reform Coffee-house, on Saturday, between twelve and one o'clock at night, for half a pint of coffee and a slice of bread and butter—there were several persons there—I fell asleep on a bench for about half an hour—I had from 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket, two knives, and a pencil-case—when I awoke I found my waistcoat cut open, and my breeches pocket also—I counted my money, and missed two half-crowns, a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and three shillings; alto the two knives, and a pencil-case—I have seen one of the knifes since—this now produced is it—I have had it between three and four years, and can swear it is mine, and was in my pocket that night when I went to sleep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gunsmith, and live in Turner's-rents, Snow's-fields, Southwark. Between one and two o'clock on Sunday morning, 14th Dec., I was in the Reform Coffee-house, Church-street, Wbitechapel—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner and prosecutor there—the prosecutor was asleep—I saw the prisoner cut his breeches pocket open, and take out a knife, a half-crown, and a hand<lb></lb>ful of silver, but what it was I cannot say—I nudged the prosecutor several times, but could not awake him—the prisoner went out, and I followed to give him into custody, but he escaped; the policeman was not near enough to him, and he got scent that the policeman was after him, and took to his heels—I was with the policeman when he was taken, about twenty-four hours after<lb></lb>wards, and while he was being taken into custody, some girl followed him—he was in the act of passing some halfpence to the girl from behind, and a knife with it—I saw the knife passing from him to the girl, and so did the policeman, and he took the knife; it dropped—there were two more persons with the prisoner when he was at the prosecutor's pocket—there were between twenty and thirty thieves there, or I should not have let him gone out—that was why I did not interfere, but I followed him out as quickly as possible.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I went with Wigley, another constable, into a coffee-shop in Brick-lane, and saw the prisoner apprehended—Wigley told him he wanted him—he said, "What for?"—he said, "For robbing a man in a coffee-shop, on Sunday morning, of 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a knife, and key"—a female came up, and I saw the prisoner pass the knife towards her—it fell down a grating, and she made a desperate resistance to get it, but 1 picked it up—in going to the station the prisoner said his father was a respectable man, and if he got over this he would work for a living.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Have you known her some time? A. Yes; I lived in the same yard with her father and mother, and she with them; she had a good character - I believe her husband has been out of work, and they were very much in distress - at the office she said she found the spoon in the garden, and sold it to Mr. Handy - the last time I saw it, it was in a table-drawer, which could be easily opened by my children - it might have been taken out by one of my children; one of them is just turned thirteen years of age.</p>

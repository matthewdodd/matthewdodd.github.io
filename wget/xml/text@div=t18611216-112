                  </hi>. I am examining officer of Customs at Graves<lb></lb>end—on the evening of 16th November, I boarded the steamer Seine from Boulonge to Gravesend at about 5 in the evening—the prisoner was a sea<lb></lb>man on board that vessel—it was my duty to examine the passengers' lug<lb></lb>gage—I examined it in midships, and the prisoner was employed to carry it aft—after I had examined a box, which proves to belong to Miss Sehmits, I gave it to the prisoner to take it aft, where all goods are deposited after undergoing examination—he threw it down, whether wilfully or not I do not know, but I believe so, and several of the articles fell on the deck—I went aft, picked them up, put them carefully in the box, and put the lid on—I remonstrated with the prisoner, and told him if it occurred again I should complain to the captain—five or ten minutes elapsed when I saw the prisoner slowy and deliberately go to the identical box, raise the lid, take several articles and put them in his pocket—I walked aft to him and ordered him to the gangway, then in the presence of Miss Schmits and several other passengers, I ordered him to deliver up the goods he had stolen from the box—he said I have not touched the box since—I said, "I saw you take several things from the box, and if you do not give them up voluntarily, I shall be compelled to take them from you"—he begged my pardon, and said that he trusted 1 would not report him—I again ordered him to take the things out</p>

               <p>of his pocket, and he produced two sleeves, and two collars, which Miss Schmitz recognised as her property—on the arrival of the vessel at Freeh<lb></lb>wharf, I communicated the whole facts to the captain of the vessel.</p>

December, in George-street, Minories—I told him I was a police-officer, and took him for stealing, on 16th November, from a box on board the vessel <hi rend="italic">Seine</hi>, between Boulogne and London, some sleeves and other articles belonging to a lady—the prisoner said, "I picked some things up, but did not steal them."</p>

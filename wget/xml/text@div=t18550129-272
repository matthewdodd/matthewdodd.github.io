                  </hi>. I am a boot maker of West Smithfield. On Friday, 12th Jan., the prisoners came and looked in at the window—Taggell then came in, and Watkins followed him directly—Taggell said that he wanted a pair of boots new fronted, which were at home, and he would fetch them in half an hour, but that they wanted to go and have a drop of ale together first—I began measuring him—he was very particular about his bunnions, to keep my attention off—I saw some boots safe in the shop while I was measuring him—Watkins Went out, and I missed them—Taggell wanted me to run after him, but I said "No," I should keep him—I gave him into custody, and then went to a public house at the corner of Glass House-yard—I waited there three quarters of an hour; Watkins came in, and I gave him into custody.</p>

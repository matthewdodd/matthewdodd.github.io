                  </hi>. I was at the Coopers' Arms public-house between eight and nine o'clock on Thursday night the 24th of February—I believe the prisoners were there when I went in—I called for a pint of beer, and while drinking it a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> occurred with Coleman and Guiseppe Maestai, who threw a pot at me, which struck me on the hat—I had done nothing to provoke him—I believe it was levelled at me, and Pelagrias struck me down with a quart pot—I became insensible with the blows—I had several pots about my shoulders—when I recovered I was taken outside the door, and taken to a surgeon's—I had not done anything to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I went to the Coopers' Arms, and found my father and the two prisoners beating him with the pots, one with a quart, and the other with a pint—I took him round the waist dragged him to the butt, and said, "Oh, my father, my father is killed"—I held him till the policeman came, and said, "For G—'s sake take them in charge!"—while I was dragging him away, the prisoners followed him with pots in their hands, and kept striking him over his shoulders and where they could—at that time he was quite insensible—I had a hard matter to keep him up at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger and butterman, at 8, Lower Belgrave Street, Pimlico—the prisoners were in my employment, Siggins for about three years as clerk, and Carpenter as a porter for about four years—Siggins' wages were 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and Carpenter's 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Thomas Hampton is my manager—in his absence it would be Siggins' duty to prepare the things to be taken out by Carpenter—he would book all the things in the day-book which would remain on the desk—Carpenter bad a. book provided for him in which to enter all the things he left at the different customers—Carpenter was away from my employment for two or three months, from January to March, 1874—a man named Brighty was with me as groom for four or five years—he left in the early part of October last, year—Hampton went for his holiday in August last, and Siggins then per<lb></lb>formed his duties, and had the whole management of the books—on 26th August I missed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about the first week in December I met Brighty at Aldridge's—he made a statement to me, in consequence of which I com<lb></lb>municated with the police, and afterwards gave the prisoners into custody.</p>

No one but Hampton, Siggins, and myself would make entries in the day-book—I have a brother-in-law named Jones—if he made any entries it would only be whilst Siggins went to dinner when Hampton was away—he was not in my employ—he came there while Hampton was on his holiday to take charge of the shop while Siggins went to his dinner, and if there was any thing to enter then, he would enter it—none of the porters would make entries—the shop was never left to the porters.</p>

I live at 14, Whitaker Street, Pimlico—during 1874 I was groom to Mr. Perks, and used to drive about with him—when I got married I had to leave—while I was there the prisoners were in the employ—Carpenter was away for about three months at the commencement of 1874—one day while he was away I saw him and Siggins together at breakfast in a coffee-shop in Buckingham Palace Road—they were sitting together conversing; I sat at the same table—Carpenter said he was going to write to the governor to see whether he would take him back, as it would be fortunate or a fortune to him to get back, as he knew more about James (meaning Siggins) than ever he did—he did come back to the employ shortly after—in August, when Hampton was away for his holiday, Siggins had to do his work—I remember something taking place about a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—Siggins asked me to take a piece of paper to his land<lb></lb>lady, to admit me to his room to take his bank-book and purse and bring them back to him—I took the key of his door and the key of a box, and went to his lodging; I was shown his room; I opened a box with the key and took from it a bank-book and a purse—I looked in the book, it was open, and the amount was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took the book and the puree to Siggins—he told me there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note lost, and he did not want the governor to go and ransack his place—this is like the book—I left the employ soon after—I afterwards saw Mr. Perks at Aldridge's, and told him in substance what I have now stated.</p>

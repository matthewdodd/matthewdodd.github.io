            . I am servant to the prosecutor; I went out to shake the table cloth after supper; I saw the gate open, I went to shut it, and heard something in the cart, there was a great bustle, and something fell out of the cart; I call'd out, the cart was robb'd; I saw a maund of cucumbers lying under the cart; I stepp'd over the kennel, and saw a woman rise up, and go into a close that was paled round; I believe she fell out of the cart; we went round it to see for her, and in about half an hour's time we found the prisoner among some willows in the ditch; we put her into the watchhouse; she said, she hoped we would not hurt her. In the morning we found the rope of the cart was cut; this case knife (producing one) she left on a basket in the shed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own it to be her knife?</p>
               <p>Beal. No, she did not; we had lost cucumbers 2 times before that, but can't say who took them.</p>

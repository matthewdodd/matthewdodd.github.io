                  </hi>. I have been, since Jan. 1845, a clerk in the Commercial Bank of London. On 4th Sept., this check was paid to us by the London and Westminster Bank—it was first paid by us to the London and Westminster Bank, but we found out our error and had it back—on searching I found that Charles Fraser, the drawer, had no account at our bank—we do business for the Gravesend Bank—I believe this check has come out of this check-book (<hi rend="italic">produced from the desk</hi>)—I cannot point out from what place, but the numbers agree—the counterfoils all bear the same number, 5676—the number of this check is 567—the last figure 6 has been removed—I know Lawes; he once kept an account at our bank—this check-book was issued by us to him—I believe the writing on the counterfoils to be his—the body of this check I also believe to be his—I mean the words that are written "Sept 11, '49. J. F. Collins, Esq., 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of the Gravesend Bank," and the figures" 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." all the writing part, except Fraser's signature—this was our pass-book with Lawes—I believe the entries in this memorandum-book to be Lawes's writing—the last entry is "1849, Aug. 28. Cash per Smith, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I cannot say when Lawes's account with us ceased—the last transaction I am aware of was on 13th April.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been, since Jan. 1845, a clerk in the Commercial Bank of London. On 4th Sept., this check was paid to us by the London and Westminster Bank—it was first paid by us to the London and Westminster Bank, but we found out our error and had it back—on searching I found that Charles Fraser, the drawer, had no account at our bank—we do business for the Gravesend Bank—I believe this check has come out of this check-book (<hi rend="italic">produced from the desk</hi>)—I cannot point out from what place, but the numbers agree—the counterfoils all bear the same number, 5676—the number of this check is 567—the last figure 6 has been removed—I know Lawes; he once kept an account at our bank—this check-book was issued by us to him—I believe the writing on the counterfoils to be his—the body of this check I also believe to be his—I mean the words that are written "Sept 11, '49. J. F. Collins, Esq., 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of the Gravesend Bank," and the figures "7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." all the writing part, except Fraser's signature—this was our pass-book with Lawes—I believe the entries in this memorandum-book to be Lawes's writing—the last entry is" 1849, Aug. 28. Cash per Smith, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I cannot say when Lawes's account with us ceased—the last transaction I am aware of was on 13th April.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined Q.</hi> Have all these books the same number of checks in them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they begin at 25 and go up to 500—I have not counted the checks in this book to see whether any are missing—I feel no difficulty in speaking to the body of this check being in Lawes's writing, from the know<lb></lb>ledge I have of it—I should say it is the same character of writing as that on the counterfoils—in my opinion all the body of this check, except the signature, is in one handwriting—there is a slight difference in the colour of the ink with which "Pay to F.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, G</hi> 14). I apprehended Lawes in Milk-street, on 22d Sept., about half-past two o'clock—I told him the charge, and said he must go to Clerkenwell police-court with roe about Smith's business respecting a check—he said he would be dif he would—he said he gave</p>
               <p>Smith the check—he then said that Fraser signed the check, and he ought to go as well—I asked where Fraser was—he said on the Exchange, and I went with him to the Exchange—I there found Fraser—I told him I wanted him to go to Clerkenwell police-station—he wanted to know what for—I told him about a check—Lawes then said, "You know you signed your name to that check"—he said, "Yes"—I believe Smith's name was mentioned by a person named Hall—Fraser said if I would wait half an hour he would go, when he had finished his business—I then took him and Lawes in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the station—a person named Hall was also in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, he represented himself as being an attorney in Moorgate-street—I did not take him into custody, he went of his own accord—as they were going along Lawes said to Fraser, "Charlie, if the Magistrate should ask you why you gave a check on the Gravesend Bank, tell him you expected the money to be paid in immediately, "and Fraser said" Yes"—I examined Lawes at the station, and found on him this pocket-book, containing these two blank checks (numbered 5676), a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, and a quantity of papers—I also searched Fraser, and found on him the papers marked" A "and" B"—I was before the Magistrate when Collins was being examined (<hi rend="italic">looking at the deposition</hi>)—this is Mr. Combe's writing (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"<hi rend="italic">The prisoner Fraser voluntarily states</hi>: The signature to the check is in my handwriting; only the signature is in my handwriting; I do not know any<lb></lb>thing about the rest of the handwriting ")—I heard that stated—Lawes after<lb></lb>wards made a statement—he said, "I believe all the handwriting on the check to be in Fraser's handwriting; none of it is mine"—Fraser said, "Most probably I signed the check at Oarraway's; I have had transactions of this kind before, but such transactions were always met, and if there is anything wrong, come to me on Monday at twelve o'clock on the Exchange and it shall be all right"—Inspector Brannan is not here; he is ill of the cholera.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William White, a moulder to a brick<lb></lb>maker—we like at Northalt, near Uxbridge—on Monday afternoon last, about 3 o'clock, I was going with my husband's tea into the brick-field, and met the prisoner going towards my house—I saw him put his hand in the water-spout to see if the key was there—it was not there, and then he tried to force the door open—he could not—he then took up a brick and smashed in the window and frame, and got in—I went up, and saw him coming out at my bed-room-window with a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, a shirt, and a handkerchief, belonging to my husband—I told him they did not belong to him, and to put them down—he took up a shovel and swore he would murder me me if I did not let him came out—he knocked me down with the shovel and cut me on my head—I had my baby in my arms at the time and he stunned the child with his fist, and made his way off—when I came to myself, I ran after him as fast as I could, hallooing, "Stop thief!"—some friends caught him, and the things were taken from him.</p>

I was called to take the prisoner in charge—the prosecutrix was very much injured, and covered with blood from the blow she had received—these things were given to me by Mr. and Mrs. White—he said he was very sorry, and hoped Mrs. White would forgive him—I told him he was charged with breaking into the house, and assault<lb></lb>ing the women, and stealing the clothes—he was sober.</p>

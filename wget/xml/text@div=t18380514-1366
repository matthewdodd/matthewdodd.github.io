                  </hi>. I live in Barking-side, Essex, and am a labouring man. In September, 1836, I occupied a cottage there—nobody lived in but I and my wife—on the morning of the 30th of September I and my wife went out to work about five or six o'clock—the door was fastened with a chain—it was not locked—the bed-room window was shut, I am certain—it is on the ground-floor, and is a sash-window—I fastened the door with a chain, and tied it with a string—we returned about twelve o'clock at night, and found the door fastened, as we had left it—the window was taken out, and stood down, inside the room—I opened the door and went in, and found the prisoner partly under the bed—the things were taken out of the boxes and drawers, and lying all about the room—I knew the prisoner—he pulled the top of my snuff-box out of his pocket, and gave it to me—I had left it in the box in the morning—the moon shone in at the window, and my wife fetched a light—I am sure it was him—I asked him what business he had there—he said he thought he was in his own house—I can<lb></lb>not say he was sober, nor yet altogether tipsy—I let him go, being a neigh<lb></lb>bour—I never saw him again till he was apprehended—he lived close to me, but I never saw him—I did not trouble myself to inquire for him—I had not heard anybody moving about before I went in, but we perceived a light in the house.</p>

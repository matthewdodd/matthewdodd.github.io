He used to feed the mare himself, and often rode her about the streets.</p>

            . I am a horse-boiler, and live in Brick-lane, Old-street. On the 13th of April, the prisoner applied to me to buy a bay mare of him - He had two at the time; one was a chesnut and the other a bay. I bought the bay one of him; I saw the other again at Worship-street, Mr. Hambridge was there with me - She had a switch tail, but when I saw her in Mr. Hambridge's possession, the tail was cut. I asked the prisoner his name when I bought the mare of him, he said it was William Bush, at a barber's shop in Cross-street, Islington.</p>

            . I am a headborough; from information that I received I went into Marshall's yard, and found the mare tied up and took her away-Goss assisted me; the prisoner said the mare was not his, but that he had her and rode her about; he told the magistrate that he found her in Ball's-pond-road, and he thought it proper to keep her; the magistrate told him he should have put her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210013"></xptr>in the pound and advertised her. Mr. Hambridge saw the mare on the 10th, and claimed her as his property. She is worth 20l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found her in Ball's-pond-road, with the bridle on - I rode her about, and did not go to sell her.</p>

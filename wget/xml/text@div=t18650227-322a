                  </hi>. I was twenty-six years in the Grenadier Guards, and have a pension and a medal—since I retired from the army I have become the tenant of 4, 5, and 6, Wellington-street—I became tenant of No. 5 in September last, under Mr. Inderwick—I know that the prisoner formerly occupied No. 5—I took No. 5 under this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and entered in September—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 21st September, 1864, and was for a term of three years</hi>)—I entered into possession on 29th September—shortly before I entered the prisoner said that he should like to have the two kitchens, and give up the house to me, and be a weekly tenant, as he would sooner pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week than 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a quarter, as he was in Mr. Inderwick's debt—I agreed to that, and he gave up the house to me all but the kitchens—he turned the lodgers who were in the house over to me; one in the top-room owed him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the one on the first floor 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I paid him the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he gave me the keys of the two empty rooms—after a few days he gave me the keys of the shop, and took his tools down into the kitchen—from 8th October he paid me six weeks' rent—he was sometimes behindhand; he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for six weeks, but he paid me two weeks in one—I gave him a book for my receipts; I never got that book from him except to put the rent down, and I gave it to him back again—when he paid me the rent I wrote something in the book—the last rent was put down for November, but I believe it was December; it was for 20th December, to the best of my knowledge; it was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 1st December I served him with notice to to quit, but ho did not do so—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the plaint-note that I ob<lb></lb>tained in the County-court—it is under the seal of the Court—I attended on 2d February, when the cause was heard—I gave the same evidence that I have given to-day—I heard the defendant sworn—he swore that I was no landlord, and that he never paid me any money, and I had nothing to do with the house, that he never paid me a sixpence rent in his life, nor yet 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was nonsuited, and had to pay the costs—there is something in the agreement about my doing repairs, and 1 did the seven rooms in No. 4, and at No. 5—I did two rooms up and part of another—my landlord allowed me one quarter's rent for repairs.</p>

               <p>entry at the time I received the money, but I put it down to the date when it was due—he paid me in December as well, but it was put back for No<lb></lb>vember—he had been tenant to Mr. Inderwick four years—I believe previous to my taking the house I only once received rent for Mr. Inderwick; that was some time between quarter-day and Christmas, 1864—I then received nearly 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I gave him something out—it was in October that I gave the defendant a book, and I put down the first week's rent—I received the book back again every time he paid—there were two lodgers in the house in October—one of them paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and the other 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the rent of the house was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and the rates.</p>

I live at 6, Strickley-place, Camden-town, I am a potman in the morning, and work at whitewashing afterwards—about the beginning of November I was waiting for Mr. Clark to come in, as I was doing his room up, and he always took the key—Clark asked the prisoner, when he came, if he had got any money for rent—the prisoner said, "Here is 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that is all"—Richards had not got any ink, so Clark would not sign the book, but he said he would take it in-doors, and bring it back to him when he came out again—on another occasion they were talking about a copper, over in a public-house, and Clark said to Richards, "If I give you half-a-crown, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. will go towards the rent"—the copper was to cost 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw Clark give him the half-a-crown.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>when Clark was not at home I used to go into Richard's kitchen and wait till Clark came—I took no particular note of the conversation because I always understood that Mr. Richards had given up the house to him—I have been a potman six months—I was once in a leather warehouse, and left because I got into trouble—I did hard work in one of Her Majesty's gaols—I robbed my employers, and got eighteen months—I came out eighteen months ago—I told Clark I was very sorry anything had taken place, because I did not not wish the man any harm—I never had any words with him in my life.</p>

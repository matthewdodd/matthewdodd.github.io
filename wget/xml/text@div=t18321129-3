On the 26th of October, soon after five o'clock in the evening, I was in the parlour communicating with the shop - I had only been out of the shop three or four minutes, and am certain the shop door was shut and latched; I came out of the parlour, and saw a man's hat behind the counter - it moved, and I immediately ran to the door, feeling certain there must be a man there; the man immediately bolted out - it was the prisoner: I ran after him, calling Stop him! and he was stopped by a corporal in the Guards, about a hundred yards from the shop; I am certain of him, for I never lost sight of him - directly I caught hold of him I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and called to the corporal not to let him throw any thing away; he then showed me a piece of paper in his hand - I went back, and missed twenty-two gold rings from a glass-case, which was locked up; twelve of them were found in his pocket - the property taken was worth much more than 40l.; the others have not been found: I found three on the ground - I still miss seven, and two gold watch-keys; they had all been locked up - fourteen spring keys, or something of the sort, were found on him - he must have got in at the door; the case was locked, but the keys were in it.</p>

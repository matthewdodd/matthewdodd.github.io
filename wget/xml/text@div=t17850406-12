               <p>What did he say? - I said I should be glad to be satisfied for the great coat that he stole away; he said he could not make me amends for it, for he had sold the coat.</p>
               <p>This is a very odd conversation you relate; had you lent him the great coat now upon your oath? - No, I did lend it him one day before.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath would you have prosecuted him if he had paid you for the great coat, or returned it to you? - No.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil and colour man, in Brewer-street, Somers<lb></lb>town. On the 23rd of August, between three and six o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, the prisoner came to my shop with this order—he said he had come from a gentleman named Barham, who I had served before—(he had been to me three months before, and those things were sent and paid for)—I asked what things he wanted—he said, "White lead, oil, umber, and ochre, var<lb></lb>nish, and Brunswick green"—I did not let him have the goods—I made out a bill of the things he proposed to have—to the best of my recollection they came to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked me to give him the bill enclosed in the order—I refused at first, but I thought he might probably want to take it back again, and I wafered it up and gave it him—he said he would call again at six o'clock in the evening, and go with my boy to take the things to Mr. Bar<lb></lb>ham, and my boy was to bring back the money—he said the gentleman was a very nice young man, and had got plenty of money—I told him I gave no credit—after I had given him the bill he asked roe to let him have half-a-crown, as he had got some things to get for the gentleman—he owed me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before, and he said, "When the things are sent up to the gentleman's, your boy shall bring back the money, and I will pay you a trifle <hi rend="italic">of</hi> what I owe yon, I shall have some money then"—he came back in an hour or an hour and a half, not sober, to borrow another half-crown—I said, "Gerard, what hare you done with the other half-crown, I am afraid you have been spending it in drink?"—he said, "No, I have not, I am as sober as you are"—I asked him <hi rend="italic">for</hi> the bill—he said he had given it to the gentleman at four o'clock—he took his hat off, and the order and the bill fell out—I told him to hand it to me—he refused at first's, but I said, "You had better let me have it, and I shall have something to show"—he then gave it me—I followed my lad with the goods, and found Mr. Barbara at No. 45, Devon shire-street, instead of No. 28—No. 28 is where he formerly resided—I have not got the bill here—it was given to a gentleman in Mr. Braham's house—the policeman has a similar one which was made out—I should have acted on the mere production of die order alone—I should have sent white lead, oil, and <hi rend="italic">trumps</hi>, nothing more, had he not given me the order for more—this is a common form of order in the trade—it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> in the same form as one I had had previously—he did not ask me to give him the goods, but to make out a list for the gentleman—I called on Mr. Barham the same evening—I did not know him—I saw a gentleman wlip I thought was Mr. Barham, who said it was not his writing—I called next morning, and saw Mr. Barham—I bad the goods close by his door waiting for him, to see they were delivered, on the same evening—I have not got the paper which contained the list of the goods—I made k out—the prisoner was to call for the goods in the evening, but after he called the second time I had some suspicion, and went with them myself—he did not go with me—I saw nothing more of him till he was in custody—he did not pro<lb></lb>pose to take the goods in the first instance—he described what goods he wanted—he said nothing about my giving him anything for bringing the order—I generally gave him something.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived at No. 28, Devon shire-street. On the 23rd of August, when Mr. Crosier called on me, I was living at No. 46—no per<lb></lb>son of my name lives at No. 28 now—I employed the prisoner to do some painting for me about four months ago at No. 28—on that occasion I sent a note to Mr. Crosier for some oil and colours, which came to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184208220186"></xptr>
               <p>—I paid for that on delivery—I afterwards employed the prisoner to paint the front of No. 45—I never saw him since—he once called, but I did not see him—I did not send him with this note—no part <hi rend="italic">of</hi> it is my writing, or the writing of any of the parties living at No. 28—two gentlemen, named Brandon, and a servant live there—I always considered the prisoner honest—I was out of town on the day he presented this order, and only came back that evening—it was shortly before I left town that the prisoner called on me—I might have had a little painting to do—I had trusted him to get paint on two former occasions.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody in Edmund-street, Battle-bridge, between seven and eight o'clock on the morning of the 25th of August—I said, "Mr. Crosier wishes to speak with you"—he said, "Yes, I know what it is about, I will call as soon as I have had my breakfast"—I said, "You had better go with me now"—he said, "Very well, I will go with you"—on the road he said, "This is a bad job, but I intended calling and paying him the money, I was intoxicated when I did it"—he asked what I thought be would be done to—I said I could not say (<hi rend="italic">order read</hi>.)</p>

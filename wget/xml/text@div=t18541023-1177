                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery. On Thursday evening, 12th Oct, I was in the Marquis of Granby between 7 and 9 o'clock—I saw the two prisoners there; Eldridge came to me and shook a handkerchief, which appeared by the sound to have money or metal in it—she asked me if it was any use to take and pass any Birmingham—I told her to walk away—I did not want anything to say to her, and to mind her own business—she said, "Never mind, you can soon pass it at the Canteen"—she went away—I did not see where she went—Davis was in the public house—when I came into the taproom I saw the two prisoners sitting along-side of each other, and half an hour afterwards I saw Eldridge give Davis the same handkerchief that she had shown to me—it seemed to me folded up as it was when she showed it to me—she told Davis to get something to drink—the handkerchief has been shown me since.</p>

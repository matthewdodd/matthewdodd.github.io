                  </hi>. I live at No. 17, Little Lant-street, Borough. On the 24th of Nov. I was in Charterhouse-square—I sometimes employ myself in looking after persons whom I suppose to be suspicious, and I get my expenses—I was tried myself nine years and a half ago, and the last time eight years ago—on the 24th of Nov. I followed three persons to Charterhouse-square—while there I saw a wagon belonging to Chaplin and Home, driven by the prisoner—I had seen him before—I saw only one wagon there, and a green cart with a very poor bay horse—there were three persons in the cart—I saw the prisoner stoop, and remove a bale from the wagon—he put it over the tail-board into the cart, and the three persons drove off with the cart—one drove, the other two sat down—they drove down Charterhouse-lane into St. John-street—this was about five o'clock, as near as I can guess—it was dusk—the lamps were lighted—there was a lamp about two yards further on from head of the horse that was in the wagon—I spoke to a policeman—I asked him for a constable of the name of Storey—he raid he could not tell me where he was, he believed he was at the Sessions—I found Storey on the Thursday, and told him.</p>

            . I remember being called up on the night of the 8th of August; it was about three o'clock in the morning; it is my dwelling-house, I am a <rs id="t18160918-12-viclabel67" type="occupation">jeweller</rs>

When I was called, I looked out of the window, and was informed by people who stood under the window that the place had been broken open; It was quite dark, and the watchman had a light in the lanthorn. I dressed myself, and I went down stairs, and found that the shop shutters had been forced one over the other they were perfectly secured up the night before. The fastenings were then the same as they had been the night before, only the bar was sprung and one of the shutters was forced over the other. The glass was broken, and ten razors taken out, and a pair of snuffers, and a coral necklace. These things had been within reach of the broken pane. I saw some of the things, the same morning; in the course of an hour I saw the coral necklace, and one of the razors.</p>

I remember seeing him on the night between the 8th and 9th; I saw him at Mr. Marshall's window, it was about three in the morning, at his shop window; he was standing at the window doing something with his hands; as soon as I saw him, a man  who stood by held up his hand, and whistled; them the prisoner jumped backwards off the payment into the middle of the road, and came towards me, and they turned up a turning called Thomas's-rents before they came to me; I did not lose sight of the prisoner, but followed him; the other man ran with him. I proceeded after them, and when I came to Ropemakes's Fields, I called out stop thief, as loud, as I could call twice. The patrole went to stop them, and the prisoner then turned down the same street where he had been committing the robbery. I ran through an Alley, and caught the prisoner just close<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180029"></xptr>to the watchhouse door; I lost sight of him while I turned one corner, but not for a minute. The patrole was close to him when I caught him. I went round another way, I gave the prisoner into the custody of Mr. Lines. I searched the prisoner; but found nothing on him. I then called Mr. Marshall up. I found the necklace and a razor under the window, and have them here now; I have had them locked up ever since. The necklace was under the shutter that was forced open; it was a very large pane of glass that was broken, and a man might have got his head in.</p>

            . I remember the last witness calling to me to stop two men; I saw two men running; I crossed the way as they were coming in; one man shot against me, and I got the prisoner against the wall, and he turned up Force-street, and then I afterwards was close to him when we stopped him in Thomas's-rents. I found nine razors, a pair of snuffers, and a crow bar.</p>
               <p>-LINES. I am a constable of the night. I compared the crow with the marks on the shutters, and the marks corresponded.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, In the evening before this happened, I was coming along Whitechapel, and I met a man named Jones, and I had been out of employ a fortnight, and he said to me, Booth, are you out of employ; and be said, why don't you go into the fields early of a morning, and get a few mushrooms. I got up early in the morning, and as I was going past this shop window, I saw the shutter had been removed, and I stopped a little, about half a minute, and on turning my head, I saw a man with a white apron, and I said, I should alarm the watchman, and he made answer follow me, and I thought he was going to alarm the watchman, and I followed him, and presently I heard a voice say stop, and I turned up the street where this depredation had been committed, which I should not have done if I had been concerned in it; I know I am very innocent.</p>

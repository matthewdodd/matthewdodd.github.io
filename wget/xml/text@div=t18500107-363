                  </hi>. I am in the employ of William Lushy, and know the prisoner by sight. On 2nd Jan. I was at Forest-gate, cleaning the sheds—my master's cow ran into the shed, and the prisoner called out, "Boy, turn that cow out"—I said, "That is my master's cow"—he said, "If it is, I bought it at Romford to-day"—he took it away, and it got along with a drove of bullocks—he said he would go and fetch the man he bought it of—my master sent two young men after him and they caught him, and he said he was going to fetch the man from Romford—they said, "If you like to</p>

               <p>come back we will fetch a horse and cart and take you there"—he said, "I will stop here, and yon run and fetch the horse and cart"—he was going the way to Romford—my master came up and gave him in charge—the cow could not have been to Romford, it was turned out about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock, and he hunted it into the shed between twelve and one—it is about eight miles to Romford.</p>

                  </hi>. Cobble came to me—the prisoner and the man be<lb></lb>longing to a drove of bullocks were standing together—I said, "Which is the man?"—the prisoner said, "Here am I; if you have a cow here, select it out"—I did so, and said, "This is my property"—he said he must seek the man he bought her of—I asked where he bought her, he said, "In Romford market"—I saw her safe in my place at ten o'clock that morning—she could not have gone to Romford and got sold and come back, it is fourteen miles there and back—the prisoner said he could fetch the person in a short time, and went down the road—I sent a man after him and gave him into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

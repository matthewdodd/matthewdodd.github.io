It was a fast-day of ours, about six weeks ago, I took a nap on the table in the kitchen, behind the shop. A little girl came in, and asked me if I had sold some shoes to the boy that went out? I said, No; and went to the door, and saw the prisoner with a pile of shoes under her arm. I cried out, Stop! and I saw him catched, with the shoes under his arm, about twenty yards from our door. He was brought back to our shop. There were only three pair of shoes found. They were my father's property.</p>

               <p>I heard somebody call, Stop him! I saw the prisoner running, and saw him throw something over the wall into Tower-ditch; but what it was, I cannot tell. I stopped him. He begged I would let him go. I said, I was afraid he had stole something. When the people came up, they said he had stole some shoes from Mr. Bendick. Another lad got over into the ditch, and found three pair of shoes. I secured the prisoner, and I am very sorry for it; I had rather have been confined six months in the bay of Biscay; for I have been confined here ever since Tuesday.</p>

On the 8th of last month, at about five in the afternoon, the three prisoners came into my master's shop, Davis asked to look at some silk and cotton handkerchiefs. I shewed them some. They turned them about a great while. At last, while she was looking at them, a gentleman came in for some thread. I turned about, to get him some thread; and while my back was turned, the two little girls, Crispin and Jones, went out. Davis bid me something for the handkerchiefs, which I could not take; and then she went out. Before the gentleman was gone, a young man, who was at the door, came in, and said, he believed some of the people who were gone out had taken some goods out of the shop. I followed them down Ship-alley, and overtook them. I desired them to come back. One of them refused. A constable came up to them, and

             early, I sat down at the next door to Mr. Habgood's. I saw Crispin come out of the shop with the handkerchiefs; they hung down below her petticoats.

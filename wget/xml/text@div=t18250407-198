About four o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th of March, I went to Best's house; I found a bag with these things in it - the prisoner had the razors and coat in his pocket - I took them to the office - he said, if there were any things belonging to his shipmate in his bag, it was unknown to him - but if they were his, to give them to him, and have no more bother about it - there were a couple of shirts in the bag, which he stated to be his own.</p>

               <p>LUCY GRIFFIN. Re-examined. Q. Did the prisoner take the bag? No, the other man took it - the prisoner was quite sober.</p>

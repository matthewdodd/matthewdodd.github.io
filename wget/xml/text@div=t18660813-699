                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, of Hounslow Heath—on 14th July, about 5.30 p.m., I was crossing Sunbury Common to Feltham in a donkey-cart—the prisoners passed me in a cart, went on about 300 yards, and then turned round and passed me again—when I got to the "Red Lion," at Feltham, I got out to have a pint of beer—the prisoners got out of their pony-cart, and Ayres knocked me down with his first—he jumped on top of my chest and called Sexton, who held me while Ayres picked my pocket of 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., leaving 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on me—I had had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—Ayres kicked me three times in the ribs and back—they jumped into the cart and drove away, and I ran after them, leaving my cart—I overtook them at the "Railway Inn," Feltham, and said, "Give me my money;" Ayres threw down two penny-pieces, and said, "Take your b—money"—after that he stabbed me through my cheek into my gums—I did not see anything in his hand—I knew the prisoners by sight, and am sure they are the men—Ayres goes about with a cart gathering dust.</p>

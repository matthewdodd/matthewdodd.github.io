                  </hi>. I am a coal-dealer, and live in New Tothill-street. On the 11th of August, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners at my coal-shed—Barber bought 1/4 cwt. of coals, and gave me a dollar to pay for it—I kept it in my hand awhile, and put it into my pocket, where I had nothing else—I gave her half-a-crown, one shilling, and two sixpences—she put the coals into a bag—they came to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they went away together—I afterwards showed the crown-piece to my daughter—she asked me for it, and I gave it to her—in consequence of what pawned between us, we followed the prisoners—my daughters ran faster than I did—they were running—I saw my daughter stop them—I only saw Barber—she was brought back to me—I took hold of her, and said, "You have given me a bad dollar, and I must take you into custody"—as soon as I got to the door there was a policeman and constable—I gave her in charge of them—she said somebody had given her the money, but I do not know who.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Vine-street, Westminster. I was in New Tothill-street, and saw the prisoner Barber had a crown-piece in her hand—she stopped, took up a bit of dirt, and rubbed it with her hand, and wiped it off—they then went up to the prosecutor's coal-shed—I saw Barber pass the crown-piece into Mr. Haswell's hand—I afterwards saw them come out, and joined in the pursuit—they ran away—Barber threw the coals down at the prosecutor's feet—I saw Barber throw something down a grating at the time the policeman had hold of her—it was down the common sewer, which could not be searched.</p>

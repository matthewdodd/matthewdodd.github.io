                  </hi> Jun. I live at No. 104, Hatton-garden, and am in the employ of my father, Samuel Hasluck, a jeweller, who supplies Messrs. Greenlay, Christian, and Company with goods. On the 14th of January the prisoner came to my place, and produced this order—(<hi rend="italic">ready</hi> "Messrs. Hasluck and Co. Two or three brequet chains and seals, for Green-lay and Co."—I let him have two—the next day he brought me back one, and had a bill in the name of the firm for the other, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. This request I certainly believe to be in the prisoner's handwriting—he had no authority from me to write it—he was not sent by our house for the articles, and they were never brought to us—we are known by the name of Greenlay, Christian, and Matthews, but myself and Matthews are the only partners—the request is written on the back of one of our printed cards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the house. I did not give the prisoner authority to write this request—I did not receive the goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I merely obtained the things the same as other clerks in the prosecutor's house, with intent, when the account was sent in, to pay for them. Mr. Bolton had the management, and used frequently to obtain goods, and get them charged in the general account; and when the account was sent in he paid his share of it, and the firm gave a cheque for theirs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHRISTIAN</hi>. We never allowed a clerk to do so—I believe there was one or two instances of the kind, and I told the tradesmen to make out fresh invoices of what was ordered for the house, I reprimanded the parties, and they did not venture to order things again, but they were not ordered in our name or by our authority—I have sent them to purchase things—they have seen things they liked, and bought them—they were</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I wish to show it was the custom of the clerks to obtain credit, and pay when the house paid for their goods, having them charged to the house; I obtained the goods, being willing to pay for them when the account of the house was presented, which I should have done; I had no felonious intent; if I had I might have kept both; I left my right name as the party taking them.</p>

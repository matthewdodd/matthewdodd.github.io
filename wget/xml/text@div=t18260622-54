            . On the 21st of June, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I was over the canal bridge, by the Rosemary Branch public-house, and met the prisoner on the bridge, on this gelding; as soon as he saw my light he turned back - I asked where he was going with the horse at that time in the morning; he said he was going to take it to Limehouse - I asked where he was going to take it there; he said he did not know, a man gave him 2s. 6d. to take it to Limehouse. I took him to the watch-house; I asked where the 2s. 6d. was - he said he was to have that when he had taken the horse to the Commercial-road; Goodwin saw the horse, and claimed it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Wadmore, and live next door to Mr. Hinxman's slaughter-house, in Clare-market. On the 4th of June, about nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner come out of the slaughter-house gate with a bag on his back. Before I saw him come out, he was standing at the door, and wanted me to go up stairs, and put my master's children to bed; he had no business with them. I remained at the door, and then I saw him come out of the slaughter-house with a sack on his back, which appeared very full; but I could not see what was in it. He was in his butcher's dress, with his jacket and apron on. He went towards Lincoln's-inn-fields. I followed him there, and then told Mr.Poole, who was in sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I have known the prisoner some time; I never had any dispute with him, nor resentment towards him.</p>

            . I am a butcher. On the 4th of June, in the evening, Eliza Hall pointed the prisoner out to me at the begining of Lincoln's-inn-fields; he had a sack, which was quite full. I and Thomas Chettle followed him to Crown-street, St. Giles's, without losing sight of him. I lost sight of him there, it being dark; some people crossed over the way, which hindered our seeing him for a moment. We remained there, and in a few minutes we saw him come out of a chandler's shop kept by

            . I am a butcher. I went with Poole after the prisoner; he has spoken correctly. I parted from him, and went to Mr. Hinxman, told him what had occurred, and then got Furzeman. When the prisoner went into the house, he had an apron on; but when he came out,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181806170053"></xptr>he had none. When I got Furzeman, we found the prisoner in White Hart-yard, Drury-lane. He was taken into custody. After that, I returned to Poole, in Crown-street. I had seen Woodford's son come out with the prisoner; before that I saw him come out and go into the chandler's shop once or twice, and then go into the boiling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You came to the house again, and Woodford, sen. was there - A. Yes-Poole, Wadman, Hinxman, Furzeman, and Roberts were there, with Woodford, sen. his wife, and daughter. We went into old Woodford's boiling-house, and searched all over the premises, except one large box, which he would not open, but found nothing there. My attention was called to the next door, which was the chandler's shop, out of which the prisoner and Woodford's son came. As we smelt and heard something, we went immediately to the privy, and found a great deal of fat. We drew up a large quantity of it; it was bullock's fat, pieces of caul, and gut fat. It was not in a fit state for sale, for it had not been cleaned. It was not in such a state as it is when sent out for sale; it must have been further cleaned, before it could be in a state for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Finding it in the state you did, could you tell whether it was fresh off the bullock - A. It was just off the animal, and was quite warm; if it had been warm with the weather, it would have been putrified. As soon as we went in and had pulled the first piece of fat out, Woodford,sen. made his escape; and I have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I followed the prisoner with Poole to the corner of Lincoln's-inn-fields. I was before Mr. Poole all the way. I lost sight of the prisoner, in Crown-street, for a moment. I followed him, because I wished to see where he was going to take it. I do not know what was in the sack.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Could you tell by appearances what was in the sack - A. Yes, I could tell it had hot fat in it; because, when a bag has hot fat in it,it slides off the back. The sack did so. We found the sack and apron in the wash-house belonging to the chandler's shop. I turned the sack inside out, and it was all greasy; there were lumps of fat as large as an egg remaining in it. It was the same kind of fat as I found in the privy; it was quite fresh and sweet, and evidently from a beast but newly killed. We only found one sack and one apron there, and the sack looked like the one I saw on the prisoner's back.</p>

            . I am a constable. I assisted in taking the prisoner. We then went to Crown-street. Mr. Chettel has spoken correctly. The fat was found in the privy. I produce the sack and apron, which were found by the weights and scales in the wash-house,next to the privy.</p>
               <p>ELIZA SCOTT. I keep the chandler's shop in Crown-street. Woodford,sen. hired the wash-house of me on the 30th of May. He kept a tripe-house next door. He must go through my passage, to get to the wash-house. I did not see the prisoner there. Some scales were in the wash-house. Robert Woodford, jun. borrowed a four pound and a two pound weight of me, at about a quarter or half past nine o'clock that evening. He returned them to me with a lamp, which he had taken out of the shop without my leave, within two or three minutes after he had borrowed them. After he had borrowed the weights, he went out of the door, and a man went out with him whom I did not know. I saw the fat after it was taken from the privy.</p>

            . On the 4th of June, I delivered seven beasts to be slaughtered at Mr. Hinxman's. I saw the gut fat; there were about 16lbs. short. There were other fats also deficient in some of the beasts. Part of that found in the privy would have made them complete; it corresponded with the weight that was deficient.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We can sometimes tell the fat of one beast from another by the colour; this corresponded also in colour.</p>
               <p>JOHN HINXMAN. I do not know the sack nor apron; all butchers wear them. The prisoner had no authority to take anything from my slaughter-house that day, nor had he any business on the premises at that time of night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Nobody but my servants have access to the place. The fat corresponded with Mr. Hick's beast; and was worth above 2l.</p>

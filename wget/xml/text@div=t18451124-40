                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Parson's-green, Fulham. On Monday afternoon, the 21st of July, I was under the sewer at work, getting timber out—I went from there to the Colville Arms public-house to have a pot of beer—it was about twenty minutes to six o'clock—I had only had one pint of beer that day—I was perfectly sober—I found the prisoner at the house—he was a little the worse for liquor—when I went in he asked if I would set-to with him for a pot of beer, meaning fight him—I said no, I would not—he came up to me, turned back from me, took a quart pot off the table which contained the beer, threw the beer under the table, and gave me a se<lb></lb>vere</p>

               <p>blow on the head with the pot—I had not struck him—the blow cut my head nearly two inches, and locked me under the table; and while I was under the table he gave me a kick in the eye, which cut the flesh and skin of my eye—it bled very little—I bled from the cut in the head—there were four or five of us in the house—we went in one at a time—after I was knocked down, Foreman came to my assistance—he came to take me up, but did not, as he was knocked down by the prisoner—there were from ten to twelve of them there—I was taken to the hospital in Mr. Pye's cart—I had my head dressed, and did not stop in the hospital—I was stunned with the blow—I was a fortnight without doing anything afterwards—I am certain I did not begin the attack.</p>

I am a navigator, and live in Wellesley-grove—on Monday, the 21st of July, I was at the Colville Arms, about twenty minutes to six o'clock—I followed Tyne in—I heard the prisoner say he should wish to set too with Tyne—Tyne did not want to do it—he was sober, but the pri<lb></lb>soner was not—Tyne did not agree to fight him—he knocked Tyne down with his hand on the head—that was all I saw him knocked down with, with his fist or hand, and he kicked him in the eye—I did not see a quart pot in the prisoner's hand when he knocked Tyne down, but he had a quart pot when he cut my head—I went up and said, "Is this a manly action?" and the prisoner gave me this blow on the side of my head with a pot—I was knocked down to the ground, and was a little stunned—in a few minutes I got up and fought with the prisoner—sometimes he was up, and sometimes I was up—I was at last defeated—I could not stand any longer from the loss of blood from my head—I got another cut from another man, and was taken away in a cart to the hospital—I am certain Tyne did not make the first attack on the prisoner—he did what was necessary to defend himself.</p>

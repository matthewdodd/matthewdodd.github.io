                  </hi>. I am a warder at Pentonville prison. The prisoner was confined there—on 16th Aug., a little after six o'clock in the morning, I unlocked his cell, and as I was passing to the next, I received a blow on the back of my head, which made me reel about two yards, and I then saw the prisoner with this stool<lb></lb>leg in his hand, four or five yards from me—it is hard beech-wood—he then gave me another blow on the mouth with it, which made me insensible—when I recovered I was in the doctor's hands—four of my front teeth were smashed, and obliged to be taken out—my lip was cut through—I was confined to my bed six days, and was obliged to be fed through a quill—I have not been able to do duty since, and am still under the doctor—I had complained to the prisoner on the night before of the state of his cell, and afterwards, in his presence, mentioned it to the principal warder—that is the only circumstance which could have given rise to this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warder of Pentonville prison. On 16th Aug. I was on duty in the first gallery, assisting in opening the cells—I saw Everett open the door of the prisoner's cell, and pass on to the next—the prisoner rushed out of his cell, and struck Everett with a heavy piece of wood on the back of the head—he almost fell on his face, but saved himself, turned round, and the prisoner met him and struck him on the face with the same weapon<lb></lb>prisoner No. 31 came to his assistance out of his cell, and there was a struggle between the three—they all fell, and the weapon fell out of the prisoner's hand—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when I got up the prisoner was uppermost, struggling with Everett, holding him by the throat, apparently to strangle him—he bled from the mouth, and seemed greatly exhausted—this is one of the legs of the prisoner's stool—I have tried it to it.</p>

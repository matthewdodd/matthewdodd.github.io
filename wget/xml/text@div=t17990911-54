               <p>- BOLTON Sworn. I am foreman to the prosecutor; I detected the prisoner on the 30th of June, with a false key opening the ware-room door of Mr. Jackson; I saw the key in the door, and his hand upon it; I took him, and left him in care of George Murray, while I went to call Mr. Jackson; then we went into the prisoner's own apartments and found all the articles in the indictment in his possession; they were put into the hands of the officer; they were found folded up in his trunk, and in his drawers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. He opened his drawers and his trunk himself, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn - I am an officer(produces the property): On the 30th of June, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner, and the property; I have had the goods ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. This blue cloth I can positively swear to, it has the maker's name, and the number.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.Any other person might have cloth with the maker's name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the number? - A. No; they number them as they make them, as I understand; I never Knew an instance of two pieces of cloth of the same number; the other things I can swear to, conscientiously, if I cannot legally; I missed them, and was in the constant habit of using them. From the extreme compunction of the prisoner, at the time he was taken (for he was agitated extremely), I have reason to believe it was his first offence; so much so, that it very much hurt me; he has came of a very respectable family, and therefore I wish to recommend him to mercy; he belongs to the most respecable family in the country that he came from.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called one witness, who had known him from his infancy, and gave him an excellent character.</p>
               <p>The Jury joined the prosecutor in recommending the prisoner to mercy.</p>

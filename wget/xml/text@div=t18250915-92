On Sunday night, the 4th of September, about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock, I put a little box into my till with 12 s. or 15 s. in shillings and sixpences, in it - the prisoner occasionally came to the house - there were only three people in the parlour - he was not one of them; persons in the parlour cannot see into the bar; I went into the parlour to dismiss the company, and on returning to the bar I saw the prisoner within a foot of the till - I thought all my doors were closed, but the side door was not - I said. "Halloo Joe! what are you doing there?" he made no answer, but ran towards the door - on going to the till, I found it half open and the box gone - I had not put it there two minutes before; I ran out, crying Stop thief! but did not tell him till Thursday night, when he came out of Mr. Clark's, opposite - he drew back on seeing me, and got to the corner, running as hard as he could - I followed; he stopped in the archway in the market - two others who were with him, stood looking at me, they at last ran off, he was stopped by the watchman - there was no stranger in the house but him - I charged him with it: he said, I was going to swear his life away.</p>

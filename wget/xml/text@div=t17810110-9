               <p>On the twenty second of October I lost my watch in the Park; there was a swivel seal and key to it. As I was coming down the Park the prisoner asked me where I was going? I told her I was going home; she persuaded me to go with her. I went with her from the Mall as it is called towards the gate that goes into Fludyer-street; she made a stop near <placeName id="t17810110-9-crimeloc45">Fludyer-gate</placeName>

               <p>Did you perceive her when she did it? - Not at that juncture of time; when she left me she made a run; as soon as I perceived her to run I put my hand to the side of my fob and missed my watch.</p>
               <p>When was the last time before that that you knew the watch was in your pocket? - About ten minutes before.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was in your pocket when this woman came up to you? - Yes; I am perfectly sure of it; I pursued her when I saw her make a run, she made a flip out of the Park into Fludyer-street. I thought my watch was lost, I went home to bed. The next morning I went to the man who had mended it in Wood-street, and told him I had lost my watch; he advised me to advertise it, which I did three days and heard nothing of it. In the Christmas week I had an information where the watch was; I went to Sir

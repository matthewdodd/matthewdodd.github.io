                  </hi>. I am a draper, carrying on business in the Fulham Road—on the 1st of July, 1870, the prisoner came to my shop to look at some black silks—I showed him some, and he stated that he wanted two, one for his wife, and one for his sister—I sold him 34 yards of silk, value 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me his name, James Scott, Clyde House, Clyde Street, and told me if I went down at 7.30 that evening he would pay me—I tool the silk myself to the house—a man opened the door—the prisoner was coming down the stairs—he showed me into a little room, went to his secretaire, opened a drawer, took out a cheque-book, and asked me how? would have it, crossed, or an open cheque—I told him I would have a crossed cheque—I left the silk, took the cheque, and went out—I then made inquiries, and came back about ten minutes afterwards to the house—the prisoner was not there—I then went to the manager of my bank (the Imperial), and asked him to go with me the next morning to present this cheque—we went to the London General Bank, and took the cheque—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found there was no account at the bank, and never had been—the manager marked the cheque "No account."</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Derby now—in July, 1870, I was manager of the London General Bank—I remember Mr. Kingsbury, ac<lb></lb>companied by the last witness, coming to me with this cheque—I searched the books, made inquiries, and we had no customer at that time of the name of James Scott—I never saw the prisoner till I saw him at the Police Court—I don't know his handwriting—I marked the cheque "No account."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I looked in the ledger in which accounts are always entered—I don't know that I looked in the signature book—I have not got the bank books here; I have nothing to do with the bank now; it is in liquidation—the books were not in any confusion at that time—I never heard that accounts were opened with persons and yet there was no record on the books—I succeeded Mr. Rogers as manager; I had been manager about six months, I think, when this transaction took place—I was eighteen months in the bank before I was manager—there was no confusion in the accounts, the business had been very carelessly transacted—money had been lent to persons which had not been paid—the books represented the business done by the bank; they were straightforward enough—I am speaking now from recollection that Mr. Scott had no account; as manager, I did not know him to have any account—I only referred to the ledger to find whether he had or not; the ledger is not here—I made the reference in July, 1870, two years ago—what I state now is my recollection from my search on that occasion—I have nothing to do with the books now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief inspector of the Detective Depart<lb></lb>ment, Scotland Yard—in July, 1870, a warrant was placed in my hands for the prisoner's apprehension—I was unable to execute it until 19th August last—upon that day I saw him come out of a house in Boundary Road, St. John's Wood—I knew the prisoner personally; his proper name is William Gratton, but he always traded under the name of William Gill—I asked him what name he chose to give, and he said William Gill—I told him I had a warrant for his apprehension for forging a cheque to Mr. Kingsbury—he said "Can't I see Mr. Kingsbury before going to the station?"—I said "No"—I took him to the station, and he there gave the name of William Gill.</p>

            At what time did you say this happened? - A little before eight o'clock, between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark or light? - It was star light, but they took me between the hedges, rather in the narrowest part of the road.</p>
               <p>Q. How does it happen that you speak so certainly as to Porter and Grover? had you ever seen them before? - Yes, I knew Porter before; when I knew him he lodged at the Wool Pack; I think that is eleven or twelve months ago, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you? - Yes, he knew me, and the other likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know Grover knew you? - They told the justice so when they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Grover before? - I had seen him, but did not know who he was; I had seen him about as a working man, many a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to be able to distinguish the men? - Porter I could distinguish, but the other I could not, because he was in dark coloured clothes; but just as I went to pass them, I looked very hard at Porter, before he struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear to Porter? - Yes, I see his face when he struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say as to Grover? - He kept all the time behind me, on my left hand side, I never could see his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear to Grover, as well as Porter? - No, I cannot swear to Grover.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am for Porter. This happened when you was between some hedges you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not so good a light there this time of the night, as if he had been in a clear open field? you was shaded by the hedges? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Whereabouts did you say this was? - I was coming from Palmer's-green to Southgate.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you give information? - I went to serjeant Runnington's the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention Porter's name then? - Yes, I mentioned his name; I knew his face, and told them who he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time say any thing of Grover? - No, I did not say any thing about Grover.</p>

               <p>Q. Who told them it would be better for them, that they should tell all about it? - Yes, I did; I told Porter that there were two persons concerned in the robbery, and there must be one more besides himself, and I told him he had better tell of the other party.</p>
               <p>Court. That was with respect to Porter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to Grover, to induce him to tell? - No, he told voluntarily before the justice of peace, without any questions.</p>

               <p>Q. He had already confessed; are you sure that when you had a second in your mind, and went to take him, that you did not say to him, you had better confess? - NO, I am sure I did not, to the best of my knowledge; he came to the justice, and I don't think the justice asked him the second syllable, before he up and told the way and manner how they proceeded in taking the watch and money from Mr. Crowder.(The examination.)</p>

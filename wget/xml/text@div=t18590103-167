                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife; we have been married seventeen years—I have part of a house in Great Tower-street. On 16th November my husband came home in the evening—he was not quite tipsy; he was the worse for liquor—I was sitting on a chair; he told me to go up-stairs—I made no answer, but got up to go and he hit me on the foot with the office poker—I fell on the ground, and while I was on the ground</p>

               <p>he kicked me on the lower part of my leg, where he had previously struck me with the poker—a policeman came in and I was taken up-stairs to bed—I was afterwards taken to the hospital; I am there now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Thomas's hospital. I have attended Mrs. Hopkins several times and have examined her leg—I was not on duty when she was first admitted; there was a fracture of both the bones of her leg above the ancle—there was a bruise, but the skin was not broken; there were not any defined marks of violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose it was occasioned by a blow from any weapon, and there was a stocking between the weapon and the leg, would that prevent any defined marks of blows? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might—I saw no defined marks, but in my judgment it proceeded from a fall—it was a week afterwards before I saw her—supposing the wound to have been occasioned by a blow, I should have expected when I saw her a week afterwards to have seen more defined blows, and therefore the probability is, that it was the result of a fall rather than a blow—supposing it had been a blow with a poker, the appearance might have been as I saw—though more probably there would have been more defined marks—but it might still be true that it proceeded from a blow—it might have proceeded from a blow or a fall—the idea I had from her was that she had the blow, and fell—a person who received a blow which did not fracture, could by a fall fracture bones in such a manner and in that situation—all I saw could have been effected by a fall decidedly.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). I apprehended the prisoner on the day after his wife was taken to the hospital—I told him the charge was assaulting his wife, and breaking her leg—he said he knew nothing of it, his wife fell in the office.</p>

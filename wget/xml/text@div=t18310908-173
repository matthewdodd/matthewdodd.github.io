            . I am an officer. On the 13th of July I was on duty in Cornhill, about one o'clock, and saw the prisoner in company with another person - I watched, and saw them follow a gentleman; at the end of <placeName id="t18310908-173-crimeloc911">Gracechurch-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. How far were you from me? A. About fourteen yards, on the other side of the way; there were no people passing at the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I get my living in an honest and industrious way; I was in a respectable solicitor's office for three years and a half, and lost my place through a dissolution of partnership - I was going on an errand when I was taken by the officer; he touched some gentleman on the shoulder, and while they were in conversation a young man brought up a handkerchief to the officer, and they went away - the gentleman found his own handkerchief in his pocket, and strongly denied that this was his.</p>

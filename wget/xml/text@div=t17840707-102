               <p>Court to Thornton. Can you say with certainty whether Boldero and Barnston had accepted any other bills to that amount, or to a similar amount? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Can you say with certainty that there was any bill of the same tenor or date? - I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Court. This bill has been travelling about, unless it is identified in some way it will not do; now the parties might have come forward, and in cases of forgery they usually trace the bi ll quite through, therefore you must prove this the same bill, he believes it to be of the tenor and date, now I am really of opinion that is not a sufficient circumstance to put a man on his defence before a Jury in a case of this sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I admit this man receives a bill of Jacobson, which he enters in a book, he has not the book here, he parts with it to Bellamy, Bellamy parts with it to twenty people, I have a right to say that every part of that bill is an absolute forgery; I have a right to say that every letter, every mark, every figure on that bill is an absolute forgery; it would have been very easy to trace it: what the Jury think in their own private feelings is one thing, and perhaps in an action might be sufficient, but when a man stands on his trial for life it certainly is not.</p>

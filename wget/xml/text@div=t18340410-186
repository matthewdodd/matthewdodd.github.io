            . I am inspector of the watch. I was in Mr. Langman's house on Sunday morning - I went there at half-past five o'clock - Mr. Langman locked me in the bar- in a few minutes after, I heard somebody come down stairs and making a noise in the tap-room, moving the pots about and sweeping the place - a few minutes before seven o'clock I heard somebody knocking with their hand at the street door - there is no knocker to the street door - I heard the person inside go along the passage and open the door - I then heard the footsteps of two persons come along the passage - I heard a sort of rumbling noise, and one person go up the stairs - I then heard the catch of a window thrown back, and the window, which divides the tap-room from the passage, pushed up - I turned round, and saw Phillips in the bar - he had his hand on the till, which was shut - he saw me directly I turned round - I got up and said, "You have made a bad job of this, young man" - he said, "I am sorry for it" - he had his shoes off - his shoes were outside - I called Mr. Langman, who came down stairs - I left Phillips in his custody, and went up for Norris, who was brought down - he was dressed - I examined the window - a pair of steps had been removed from where I had seen them before, and they would assist the prisoner in putting his arm through a broken pane of glass, and putthing the catch back - there was nobody up stairs but Norris, not dressed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was not a very early hour? A. The house does not close until late - it is a night-house - the till is in a counter, shut up - Phillips's hand was on the counter - the counter is covered with pewter, but he had his hand nearly on the edge - as it appeared to me, attempting to take the till out - the till was not locked - no part of it was opened - I found no property of the prosecutor's in his possession - the steps had been removed from one place to the other.</p>
               <p>MR. LANGMAN re-examined. Q. Used you to leave out a knife-tray for the knives to be cleaned? A. Frequently - Phillips never used to come to assist in cleaning the knives - I never saw him after he left - I don't know whether I had left the knife-tray out that night - it was kept in the bar usually.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose Phillips had come to clean the knives, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100089"></xptr>you had not left them out, Norris would naturally go to the bar to get the knives? A. No, they were not in that bar, but in a bar behind, not near the window - you have no business in that bar to get to the other: you must go into the bar the knives were in first - the house opens about seven o'clock, but Norris was rather late that morning.</p>
               <p>Phillips's Defence. I was out of employ - my fellow prisoner asked me to come and help him on Sunday morning - I knocked at the door, Norris let me in - I swept the passage out, and did two or three things for him - he asked me to clean the knives - I found they were not left out - Norris went up stairs - I immediately opened the window, and got into the bar - not with intent to steal, but to get the dirty knives.</p>
               <p>Norris's Defence. I asked him to come and help me, which he did - I let him - in - I left him at work and went up stairs - I heard a noise and came down - I am entirely innocent.</p>

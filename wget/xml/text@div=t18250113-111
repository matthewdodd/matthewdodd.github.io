The male prisoner came into my service in August, and left in November - I was not then aware of having missed anything but a rule, which I have seen since at the Office - I have looked at the things here produced, and believe them to be mine - I looked over my stock on the 30th of December, and missed articles of this description; he was in the habit of working at the back of my premises, where these goods were placed on shelves, in papers - I am sure I had not sold them.</p>

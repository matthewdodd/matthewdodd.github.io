                  <hi rend="italic">The letter was dated 2nd January,</hi> 1870, <hi rend="italic">from the defendant to Mr. Be-tram. It was marked</hi> "Strictly private," <hi rend="italic">and contained the following expre<lb></lb>sions</hi>: "Sir, As I conclude it is by your advice and persuasion Mrs. Marshal has taken the present step in leaving me, induces me to address this letter to you, in anticipation of your giving it your serious consideration' "Look at Mr. Marshall's two sons and his daughters; what do you think of them? What training have their sons had, putting out of the question Christian teaching?""It is impossible for Mr. Marshall to regard Mrs. Marshall's children as his own; Mrs. Marshall's companions, since her mar<lb></lb>riage, has robbed her of all those precious gifts which befitted the character of a mother, and the examples she has had before her are too disgusting to refer to." "I once saved Lizzie's life, when Mr. Marshall absolutely de<lb></lb>clined to provide her with anything, although she was then living at his house at Holloway; her doctor and nurse can confirm this." "If you were in possession of all the facts of Lizzie's wretched life up to within a few months more of her coming to me, and considering the cowardly and profligate asso<lb></lb>ciates that she has been compelled to mix with, you would, I am convinced, have advised her differently." "I dare not think wrong of Lizzie, nor regard her (using her own language) otherwise than in the sight of God, her husband."</p>

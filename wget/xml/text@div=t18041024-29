In consequence of my knowing the woman that was drinking with her at my house I sent for the woman, and I told her I suspected the woman had robbed me that was with her; she told me the prisoner's name, and where she lived; and, in about an hour and a half, she was stopped at a pawnbroker's pledging the table-cloth.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Lambeth-street: On Saturday the 13th of October, about twelve o'clock, I heard that Mrs. Barclay had been robbed of some linen; I found the prisoner at Mr. Texter's, the pawnbroker's, facing the London-hospital, she was at that time offering the tablecloth to pawn; I found in her apron a cap, and a half-handkerchief; and when I had taken her into custody, she said she had washed the other things in her room, and hung them up to dry; she said she had bought them of a sailor for half-a-crown, he had asked five shillings for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in her own lodgings? - A. No, in another person's room, she shewed me the place; the things I now produce, I found by her own direction. (The property produced, and identified by the prosecutrix.)</p>

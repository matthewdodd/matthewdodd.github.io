On the 12th of August, between three and four o'clock, I was in her house, and saw the prisoner with several others before the door, kicking up a kind of stir - and there was a bonnet taken off the line; while Mrs. Bampton ran after that, the prisoner came and took the looking glass off the door - Bampton asked her what she was going to do with it; I cannot tell what she said; but I ran up and laid hold of the glass; she pulled it so hard I let go - her companions then came up, and she ran down a turning, and I saw no more of it.</p>

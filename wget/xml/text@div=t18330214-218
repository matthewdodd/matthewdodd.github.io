On the 5th of February, about twelve o'clock at night, I was standing at my door - the prisoner came up, drew my watch out of my fob, and ran away; I pursued - he threw it away; I gave him in custody, and the Policeman picked up the watch - I was a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you sober enough to remember whether there was a lady standing at the door with you? A. There was not at that time - I had been previously speaking to a female; I do not know who she was - we might have been ten minutes together; this watch has no mark on the glass, or on the silver, but it was thrown down on the side of the door, and fell on the step; it did not slip down while I was with the lady - the prisoner threw it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say that if the prisoner mentioned one word about females, you would not recommend him to mercy? A. No; I did not say so at a public-house in Little Paternoster-row - I saw Mr. Fish at the public-house a few days after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that the prisoner gave you a blow on the breast? A. Not a violent blow, Sir - I believe, I said so at the Police-office, but he did not strike me to hurt me; he denied all knowledge of me or of the robbery - I do not recollect showing the Policeman the door at which I had been standing - no woman came forward and said she had seen me a little before, creating a disturbance with a woman in Union-street; I am positive the prisoner drew my watch out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you been drinking at more than one public-house? A. Not to my knowledge - I had been speaking to the woman in Union-street, not more than a dozen yards from where the officer found the watch.</p>

             (Police-constable H 112). I was on duty near the prosecutor's, I heard the cry of Police! and saw the prisoner walking - he stopped when I saw him; the prosecutor came out of the court, and charged him with striking him with one hand, and taking his watch with the other; he said he shoved him in the breast, and took his watch - the prisoner said he never saw the watch; I took him to the station, and returned to the court - I could not find the watch then - but I found it, when I came round a second time, in the place where the prosecutor said he had been robbed, about three or four yards from where I took the prisoner; I had looked in the same place the first time, but had not turned my light on - it was in a dark corner against the step of a door; it laid with the glass uppermost, and the chain on it - the prisoner passed that spot with his left hand to the wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you heard the prosecutor swear it was thrown down? A. Yes; I did not see the prisoner throw it - the prosecutor was in liquor; he did not tell me he had been talking to a female - the prisoner might have thrown the watch down, and I not see him; it laid against the step of a door, and the chain was regularly laid on it.</p>

             (Police-constable H 120). I have a certificate of the former conviction of the prisoner, which I got from Mr. Clark's office; I know he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I certainly had the misfortune to be here nine months ago, but I am innocent of this; I was going home that night, and saw the prosecutor and a woman at a door; he had his trousers down; I went on, and heard a cry of Police; the prosecutor then came up and said "This is the man that robbed me" there was another, Policeman came up, and said, "You may as well come to the station;" they took the prosecutor there; he was so drunk, they gave him a chair he told them where the watch was likely to he found; he had been in bed an hour before it was found.</p>

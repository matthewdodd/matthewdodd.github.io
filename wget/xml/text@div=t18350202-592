                  </hi>. I am the son of Stephen Pott, of Edmonton; he has an osier ground at Enfield. On the 31st of December Stephen Reed was employed to cart some osiers—Welch, who was convicted yesterday, was his servant—I saw the osiers in the cart when they were being unloaded—I saw Ansell with them—he was not in our employ, nor in Reed's—I saw them unloaded in my father's yard at Edmonton, where they are deposited—43 bundles were unloaded; there ought to have been 47—I had not given directions for any part of them to be unloaded elsewhere—I manage my father's business—I went to see them unloaded, in consequence of in<lb></lb>formation; I went to the prisoner's premises about in hour afterwards—the constable afterwards took John Vardon into custody, and Ansell was taken into custody afterwards—I went to the prisoner's house; he keeps the William the Fourth beer-shop, at Edmonton, and is a turnip-buncher, and ties up turnips for the market—thin osiers are much used for that purpose—I went down his yard, through the turnip-bunching shed, and found one bundle of osiers—a great many of them were thin, sufficiently to bunch turnips with—there were several persons about, but not employed in bunching turnips—they appeared such osiers as had been on our ground—I then went round to inform Camp—he and the prisoner came together to where I had found the one bundle—I asked the prisoner if they be<lb></lb>longed to him—he said no, they did not—I said, "Do you know they belong to my father?"—he said, "I do not know who they belong to"—the constable said, "There are three more bundles misting; will you allow us to search further?"—he said, "Yes"—we searched in a stable he did not point it out, but we came to a stable door, it was then opened, and we there saw the three other bundles, making the four which were missing—Camp asked the prisoner if they were hit—he said "No"—we</p>

On the 31st of December, Welch asked me to go with him, and I went with him after some osiers, down the marsh, to Mr. Pott's ground, with a cart—we put forty-seven bundles of osiers into the cart, and drove with them towards Edmonton—while we were going along, we came by Vardon's beer-shop, and we put down four bolts of osiers at his house—I put them out of the cart, and Vardon's son took them in—he stood close by the cart while I put them down—the prisoner was not pre<lb></lb>sent—he was inside the house—he never saw me put them down—I did not sit down in the house—we went and had a pot of beer before we put the osiers down, and after they were taken in we had one pint more be<lb></lb>tween us—the prisoner fetched the last pint—we did not pay for it—I never paid, and I did not see Welch pay—I saw Vardon put his hand in his right hand pocket, and pull out some money to give Welch—I cannot say how mueh—Welch started off, and never said a word to me—I then ran, and overtook him driving towards Edmonton—while I was driving on, I saw the men who cut Mr. Pott's osiers come by—Bennett was one of them—the other, Baynes, I think—when we got to Edmonton, Welch said to me, "Go and open the gate"—we took no more osiers out till we delivered them in Mr. Pott's yard—young Mr. Pott was in the yard—he said no<lb></lb>thing to me—I was not there all the while the cart was unloading—they were all taken out of the cart—there were forty-three bundles—there had been forty-seven, but four were left at Vardon's—I was taken into custody about half an hour afterwards—I was examined before the Justice, and told what I have now—I was ordered to prison, to be a witness here, and have been so to this time—I went before the Justice with the prisoner—he said, as we went, "Whatever you do, do not say I am in it, and I will employ you a counsellor"—I made answer, "I do not want a counsellor, I mean to speak the truth; I am brought into it, and know nothing about it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice on board the brig <hi rend="italic">Mary</hi>, which was lying in the Regent's Canal. On the night of the 4th of Feb. I came from the cabin to the deck—I saw the prisoner standing between the lug-boat and the rigging;—I asked what he was doing—he said he was easing himself, and I had seen him putting his shirt in his trowsers—I said he had better go on shore—he asked if I thought he was up to any roguery—I took the cabin</p>

               <p>poker to get him out of the ship—he went on shore—I saw some of the tackle of the vessel had been cut and had fallen on the deck, about a yard and a half from the spot where the prisoner had been standing—the tackle had been all right that evening—I had not heard the tackle fall, but it had been cut, and was lying on the deck—here it is—this is the end that was out—it was about twenty minutes before nine o'clock—the policeman brought the prisoner about twelve o'clock—this rope is the property of Anthony Strother—it was in the dock of the Regent's Canal, about 100 yards from the Thames—it was under the cleet, where it was coiled up—it had been just cut off.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner very near Limehouse bar, coming towards it—I saw him soon after he came from on board the ship, but I did not know he had been there—I found on him this ship's knife, which appeared as if it had very recently cut a rope in two, by the smell of it—there is tar upon it now—I had previously directed the prisoner to a lodging—I did not know he had been on board the <hi rend="italic">Mary</hi>—I took him on board, and Scott immediately said, "That is him."</p>

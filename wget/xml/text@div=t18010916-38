               <p>Q. At what time of day or night? - A. I cannot say, I was very much intoxicated with liquor; I staid there all night, and did not miss my watch till the next morning; I afterwards saw him pull it out of his pocket on the 25th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him between the 25th and 26th of August? - A. Yes, two or three times; he worked at East Acton and I at Ealing. On the 25th of August, I asked him about my watch, and he pulled out a watch that he said he gave a guinea for, and put it in the landlord's hands.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you never asked him for it before? - A. Yes, I asked him for it the Sunday following, and he said he had seen it; I then had him taken.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KENTISH, sworn. - I am a constable; I went to the prisoner and challenged him with having the prosecutor's watch; the prosecutor was with me; the prisoner said he had no watch at all; I put my hand against his sob, and there I felt a watch; I asked him to shew it to me, and he said he would not; I told him, then I would search him. The prisoner and the prosecutor then went into another room, and then the landlord brought out the watch and delivered it to me; his name is Higgins. (Produces it.) I have had it ever since.(The watch was deposed to by Messer.)</p>
               <p>- HIGGINS, sworn - I keep the Horse and Groom at East Acton. On the 25th of August, the prosecutor, the prisoner, and Kentish were at my house; the prisoner is a gardener, and lodged at my house; I heard an alarm, that they were come to take the gardener; the first I heard him say was, that he had no watch but one, that he had given a guinea for; I found that the prisoner and the prosecutor were acquainted; I said they had better go into another room and settle it; they were in the room by themselves about a quarter of an hour; then they called me in, and the prisoner gave me the watch, saying, there was the watch, if it was Messer's he should have it; he would bring the man by to-morrow night that he bought it of for a guinea; Messer said, if he did give a guinea for it he should have it again; the prisoner desired I would take care of it till the next evening; the prisoner had been out in the course of the day as I understood to find the person he had bought the watch of; he came in the evening and said he could not find him, but he would not deliver up the watch without the guinea that he had paid for it, or go before a Magistrate; then they all went together to the Justice's, and he recommended them to Bow-street; we went to Bow-street, and the prisoner was committed; he lodged in my house ten or twelve weeks; he was a very sober, industrious man, and has done a great deal of work for me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in company with this young man; he and I were both very much intoxicated; I dropped asleep, and he went away and left me; the next time I saw him, he accused me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160029"></xptr>of taking his watch; about five weeks after that I went to London and bought a watch; I gave a guinea for it, after that Kentish and Messer came to Higgins's and challenged me with the watch; I said, if they would give me a guinea, they should have the watch, and I delivered it into the hands of the landlord.</p>

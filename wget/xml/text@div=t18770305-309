                  </hi>. I am a riding master of 212, Great Brunswick Street, W.—I was present at the Wesleyan Chapel, Dorset Gardens, Brighton, on 9th February, 1863, when the prisoner was married to Ellen Brazier—I gave the bride away—this is the certificate. (<hi rend="italic">This certified the marriage of William Gibson, legally divorced to Ellen Brazier, spinster, at the wesleyan Chapel, Dorset Gardens, Brighton, on 9th February</hi>, 1863.) I have seen the prisoner several times since—I saw him last about two and a half years ago—I have been in Ireland since, but I saw him on an average monthly from 1863 to 1871, and had conversations with him about his wife, he wanted me to go and ask her to meet him, but I was afraid to do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 51, Seymour Street, Bryanston Square—on 18th July, 1871, I went through the form of marriage with the prisoner, at the Liverpool Road Chapel, Islington.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not find out that he was married till six months ago—this letter is in my writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated January</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">and staled:</hi> "I am convinced that our marriage was illegal, although I know you considered you were perfectly free to marry again, therefore I have no ill feeling towards you.") He locked me in a room and made me write that—I said "Why do you wish me to write that letter"—he said "This woman is a very dangerous woman, and she may bring a charge against me for marrying her while I was drunk"—I do not know who the dangerous woman was—I also wrote "I shall never trouble you; trusting you will not interfere in case I think proper to marry again"—I say in the face of that letter that I did not know he was married—I have not seen him to speak to within the last six months, but I saw him twice in Oxford Street with the woman he was living with—I once wrote to him to meet me when I wanted to arrest him, but I did not write to him from time to time to meet me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I first knew for certain that he was married, last September, after I left Bath—I heard a rumour of it two years ago, but he said that it was a lie, and called me a fool, and said that the woman I spoke of was already married, a married woman who he had lived with, and that it was impossible for him to be married to her—I was satisfied with that; but about six months ago I saw his wife—I believe he has married somebody else, at Norwich, in 1875, since I left him.</p>

            ; I am first cousin to both; they lost on the 12th of June, four wainscot boards and three deal boards out of the yard; I saw the prisoner come in the morning, he had been backwards and forwards for upwards of a week, loitering about the yard, and never bought any thing; so I watched him, he had been used to buy, but not at that time; I saw him look these deals out, and hide them behind the counting house; he saw me in the yard and Mr. Maddocks, and he went away again; about twelve or one he came in again; I went down the yard and told a sawyer to look out after him; the sawyer gave me intelligence that he was gone; I followed him, and took him with the deals on his shoulder; the constable has the deals; I took particular notice of the deals when he left them behind the Counting house, and five minutes before the deals were there, and when I took him they were gone.</p>

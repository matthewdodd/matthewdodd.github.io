                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 221), I know Jacob Jackson; I was at the police court when he gave evidence against the prisoner—his deposition was taken—the prisoner had an opportunity of cross-examining him—I saw him in the hospital the day before yesterday, he was then ill in bed—I have not the slightest doubt that he is the same man who gave evidence against the prisoner—I saw Jacob Jackson's deposition taken in the prisoner's pre<lb></lb>sence, so that he could cross-examine him—I received information of this robbery, and I apprehended the prisoner on Monday, 1st Feb., at half-past 11 o'clock at night—I told him the charge, he said that he knew nothing about it; he was not there at that time—I told him that he was charged with committing the robbery at a certain time and place.</p>

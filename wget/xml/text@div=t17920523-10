I asked them a second time, and the prisoner and others came out; the prisoner with part of a brick in his hand, another with a pair of tongs, another with a poker, and another with a large hand-saw, and another with a stick: we did not get the hat; but the prisoner came up to me, and took my hat off my head, and threw the piece of brick at my head; they swore, b - r their eyes, if they would not kill every Englishman that came along the place.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 13, in Parker's-lane, a hard labouring man; I have known him three years. (The rest of the prisoner's witnesses ordered to go out of court.) I came to prove I saw the first of this row.</p>
               <p>You was one that was there? - Yes; I stood at my own door, and there was a row in the street; some gentlemen were coming up, and one of them said, Troth Pat, which way does the bull run? There was another of our country folks apprehended the word, and he struck at the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Who asked that? Which way does the bull run? - This young man with the fair hair, the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never said such a word.</p>
               <p>Rawley. Another man apprehended the word, and he followed him and struck him, this young man.</p>
               <p>Who struck him? - I do not know rightly; he was knocked down; when he got up, he ran as hard as ever he could lay legs to the ground, and away with him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179205230017"></xptr>without a hat; and Fitzgerald was not in the case, any more than your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Who had the hat? - I do not know; but I am ready to take my oath that Fitzgerald was not in the first row; and he lost his hat in the first row.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot positively say that this man was in the affray; but I verily believe he was the man that had the tongs.</p>
               <p>Rawley. No, I had not the hat indeed.</p>

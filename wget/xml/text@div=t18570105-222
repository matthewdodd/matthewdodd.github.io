                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and lodge at No. 8, Well-street, Whitechapel. On Friday afternoon, 26th Dec., I was in the Globe public house with Lynch, a companion of mine—when we came out we saw some musicians playing, and, as far as I saw, one of the musicians had some artificial flowers in his hat—there was a crowd, and the prisoner was one in the crowd—very shortly afterwards I observed that Lynch had some artificial flowers in his hand—they appeared to me to be like the flowers in the hat—I did not see how he got them; I suppose he took them from the hat—some words took place between the musicians and Lynch about those flowers, and some blows were exchanged between them—the police came and separated Lynch and the musicians—after that, I was going away with Lynch, my companion—we walked right down a street and turned a corner, and about ten yards from the corner I heard a noise behind me—I turned, and saw about a dozen Germans running after us—they were the musicians—about half a dozen of them came to me—the prisoner was one of those that came up—I saw one of them, I cannot say which, with a knife in his hand, and I received a stab in the left side of the neck—I had turned round and exchanged some blows with about half a dozen who came up—before</p>

I was in Mary Ann street that day, and I saw some fighting between some Germans and two sailors—the prisoner was one of the crowd I am sure—I saw two policemen come up, and they sent the Germans one way, and the sailors the other—Denham had a companion with him, Lynch—I saw a number of Germans follow them; the prisoner was the first—they went down Mary Ann street, and they caught the prosecutor against the wall, and half a dozen <hi rend="italic">pitched into</hi> him—the prisoner was one amongst the half dozen—he had a knife in his hand, and made an attempt to dig it into the prosecutor, and it went into the wall—another stab went into his neck—the prisoner immediately ran away—I am positive the prisoner is the man that stabbed him; he ran away, and threw the knife away, and took it up again and gave it to me, and gave me a halfpenny at the same time—I gave the knife to the policeman.</p>

I heard some music near the Globe—I know the prisoner—he was walking at my side—we walked through Cable-street, to another street; I do not know the name of it—I saw when the sailor was stabbed; and a little fellow who was the sailor's comrade, wanted to run away, and some persons laid hold of him—when the sailor was stabbed, the prisoner was still at my side, stand<lb></lb>ing still—I remember the police separating the sailors and the musicians—I stood not very close by them at the Globe—when the sailors ran fast away, the prisoner and I walked slowly behind them, with the music—the prisoner was by my side when the sailor was stabbed—it was after that that Lynch ran away—the prisoner could not be the person who stabbed the sailor, he was too far away—we were about twenty steps off—after the prosecutor was stabbed, Lynch went to run away.</p>

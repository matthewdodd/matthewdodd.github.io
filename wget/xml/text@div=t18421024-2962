                  </hi>. I deal with Mr. Bellamy. I do not think I paid the prisoner 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 19th of September—I think it was a week after<lb></lb>wards—here is the bill—it has no date on it—it was paid a week after I received the meat, which was in the holiday time—I did not pay it in the holiday time—here is a mack to it for the receipt, such as he puts to all his bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It was a week after you received the meat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a more civil and more honourable young man than the prisoner never came to a customer's door—I objected strongly to go against him—when he found there was short weight, he was embarrassed for fear his master should lose my custom—part of this meat has been bought some<lb></lb>where else—Mr. Bellamy told me he had found it out, he had bought it in Newport Market of another butcher—he pointed out a knuckle of veal, which he said was bought by the prisoner in Newport Market, to poison me in my religion.</p>

               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not endeavour to get 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was the pro<lb></lb>position of the family—the prisoner robbed me of more than 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I asked him on the 26th, if he had got any money of mine—I was not in the habit of asking him that daily, at night—he did not say he had paid me—he said he had got none—he did not deny receiving the money of Mr. Valentine—he might not have paid me money, and I forgot to cross it out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am still in the prosecutor's employment When I have gone out and received money, I have sometimes accounted for it that night, and sometimes next day—it has never in my case been post<lb></lb>poned longer, to my recollection—I certainly have sometimes asked my master to settle with me at night, and he has said, "Let it be till to-mor<lb></lb>row"—it has not been postponed beyond two or three days, to my recol<lb></lb>lection—I should not like to swear one way or other—the money we re<lb></lb>ceived has been settled at night—he gave us no particular orders—it was settled that day, or the following, after the next day's trade was over, in the evening part—if my master has said it has been postponed four or five days, it has not to my recollection—I have been sent out to buy joints for my master—he sometimes gave me the money, and I have sometimes paid it out of my pocket, and it has been settled when we have settled—I can<lb></lb>not prove that the prisoner has purchased meat of other persons—when master sends out to buy a joint of meat, we do our best endeavours to buy it as cheap as we can—if he sends us to a customer who wants a joint, we go and give the order, and sometimes master gets it, and sometimes we do.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 133). In consequence of information I received, I went on 24th May, about 12 o'clock, to the premises occupied by Mr. Webb, a silk-manufacturer, the prisoner's employer, 7A, Basinghall-street. Mr. Hawkins's premises are No. 7—there is a passage between, and a door into it from the premises of each—it is not a public passage—Mr. Hawkins is a chemical manufacturer—I found the prisoner in the warehouse, and told him I wanted to speak to him in the presence of his employer—we then said Mr. Hawkins had lost some calicoes, and the prisoner was suspected of stealing them; he said he knew nothing about it, and should have no objection to let us search his house—we went there, and found his wife in the bedroom tying up a parcel on the floor—the prisoner stepped quickly towards her, and whispered something which I could not hear—they both seemed confused—I took the bundle, it contained two large pieces of calico—Mr. Hawkins examined it, and said it was his—the prisoner's wife said she pur<lb></lb>chased it in Whitechapel—the prisoner said, "Yes, that is right; I know she purchased it"—I went the same day to 16, Charles-square, Old Gravel-lane, and found the prisoner's mother-in-law, Mrs. Jones—I got from her about 20 yards of calico, cut up into shirts and chemises—Mr. Hawkins claimed it—the prisoner was not with me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the passage run between the two houses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is one house divided into two, each communicating with the passage. I found, in Mrs. Whittaker's drawers, pieces of calico which had been used—here are the two parcels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—one came from Mrs. Jones, and the other from the prisoner—there are three doors opening into the street—it is a very large house, and there are a number of passages—the passage is boarded, and there is a door at the end of it, which is open during the day and shut at night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Jones, of 16, Charles-square, Old Gravel-lane. The prisoner is my son-in-law—on 24th May, some calico was found at my house by a policeman—it had been in my house five weeks—I received it from the prisoner's wife—she was alone when she brought it to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know of the prisoner's wife purchasing calico at Whitechapel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, frequently; I have been in the habit of going with her to purchase calico when she used to receive her money—she obtained her livelihood by making it up into shirts, chemises, and little things for children—I used to make up articles for her, and assist her—there was nothing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185106160009"></xptr>
               <p>extraordinary in its being found on my premises—I had been in the habit of making for her three, four, or five years—the last time I purchased calico with her was about five weeks before the property came to my house—I pur<lb></lb>chased sixteen or twenty yards with her at the Hen and Chickens, a draper's shop in Whitechapel; I have been in the habit of purchasing calico of this sort with her for five years, and making it up—my husband is a waterman—the prisoner has been married to my daughter-in-law between eleven and twelve yean—I have known him five or six years, and never heard a whisper against his character—he was porter to Mr. Webb, and was living on his premises to take care of them, with his wife and five children—he has been living there about two years.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 151). I went with Packman and Mr. Hawkins—I saw the calico found—Mr. Hawkins identified it—I saw the prisoner very uneasy, endeavouring to pass something to his wife—I seized his hand, and found this key, which fits the door from the passage into Mr. Webb's premises, from whence there is a door which leads into Mr. Hawkins's room; after the prisoner was remanded, I went back, and minutely searched the premises, and found several keys—I took the key from the kitchen-door, and tried it to Mr. Hawkins's warehouse-door—it opened it—it is a kind of side-door into the passage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had the prisoner been in custody when you say he appeared uneasy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five or six minutes—there is nothing particular in this key; it is a common one—the house has been all one, but has been divided off—I did not try this key to the other doors—it does not correspond with the other key I found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to John Hawkins and his two part<lb></lb>ners—they are calico-spinners and manufacturers. In consequence of inform<lb></lb>ation, I have taken stock, and missed sixteen pieces altogether, worth 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have missed six of them since I made my deposition—we have a great quantity of calico from Manchester—it comes in bales of so many pieces each—the door from the warehouse in the passage leads into the interior of Messrs. Webb's warehouse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had not you taken stock before you gave your evi<lb></lb>dence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not the whole—we were obliged to write to Manchester several times—I have said the amount of the loss was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we compared the letters and stock accounts we received from Manchester with the goods we had in London—there are from 1,500 to 2,000 pieces of calico in the warehouse—the average price is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—we supply five houses, from whence our cali<lb></lb>coes are distributed to all the retail shops—it would be very difficult to find a shop in London where they are not.</p>

The prisoner was in the service of Fuller and Webb, in the adjoining premises—I accompanied the officers to search, and saw the calico found in a bundle, which the prisoner's wife was tying up—this is it—it is mine—I know it by the finish and make, by the fibre—this is not a whole piece, and our pencil-mark is not here—I only know it by the finish—I form the same judgment of these other pieces—there are five or six different qualities.</p>

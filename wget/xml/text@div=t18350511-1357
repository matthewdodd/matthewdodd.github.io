It is in the parish of Christchurch, I think—I do not pay taxes—I sometimes sell fish, and sometimes fruit—I do not rent the house, it is let out in tenements—I am a lodger—the landlord does not live in the house—I have one room to myself, separate from the other lodgers—on the 22nd of April, between eight o'clock at night, and one o'clock in the morning, this happened—I locked my room-door at eight o'clock, and was absent from eight till one o'clock—my wife was with me—we went towards Greenwich fair—when I went away, I left the prisoner sitting on the steps, outside my door—I am quite certain I locked the room-door—we returned between twelve and one o'clock in the morning—I found my room-door open, and missed a looking-glass off the drawers—I knew the prisoner before, by his brother being with me—he lived nearly opposite to me—I got a constable and went after him, and found him in bed—he lives with his mother, who is a widow—I told him I had lost the glass—he denied it—I took him to the station-house in Tower-street, and after the Inspector put a few questions to him, he said he had taken it, and sold it to a woman named Rogers, for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went to her house, and found it there.</p>

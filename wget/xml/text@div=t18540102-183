                  </hi>. I am the head of the firm of Baxter, Rose, and Norton, solicitors and Parliamentary agents, of Park-street, Westminster. I knew nothing of the prisoner until Friday, 2nd Dec.—at that time there was a vacancy for a master in a school at Finningley, in Yorkshire—I had received certificates or recommendations from the prisoner, through the intervention of Mr. Woodhouse, the rector of the parish—there were about</p>

               <p>ten or a dozen certificates of character, which the prisoner had transmitted to Mr. Woodhouse—on Friday, 2nd Dec, the prisoner called at my place of business—I said to him, "I have received these documents" (holding the certificates in my hand) "from Mr. Woodhouse, the rector of Finingley, and he states that you have sent them to him, and are applying for the situation, of schoolmaster there"—he replied, "I sent these to Mr. Woodhouse"—at that time I had them before me, and produced them to him—among them was one purporting to have come from the Rev. Mr. Johnston, the rector of Lutterworth, dated in Nov., 1853—I told the prisoner that Mr. Woodhouse had requested me to see and examine, and judge of his qualifications, and if I thought him qualified, to engage him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you say about that certificate; you say you showed him that among others? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked him if he had the original; I showed him that one.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it purport to be a copy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were all copies.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you produced that to him, you asked him if he had the original? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; (I had not, at that time, received any letter addressed to Mr. Woodhouse from Mr. Johnston)—the prisoner replied that he would bring the originals at any time—I then examined him as to his knowledge of the subjects which would be required in a schoolmaster; and having done so, I told him I would rather see my friend Mr. Woodhouse, in the country, where I was going the next day, and judge of his expectations, and appoint another day upon which the prisoner could bring the originals—I saw the prisoner again on 7th Dec.—between the 2nd and 7th I had seen Mr. Woodhouse, and received a letter that had been addressed to him by Mr. Johnston—when the prisoner came on the 7th, I asked him if he had the originals with him—he produced various originals, and, among the rest, one which he said was signed by Mr. Johnston, the rector of Lutter-worth—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "Gentlemen,—Mr. and Mrs. Sharman have been known to me for some years; and for some time they had the charge of a large school, under my control and superintendence, which they conducted with great ability and success. Indeed, the committee, parents, and children, were sorry when they resigned; and some of the latter presented them with small tokens of their esteem. I have therefore very great plea<lb></lb>sure in bearing my testimony to their excellent moral character, and their suitability for the office of instructors to the rising generation, and can with confidence recommend them for the situation they seek, knowing them to be peculiarly adapted for the right management of children.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did the prisoner describe the gentleman by whom this was said to have been signed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked him as to that particularly—I said, "Is this the signature of Mr. Johnston, the rector of Lutterworth?"—he said, "It is;" and that there might be no mistake, I said, after a little interval, "Are you sure this is the signature of Mr. Johnston, the rector of Lutterworth?" and he again said it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you at that time before you the letter from Mr. Johnston to Mr. Woodhouse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had; and I said, "This is very extra<lb></lb>ordinary, for I have a letter, which I will read to you, from Mr. Johnston;" and I then read to him this letter (<hi rend="italic">reading it</hi>)—"Claybrook, Lutterworth, Dec. 1, '53," addressed to Rev. G. H. Woodhouse. "Rev. Sir,—In answer to your letter, received this morning, I have to state that the testimonial</p>

               <p>you have received from Mr. Sharman, bearing my name, must be a forgery for I have given nothing of the kind, nor has Mr. Sharman ever been a master at any school in Lutterworth. Some ten or fifteen years back, or more, there was a Mr. Sharman, master to the infant school at Hinckley, and an excellent master he was; but his moral character proved to be such, that he was obliged to leave. If you can lay hold of the Mr. Sharman who has signed the testimonial, I think he ought to be punished. I suspect he is the man that was master of the infant school at Hinckley. I am, Sir, yours faithfully, R. H. Johnston."—when I had read the letter to him to the end, I observed that the initials to the letter did not corre<lb></lb>spond with the initials to the certificate—I observed that to him, and said, "How can you pretend this to be the signature of Mr. Johnston, when it has not his proper initials?"—the prisoner was confused; and I then said, "Do you still pretend to tell me that this certificate is his signature?"—he said, "No; but I am sure I have got the original among my papers, and I can find it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But I thought this was the original? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He so stated it, in the first instance, twice over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What further passed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner then pro<lb></lb>duced a large book, which I have here, full of various letters, and asked me to look at those—I told him I wanted Mr. Johnston's original, if he had such a thing; but after searching for some time, he said it was not in this book, but if I would let him go home, he would fetch it—I then sent for an officer, and had him taken into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you did not let him go home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not; I sent for an officer, and gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before he stated to you that it was not the original (having first stated that it was), had you called his attention to the difference in the handwriting between the genuine letter of Mr. Johnston and the writing of the certificate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I called his attention to the difference in the initials—there is a similarity in the handwriting, but I had not, until I had myself read through the letter to him, seen the difference in the initials—assuming the writing not to be genuine, it appeared to me to be an imitation of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I, on 2nd Dec, produce any copy of testimonial or testimonials from Mr. Johnston? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the copy testimonial from Mr. Johnston was among those which were transmitted to me from Mr. Wood-house as received from you, and was among the testimonials which I exhibited to you, and asked for the originals—I asked if you could produce the originals—you said you could—I told you I could not look through those originals at that time, but you said you would produce them at some other period, any time I might fix—I did not mention Mr. Johnston's name at all to you on 2nd Dec.—on 7th Dec you produced to me the paper which I have handed in, which you stated to be the original, and I had in my hand the copy testimonial which Mr. Woodhouse had transmitted to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, did I present to you any single certificate, or any collective number of certificates? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You presented to me a great many certificates, and that among others—when you entered the room I was opening my letters from the post, and I referred you to my secretary, Mr. Drake, asking you to exhibit all the originals of all the copies which you had transmitted, and begging him to call them over one by one, to see that you had procured all the originals—I asked him to put down the copies, one by one, on a sheet of paper, and then to mark off, one by one, those copies of which you produced the originals—Mr. Johnston's was not <hi rend="italic">ticked</hi>—it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185401020037"></xptr>
               <p>not one of those which you produced to Mr. Drake, but I myself asked you for Mr. Johnston's—I will swear, according to my remembrance, that you did not produce that to Mr. Drake; I had to ask you for it, I remember that distinctly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Drake take them, and put them down in your presence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did; it was all done in my presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You have stated upon your oath that I presented this to you; I ask you again whether the documents were not collectively presented to you by your secretary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All the documents that you produced to him were presented to me collectively; but when I came to look at the list of the originals produced, I found Mr. Johnston's original was not among that list, and I asked you myself for Mr. Johnston's certificate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it was not produced at first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not produced at first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I state that that was Mr. Johnston's original? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, twice over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Pardon me, you are wrong there, I made no answer. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I asked you the question when you presented me the paper, "Is that the signature of Mr. Johnston, the rector of Lutterworth?"—you said, "Yes, it is; and after a little interval I put the same question again to you, and you gave me the same answer, that it was his signature—I swear that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You did not ask me as to the signature at all; will you swear that I afterwards said it was not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when I had observed and pointed out to you the difference of the initials to the name, I said, "Do you still mean to say this is Mr. Johnston's signature when the initials do not even correspond?"—you then said, "No, but I am sure I have got the original, and I can produce it to you"—I do not remember your saying that you had received an excellent character from the committee of that school of which Mr. Johnston was a member.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I not, when I produced that book, refer you to certain certificates, to prove that I had held a school under Mr. Johnson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You did produce two papers, I think, which you begged me to read, to prove that you had been at a school under Mr. Johnston—I read them. over, and told you it did not appear to me that those documents proved any such thing—I do not remember your referring me to a printed document as the last report of that school, of which Mr. Johnston was a constant visitor—perhaps you can point it out to me—(<hi rend="italic">the book was handed to the prisoner, who pointed out two papers to the witness</hi>)—I do not remember ever having seen these two printed documents before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not, when I showed them to you, make the observation that they had nothing to do with this present certificate of Mr. Johnston? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not have made it upon these documents to the best of my remembrance, for I do not remember to have read them before the present moment—you did show me some papers, but they were manuscript papers, and I said as to those, "These have nothing whatever to do with Mr. Johnston's certificate"—I believe you did not show me these—I have no remembrance of them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at another paper pointed out by the prisoner</hi>); I think this paper was shown to me—it is signed by Mr. Hayes, as secretary of the school, and is dated Nov. 11, 1831: "Minute of the committee of the Hinckley school. The committee have great pleasure in giving their certificate of good character to Mr. and Mrs. Sharman, and the ability with which they have conducted the infant school for the last four years."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that in print, or writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In writing; it is a copy, not an original.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I not show you an original letter of the Rev. Thomas Smith, in which he states that he had received an excellent character of me from one of the members of the committee of that school? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Looking at a paper pointed out by the prisoner</hi>) yes; this paper was shown to me—it is dated Sheffield, and purports to be signed by Thomas Smith; and upon this, knowing most of the clergy of Sheffield, I asked you who Mr. Smith was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What answer was given to your question? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I forget the purport of the answer, but it did not throw any light upon my personal knowledge of the parties in Sheffield—I then saw an original in his book, the signature to which I think I knew to be an original, from a gentleman of the name of Hoole, in Sheffield—he is a solicitor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Mr. Hoole was treasurer of a school with which I was con<lb></lb>nected nearly six years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I say one word to you about wishing to return home in refe<lb></lb>rence to the certificate of Mr. Johnston? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; after searching for some time, and not being able to find anything in this book, you said if you returned home you could find the original, and would bring it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not I say, in answer to your question about Mr. Johnston's, that I had it not; that I had received other letters from Mr. Johnston, which I had, and that I thought I had one in my book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You distinctly said you had it not, and you also added that you had other letters from Mr. Johnston—you looked in your book for the letter, but at last you desired to go home to fetch it, and I then told you I should be obliged to give you into custody—I state that on my oath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have stated that he produced to you two written documents; and that upon the production of those written docu<lb></lb>ments, and reading them, you said you did not consider they had any reference to the signature of Mr. Johnston? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I believe those were the two written documents to which he has now referred me in this book—he said he had Mr. Johnston's original, and would fetch it; and he also added that he had a letter, or letters, of Mr. Johnston's besides that original!—I am not quite sure whether he made use of the word "besides," but is was perfectly intelligible that he had a letter, or letters, of Mr. Johnston's besides the original.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he tell you from whom he had received that; paper which he told you was signed by Mr. Johnston? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told me he had it from Mr. Johnston; I am quite certain he did not say he had it from a Mr. Sutton—I believe Mr. Sutton's name was not mentioned at that interview—I knew Mr. Sutton very well—he was vicar of Sheffield—he is now dead; he has been dead five or six yean—I believe his name was not at all men<lb></lb>tioned at that interview—I certainly should have remembered it if it had been mentioned, because I knew Mr. Sutton so intimately—his name was not mentioned—there were other clergy of Sheffield mentioned a Mr. Lipsey, for instance, but the prisoner decidedly did not say to me that he had received this certificate of Mr. Johnston's from Mr. Sutton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I not distinctly state to you that I received a most excellent testimonial, of which that was a copy, from the Rev.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not, in answer to my question, say, "I knew Mr. Sutton very well, but he is dead," and I then referred you to Mr. Lipsey, of St. Philip's</p>

The signature to this letter is mine, the signature to the certificate is not—I was not at all aware of its existence until I received a communication from Mr. Woodhouse—I wrote the letter to Mr. Woodhouse which has been read by Mr. Baxter—I cannot say how long it is since I had anything to do with the prisoner, but I believe above twenty years—in the month of Nov. last year, or within any recent period, I should not have given aim such a certificate, because I had no knowledge of him latterly; he had been a very good master at Hinckley—I was only upon the committee, the school was not under my control—I did not authorise anybody to write any such letter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not I receive a most excellent character when I became master of the Hinckley school? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly; you conducted the school to the satisfaction of myself and Mr. Dicey, who was a constant visitor—I do not know whether you resigned the school of your own accord—I cannot say what was the cause of your leaving—I cannot say that Mr. Dicey and myself came over to Hinckley to request you to continue in the school after you had resigned; it is above twenty years ago, and I really could not say one way or the other—I certainly say you were a very good master when you were at Hinckley, but after that I can say nothing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>I cannot say that I sent you a letter by a Mr. Firth, about two years after you had gone to Sheffield, to know whether you were comfortable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have hinted in your letter to Mr. Woodhouse that there was something in my moral character that made me leave. Do you know Mr. Dicey's handwriting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very well (<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter produced by the prisoner</hi>); this is his writing; it is dated 6th April, '42, and begins, "Dear Mr. Sharman,"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mr. Dicey being a Magistrate, and a principal supporter of the Hinckley school, do you suppose, if there had been anything prejudicial to my character, he would have addressed me in '42 as "Dear Mr. Sharman?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I should say he would not—Mr. Dicey was certainly in a position to know whether there was anything prejudicial to your character or not, quite as much so as myself—you have been out of my sight for these twenty years, and I did not know at all what was passing with respect to you—I know Mr. Firth, of Ullasthorpe—I do not recollect sending a letter to you by him, I might have done so—I cannot say that I did or did not send such a letter a year and a half after you left Hinckley, wishing to know whether you were comfortable, and if not, the committee were anxious again to receive you—I do not know where the letter that I did write to you was directed, but I remember stating that it was no use your applying for the Lutterworth school, as there were so many other applicants—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one produced by the prisoner</hi>)—I state here that I well recollect your good management—it is dated 1849.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If so short a time since as 1849 you did not recollect having com<lb></lb>municated with me, is it not possible that you may have altogether forgotten having written a testimonial for me to the Rev: Thomas Sutton, some six-teen or eighteen years ago? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes! it is quite possible—I would not swear that I did not give Mr. Sutton a testimonial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You will not swear that this is not an exact copy of a testimonial that was given by you to Mr. Sutton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This signature is not mine, and the date is certainly of last year, Nov., 1853—I certainly have not the least recollection of giving Mr. Sutton a testimonial with the exact words there used; I believe I did not—I do 'not know when the testimonial to Mr. Sutton was given—at the time you left Hinckley I would have given you such a testimonial as this; but I would not have done it latterly—I have never, directly or indirectly, stated in any communication I have made to you, that I would not have done so; I have never, that I know of, ever hinted to you that there was anything incorrect in your conduct—you had no reason to anticipate from anything that you heard from me that I should change my mind with reference either to your character or ability—you never heard anything from me to that effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How can you charge me with a forgery, if you do not know whether you gave me a certificate or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I know that in Nov. 1853, I gave no such certificate—I know this is not my handwriting, and there<lb></lb>fore I know that this is a forgery—I really think I did not give Mr. Sutton this; this is a forgery, because it is not my signature; therefore it is what I consider a forgery—it is not a copy of that given to Mr. Sutton, because the date is different; the date makes all the difference; I might give a very good certificate at one time, but many years afterwards a copy of that becomes a forgery—this does not profess to be a copy, but it professes to be my own, whereas it is not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you did not recollect, until he called it to your memory, the transaction with respect to a correspondence about</p>

               <p>another school which took place in the year 1849; I believe you are now more than seventy years of age? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I do not recollect that from the time he left Hinckley up to the time when my attention was called to this certificate, he ever applied to me for a good character for any purpose—in modern times I certainly should not have given him such a certificate as this.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The letter produced by the prisoner was read, as follows:</hi>—"To Mr. J. Sharman.

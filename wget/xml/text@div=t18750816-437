I live at 6, Bloomfield Road, Maida Hill, and have an office at 2, Pancras Lane, Cheapside—I am president of the German Relief Society—up to Friday, 16th July, the female prisoner was a stranger to me—she came to my office on that day and brought with her this card with the name of Mr. Dietmar who was known to me, and my name and address was written on the back of it by Mr. Dietmar—she said that Mr. Dietmar had sent her and had also assisted her; that she had a passage to Hamburg paid by the Society of Foreigners in Distress, in London Wall and she and her husband were to start the nest day, Saturday, but being destitute and having some things in pledge she wanted to take them out and for that purpose she asked me if 1 could do anything for her from our society—I told her that our meetings were once a week, on the Thursday and I gave her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of my own—I also gave her an address of another German gentleman—she came to me later in the day at my desire because I had told her that I would see if I could find any one else to assist her—I wrote the name of Gustave and Emiline Arnold on the card at the first inter<lb></lb>view—those were the names she gave of herself and husband—she did not say where she was living on either of those two occasions—on Monday, 19th July she called about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I expressed my surprise to see-her as I expected she would be on—the road to Hamburg—she replied that she had come from Dr. Sholl or Dr. Capel, I am not certain which, but one of the parties connected with the society to assist foreigners in distress, and she had arranged to postpone her passage to the Wednesday following—I asked her for what purpose—she said she had a few things yet to settle before starting, that she had a few things that she was most desirous of having with her, still in pawn and she wanted to get some additional money to take them out—she asked me if I could give her any further names—I told her I could not annoy my friends in that way—she then said she had a very nice dog which she could not pay the passage for to Hamburg, and if I liked to accept it she would give it to me—I said that under her circumstances I could not accept a present of that description, but if it was worth anything I would</p>

It expressly said</hi> "<hi rend="italic">any part of a valuable security</hi>;" <hi rend="italic">it therefore applied to any paper which might afterwards be converted into a valuable security. Its being in an imper<lb></lb>fect form would not prevent the operation of the statute. If it were otherwise, a lawyer who by restraint or threats dictated a perfect valuable security would be guilty, and a layman whose intention was the same, but had not the requisite knowledge, would not be guilty.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE BRETT</hi>. "I <hi rend="italic">am clearly of opinion that this is not a promissory note or a negotiable instrument, and never could be made one. Therefore the question must be whether such an instrument is within the statute. The words of the stutute are 'a valuable security.' It is suggested that the meaning of that is a negotiable security; but when we look at the interpretation clause it is obvious that it is much larger than that, because it includes many things which are clearly not negotiable. If that be so, the question is whether this is a security, and whether it is valuable? It seems to me that on the face of it, if the a fair were a genuine one, it is an agreement to pay money; it is an agreement to pay 1001. in consideration of the person, to whom the promise is given, undertaking not to bring an action against the person by whom it is given. It is a document which, if it were genuine, would be strong, if not conclusive evidence against the prosecutor when made a defendant, that for a good consideration he had agreed to pay a sum of money. It is not a debenture; if it was, no consideration need appear on the face of it</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Being an agreement only, it is necessary</hi> in <hi rend="italic">order to make it valuable that a sufficient consideration should appear on the face of it, and I am of opinion that there is a sufficient consideration appearing on the face of it, and that it is strong evidence of a binding agreement upon which, if the affair were genuine, the prisoner might have sued the. prosecutor. It seems to me that it is an in<lb></lb>strument upon which, if genuine, the person who procured it might recover the amount against the person signing it. I am therefore of opinion, although it is not a negotiable instrument, yet in as much as it would, if genuine, be evi<lb></lb>dence of a binding agreement, it is a binding agreement between the parties, and it is within the Statute.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">The male prisoner dictated to the interpreter a long address, the effect of which was that having entertained suspicions of his wife's fidelity, he had watched her, and on the day in question on returning home with a friend and finding the prosecutor and his wife together under circumstances which con<lb></lb>firmed his suspicions, he charged her with adultery, and desired the prosecutor. to quit the house; that upon that the prosecutor offered him money, and at the suggestion of his friend he reluctantly consented to that course.</hi>

WILLIAMS</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in addressing the Jury on behalf of the female prisoner, urged that the evidence did not warrant the suggestion that she was a party to the attempted extortion; and, further, that if she was, yet being the wife of the male prisoner, and acting under his control, she would be entitled to an acquittal. A certificate of marriage on 1st October, 1872, at Ham, of Auguste John and Sophia Amelia Aberline, called Koch, was handed in.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">told the Jury that if they were of opinion that the woman took an independent part in carrying out the crimes, the fact of her being the wife could not absolve her. He should advise them, to consider her as the wife; if so, anything done by her in his presence and under his control, the law would excuse, but if she was taking an independent part in the mailer when he was not there, then she would be answerable, although she were his wife.</hi>

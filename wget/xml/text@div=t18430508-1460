                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Bank of England. On the 1st of April, I was at the afternoon service at St. Paul's Cathedral, in one of the stalls on the north side—the clergyman officiating was nearly opposite to me, and a little lower on the south side—he was on a line with other persons, rather elevated, but lower than me—I was in one of the stalls—it was Mr. Haden—at the prayer for the Queen, I observed a person nearly opposite to me, and about two yards from the officiating clergy<lb></lb>man, appeared to stand while the majority of the congregation were kneeling—he appeared to me to have a book under a bag or handkerchief, or some<lb></lb>thing of a red colour—I thought he was about to follow the clergyman in his duty—the red bag was before him—his face was to the east—I was on his left hand, as the last gentleman in the jury box is—the congregation were with their faces as mine is, towards your lordship, consequently the congre<lb></lb>tion behind and before could not see him, but I could see him, being on his left hand—the clergyman was on his right-hand—the light comes from the east window—I saw him, as I thought about to open his book, but instead of the book the light fell on the barrel of the pistol—I immediately rose up and screamed out "Seize him," or something, "he has a pistol"—I alarmed the congregation, and saw him at the same time turn the pistol round—I distinctly saw the brass from the light falling on it—I left my seat, calling out during the whole time, came along the stalls towards the body of the church, and came down the steps—while I was on the steps the pistol was elevated by him, and I saw the sparks from the pan—I cannot distinctly say whether it was pointed at any one in particular then, as I had altered my position—my eye was directed more to the pistol than to the direction of it—I went a few days afterwards into the same stall, and Mr. Haden was also performing duty in the same situation, and I was surprised to find that from the situation I was in, and the situation Mr. Haden was in, that if the pistol was turned at all it must be turned in the direction of that clergyman—after I had called out for some moments, the congre-</p>

               <p>gation were alarmed—the pistol was seized by one person close to him, and he was seized by another person—I think the pistol was knocked down—I saw the sparks when the pistol was elevated, and before the pistol was seized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BRYARLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say it was impossible the pistol could be directed otherwise than at the clergyman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not said so—I did not afterwards measure the spot from where the prisoner stood to where Mr. Haden stood, but feel satisfied it was not three yards cer<lb></lb>tainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether anybody struck the prisoner's arm before the pistol went off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was some struggling—the impression on my mind is that the sparks were distinctly discharged from the pistol before the prisoner was touched—though I had left my seat, I think I could see the whole that was going on—I kept my eye distinctly on the pistol, and on his hand—he sunk his hand, certainly, after raising it—he raised the pistol, and discharged it—whether he discharged it at any person I cannot say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So that in the interval nothing was done between his holding the pistol in the direction you suppose, his presenting it, and it going off—were you so placed as to tell the pistol could not have been raised, taken down, and after<lb></lb>wards go off in the scuffle? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, certainly not—it did not go off in the scuffle—the pistol was not seized, nor was he seized till the sparks had been emitted from the hammer—he was very sullen afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have measured to see where Mr. Haden was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I measured the distance I was at from the prisoner before I removed—I was about twenty feet from him, nearly in a straight line.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BRYARLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in a state of great agitation, or ia a condi<lb></lb>tion to notice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not so agitated but I intended to seize the man, had I been near him—of course I was very much alarmed at such an extra<lb></lb>ordinary circumstance, believing the man to be about to enter into the de<lb></lb>votions of the service, and then to have a murderous attempt, I of course was alarmed—I should be sorry to say I was not agitated.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the muzzle of the pistol appear to be pointed so as to reach the clergyman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was most certainly elevated, and not elevated to strike any one level with the prisoner, but if discharged, the ball or contents must go above the heads of the congregation on the floor, but what the pre<lb></lb>cise direction the muzzle of the pistol was I cannot say—when he discharged it I was further from him—when I saw the sparks—I was then more behind him, and in a lower situation—I had descended a step or two, and got into the body of the church—I think I was on the last step.</p>

"To E. R. Sintzenich, Esq., 41, Moscow-road, Bayswater, April 1, 1843. Dear Brother,—I wish to inform you of the situation I am in; I took it into my head this afternoon to have a pop at the clergyman in St. Paul's, and am now in a police-station in an alley that leads out of Fleet-street. I don't care much about it, as I did no harm; but be so good as not to tell papa and mamma yet, as it will put them out. My examination comes on on Monday at twelve o'clock, as I hear. I want you to come to see me, and no one else till I see you; but it did exasperate me above a bit when I heard the fellow calling the usurper, Queen, when I have lately discovered that James Stuart is the right sovereign. Give my love to all, and tell them not to be uneasy about me. Inquire for me at the police-station, Fleet-street."</p>

BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> By whom were you shown this small quantity of pow<lb></lb>der? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was handed by some of the authorities in the cathedral to the officer who had the prisoner in custody—he had it in a small bit of paper when it was shown to me—I did not see it taken out of the pistol—it was about ten minutes after the prisoner was taken that it was shown to me—I cannot say how many hands it had passed through—it was not Mr. Lingard that showed it to me—it is not unusual for the flint of a pistol or gun to strike sparks without igniting the powder, if it is in the pan—if a pan is pro<lb></lb>perly charged with powder to go off, you will generally see some little soil on the hammer, and there was none whatever on the part of the hammer that presses on the pan—had it been primed as pistols usually are, it would have left a little foulness—the portion of charcoal in the powder would have caused that—I think a pistol having powder in the pan, and powder dropping out without being ignited, would probably leave a mark; it is usual; I am speak<lb></lb>ing generally of what I should conceive would be the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BRYARLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it not almost invariably the case, when powder is put into the pan, that some will remain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The generality of powder used, the common kind, from the greater portion of charcoal being mixed with it, would decidedly leave a portion to cause a soil, so as to be shown when rubbed, and the powder shown to me appeared to be a very inferior large grain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If priming was put in the pan of a pistol, and fell out without igniting, could you then detect whether there had been powder or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I conceive that would depend on the quantity of powder put in the pan—the smaller the quantity the less chance would there be of its leaving any sign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing there was a small quantity, yet sufficient to dis<lb></lb>charge a pistol, and that bad fallen out, would it necessarily leave powder for you to discover? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not unlikely it would deceive me—it might leave no mark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BRYARLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If there had been three or four times the quantity of powder you saw, would it have propelled the shot to the distance of the clergy<lb></lb>man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why I should suppose if there had been four times the quantity, it would have blown the shot out, decidedly—it would then reach a person six feet off—but unless it hit the eye I conceive it would have done no harm—if it hit the eye it would.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Euston-grove, Euston-square, and am a chorister at the chapel-royal. I was present at St. Paul's on the 1st of April—I saw the prisoner draw a pistol from his breast—I cannot say who he aimed it at—it did not go off—he drew it back, and I believe somebody hit him on the head, and it was then taken away from him—he put it a little forward again after he was struck, and then he was pulled back—I saw him try to cock the pistol after he had presented it—I did not see in what direction it was when it went off—I did not see the sparks or bear the snap—it did not go off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the minor canons of St. Paul's. I was present there on the 1st of April, and saw the pistol fired—my atten<lb></lb>tion was called to what was going on, by hearing a violent noise on the oppo<lb></lb>site side of the choir, from some gentlemen in the stalls—I jumped up, looked towards the person making a noise, saw his gesticulation with his arms—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184305080047"></xptr>
               <p>seemed in violent agitation—at last I heard the words, "The pistol" pro<lb></lb>nounced—I immediately turned my eye under where I was sitting, and there saw the prisoner, at the very instant my eye caught him, throw his right arm round, as if endeavouring to extricate it from the grasp of somebody behind, I saw a pistol in his hand—it was then extended to about an angle of forty-five degrees, towards that part of the choir in which the communion-table is placed—there were two gentlemen sitting on the seat immediately behind him, and when the pistol came in contact almost with their heads, they seemed to shrink back, almost involuntarily—the gentleman who gave the alarm immediately cried out, "Seize the pistol!" when one of them darted his arm forward with the utmost rapidity, and grasped the barrel of the pistol—a very short struggle took place, in which the pistol was snapped, as if the man's hand was on the trigger, and the act of drawing it out of his hand had caused it to go off—I observed something white protruding from the mouth of the pistol—the man was then seized and taken away—immediately after the service I went into the vestry, where he was secured—the policeman gave me the pistol, and I drew a dirty white paper from the muzzle—there were two inches of it protruding from the muzzle—I found some paper at the bottom of the pistol, besides what was in the muzzle—it was in the barrel—it was crum<lb></lb>pled paper—Mr. Lingard extracted it with a piece of wire—I took the paper, and spread it open on the vestry table, and should think twenty or thirty grains of powder dropped from the paper—it was apparently inclosed in the paper with the shot, which had dropped out when I spread it on the table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you of opinion, supposing the paper to have been set fire to, that it would have projected the shot, that it would have gone off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—I am accustomed to fire-arms, and in my opinion it could not have ex<lb></lb>ploded—it did not appear to me to have been primed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you find any powder in the pan? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None—I as<lb></lb>sume it was not primed, from the quantity of sparks emitted—if it had been primed it would have exploded, probably from the sparks—they appeared sparks from the flint and steel—I observed then it was a flint and steel pistol—I saw the charge drawn by Mr. Lingard—I do not know how for down the barrel it was—I was sounding it myself with the wire before he drew it—it was down quite at the breech of the pistol—it is my firm belief the powder and shot were inclosed in the paper—I cannot distinctly say whether they dropped from the paper, or followed it when it was drawn out, but am perfctly clear the grains of powder were inclosed in the paper, for I brushed them off from it on opening it—I do not think they adhered to the outside of the paper—after the paper was drawn, Mr. Lingard put the wire down the barrel again, stirred it about, and on rapping the muzzle on the table, a small quantity of powder came out, with a great quantity of rust.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the next thing to the touch-hole was powder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It may be so—there certainly was a few grains of powder at the bottom of the pistol, mixed with rust—I was immediately over the spot where the occurrence took place—I was next to Mr. Haden—the prisoner was between me and the person who seized the pistol—his face was towards me—the person who seized the pistol was behind the prisoner—the pistol has a very large touch-hole, and if it had been loaded with powder, a great quantity of the charge must have come into the pan—if the trigger had been pulled without igniting, it is very pro<lb></lb>bable a great quantity of the charge might have been lost.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HARKE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I wish to say, on account of the last gentleman's evidence, that the pistol was directed towards the communion table—I think it right I should state the impression I had on my mind when I saw the sparks from the pistol—I was either on the steps, or in the body of the church, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184305080048"></xptr>
               <p>from that situation, whether the pistol was directed to the clergyman, or more towards the communion-table, as the gentleman has said, I cannot say; but it appeared, from the situation I was in, it was directed more towards the com-munion-table than towards the clergyman; but I think that appearance arose from my altered situation.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Villiers Street, Camden Town—on Satur<lb></lb>day, 2nd June, I was going for a row on the Thames between 3 and 4 a.m. with two other lads named Thompson and Sutton—the prisoner was in the boat—he said "I am going to draw the plug"—I said "No, I shall not let you"—he said "I will," and I said "No"—we both got out of the boat—he said "If you hit me I shall run this knife into you"—I said "I do not want to hit yon," and T pushed him—I pushed him again and he ran his</p>

I am house-surgeon to the Poplar Hospital—Munday was brought in on June 2nd—he was very pale, and suffering from loss of blood—he had an incised wound on the left side, caused by some sharp instrument—I probed the wound, and it went to the left rib—it was very dangerous—it must have been a violent blow, from the quantity of clothes it had gone through.</p>

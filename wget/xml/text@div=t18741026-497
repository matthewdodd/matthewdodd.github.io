                  </hi>. I am a gardner at Ashburton, in Devonshire, and also near Staverton—during the summer I had about fourteen tons of fruit to dispose of—I have a step-son whose name is John Red away—about the middle of July he came to London, and I authorised him to advertise in the London papers for the purpose of finding purchasers—I subsequently received a communication from Bennett and Co.—I have not been able to find that letter—I received other letters from Bennett and Co., but I think it was in consequence of the first letter that I sent a sample of the fruit—afterwards, during the month of September, I sent fruit from time to time—on 12th September I sent 3 tons 4 cwt. of apples and 4 1/2 cwt. of pears, the charge for which was 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 19th September 1 ton 5 cwt. of apples, 16 cwt. of pears, 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that includes the hampers and empties—in consequence of a telegram I sent 38 lbs. of grapes at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb., and on the 22nd I sent 18 lbs.—on the 25th I sent 1 ton 10 cwt of pears, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 3 tons of apples, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 26th September 1 ton 5 cwt of apples, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 11 cwt of pears 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the total value of the fruit sent was about 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were consigned to Bennett and Co., 74, Little Britain—I authorised my step-son to receive the money for the fruit.

These are the letters I received from time to time in the progress of sending the fruit to London—there is one letter missing, and it was in the same handwriting as these—it was concerning the quantity of fruit I had to sell, asking for samples and the price—I sent a sample and received a letter from Bennett to say he would give me 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for apples and 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for pears all round, and after the receipt of the goods he would send the cash within seven days—the 14th August was the day of the first consignment—I must have received another letter before that—I sent all the fruit and got none of the money—the statement made in the letters was that H. Bennett and Co. were merchants at 74, Little Britain—I received a letter from my step-son during the progress of the matter stating that they were salesmen in Covent Garden Market—all the consignments were addressed to 74, Little Britain.</p>

Two or three letters passed before any fruit was sent at all—I asked my step-son when he was in London to call at Bennett and Co.'s and describe the fruit to them which I had, and then I received a communication from him—my son went into Mr. Bennett's employment—I can't say when that was—I received a letter from Mr. Bennett complaining that the fruit was wet and damaged—fruit is apt to damage if it lays by any length of time—there was no agreement that I was</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">recalled</hi>). I am the step-son of the prosecutor—I live at John Street, Hanway Street, Tottenham Court Road—I came to town in search of employment about the 12th July this year, and I inserted an advertisement in the newspapers with reference to the sale of the fruit—a day or two after that I called on the defendants at 74, Little Britain, in consequence of a letter I received from my step-father—I saw Bennett in the first instance—the name of Bennett and Co. was on the door—I gave Bennett a description of the fruit and told him to apply to my step-father for further particulars—he said he would—I did not mention the price—I called again at the same place in a few days and I again saw Bennett—the first time T called I told him I was out of employment and asked him if he knew of anything, and he asked me to call in again—on the second occasion he asked me what employment I wanted and whether I should like to come with them—I said I would think over it and call again another day—the next time I called I saw Kenzett and repeated to him what I had said to Bennett—he spoke to me about the situation—I had never seen him before—I did not know who he was when I went in, but he said he was Bennett's partner and that they were merchants—he asked me if I would like to come in their office—I said I did not understand anything about the business—he said "Well, just think it over and call again another day," so I took further time to consider—the next time I called I saw Bennett and he then told me he was a fruit salesman in Covent Garden Market—that was through me asking him what the work was to be—I asked him what I should have to do and he said I should have to keep the books for a little time, and after I had been a little time with them he would take me in the market with him—I waited two or three days and then I called in again as Kenzett was not there before—I saw them both and talked about my coming to accept the appointment and I was, to stay with them for one month—Bennett offered me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—Kenzett said that was not enough, they would give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said on those terms I would come to work for them—I was to have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week for a couple of months and after that. I was to go out into the country for them to buy goods, to keep them supplied in Covent Garden Market and to sell for them as well—I entered upon my duties on the 7th September at the office, 74, Little Britain—I stayed there a month within two or three days—I was there every day—I kept up a communication with my step-father during that time—one basket of grapes came there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187410260132"></xptr>
               <p>and that was all—I never saw any business carried on there—there was a desk and two chairs and an inkstand in the office and there were a few samples of hair for stuffing sofas and chairs, a piece of leather, some tobacco, a lot of engravings of fenders, and tools, and machinery, and there was some glue—after. I had been there about eight days Kenzett took me out with him and we had a glass of ale, and he said he should like me to go and sell that kind of machinery, of which they had the patterns—he showed me a book of patterns—I said if I thought I could get a living by it I should be very glad to do so after they had put me in the way a little—I did not go out—there were no books kept except one they used to copy the letters in sometimes—Bennett did the writing in that and sometimes Kenzett—there is none of my writing in it—I never wrote anything while I was there—I never kept any books—these letters are in Bennett's handwriting—I have often seen him write—I had nothing at all to do during the month I was there—I spoke to Bennett one day about it and he said "Well, I will change your duties next week"—he told me that the reason I had no books to keep was that the former clerk had left them and taken away 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and therefore the books were not fit for me to keep—I was satisfied with that explanation—I had authority from my step-father to receive the money for the fruit consigned and I asked Bennett to send a cheque for the first lot of goods—he said he would send at once—I repeated my request the next day and he said he was in a very great hurry, he was going down to Covent Garden Market and he would send the cheque on from there—I had asked him if the first lot of fruit had arrived and he said "Yes," and he told me that it was rather damp and that the large and small fruit was mixed together—I asked if I should come and help to sort it, but I did not see it at all—he did not tell me where or how he sold it—the last time I saw Bennett at the office was on the Saturday that I asked him for the cheque, and he said he would send it on when he got to the Market—that was three weeks after I had been there—up to that time I had been to the office every day—Kenzett was frequently there for the first two weeks and then he told me he was going down into the country to bury his sister, and I never saw him again until he was appre<lb></lb>hended—I was not paid any wages for the time I was there—I did not ask—they had letters come there addressed to the firm and occasionally some one called—they seemed to be business men—I don't recollect anybody named Eaton calling—I never went to the banker's for them—I have seen a cheque book but I never saw a cheque drawn—when I asked Bennett for the cheque he took one out of the box, put. it in his pocket, and said he would send it.</p>

When I went into the employment I said I did not know anything and they said they would teach me—I saw a book in which they kept copies of their letters; it was locked in the desk—I did not know they had got a place at Lower Marsh, Lambeth, where the fruit was stored—I did not apply to them for any wages—I was to be paid at the end of the week, and I was there a month all but four days, I think—a Mr. Perry, a tailor, called there occasionally—I left on the Tuesday, I can't tell you what day of the month it was—when I asked Bennett for the cheque he said "Do they want a cheque on account, or do they want to be paid for the first lot of goods"—I said "They want to be paid for the first lot of goods"—he said "I will send it on, but if I do I expect they will allow 5 per cent."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Little Britain, and am the landlord of the offices occupied by Bennett and Company—I let them furnished to Mr. Bennett and another gentleman, a Frenchman—Bennett said he wanted the office for his uncle—I think it was the beginning of June, I let them—I have seen him there from time to time, but I did not live in the house—I got one month's rent in advance and that was all—from August up to September, I have seen Kenzett there.</p>

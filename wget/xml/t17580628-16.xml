               <p>Sherrey. He said he found them.</p>

               <p>Sherrey. They said they came out of Mrs. White's house, about four that morning, and that the prisoner had offered a frock (not in the indictment) and hat to fell upon the road, by which means they told me they found the prisoner.</p>

I was looking at them when a man came by that lodged at Mrs. White's house, and wished me a good morning.</p>
               <p>E. White. I had a lodger that came and told me he saw the prisoner tying up two bundles, and he saw him cross the water for Kent, by which means we pursued him.</p>

                  </hi>. On 21st April Ram Sammy came to my shop and bought some bread and flour—he paid me with a shilling, which I put in the till—there was one shilling besides in the till, quite a new one—I gave him change—he went out of the shop, and Mr. Chapman from the Home came in in about two minutes—I looked in the till—I knew the shilling I had received from Ram Sammy—I examined it, and found it bad—I bent it, and afterwards gave it to Colonel Hughes.</p>

On the evening of 21st April I recollect Francis leaving the house—Ram Sammy left soon after—they went into a house and stayed till 10 o'clock at night—they came out together, and went into the Stranger's Home—Ram Sammy then went out, and went into Mr. Koch's, the baker's shop—when he came out I went in, and Mrs. Koch showed me a bad shilling—on the 23d both the prisoners were brought before Colonel Hughes—Mrs. Koch and Powell were present—the Colonel asked Ram Sammy where he obtained the shilling which he had pawed at the baker's shop—he pointed to Francis, and said, "That man gave"—Francis made no reply—I searched Ram Sammy's box, and found a pair of trowsers, and in the pocket of them four sixpences—Colonel Hughes asked him how he came by them, and he immediately pointed to Francis, and said, "That man gave."</p>

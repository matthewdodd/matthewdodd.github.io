                  </hi>. I perform the duty of a landing-waster at the Custom House, and live at Pitt's-place, Old Kent-road. I became acquainted with the prisoner in consequence of her coming to me and making inquiries about her husband, who she represented to have died during her absence from this country—she stated that he had been an interpreter at the Custom House, and was well known by those who were in the habit of frequenting there—she stated that the person with whom her husband resided refused to give up his effects, and she wished to know what means would he proper to use to recover possession of them—I gave her my address, having referred her to the Consul, telling her that I knew the secretary of the French Beneficent So<lb></lb>ciety, and that I would endeavour to obtain the restitution of her goods in the event of her not obtaining them through the medium of the Consul—I re<lb></lb>lieved her from time to time with money and food, and eventually, from an accident which she alleged to have received while carrying a message from my residence, which enabled her to obtain employment in needlework from a Quaker in London-wall, who gives it to distressed persons from motives of charity; I became security for the return of those goods, and she was unable to present herself, on account of this accident, and I therefore took her into into my service until the injury she had received should he cured, and during that period she committed this robbery—altogether she was in the house ten or twelve days—on the last day, between eight and half-past eight o'clock in the morning, she appeared to wish to get rid of me; exhibited a great deal of impatience for me to leave, and told me it was late; when I got outside, I found that I was not so late, but I had come out without my watch, and I went back to get it, and had then time to go leisurely to my duty—on my return home at half-past four, I found a hot joint prepared ready for dinner, but the prisoner was gone—I noticed a bit of wood chipped off the lock of one of my drawers, and I immediately found that a purse which it then contained had been emptied of its contents; a gold watch and other articles were also missing—26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. In gold, and about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. In silver—the owner of the house, Miss Dummer, and her sisters, reside in the house, myself, and another gentleman and lady—from something I ascertained from Miss Dum<lb></lb>mer, I went immediately, having first informed the police; to the Electric Telegraph Office, and gave a description of her, and she was stopped at Folkestone—while I was wasting at the office, I received a paper, telling me that she was arrested, on the train, which was then on its way, arriving at Folkestone—they sent me word, within a quarter of an hour from my arrival at the office, that she was in custody—I then went to Folkestone, and iden<lb></lb>tified her—about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was found on her, and a quantity of dresses, hosiery, and other goods, the produce of part of the money which she had expended, a gold watch, and the top of a smelling-bottle—I subsequently found other things—it appears that she had taken too much to drink, and she lost one parcel of goods on the road, which, by the diligence of the officer, I have succeeded in obtaining—when I charged her with stealing the money and watch, she at first said nothing—she afterwards said, "You gave them to me, to set me up in my own country"—I said, "This is base ingratitude on your part"—she said, "It is God's truth"—I spoke to her in French, and she replied in French—I asked her what had become of the remainder of the property—she said she only had 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that I had given her that amount with the watch—she said she was going to Dover—at that time she was very</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable at Folkestone. In consequence of a communication by the telegraph, I took the prisoner into custody on the 13th, about twenty minutes after nine o'clock—I told her that the informa<lb></lb>tion I had against her was for committing a robbery at London—she said she could not speak English, so I got an interpreter to tell her—he told her, and she said the money was given to her, and likewise the watch which I found on her—I also found nine sovereigns, ten half-crowns, six shillings, five sixpences, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece, and 8 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and a bundle of linen drapery, with an invoice, amounting to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., consisting of stockings, dresses, and other articles of females' wearing apparel—there is no date to the invoice.</p>

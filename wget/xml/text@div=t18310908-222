               <p>THE REV. JAMES MACDONALD. I am a <rs id="t18310908-222-viclabel1146" type="occupation">clergyman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18310908-222-victim1656 t18310908-222-viclabel1146"></join>. In 1829 I bought the machinery which had been used for the Steam Washing Company for 1,500l.; I had had some interviews with the prisoner, and on the 29th of June I took him and Smith into my service - their salaries began from that day; they were to have 300l. for the first year, 400l. for the second, and 500l. for the third; it was my intention to remove the articles I had purchased from where they were to the Isle of Dogs, but in July 1829, I had not began to build - I have had large buildings erected there since; I had no place then fixed to meet the prisoner, but I had seen him at the Somerset coffee-house, and he proposed that I should still meet him there - I met him there on the 4th of July, 1829, and he said there were a great many sets of harness, which had belonged to the old company, to be sold a very great bargain, and he had bargained for the purchase of them for 21l. with Mr. De Mole; and he asked me to give him a cheque for it - I drew the cheque which I have now in my hand, and gave it to him expressly to pay for that harness - it is drawn in favour of Mr. De Mole; I left London for Scotland on the 28th or 29th of July - I had given the prisoner a cheque for 50l. for the general purposes of the business, on the 11th of July; and before I left town I deposited in the hands of Messrs. Bosanquets 1000l., to the credit of Junius Smith and James Lee, with joint power to draw with two names to the cheques - I did not tell Smith that I had given Lee the cheques for this harness; he knew nothing of it - it was not till May of the present year that I discovered the cheque had not been paid for the harness.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. This cheque is dated July, 1829? A. Yes; (looking at an account) part of this is my writing; the prisoner had not been in the company's employ previously - Smith left me in July, 1830, and I appointed Captain Wager in Smith's place; the prisoner lived at Lewisham-hill - I preferred two or three indictments last September and four this - I did not complain to any Magistrate respecting this cheque.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he appears here for the first time to explain, if any error has arisen? A. Yes, I charged him at Bow-street with embezzlement last April - there were two examinations, and he was dismissed, on account of his bringing forward a book, which he pretended was an account kept for me, and by me which I disowned; the very instant I discovered this charge I went to my solicitor - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080103"></xptr>am not aware that three Sessions have passed - I dismissed the prisoner on the 11th of January last; he brought an action against me for wages, which was unjust, and I resisted it - I think that was in March - I proposed to give him 130l. as a settlement of all accounts, if he would stop the action, and he refused, but that was before I knew I was defrauded - he had taken one book away with him when he left; my cheques are generally kept at my bankers' for years, and sometimes I do not demand them for three years or more; I am not a man of business - they were returned to me a week or a fortnight ago- I keep a pass-book, and it is entered in my cash-books - it was proposed to me to refer all matters in dispute to an arbitration, and I agreed, but that was before I discovered the fraud; the prisoner and I very often went over the accounts to see how much had been expended, but not lately, before he left me, for we were not on speaking terms for some months; I do not recollect his telling me I had debited the washing concern with a great many cheques, which had been paid to my private account - I will say he did not say so - this cheque was never applied to my private purposes; there was no other cheque of 21l. about that time; these five items on this paper are my writing; it is a scribbling thing, it is no account: here appears for "Self" marked against them, and "Cheque 21l.; it is one of the items - I did not give any cheque of 21l.; it is my writing, but I do not call it an account - it is a rough scribble, which I might make to see what I might have to receive at a particular banker's hand; this is not the date in question, and probably not the year - here is a cheque of 21l. in Coutts's book, in July 1830, paid to Smart, and that may be the 21l. on that paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not on this paper "29th June?" A. Yes, but that means collections received from the beginning to June; there is no last date - it might be written in 1830, for there could be no debts collected till after 1830, as the buildings were not erected; the parties belonging to the harness were bankrupts four months afterwards, but not at the time; I imagined that it was to be delivered to me on payment of the money.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went before Mr. Hall in April last? A. Yes - Mr. Harmer was then my attorney; I did not then know about this 21l. cheque being stolen -I never 
               <persName id="t18310908-222-person1657">drew</persName>
             a cheque in favour of De Mole, except to pay for the harness; the prisoner never informed me it had not been applied for that purpose - there was no private account between us.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. The prisoner has not been in custody? A. No, the Court admitted him to bail last Session.</p>

            . I was a clerk to Mr. Macdonald with the prisoner. I remember an application being made on behalf of Mr. De Mole for 21l., but am not certain whether it was for harness or the works - the prisoner and I agreed that it should be paid by a cheque; I think that was in August - it was after the prosecutor had gone to Scotland; this is the cheque - the prisoner never told me he had another cheque for the harness; this cheque is on Bosanquet's, drawn by us, in favour of De Mole, for 21l.; it was to be paid out of 1000l. Mr. Macdonald had left there to meet expences while he was in Scotland.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there any secrecy in the prisoner's transactions? A. Not that I saw - I had access to Bosanquet's cheque-book; the prosecutor still holds the concern.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you access to Coutts' cheques? A. No.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and live in Threadneedle-street. In 1829 the assignees of the Washing Company sold the property to Matthew Smith; there was some harness; I saw the prisoner several times about it; the harness was sold, or about being sold, to Mr. Smith, for twenty guineas - the prisoner called about the transfer of some property, of which I had no knowledge, and spoke of purchasing the harness, among other things, for himself or Mr. Macdonald - I told him a sale was made to Smith, and I could not well have any thing to do with it; I ultimately received this 21l. cheque on Bosanquet's about the 14th of August, and the receipt was given I think for Mr. Smith, as I was careful not to mix the accounts; I had before refused to receive payment, and wrote to deliver the harness to Smith - I am not aware that the prisoner ever offored me any other cheque, but he offered to pay on several previous occasions, and I refused it; I think the negociation had been pending two months or longer.</p>
               <p>THE REV. MR. MACDONALD. The prisoner would not have occasion for more than the 1000l. during my absence- I had given him 50l. besides for general purposes; he had no need to apply this cheque to any other purpose.</p>
               <p>JUNIUS SMITH re-examined. Q. Did the prisoner ever pay you 21l., or bring to your knowledge that it had been received by a cheque? A. I was at the building, and he brought me money from town to pay for materials, and work people.</p>
               <p>THE REV. MR. MACDONALD. I have books with an account of money paid by Lee to Smith - I am sure this 21l. cheque was not returned to me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in a long address, stated that he had received the 21l. cheque himself, at Coutt's, and offered the cash to Mr. De Mole, as the prosecutor wished his name not be known in the concern - that on its being refused he had given the amount to the prosecutor, and that the prosecutor, on a settlement had acknowledged the receipt, as appeared by the account in question, and there was no other cheques to which the 21l. on that account could apply; that it must be evident if he had committed a fraud he would have taken the 130l. offered, rather than wait for a reference.</p>
               <p>MR. MACDONALD re-examined. Q. On this account there is "Self 21l.," and other items - were these sums taken out of any banker's book? A. I think not; I have no doubt this applies to myself in 1830; I think I made them from a private memorandum of my own in 1830; the prisoner never paid me a sum of 21l., or any other sum on any occasion; these figures could not refer to any transaction previous to 1830, as there are collections entered which could not be made till business began - here is on another part of the paper "Hodson 60l." - that might be about the commencement of the works in 1830 - I do not swear that it might not be in 1829; I do not see in my book any ac<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080104"></xptr>count of any other cheque of 21l. - here is one for 21l. 15s. in June, 1830; I am certain he did not return me the money.</p>
               <p>JUNIUS SMITH. I cannot say the prisoner did not pay me the 21l. among other monies at the works.</p>

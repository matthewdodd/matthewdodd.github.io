                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Ware. On Saturday, the 6th of April, I was drinking at the King William public-house—I was not perfectly sober, nor yet drunk—I left about half-past ten o'clock at night, and went to the Ship and Unicorn public-house—I left there a little after eleven o'clock—the prisoner lives in New-court, Gravel-lane—I passed her door, and she was at her door with a young man who had assaulted me in the course of the day—I mentioned it in the prisoner's presence, when I passed, that he had struck me on the breast—I went and asked him what was the reason he struck me on the breast—he said nothing—I was only going to speak to him about hitting me—I do not know what I should have done to him, but the prisoner, who was between us, shoved me—I caught hold of her to save myself from falling, and we both fell down, the prisoner uppermost—she had nothing in her hand at the time—I said nothing to her then, that I know of—I saw the young man give her some<lb></lb>thing bright—I believe I had said I would mark the young man before he went away to sea, that I would scratch his face—it was after that he put something bright into her hand—she struck me on the left side of my forehead, with what she had in her hand—she only struck me one blow—I fell, and recollect nothing more till next morning, when I found myself in the London Hospital—I was there four weeks and three days, attended by a surgeon—I came from the hospital on the 4th, of May, to go before the Magistrate, and returned to it again for three days.</p>

               <p>just inside—Ware was there, and I saw her going to strike the young man over the prisoner's shoulder—the young man did not do any thing then—I saw the prisoner strike Ware with a candlestick on the left forehead—the candlestick was a lightish colour, it looked like tin—Ware fell and got up again, and then they fought—every time she hit Ware she fell on the back of her head—after that she fought her with her fist—there was only one blow with the candlestick—I observed her left forehead bleeding a little, and afterwards it bled a great deal, in the same place—it poured out—it all burst out together, and I took her up—she did not say any thing, she could not speak—Ware did not strike Ashton at all before she was struck with the candlestick—I helped to take Ware home, and Winter helped me—I met a policeman, as we went along—I had not been drinking much—I knew what was going on.</p>

Ashton and Ware were fighting at that time—it was before the scuffle that the door was closed against them, and they tried to get the young man out—I did not notice whether they got into the house—I was looking at the women who were fighting at that time; and there was such a crowd—they were trying to get into the house both before and after Ware was struck with the candlestick, I believe—when I fetched them down there was the young man inside—Ashton stood against the door, and her young man behind her—the two young men made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> to get at him—this made Ashton come out with the candlestick; she said, "I will fight you now, <hi rend="italic">Sally,</hi> fair—come on, <hi rend="italic">Sally,</hi> I will fight you fair"—that was after she had hit her with the candlestick—I did not see them scuffling without the candlestick at first—it was after she hit her with the candlestick—she struck her with the candlestick first—she had the candlestick in her hand when I first came</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Lehmen, a sailor, and live in New-court, New Gravel-lane. On the 6th of April, about twelve o'clock at night, I had just finished supper, when I heard a noise under my win<lb></lb>dow, next door to me, at No. 4, where Ashton lives—I went to the door, and saw the prisoner and the prosecutrix under my window—the prosecu<lb></lb>trix's head was down in a kind of stooping manner—they were both fight<lb></lb>ing—I heard Ashton say a great many times, "Let go of my hair"—they parted after a full minute, and the prosecutrix followed Ashton to her own door again—I heard very ill language from Ware—she said, "Come on"—using language I should not like to express, and put herself in an atti<lb></lb>tude of fighting—they were fighting under my window when I first saw them—Ashton came to her where she stood in an attitude for fighting, and struck her—she fell against my feet at my door on the stones—by the time she got up again, some sailor-man said, "<hi rend="italic">Sal</hi> Heels, what are you about? you are too drunk for fighting"—(that is her mother's name, and the name she always goes by)—I heard Ware say, "Come on, you b—cow"—I believe she was very much in liquor—I saw them standing in a fighting attitude three times—I saw blows pass between them—I did not see the first blow struck—I saw Ware fall and get up again—I saw she had a cut on her head, and suppose it could come from nothing but what I saw on the fastening of my shutter—when she fell on the back of her head, the blood went on my shoe—I am perfectly certain Ashton had no<lb></lb>thing in her hand at the time—I could see by the gas light she had no in<lb></lb>strument, or any thing—Ware said, "I can fight no more, I am too drunk, for my head is cut"—I produce this shutter fastening—I took it from my window next morning—her head came quite in the direction of it, and it was rather clotted with blood when I saw it, when I got up on Sunday morning, I wiped the blood off it, and likewise off my window-ledge—there was also blood on my own door—it was a stand-up fight, as much as they could stand, but she was so much in liquor she could not stand up—I never had any quarrel with Ware.</p>

Ashton lodged with me—on the night of the 6th of April, after I went to bed, I heard a noise—the prisoner called me up to let her in—I did so, and I saw her, a young man, two sailors, and Ware—I heard Ware call the prisoner very improper names, not fit to use, and she tried to get into the house, but I closed the door—the two men that were with her also tried to get in—I shut the door, and held it as long as I could but they bunt it in upon me—I had not time to lock it—the two men did not get into the house—the door was forced open, and I took hold of the prisoner's hands to prevent her going out—the second time the door was broken open, the sailors got in, and one of them knocked me down—the prisoner had no weapon in her hand at all, for I held her hand—I saw a little of the scuffle—I saw Ware fall twice, once on her back, and I saw her fall on the grating of the kennel—the prisoner knocked her down once, and she fell on her back—I did not see the whole of the scuffle—I was in-doors—I cannot say whether Ware was one who tried to force the door—they were all three standing at the door—there was nobody else there at that time.</p>

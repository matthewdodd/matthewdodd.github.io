                  </hi>. I am a baker, and carry on business at No. 8, John-street, Limehouse—I know the prisoner—he was in my service about twelve months ago, as nearly as I can recollect—he was with me a few weeks and worked in the bakehouse—he had the whole range of my premises, and knew them well—on Monday morning, 19th December, I was knocked up about half-past 4 o'clock—I went in my shop—I found the shop door open—the police constables were outside the shop waiting for me to let them in—I missed out of the parlour two coats, a hat, a pincushion, and all the money was taken out of the till, besides some from the parlour—I know this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this pincushion—this coat is mine, and it was safe some few days before—this pincushion was my housekeeper's property—she kept it in her work-box—the work-box was open when I came down and this pin-cushion was gone—I had seen it a few days before the robbery—I had locked my house up on the Saturday night—I had double locked tho front door, put the key in my till, and locked the till and put the key in my pocket—the back part of the house was not locked up—a person could come to my shop from the bakehouse, and the men were working in the bakehouse that morning—the hat that was taken was almost new.</p>

             sworn. - The prisoner brought this order to me for some moist-sugar for Mr. James, Mr. James did not deal regularly with us; I looked at him, and knew him to be the man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120059"></xptr>that had the nutmegs from us; I went over to Mr. Thwaites, and he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. At the time he came with this he made the same sort of story, did not be? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say he was sent by those people? - A. He said, afterwards, that he lived with Mr. James.</p>
               <p>Q. But suppose you had not discovered the fraud, would you have given the property to him unless he had added that he was the servant of Mr. James? - A. No, I do not know that I should; Mr. James having no account at our house made me suspect it the more.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Gentlemen, I am sure I should but insult you and the Court, by saying that there has not been an attempt to commit a fraud in this case; I will content myself with calling the witnesses to the character of the prisoner, and that, I am sure, will be the best way of appealing to the mercy of the Court.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Messrs. Berry and Patmore, in St. Martin's-lane: On the 30th of December, the prisoner came and offered a piece of cloth to pledge, and from her conduct at the time, I suspected she had stolen it; I took her into custody; she would not tell me where she lived, but upon enquiry I found that she belonged to St. George's workhouse, (produces the cloth); she said at first that she was pledging it for a man of the name of Jones, who lived at No. 3, in George-court; I was going to send there, and then she said, no, he did not live there, he lived at Kensington; I asked her where at Kensington, and she then declined answering any thing further; she tried very much to get away, and wanted me to let her go.</p>

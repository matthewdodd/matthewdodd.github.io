I returned with Holmes to the house. I left the prisoner in custody of Holmes, after asking him a few questions; the constable asked him where he took the note, in my presence. He seemed very much agitated, and said he had got it; afterwards, he said he had took it at Smithfield, with others, for a horse and two cows. I asked him where he came from; he said, from Gravesend, and then he said he had received it in change for a one hundred pound note, which he had received in Smithfield for cattle that he had sold. I said I thought he was guilty. I desired Mr. Holmes to stay with him while I went to the Bank. I took the note with me; it was there ascertained to be a bad one. I delivered it to Mr. Rogers.</p>

            . I am a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the witness coming to you requiring you to go to the Equestrian tap-house - A. Yes; on Lord Mayor's day. The Equestrian tap-house is kept by Mrs. Taylor. I saw the prisoner in the tap, and I saw a note which was shewn to me in the tap; I asked the prisoner if he had no smaller notes or change about him; he said, he had not. I asked him to bank the note, and put his address to it; he wanted to know what was the matter with it; I told him we doubted it being a good one. I then asked him where he lived, and who he had got it of; it mattered not, he had get it he said, and as to where he lived it mattered not to me, he lived no where particular he was a travelling man. I told him if he did not give me a more satisfactory account I should keep him in custody, and send over to the Bank to know whether the note was a good note or not. I then said, if Mr. Nicholson would take the note to the Bank I would keep him in custody; I had him in the parlour all the time. He was then very anxious to go after Mr. Nicholson in a coach, he had a great many more notes that he took of the same person, they might be all bad, he had taken them in change of a gentleman. I asked him what sort of a gentleman it was that he had taken them of; he said, a master farmer, a gentleman dealer in Smithfield. At last he told me he lived at Gravesend. I asked him where the gentleman that he took it of lived; he said, he did not know. The prisoner said, he had part of a house with a gentleman at Gravesend. I asked him how he obtained his living; at last he said, he obtained his living by selling liquor on board a ship. I then asked him whether he knew several people that lived at Gravesend; he said, he did not; he had been but three weeks there; he came from Cork to Bristol; that had dealt in cattle in Cork. I asked him if he knew the man he had sold the two cows and the horse to. He said he did not know, but if I would go with him to Smithfield he would shew him to me. Soon after, Mr. Nicholson returned with Foy; he was then searched, and taken to Marlborough-street-office. I saw him searched; he had two five-shilling and sixpenny pieces and a ten pound note upon him. He wanted to pay for the reckoning while Mr. Nicholson was gone for Foy and Glover. He was anxious to pay with the money several times. Foy also found a small key in his waistcoat pocket, apparently a drawer key.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOY. I am an officer. I searched the prisoner; I found upon him two dollars, a six-pence, a ten-pound note, and a key. I learned where his lodgings was; the next day he told me. After I had searched him he was taked to the office, and from there to prison. I asked him the first day where his lodgings was; he would not tell me, and before the magistrate he did not tell. I learned from him the next day, at the house of correction, that his lodging was at St. George's coffee-house, Blackman-street, in the Borough; if I would apply to Mr. Ellworthy, at St. George's coffee-house, in Blackman-street, in the Borough, he would tell me who he was, and that he lodged there. I went there; his lodging was pointed out to us by Mr. Ellworthy; Mr. Ellworthy shewed me the prisoner's room; the door was locked. I told Mr. Ellworthy it was necessary the door should be opened; he broke it open directly. The key that I found upon the prisoner fitted the drawers; the drawers were open, all but the top drawer; that was locked. In the top drawer I found two five-pound notes folded up in a piece of paper, which I marked. These are the two five-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any other notes any where - A. I found thirty-two dozen counterfeit tokens in a drawer along with the notes, and under the carpet I found two parcels of notes, one parcel containing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010039"></xptr>twenty, and the other six, in the same room; they were all counterfeit. I found them in a small brown paper parcels under the carpet. The carpet was laid down, and under the carpet were these notes. These are them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the trunk that is produced - A. Yes, that is the trunk that I found; the ticket at the top is partly torn off, and some of the bits laying at the bottom of the trunk. There were five good one-pound notes I found in the drawer with the two five-pound notes. They were separate from the five. The bad notes were in a paper, and the good ones by themselves.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were some silver in the upper drawer.</p>
               <p>COURT. There were some good silver that they have denied; do you mean to say they have not given it up to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Foy. There was no good silver in the drawer.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do; he with another person took a front room one pair in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they occupy that room - A. I do not rightly know; I suppose nine weeks. That was the room Foy came and searched. I was not at home when he and the woman took the room. I was at home when he lived there some part of the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How did I behave during the time I lived in the house - A. Very well.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive any letter of the prisoner on the 20th of November - A. I believe it was about the 10th, it was the next morning after he was in custody. He desired me to put the letter in the Post; I gave the letter to Mr. Westwood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards receive from him any more letters - A. I think the next letter was the next day. I did not put either of the letters in the Post; I delivered them both to Mr. Westwood.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can you swear that is my writing - A. Yes; you gave me two letters; I saw you direct one of the letters. There was nobody locked up in that room but yourself; nobody could get access to you; nobody could write it but yourself.</p>
               <p>Q. That you cannot tell, for I had been down in the yard - A. I do swear to it; you had never been in the yard when that letter was wrote; you had only been in the yard on your coming in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not write a part of my letters - A. Not of these.</p>

               <p>"My dear, I have to inform you that I was taken up about a bad bill, which I did not know it was so. I think it must be the bill received of the man I sold the horse but if it is not, somebody must have given her this note for small notes; I did not know this. Tell you and the girl to come and see me to day, do not fail. Tell the girl to take all my money out of the top drawer; there are two notes in paper folded up, do not take it to your house or the other, for they will come and see. They took all I had away from me. I did not tell where I lived, for they would take all, but they would give it. I was afraid to tell where I lived in regard of the man of the house. It would be better for me to tell. I am in the House of Correction."</p>

I am a horse dealer; some time back I sold a horse, three weeks ago; the girl was present. I hope you will prove it; I will pay them well for it. I sold a cow; it would be a great deal in my favour. They know what it is; they must come, or it will be of no use. Do all you can in this. I shall talk to you another time. Tell me in your letter whether the girl has taken the rest of the money away; tell them not to keep it at your house or the other. Direct to

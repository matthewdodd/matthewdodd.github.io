                  </hi>. I live at 14, Claverton Street, and am a clerk in the Admiralty—on Tuesday, February 25th, I was standing near the National Bank, at the corner of Northumberland Avenue, opposite the new hotel, at about 7.15 p.m.—there is an open space there, and adjoining that is the National Bank, at the corner of the Avenue, opposite the new hotel—I heard the clattering of wheels coming down Cockspur Street—I was facing that way, and saw a large two-horse van and a one-horse van going down the street at a very rapid pace—the two-horse van was nearest to me—I did not see the deceased, I was watching the vans—the foremost van, the two-horse ran, received a kind of check, and apparently paused for a moment or two on the crossing, and between the two refuges which are in the middle of the road, and in a line with the path—the crossing is from the end of the Strand going down to Whitehall—it is stone pavement; the wood pavement meets it there—the van-driver appeared to attempt to pull up at the crossing—I then heard shouting, and a crowd collected—I went up; I saw the deceased on the ground, and Lovell holding him—the van had gone about 20 yards down the Avenue—I followed it, went up to the driver, and said, "Do you know what you have done?" or something to that effect—he said that the blame was to be attributed to the other van, and that we were to look after that—I do not recollect his exact words—he also told me not to have so much to say—a policeman came up a few moments after—I did not hear what was said between the policeman and the prisoner—it was dusk at the time—the lamps were lit—there was plenty of light—there was con<lb></lb>siderable traffic—the traffic is very dangerous there between 5 and 7 o'clock to the foot-passengers crossing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was a mineral water van—I did not see whether it was loaded with empty boxes—they made considerable noise when they approached, and that attracted my attention—there are two refuges there—this occurred almost exactly between them—the roads might have been slippery, but I did not notice it—I believe I said at the Coroner's inquest, "I should think it was very likely the stones were slippery"—the incline does not appear to be in the direction of the Avenue—there is a heavy incline towards St. Martin's Lane—I think the van was crossing the incline, not in the full force of it—I cannot say whether the second van passed through the Avenue, I lost sight of it as it got almost to Taylor's van near the corner, and saw nothing of it afterwards—it disappeared mysteriously, and we none of us saw any more of it—my impression is that it went down Northumber-land Avenue, but I did not notice which way it went—I do not recollect saying before the Coroner that I believed the driver or drivers trying to pull up prevented me—my recollection is perfectly clear, I believe, as to every word I have ever said on it—I cannot attribute the van not being pulled up to be in consequence of the incline.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The incline is from St. Martin's Lane towards Whitehall, and from Cockspur Street towards Whitehall, so that the vans would be crossing it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am driver of Hansom cab 1561—I was driving my cab on the evening of the 25th February from the Strand towards Whitehall—I saw the deceased on the crossing, in front of the first obelisk, just before he got to the first refuge as you leave the Strand footpath—he was about to step on to the second refuge—I saw a pair-horse van, and a smaller van behind, coming from the direction of Cockspur Street—they were somewhere about the statue on the right, but nearer to me—the pair-horse van was going between seven and eight miles an hour, across the line I was going in, and towards the Avenue from Cockspur Street—it passed in front of me—I pulled up to allow it to pass—when it had passed I saw the deceased about the middle of the crossing between the two refuges—I saw the driver pull at his horses, and the deceased seemed to fall instantly—the van went farther on to the off side of the road down the Avenue—I halloed—the driver then pulled up about 40 yards from the Avenue—he looked back as he was pulling up to see what he had done or where the gentleman was—I saw no other vehicles there at that time—the other van pulled out from behind him, and went on down the Avenue—that was when they were about on the crossing—the driver saw the first van checked, and then pulled out behind him—they were both between the two refuges—I saw no other persons crossing besides the deceased—there was room for the van to pull off to the near side—I drew my cab round on the crossing, when the van went on, and the deceased was placed in it, and I drove him to the Charing Cross Hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner's van made a great noise, a rattling noise—I cannot say whether it was loaded or not—I called out—I did not hear the prisoner call out—I would not swear he did not—I was about 30 yards from the spot where it happened—the deceased did not appear to hesitate—I had not moved until the van knocked him down—I stopped for the vans to pass—they passed me one behind the other, and appeared to go straight on—I did not see the deceased after the van struck him; he went down imme<lb></lb>diately, he appeared to be struck by the pole—the two vans went between the two refuges, one after the other—he had to pull out, and the smaller one went on—the stones were rather slippery at the corner of the Strand—there is a slight incline there, sufficient to put a break on if they had one, but not so steep as the incline from St. Martin's Lane—the deceased walked right across, and did not appear to look either way.</p>

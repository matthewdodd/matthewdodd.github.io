In consequence of having only found one, I surmised, having a variety of drawers, that I had mislaid it; I therefore expected that at my leisure I should find it. I expected then to find it in the country; I went into the country, I could not find it. In consequence of a warrant that was taken out to search for other things, the key of my wine cellar was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that key that was shewn to you by Hancock the officer, one of the keys of your wine cellar. - A. I believe it to be one of the keys; I missed a small pocket almanack and other articles.</p>

            . Q. You are one of the officers belonging to Hatton Gardon office. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with a search warrant and when to Manchester-square. - A. I did, I went to No. 18, North-street, Manchester square; I think it was Thursday the 19th of November. I saw the mother there and a little boy; the prisoner said she was her mother, and this was the prisoner's apartment not the mother's; I told the mother that I had got a search warrant against the place for articles stolen from Mr. Dawson by her daughter; she owned the daughter lived there. I was proceeding to search, I observed the old lady go to a drawer and take out a piece of blue cotton and wrap it in her apron to conceal it; I said stop, old lady, you must not take any thing out there, put that down again; I then proceeded to search, she having put down the blue cotton, it is made into an apron; after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020021"></xptr>that I searched and found several other articles, which I shewed to Mrs. Spittlehouse, who had been a servant to the prosecutor; she identified them to be Mr. Dawson's.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these things. - A. A breakfast cloth, and a kind of a towel, she held it up to the light and shewed where the marks had been picked out, WD: Mrs. Spittlehouse discerned it; after that I found some more cotton, which Mr. and Mrs. Dawson believed to be their property, and some pieces of Vandyke bordering furniture; there was some of it worked up in chair covers, which I could not bring away; this is the key I found on the second search, the prisoner was present; I told the prisoner it was the key I had seen before.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen that key upon the first search. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take it then, you went back with the prisoner to for that key. - A. Yes; she then offered me the key of a street door; I said not that, it was a bright key I had seen, and I must find it; then she threw herself into a fit. In the mean time Mrs. Spittlehouse said here is the key upon the drawers, and that was the key; I afterwards tried the key to the wine cellar door of Mr. Dawson's, it answered directly and corresponded to the one he has in his possession. (The key produced.)</p>
               <p>Hancock. When I went to the place where I brought her from, York-street, I found these articles where she then was in service. At the time that I took her to the house of correction I should have told you there was a young woman accompanied me down to the house; as soon as I put the prisoner there, the young woman told me some things which led me to go into York-street where she was at service. On my searching Mr. Lucas, he had all her things down in the back parlour; I brought these things away; another apron made out of the same sort of stuff as the other. I found a piece of cotton made into an a apron, and another piece of cotton. In consequence of what I learned at York place, I went to the old lodgings of the prisoner in North-street, there I made another search; the old lady turned her back upon me, I saw her conceal something in her bosom; I searched her bosom and found a duplicate of a broach and a smelling bottle, pledged at Mulcaster's. I went to Mulcastert and saw the articles.</p>
               <p>Q.What did the prisoner say with respect to these articles when they were produced. - A. She denied the bottle belonging to Mr. Dawson; and the broach I think she said she found it; the cotton and the other articles she owned she took.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The lady and Mrs. Spittlehouse said if I did own to it she would forgive me.</p>
               <p>Court to Hancock. Did you hear any body say to her it would be better for her to confess. - A. I heard Mrs. Dawson say she told her it would be better for her to speak the truth; Mrs. Dawson told me so; it was not in my presence.</p>

During the time I lived there, the prisoner was house maid for three weeks; she was in the town house and I was in the country; this blue cotton was found on our first searching her, which was the time she confessed to taking them; I knew it was the exact pattern of Mrs. Dawson's furniture; that is all I know. The prisoner said to me she hoped I would speak to Mrs. Dawson that she would be merciful to her; I told her if she had really taken the broach she had better confess it. I know the table cloth to be Mr. Dawsons, having a number of stains on it. The prisoner told me it was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she admit that it was Mr. Dawson's property. - A.Yes, when she and I were alone.</p>

            . I live in Church-street, Soho. I came from the office after being examined, and was going to the house of correction, the prisoner asked me whether I was a prisoner, I informed her I was not; she asked me whether I would go to her mother's and get a watch and duplicate in a bonnet box; I was to take these things, and if she got free she would give me five pounds for my trouble; she made me promise not to tell Hancock the officer, but to give him the slip as soon as she was in the house of correction, for fear Hancock should be at her mother's before me; I informed Mr. Hancock of it, and went with him to her mother's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My mother did not know where I was; I asked her which way she lived, she told me; I said for God's sake go to my mother, and bring me some things to the place, some victuals, and some money, I would reward her for them. The smelling bottle I found, and the broach likewise, going through Cranbourn-alley; the table cloth I took in a mistake to wash along with my own gown, I forgot to bring it back again; one of the bits of cotton was in my drawer in the bed room, I took it home with my things; as for the key it was my poor husbands, it was never in Mr. Dawson's house before it was carried there by the constable.</p>

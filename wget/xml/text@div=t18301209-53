            . I am Mr. Radnor's shop-boy. The prisoner is the person who pawned this cloak on the 4th of November - master took it in; I never saw the prisoner before, but am sure it was him; I saw him again before the Mayor of Windsor, and am certain of him - I was hanging some things at the door when he came in; it was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning - he stayed in the shop about ten minutes; I was hanging up things all the time - I saw master take the cloak in, as I went behind the counter for something to hang up while he was there - I saw him take the cloak out of his bundle, in which he had got a black coat and a shirt; he offered the shirt, but master would not take it in as it was dirty - he put the cloak on the counter; master looked at it and lent him 6s. - he doubled it up, and put it under the counter; I afterwards took it from there, and put it back after it was booked - I took it up stairs next morning; it was still folded up - I should know it again.</p>
               <p>GEORGE RADNOR re-examined. The cloak was pawned in the morning, but I cannot say at what time I took it in; Cale was there at the time; I do not recollect what he was doing, nor what the prisoner had the cloak in - it was put under the counter, then booked, put there again, and taken up stairs next day; this is the cloak.</p>

               <p>GEORGE MILLER. This is the cloak that was in my possession - Edward Gooden left it in our house under my care about a week before; I know it by having seen it a good many times, and seeing him wear it - I am certain of it.</p>

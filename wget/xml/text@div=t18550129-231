                  </hi>. I am a cooper by trade, and live in Shorter's rents, Whitechapel. On the night of the last day of the year, I was going up Keate's court, Whitechapel, about half-past 8 o'clock; it is near Spital<lb></lb>fields-church, about five minutes' walk from where I live—I had met a young woman from Limerick, who I have known for the last five years, and I went with her to her place—she lived in that court—I went through the court, and went up stairs with her—I then left her—she stopped up stairs, and I went down and stood at the door waiting for her to come down—it was her own place, but I expect it was a bad place—I went three steps from the door, and saw these three gentlemen (<hi rend="italic">the three prisoners</hi>) in the passage of a house opposite—I knew them before by sight; Rogers for the last two years, Bedborough for ten or eleven months, and Merritt for about three years—there is one gas lamp in the court—I was as sober as I am now—the prisoners sprang from the opposite door as I came from the doorway—Rogers caught me by the neck on one side, and Merritt caught me by the neck on the other side—I did very well with those two <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi>, but Bedborough sprang on the back of my neck, put his two knees in my back, and pulled me down on the flat of my back in the court, and pulled the buttons right off my waistcoat—I called out "Murder!" and "Robbery!"—they took my watch from me before they knocked me down; when the third fellow sprang on my back—it was Rogers that took my watch—it</p>

               <p>was a silver one, engine turned, capped and jewelled; it had a silver chain to it, and a gold key—I am sure I had my watch safe when I came down stairs—I had hold of it in my hand as I came down stairs—the chain was in my hand, and the watch in my pocket—I had hold of it to keep it clear of these men—I cannot say whether the chain was broken; it was not a guard chain, only a chain about eight inches long—it was not fastened; it went in between my buttons—the watch, chain, and key were attached together—when I called out "Murder!" they ran away as fast as they could through the court—I went straight to Leman-street station—the young woman did not come down stairs before I was knocked down—I saw the prisoners, Rogers and Merritt, in custody at half-past 1 o'clock that same morning—I am certain they are two of the men—I saw Bedborough, I think it was at half-past 5 o'clock in the morning, with the officer—he was in bed—I am certain he is the other man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 76). I received information from the prosecutor on 31st December, about five minutes before 10 o'clock at night, at the station, in consequence of which I apprehended the prisoners—I first took Rogers about a quarter past 12 o'clock; he was walking down Keate-street alone, within about 100 yards of the court where this happened—I do not know where he lives—he asked me what I took him for; I said on suspicion of stealing a watch—he" said he knew nothing about it—I took Merritt about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I went to the house where he lived with his mother, and when I came out of the house I met him—he asked what it was for; I said on suspicion of stealing a watch—he said, "It was not me"—the prosecutor had given me a description of the men—I took Bedborough about an hour and a half afterwards; he was at home in bed, at No. 1, Keate-street—I told him what it was for; he said he knew nothing about it; he was not there—I remember the prosecutor coming to the station when Rogers and Merritt were there; that was about a quarter past 1 o'clock—they were shown to him—there were several other parties at the station—I told him to go in and see if he could identify any of those as the men who had robbed him of his watch, and he first picked out Rogers and then Merritt—he picked them out from others—there were three others—they were three civilians—I do not know whether they were prisoners; there were charges against them at the time—the prisoners were not standing by themselves; they were all standing together, with their faces towards the door—I told the prosecutor to go in and see if any of those were the men that had robbed him of his watch—he went in, and immediately he got inside the door he said, "That is the one that seized me first," pointing to Rogers, and "That is the one that seized me second," pointing to Merritt—Rogers said he must be a bad one to want to <hi rend="italic">lag</hi> them for that, and Merritt said he must be a bad man to lock them up for it—the prosecutor went with me to Bedborough—I told Bedborough to dress himself—he said, "What for?"—I said on suspicion of a watch—he said, "What, for that <hi rend="italic">souper</hi> up the court?"—I understood <hi rend="italic">souper</hi> to mean a watch; it is a slang phrase for a watch—I then called the prosecutor up stairs to see if he was the man, and directly he entered the</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">At this period of the case, Joseph Mate, one of the Jury, was taken ill; Mr. F. J. Dent, a surgeon, having attended the gentleman, deposed upon oath that he was suffering from premonitory symptoms of delirium tremens, and was unable to resume his duty. The Jury were then discharged from giving any verdict. Joseph Surr was substituted as a Juror instead of Mr. Mate, the whole Jury were re-sworn, and the prisoners again given in charge. The evidence already given was then read over to the witnesses, who stated that it was correct. Mr. Payne held the depositions for the Court, and Mr. Clarkson appeared for the prisoners upon the second occasion.</hi>)</p>

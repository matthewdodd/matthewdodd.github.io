                  </hi>. On 27th Jan., I went with Wardle, the officer, to No. 3, Boss-court, Thames-street—a bed-room door there was opened by a key which Wardle had taken from the prisoner—we there found this album, scrap book, and other goods (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this album is in an un<lb></lb>finished state—it is altogether unfinished out of our hands—it has been torn out of its cover since it left our premises—there is no gold work round here, and this part was not glued down—a book would not be sold in such a state—the prisoner had no right to have it at his premises—this scrap book is not bound; it has no cover to it—it is what we term sewn and cut—it is not in a state to be sold; it is unfinished—the prisoner had no right to have it—here is "Rock's Illustrations of London"—that is com<lb></lb>plete—the prisoner had no right to have it—here is a piece of silver paper, which is used in the factory for the lining of books—that is never sold—here are about 100 illustrations of what we call "The Tourist's Companion"—they are sold six in a cover, in different sets—they are illustrations of all parts of England—we sell them at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each number, 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece—here is a pair of shears and a pair of compasses—I know these—I missed them some months ago—we were in the habit of missing our tools without making inquiry about it—I know these shears by their having been fresh ground, shortly before they were stolen—I missed them about four months ago, a day or two after they were fresh ground—we never properly traced them from the grinder's—I made inquiry of the grinder—I had him</p>

               <p>at the station house as No. 14, Griffin-street, York-road, Lambeth—I found that he did not live there, but from information I received there, I went to Boss-court, and got into his room with a key which I found on him—I found all these things produced in a sideboard or cupboard—I went back, and asked him why he had given me a wrong address, upon which he asked me if I had found his address—I said, "Yes"—he asked me what I had found—I told him I had found a pistol in his room—he said that it was his own—he said that the prints were waste, and he ought to have cut them up, but he took them home; that the shears a fellow workman had lost some time before, and he found them and took them home, and the compasses also—he gave no explanation of any of the other things.</p>

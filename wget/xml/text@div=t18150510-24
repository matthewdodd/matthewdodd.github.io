On the 3rd of April, last I gave him two ounces of gold to beat, and on the 4th, he came in and did a little to it, and then went away, he did not come again that day, nor all the week; I was surprised at his not coming. On Sunday evening I went to his house with a peace officer, we knocked at the door, his wife said he was in bed, we went into the house, we did not find him; last Sunday morning, we went to his house, again, we went down the street, we saw him standing in the street, I said to the officer that is the man, we took him into custody, we tied his hands and took him to the watchhouse, and the next day to Marlborough-street, the prisoner said he had lost the gold, he had taken the gold to do it at home.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the gold - A. I think about eleven pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop part of your dwelling-house - A. It is; I gave it him in the next room to the shop, in my house.</p>
               <p>REDFORD BURKER. I am an apprentice to Mr. Redford I am master give the prisoner that gold to work two ounces, three penny weights, on the 3rd of April, he had been working about twelve months before that. He worked that gold out process, is master's shop where he was always accustomed to what he parted it into so many weights, I see him do that I see him heat it on the 4th of April in the morning he went away. On Sunday master sent to know why he had not been at work, I went to his house, I told him, master wanted to know the reason why he had not been at work, he said, he took some gold home, and that he had lost it; that was the reason he had not been to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had any licence to work at home, you don't know perhaps - A. I do know that none of master's men work at their own home, they all work in master's shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took the gold out of the shop, and put it in my pocket; I went out of the place in a hurry, and I happened to meet with two persons, shopmates, we got drinking such a quantity of liquor, that I was insensible, so that the next morning I played truant, having found I had lost Mr. Redford's gold; I know no more of the gold than Mr. Redford does.</p>

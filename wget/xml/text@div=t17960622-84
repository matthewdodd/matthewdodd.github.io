               <p>Q. How soon after this did you receive a letter from the prisoner? - A. About six months after, the first of June, by the penny-post.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter; is that the letter you received? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner's hand-writing? - A. Yes; I believe it is his writing; I have not a doubt of it. (The letter read).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. It is about two years since we first entered into partnership; the agreement was not a written agreement; I said, we had better have an attorney; he said, that would be an expence; I said, if he was willing to take my word I would take his, as he was a professor of religion; he kept the books, I did not know how things went on; he went out of town for a week and locked up the books, I was obliged to have the place broke open; and when he came home he slew at me, and I said, I was determined to part with him; and in the night, as we were in bed together, he attempted this soul crime upon me.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. When was this? - A. I cannot say; it may be six months from this time, or nine months; it is impossible for me to tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was so late as September or October? - A. I cannot form an idea.</p>

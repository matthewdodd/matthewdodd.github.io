                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Williams, of No. 8, Friendly-place, next door but one to the prosecutor's. On the 30th of Dec., a little before one o'clock, I was in my parlour, about two yards from the window, and saw the prisoner Dipper—he came and looked over the blind into my room—I had a good view of him—I went to the street door directly to look after him, and saw him turn round two houses beyond, to a piece of waste ground, and the boy and Forster walked on a few steps, and stood, talking together, twenty or thirty yards from the prosecutor's house—I went to the door again in a few minutes, and saw the three loitering about the street—the youth was playing with something, and they were looking about, as if waiting for somebody—I was in the parlour a little after one o'clock, and saw the two prisoners go by—Dipper had a box—they came in a direc<lb></lb>tion from Johnson's house, and returned the same way—I saw the two pri<lb></lb>soners, but did not go to see if the boy was there—the box was a lightish yellow wood, and had a handkerchief partly over it—he was in the act of covering it—it was the colour of the box produced—I have no doubt of the two prisoners—I noticed them particularly, and their neck-handkerchiefs were exactly alike, blue with white spots, and the boy had a handkerchief of the same colour.</p>

I went with him, and desired him to stay at the door. I went in; there lay the things by the prisoner. I said to him, Pray, who authorized you to take these things away? He said, Mr. Jackson knows very well what I have done. I said, If he approves of what you have done, I shall not trouble myself about it. My young man went for Mr. Jackson. I said, You have taken away the key of the room. He took the key out of his pocket and gave it me. I sent the key home for Mr. Jackson to look into his room; he came, and said, his box was broke, and every thing was swept out of it. He opened the bundle, and knew them to be his property.

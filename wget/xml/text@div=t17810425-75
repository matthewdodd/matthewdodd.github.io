               <p>The prisoner, Gearing, lived with me six months; he behaved so well that I placed great confidence in him: Mrs. Pritchard complained of missing a great number of things to a great amount; I suspecting the prisoner, he was sent for to the justice's by the justice's advice; when he was brought there, he was beginning to make a confession; having some regard for him, I was not willing to take his life; I stopped him from going on with the confession; he only confessed pawning a shirt, a tablecloth, and a neckcloth. I took him home, and promised him, if he would tell the truth, I would be as favourable as I could; I would spare his life. Several articles I had lost were found at different pawnbrokers.</p>

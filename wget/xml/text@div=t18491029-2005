                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Clark, of 55, Long-acre. On 29th Aug., about six o'cloek, the prisoner came and offered me a ring in pledge, very similar to the one produced—I cannot say whether she asked 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I asked if it was gold—she said it was—I told her I had seen her before, and also a ring of that description, and one had been taken at our house very similar to it—I said it was brought by a man—I can undertake to swear they were manufactured by the same person—this is the one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I told her I should take it to a refiner—he notched it, and applied the test, and I came back and told her if she offered it at any other shop she would be committing a fraud—I showed her the notch, and applied other tests, which I showed her—she became violent, and said I was not obliged to take it without I liked—she insisted on having it back, and at last I gave it her—she then left the shop, and I gave directions to Saxby.</p>

                  </hi>. I am also in Mr. Clark's service. On 29th Aug. I received instructions from Simons; in consequence of which, I followed the prisoner into a public-house in Mercer-street—she waited there twenty minutes or half an hour; she then came out, and went towards Leicester-square,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184910290152"></xptr>
               <p>where she was joined by a man, and they went into King William-street, walked about there half an hour, then turned into St. Martin's-lane, and the prisoner went into a pawnbroker's shop—the man waited on the oppo<lb></lb>site side—I went into the front shop, and told a young man there that there was a <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi> in one of the boxes—the prisoner could not see me—I saw her pass a ring along the counter similar to these—she was asked if it was gold—she said, "Yes"—the man filed and tried it with the test, and gave it her back—I did not hear him say anything about it—she could not see him file or try it—she then took the ring, left the shop, walked up St. Martin's-lane, and was joined by the man—they then went into Broad-street, Bloomsbury—the prisoner went into Mrs. Wood's shop, and the man waited at the corner of the street—I went into the shop, and made a communication to the shop-man—I saw a ring offered to the shopman—he asked if it was gold; she said it was—he tried it with a file and the acid—I think she might have seen him do that—he then gave it her back—I did not hear him say anything—when she got outside, she joined the man, and they went to a pawnbroker's at the corner of Wells-street—the prisoner went in, and the man waited on the opposite side—I went into the shop, and made a communication—the prisoner tendered the ring in the same way—the shopman tried it, gave it her back, and told her she was a <hi rend="italic">duffer</hi>, and if she came there any more he would give her into custody—she said, "Why don't you do it now?"—she then left the shop—I did not then see the man—the prisoner then went into the boxes at Mr. Webb's—I went in, and saw a ring offered there; it was the same ring as far as I could judge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Dobree and Tomlinson, pawnbrokers, in the Strand. On.31st Aug. the prisoner came and offered this ring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked her if it was gold—she said, "Yes"—I asked her what she wanted—she said, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I lent her 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she gave her name," Jane Russell, 7, Edgware-road"—I have examined the ring with the one produced by Vincent, and they precisely correspond—I should say they were made by the same person.</p>

Yes, I do, he went by the name of Old Bob; he lived on the back of Black-friars church; I sold him the 6 gold rings and 3 silver table spoons, he gave me 35 s. for them; I think he gave us 6 d.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030052"></xptr> more, but am not certain, out of which I spent 1 s. he gets his bread by buying stolen goods; Griffiths and Emery went with me; I have seen him many a time at the Globe on Saffron-hill, buying stolen handkerchiefs; when he was taken up he popped a handkerchief into my hand, which he was going to buy of a young fellow. The prisoner's wife keeps a little chandler's shop; I sold the things in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him how you came by them?</p>

               <p>Emery. The prisoner gave me a bottle to fetch half a pint of rum, this discourse might be then, for I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear of five guineas being offered for the taking of the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Carrol. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you upon the trial of Murphy to mention nothing of Griffiths.</p>
               <p>Carrol. The prisoner went by the name of Old Bob, and I mentioned Old Bob.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to mention Griffiths and Emery being with you?</p>
               <p>Carrol. Because I was not asked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to Emery to come now?</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The spoons were worth about 32 s. 6 d. as to the gold rings, some of them weighed 28 or 29 shillings, they were very large old fashioned rings; I found one gold ring on the prisoner's wife's finger, which I believe to be one of the six.</p>

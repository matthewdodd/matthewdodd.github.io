My husband and I left the house, about half-past nine o'clock on the evening of the 16th of August - we have only one room - Mr. Jackson is the landlord - he does not live in the house - I locked it, and gave the key to my husband- I was absent about half an hour - on my return I found the room door broken open, a chest-of-drawers open, and things scattered about - I missed my husband's clothes, and the other articles stated in the indictment - I and my husband went towards Bartholomew Fair about the 3rd of September, and met the prisoner with one of my gowns on in Chiswell-street - she looked at my husband, and he looked at her, and called my attention to her gown - we followed her - he let go of my arm - I went up and told her I had lost some things, and she had got on one of the gowns I had lost - I asked her where she got it from, as I had lost some more things - she said she bought it in Rosemary-lane - she did not know the person she bought it of - I told her the body was lined with white - she said it might be - I told her the skirt was lined with dark green - she said it was slate colour - I wanted to look to convince myself, but she refused - I asked her how long she had had it - she said six weeks or two months - I told her I had not lost it so long as that - she said she had had it two months, if not longer, and it could not be mine, and said she would call on me the next day, or I should call on her - that she lived in the City-road - she said she could not give me any more satisfaction - she told me where she lived in the City-road, and gave me the number, but I do not recollect it - I told her my husband was just by, and I wished him to speak to her - she had a young woman with her - they were whispering - while I was looking for my husband they walked away - I lost them - my husband came up to me - I told him she had got on my gown - he had seen which way they went, and went after them - they looked back, and saw him coming towards them, and stopped - he asked her where she got the gown - she told him she got it in Rosemary-lane, and did not know the person she bought it of - he said he was not satisfied, and led her till he came to a policeman, and gave her in charge at Bunhill-row station-house - the inspector asked her where she lived - she refused at first to tell - she said she lived at Hoxton - they told her they must know where she lived, and the gown must be taken off her - then she said she lived in Old Nicholl-street - the gown was taken off her, and kept in the station-house - after the robbery I found a phosphorus box in my drawer, which was not there before - I know this is my gown - it is lined with three different colours - it is an old gown made up - there is a cut on the left shoulder, and a piece let in between the lining and the silk, it being a damaged silk dyed - the body was lined with white, and the skirt with dark green - I am sure this is the gown - I have not seen any other part of the property- the value of all the property I should think is about 10l. when new, and about 5l. 10s. when stolen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The prisoner told you that she lived in the City-road, and at the station-house she said Hoxton? A. Yes. I do not know Plummer-street, nor Old Nicholl-street - the door of my apartment appeared to be burst open with violence - the drawers did not appear opened with violence - the other locks appeared to have been forced open with violence - I did not find any mark of any instrument on them - the house was broken on the 16th of August - I have not said it was on the 5th - it was not quite three weeks when I saw the prisoner - my husband's waistcoat was a buff one, and kerseymere - I believe he had had it for four years, but never wore it hardly - he had been to sea - he gave 10s. for it when it was new - he had the coat about the same time, and gave 5l. for that and the trowsers - he has been in London two years, but he did not wear the waistcoat a great deal - he wore it on Sundays in the summer - he used to wear the coat and trowsers on Sunday - there are three other lodgers in the house, men and women, and there were so at the time in question - they are all there now - the prisoner did not say she had had the gown three or four weeks - I never saw her before September - I was about ten minutes' walk from my house, when I saw her - I never saw her in my neighbourhood - she said she had worn the gown in Finsbury-square - I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160040"></xptr>been in Rosemary-lane once - I have seen people standing there selling old clothes - the officer could not exactly find the number of the house she gave them - I think it was on the 3rd of September that I met her.</p>

             (police-serjeant G 49). I was in Bunhill-row - the prosecutor and his wife gave the prisoner into my charge on the 3rd of September - I asked her where she got the gown from - she said she bought it in Rosemary-lane - I asked, "Of whom?" - she said, she did not know who the person was - I took her to the station-house, and afterwards received the gown, which was taken from her by a female who searched her - I asked when she bought it - she said, "About six weeks ago" - she told me she lived in Nicholl-street, in Spitalfields, and in Whitecross-street - she stated that at different times; the first time, she said, "Old Nicholl-street;" and at the station-house, she said, "In Spitalfields" - I did not go to either of the places, as she mentioned no number.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Nicholl-street? A. I believe there is a Nicholl-street in Hoxton Old Town- it is a long way from the turnpike in City-road - I know Plummer-street, in the City-road - that is away from Nicholl-street - I was not directed there - the inspector was present when she gave me the different addresses - she told him Nicholl-street; the other two addresses, she gave me in the presence of other persons, but not in their hearing, as there was a bustle in the station-house at the time - I never expressed my anger towards her at all - I never said I had got her in my power - I knew her before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say in any body's hearing, that now you had her in your power you would give her a lift, if possible? A. On my oath I did not - Jews, and such persons, sell things in the street in Rosemary-lane - I never went to the prosecutor's house - the prisoner is a woman of the town - I did not know where she lived - I had not seen her in the neighbourhood of Chiswell-street, near Shoreditch - I believe she has always said she bought the gown in Rosemary-lane.</p>

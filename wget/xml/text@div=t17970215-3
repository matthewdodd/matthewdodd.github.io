               <p>Q. Did you fasten the outer door of the house? - A. The girl, in Court, locked the street door, and bolted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the property mentioned in the indictment in the bar? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. In what manner were the half-pence wrapped up? - A. In two or three parcels, in five shilling papers, wrapped up; the others were loose in the bag; one parcel was in a paper that I received from Messrs. Osborne and Priddle, of Snow-hill.</p>

               <p>Q. You got up between seven and eight o'clock, was it then light? - A. No, it was not light; our house is very dark; I came down stairs, and one of the lodgers was just going out as I came down stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. In what condition did you find the bar? - A. Before I came down stairs, he knocked to be let in again; in going to let him in, I found the bar door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the bar? - A. I felt immediately that the lock was torn off the bar door, and part of the wood-work with it; I was very much alarmed; I sat down, and called to the girl to strike me a light; as soon as I got a light, I found the bar in very great disorder; I found the bottles were taken down off the shelf, and the basons and every thing was in very great confusion; I opened the drawer, and missed the waistcoat; at the same time I missed the bag with the halfpence; they took away a pint measure of halfpence, but I did not miss it at that time; I had other lodgers in the house; I desired Cassrey to go up and see if they were all up.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of violence on the outside of the house? - A. there was a piece slipped off the door of the cellar window, and part of the slap was trod upon in getting down into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. That cellar door is not opened, I suppose, in the usual course of the business? - A. It is never opened but when we take in beer.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it opened before? - A. The 23d<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150012"></xptr>of November, to let the buts down; it is never opened upon any other occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it been opened to your knowledge between the 23d of November and this time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After it had been opened for the purpose of admitting beer, in what manner was it usually fastened? - A. Bolted.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to the fact, whether any time before this night the door was bolted? - A. I saw it bolted the 23d of November.</p>

               <p>Q. Has any body else a part in the business of the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated to the Court, that the bag contained a good many bad halfpence; how many bad halfpence might there be? - A. I lost about thirty shillings in bad money.</p>
               <p>Q. How many good ones were there? - A. Thirty or forty shillings, or more; they were in the pint measure.</p>
               <p>Q. There were not above three or four or five shillings good? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Supposing a person had broke open the cellar-door, and got into the cellar, how would they get into the tap-room? - A. The cellar opens to the stairs; there was nothing to hinder them.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the door upright, or flat upon the ground? - A. The door is upright, but there is a slap on the ground to let the butts down.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing any person got into the cellar, how could they get to the bar? - A. There is a pair of stairs comes up opposite the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. The stairs are in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the stairs that lead down to this cellar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If once they got into the cellar, there was an easy communication to the bar-door? - A. No, to the house; the bar-door was locked; this is a common stair-case to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When they got in by this cellar-door, there was a communication to every part of the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing else in the house broke open, but that which you describe? - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you aware of any other mode by which a person could get into your house that night, but by this cellar-door; - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of this door has been slipped off? - A. Only a small piece, as if some means had been used to force it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the bolt, on the inside of the door? - A. On the inside of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, the part that was broke; do you apprehend, by that part that was broke, any body could get at the bolt? - A. I think they could; the bolt appeared to be slipped back, I did not perceive any injury that had been done to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think any person could have got at the bolt by the piece that was slipped away? - A. I don't suppose they could.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose the bolt had been opened within? - A. No; I suppose it was open on the outside, by something that forced it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you thing any instrument could be used to put back the bolt? - A. I think there was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. In this lady's house there is a privy, that goes by the bolt, every body that uses the house has a communication with the privy; any of the lodgers might put back the bolt.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you come back alone? - A. I came back alone, and Wigg came round to meet me; he said he was waiting there for somebody being up at the Green-dragon, to have something to drink; I asked him what he was; he said he was a printer, and worked over the way; I said, you do not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a watchman of St. Dunstan's: On the night this happened, about a quarter before three in the morning, Lowndes, the patrol, passed me in Fleet-street, I told him all was well; he passed the passage, and then came to my box, and told me there were two fellows, and ordered me to go round by Silver-street; I went round, and met him at Lombard-street, there was only one then, Meritt.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the other name Silver-street has? - A. Bouverie-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You only observed one, and that was Meritt? - A. Yes; he was speaking to Lowndes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they? - A. In Fleet-street, the top of Lombard-street; Lowndes chastized him, and asked him what business he had there, and told him he had seen him there some time; he told him he was waiting for the Green-dragon opening, that he might have some refreshment; the patrol told him, he had seen him lurking about there, and he would take him to the watch-house; by that means, he and I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man you took, to the watch-house? - A. Yes, I am certain of it, he went by the name of Thomas Bond; I saw him examined, and then I went to my beat.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next thing that happened? - A. I went to the watch-house, and saw the patrol coming out of the watch-house with Meritt in his custody; I was informed, by Sullivan, that he was about the passage; when we were coming down I met Pitt, one of our patrols, I went down to Sullivan to have him come up, to see if he knew the prisoner; as we and Pitt came into Lombard-street, we heard the alarm of stop thief; Pitt ran first, he was the first man; I ran after him, and Sullivan after me, we ran into Bouverie-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were you pursuing there? - A. We did not know, we thought it was Meritt we were pursuing, but it turned out to be Brown; the prisoner at the bar coming out of Siver-street, Pitt saw Brown and struck at him, but there being a good deal of ice on the ground, Pitt sell, he called to us, and we ran after him, and caught him in a place, I believe they call, George-alley, in the ruins that leads into Water-lane; when I saw him first of all, he was raising himself from a binn, where they throw dust in; before we got to him, he laid his arms on the binn, and his head on his left arm, till we came up to him, and raised him up from the binn; we raised him from the binn, and Sullivan knew him very well, and said, is it you, John, and then we took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you were present when any thing was found in the binn? - A. I was not, I saw him searched in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Denham, the watch-house keeper, present when he was searched? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found upon him? - A. There was a waistcoat found in his great coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect who took the waistcoat out of his pocket? - A. No; Denham and Pitt searched him, one of them took it out.</p>

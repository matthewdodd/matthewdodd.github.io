               <p>On the 2d of March I was in a post-chaise coming to town, with a Mr. and Mrs. Hirst; I was asleep when the chaise stopt.</p>
               <p>What was the first thing you perceived? - I felt a man's hand on my thigh, he said he wanted my money; I said he should have it presently, I had three guineas in my pocket, and some silver, and I was not disposed to part with my gold; I was some time separating my silver from my gold; one man, the opposite side called out, damn me, why don't you rob that gentleman? the man immediately said, make haste, or I will fire; I had not given him any thing then, I told him he might fire and be damned, and gave him six shillings and sixpence; afterwards they went off.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was rather a light night, and the road was particularly light.</p>
               <p>Could you see either of the persons, so as to recollect and know them again? - I will not say positively.</p>

               <p>Did you see him so as to know him again? - I think I should, it was rather duskish at the time; the man that robbed me had a brown great coat on.</p>
               <p>Look round at the prisoners, if you think either of them was the person? - I believe the person in the blue coat (Jennings) was the person that robbed me; I will not be positive.</p>

               <p>On the 2d of March, near the hour of nine in the evening, I was going to Acton, together with three others, two on one side of the road, and two on the other; we met the two prisoners coming from Acton towards us; I was going to Acton, I let the prisoner Wood pass by the left hand side of the road; Jennings jumped from the footpath into the middle of the road, where he run backward, when I had an opportunity to see he had a pistol in his hand; (the pistol produced) he ran then on the right side of the road on the foot-path, he ran on, and I after him for some considerable way; he turns about with the pistol in his right hand, presented the pistol to me,

               <p>It was not then, as Mr. Hirst says, duskish; you can see perfectly well, perhaps better, in the dark than in the light? - It was rather light.</p>
               <p>You just now said it was perfectly light to discern a man's features? - It was in the month of March, near nine o'clock.</p>

               <p>I am a patrol with Creedland; on the 2d of March as we were going backwards and forwards, I saw Wood between Acton and Shepherd's-bush.</p>
               <p>Did he run away? - He did not, because he was seized; I brought him to a public-house and searched him; I found on him half a guinea, two half crown pieces, four shillings, and three six-pences (the money produced); I found this powder in his pocket (produced); I saw him throwing away the pistol.</p>
               <p>Did you find the pistol again? - I sent two men and they found it in the very spot where I apprehended him, in a field on the onside of the road, that is on the left side of the road going from here to Acton.</p>
               <p>Court to Creedland. On which side of the road was the other pistol thrown over? - On the right-hand side.</p>

               <p>Was there any of the money such as you could know again? - There was one of the six-pences I think I could recollect.</p>
               <p>Do you think you can positively say? - Money is such a thing one cannot scarcely swear to; I verily believe it was the money I had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect any thing of the half guinea? - It is one of the late coin, one that looks pale.</p>
               <p>Was there any silver you could know? - One of the six-pences had a notch in it.</p>

               <p>Was there on any of the six-pences any marks? - Not to swear positively to.</p>
               <p>Can you describe the marks on the sixpence with the notch, such as they were; was there any thing else beside a notch; was it a thick one or a thin one; was it a remarkable thin one? - I cannot take on myself to say.</p>
               <p>Have you observed any other marks besides that notch? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether it was round or not? - I do not think it was quite round.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, look at that six-pence. and tell me how far you can speak to it? - This is, I believe, the very six-pence I had fourteen days in my pocket.</p>

            . I live in Cow-lane, the two prisoners at the bar brought this horse and mare to me to sell; I no sooner bid them 6 pounds for them, but they agreed to take it; they being worth much more, I thought proper to stop them, and made inquiry which way they came by them; they went to get vouchers, but brought none, at last they told me they had stole them from their mistress, and likewise where she liv'd; so I and the constable sent her a letter, and she came up and swore to the horse and mare as her property.</p>

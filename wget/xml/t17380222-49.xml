               <p>A Witness. On the 28th of Jan. I was waiting at Table, the Prisoner knock'd at the Door, I went to the Door, but my Fellow Servant coming up at the same Time, he asked her for a Basket of Dust for the Paviours. There were no Paviours at Work in the Street, but however, we let him go down in the Kitchen, and I return'd into the Parlour. Immediately afterwards, I had Occasion to go down into the Kitchen, and met him coming up the Stairs; he ran out and slapp'd the Door after him. He was no sooner gone, but my Fellow-Servant observing the Print of Spoon in the Sauce, which was in a Dish I had carry'd from Table just before, she asked me if I had brought down a Spoon in that Dish? I told her I had. Then he has certainly got it, says she I ran out into the Street, and enquired for the Prisoner, and the Men who were dressing the Lamps in the Street took him; I swear to the Prisoner</p>

When the Prisoner knock'd at the Door, I stepp'd into the Area, and saw him with Sack, under his Arm, he asked for some Dust for the Paviours. I thought to let him have a little Dust, and directed him where to find it, - I went before him and bid him follow me; as I was going to shew him the Place, I heard something hit against the Dish that stood on the Table; to the Dust, he said it would not do for him, because there were bits of Paper in it, clean enough for him, and to went up Stairs again and would not take it.</p>

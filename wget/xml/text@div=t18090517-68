               <p>Q. Did you lose a bear skin any time in April last - A. I did; from the door; it hung partly in and partly out, as a sign; it was worth about a guinea and a half. I saw it about seven o'clock in the evening on the 26th of April; it was safe then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it taken away - A. No; I heard of it a few days afterwards; the prisoner was in custody then.</p>

            . I am one of the officers of Hatton-garden office. In the afternoon of the 27th of April, about five o'clock, I was standing in Cow-cross-street, near Smithfield, at a grocer's door; I saw the prisoner going past;

             was passing on the opposite side; the prisoner had this old bag hanging across his back, it appeared to be nearly full; I said to my brother officer look out. I stopped the prisoner just before he got in the bars of the city; he was going towards Smithfield, I touched the bag that he had on his back with a cane; I said halloa, Tom; what have you got here, dust; he said yes, master; I knew him. My brother officer hit the sack underneath, it sounded hard; I said you had better take him in the house here, and it turned out to be a bear skin. He stood a little bit amazed as if he did not know what to say; at last he said he found it under the wall of the New church, in the Strand, about ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where he was going to take it - A. No; not till after he was committed; he then said that he happened to see me stand, or else he should have taken it to the sign of the Blue Post, near where I stood, to one Wilcox, who was to give him two guineas and a half for it. Wilcox was a publican, and this was the son of the publican, who kept another house in West-street.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EKELSOE. Q. You are a brother officer with Trott - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any more of this business than he has told us - A. No. The account that he has given is the account that I would give upon my oath.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Westminster near about ten o'clock on Monday evening. I had occasion to ease myself at the New church in the Strand, there I found it, I took it home and cleaned it. Trott asked me what I had, I said a bear skin, and some bones; he said shoot it out; I shot it out. and went with him; I said I was going to take it to Rag-fair, or somewhere thereabout, to get vend for it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Trott. Did this man tell you it was a bear skin - A. No; he told me it was dust.</p>

On the 15th of November, the two prisoners came into my shop to look at some silk handkerchiefs, I shewed them a number, they did not approve of any. I took them away, and brought a drawer full, the handkerchiefs were covered over, I set it on the counter before them, and left it covered over, then stepped about ten yards to a door, to call my young man, a number of other customers coming in just at that time. When I came back, the man prisoner had taken the paper off the the drawer, and was looking at them, the woman stood by him, and appeared to be putting something into her pocket. I still opened the handkerchiefs for them to look at, to endeavour to sell them one, and while I was doing this,

They bought nothing, turned to go out, I prevented them, and pushed them into the back room. I told them they had got a handkerchief of mine; after a great deal of altercation, the woman prisoner threw the handkerchief down, and said,</p>

I saw Thomas Cohen take the paper off, and take the handkerchief out of the drawer. He looked about him, and gave it to the woman that stood at his left hand, and she put it under her coat. I told Mr. Wilson of it.</p>

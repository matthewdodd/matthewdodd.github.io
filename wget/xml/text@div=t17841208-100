             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner came to me, and desired I would go and receive her wages of a Lady whose name was Appleton, in Fitzroy-street; her mistress was very much offended at the demand, and charged me on my life to tell her she had robbed her; she called this woman a thief, I told Mrs. Appleton, you have much the appearance of a gentlewoman, I beg you will adjust this matter, for the woman declares she never robbed you, or any body else; I said for my own satisfaction, and the many obligations the prisoner at the bar has been under to me, I should have been very happy for her family's sake. Mrs. Appleton said, if ever she dared go nigh any of her friends, she would prosecute her; I said Madam, do not be so cruel; this is the gentlewoman that is the prosecutrix now, I had this order to demand the wages of Mrs. Appleton; will you be so obliging Madam to let me look at your face (to the prosecutrix) I am not afraid to shew my face before all the world; that is the very Lady, Sir, who went by the name of Appleton; and she further said, that if this woman had any demands, that her master should hang her; which of the masters I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you went to that Lady who bore the name of Appleton, and you demanded wages, and she said if she troubled her for wages, her master should hang her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Council for the Prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Who are you? - A woman Sir.</p>
               <p>You look more like a man than a woman, what are you? - I am a wife, I have lived in Printing-House-yard, Black-friars, eight years, I never was before a Court, nor my name in question before.</p>
               <p>Did you know the hand-writing of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at that, and see if that is her hand writing? - There is her hand writing on the note.</p>
               <p>Put on your spectacles? - I have none Sir, but if you please to lend me a pair, I can tell you; my husband was a jeweller by trade, I now follow the stay-making business, and employ a great many hands (looks at it) I cannot pretend to say, I have a vast many notes, I have seen her writing.</p>

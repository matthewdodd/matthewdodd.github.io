             had not been at home all night, and that my scrutore in my dining-room, was broke open. Upon which I came home, there I found it broke and the flap of it down, a tin chest, with the things mentioned in the indictment in it was lying on the stairs, and all the things gone, a hammer and chissel of my own, were one lying near the tin box, the other on the flap of the bureau. The prisoner at the bar was my labourer to grind colours, look after my horse, and go on errands, &amp;c. When I understood Grigby was absconded, I inquired after the prisoner, and was informed they were at an alehouse at skittles on the 12th, the best part of the day. The prisoner not coming as usual, I sent and found he was gone from his lodgings, and had taken what things he had along with him, I went to Goldsmith's-Hall and sent bills amongst the trade, and advertised in the papers ; and by virtue of the advertisement, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040023"></xptr> worthy gentleman of Bridgwater in Somersetshire, got the prisoner apprehended; and in order to do justice to my country, I have brought him here. Some time after the robbery one Mr. Slayter who keeps an alehouse at Baguali's-Marsh, came to my house with one of the papers I had printed; saying two such persons which I described, had changed the two guinea piece with him. It was a very remarkable one, I had it many years, I could know it from ten thousand, there is a flaw in it that goes from one side to the other. He brought it, I gave him 2 guineas for it. I had a ring stopped at Smithfield bars brought by a woman, but they were not so lucky as to stop the woman. My apprentice has not been heard of since he left the prisoner.</p>

             rung the stable bell, I went and let him in and went down stairs again. Just as I got down stairs again the prisoner knocked at the fore-door. He brought the key of the shop, and begged a bit of soap to wash his hands. He went up stairs, and cross the passage, and opened the door. We heard it shut but we did not see him go out. Just after that Grigby called down the kitchen stairs and said, Master will be at home to night or in the morning. After we had done washing, we wondered the apprentice did not come home as usual. We went up stairs and there saw a small tin chest wide open, with a hammer lying by it. We had never seen the chest before. We went into master's room and into the dining-room, to see if every thing was fast in the dining-room. We saw the flap of the escritore down and a chizel lying upon it. We went and desired a watchman, to go for Mr. Edmonds master's foreman. He came with the watchman. We searched the house. My fellow servant and I are very well assured nobody had been in the house, but Grigby and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Jonnathan Slayter. I live at Bagnall's marsh, or what is called Black-mary's-hole, about a furlong from the prosecutor's. I keep a publick-house. On the 12th of August in the evening, came in a man and a boy near the close of the evening. There came with them an acquaintance of mine. I cannot pretend to swear to either the man or the boy. They asked for a shillings-worth of Liquor, it was either rum or brandy and water. I think after that they had another. After that my man brought a 2 guinea piece to change. My wife did not know what it was. He is shew'd it. [The prosecutor deposed to it as his property, and be likewise.] The lad said he should be lock'd out, so they both lay at my house. After the advertizing these things I wait, and carried this 2 guinea piece to the prosecutor.</p>

The next morning as I was coming from Hatton-Garden, I met them both together, the lad had a bundle on his back. The prisoner something in his apron.

Then he said he did not care for beer, and if I would go with him he would give me a treat, and knowing this man, we went along with him. The Evidence said if I would go into the country he would go with me. There Grigby pulled out that piece of gold and laid it upon the board. I took it up, I might throw it in order for change I am not positive. He said he had it of his sister, the next day I was fearful<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175112040024"></xptr> of being arrested for money I owed I did not tell my master I was going away then, but I had about a fortnight before, one time when he paid me.</p>

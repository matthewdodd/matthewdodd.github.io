                  </hi>. I live at Bridgewater-gardens. On the morning of the 15th of July I came out of the Coach and Horses with two friends—the pri<lb></lb>soner and another man were outside—we stood there talking for several minutes—the prisoner and the other began insulting us, by making a noise with their mouths, and turning to ridicule everything we had said—I turned round, and asked if their insults were meant for us—they said, "Just what you like"—I said, "What do you mean?"—they said, "Just what you please"—I remonstrated with them, and said I was old enough to be their father—they said, "Here we are, two young ones"—I said, "Is it fighting you mean?"—I put myself in an attitude of defence, and in about two minutes afterwards I received a wound in my hand from the prisoner, from a sharp instrument—it bled dreadfully—I caught hold of him—a policeman came up, and I gave him in charge—I have a doctor's certificate from Gray's Inn-lane Hospital—my fingers were both dreadfully cut</p>

                  </hi>. I heard the prosecutor ask the prisoner what they made the noise about—they said, "Nothing particular"—they were making noises after some females—the prosecutor said, two young men like them ought to know better than to interrupt people in the street, especially females—the prisoner said, "I was not aware you had any female in your company"—Hare said, "Is that intended for us?"—the prisoner said, "Just as you please, if it suits you take it to yourselves"—he then asked him several questions, and then asked if he meant fighting—they said, "Just as you please"—Haie said, "I will take no advantage of you, as I am old enough to be the father of either of you"—I said, "you had better come about your business,</p>

               <p>and have nothing to do with them; they are young men, they will be olderby-and-by, and will know better"—the prisoner said, "Though you may thinks very young, perhaps we are older than you are in one way"—I said, "lawhat way?"—he said, "We know too much for you"—Hare said, "Well, ifit is fighting you mean, I will fight the pair of you"—he put himself in an attitude to fight, one removed to the left, and the prisoner said, "I will knifeyou"—I saw at that moment his hand cross his breast, as if to take a knife from his waistcoat pocket, and as be lifted up his hand, he seemed to be opening a knife—the prosecutor directly said, "My hand is cut."</p>

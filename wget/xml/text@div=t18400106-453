                  </hi>I live in Cambridge-street, Westminster, and am agent to Mr. Robert Plant—he is the owner of the house No. 228, Piccadilly. There was a confusion about taking some part of the premises off the hands of Mr. Hunt—I was over the house about two months ago, and missed some marble chimney-pieces from the room where they bad been, but they were not removed from the premises—they had been in the front and back rooms on the first floor, which rooms were in the possession of Mr. Hunt, who kept billiard-tables there, and I found the marble in the back room on the third floor, where it had been stowed away—when fixed they were worth six or seven guineas—I afterwards saw a part of them in the possession of a man named Prestage, in Husband-street, I think, on the 4th of December—in order to increase the confusion going on at the house in Piccadilly, a great many people attended there to buy greens and turnips—the ground-floor is partly occupied by Mr. Newson, and the persons who went up had to pass through his shop.</p>

                  </hi>I was living about a month ago with my father, at No. 228, Piccadilly—I have seen the prisoner at the house frequently—I was there the first day he came—he said Mr. Hunt had let him the place for a shilling a week—he came alone the first time, and alter that he brought a lot of blackguards with him, apple-women and sweeps—they all went up stairs—one day the prisoner came with two men, the men took away some marble in a hand-barrow, and the prisoner staid behind—when they came the prisoner went up stairs with them—I followed them part of the way up—I heard them knocking to get some blocks loose, but they could not undo them—they were up stairs about an hour—after Mr. Cross and the other man were gone with the marble, the prisoner staid up stairs—Mr. Scott came, went up stairs, and then the prisoner disap<lb></lb>peared.</p>

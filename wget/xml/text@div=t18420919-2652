About a quarter before five o'clock, on the morning of the 10th of September, I heard a noise at the shop door—I got up directly, and saw the prisoner poking a long hook through the fan-light, and getting two shawls through—he had forced open the glass, which I had fastened by a string on the previous night—the shawls were some distance inside the shop—he had got up to the fan-light by means of the elbow of the blind and the handle of the door—he drew the shawls out through the fan<lb></lb>light—there was a light inside, but it was just getting daylight, and it could not be distinguished.. o</p>

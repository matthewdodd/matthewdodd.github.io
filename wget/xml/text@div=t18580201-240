                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 422). On 22d Dec. last, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in the Mile End Road; it was the day after Christmas-day, what is called <hi rend="italic">Boxing</hi>-day—while I was in the Mile End Road I saw the prisoner Callagher; I saw him assault a man named M'Carthy—he struck him with his fist in the face and head—I saw McCarthy bleeding very much from the eyes, nose, and month—I took Callagher into custody for that assault on M'Carthy—this was in the Mile End Road—Callagher was rescued from me by some of the persons who were there, who are not in custody—I pursued him into Leslie Street, and there took him again; he resisted very much, and endeavoured to throw me on my back, and kicked me with his feet—the deceased Henry Morgan, a police constable, came up to my assistance at that time, in Leslie Street—he laid hold of Callagher on the right side, and I on the left—we then succeeded in taking him towards the station, as far as Jubilee Street—there was a large crowd following us as that time, I should say at least 100 persons—they did not interfere with us at all in Leslie Street, but when we got into Jubilee Street, the mob attempted to rescue Callagher; they endeavoured to pull him away from our custody—a very violent struggle took place between Callagher, myself, and Morgan; Callagher said he would not go to the station—there are some railings at the bottom of Leslie Street, which inter<lb></lb>cepted his progress—I overtook him there; he laid hold of those railings—thatwas before we got him from Leslie Street into Jubilee Street—it was in Jubilee Street that he said, "I will not go to the station"—at that time both Morgan and I had our staves out—we had our uniforms on; I had on my great coat, with my number on my collar—our staves were drawn in Leslie Street—while we were struggling in Jubilee Street, the prisoner Murphy came up—we were assailed by the mob with stones; I mean, they threw stones at us—Murphy laid hold of Callagher, and attempted to pull him away from us—after a very violent struggle we succeeded in getting him a little further towards the station, through Jubilee Street—then another</p>

               <p>struggle took place between Callagher, myself, and Morgan; Callagher again became very violent; another shower of stones was hurled at us by the mob, several of which hit us in the head and face—Morgan's hat was cut through by the stones—Callagher then said that he would not go any further, no two b----policemen should take him to the station house (this was in Jubilee Street)—he then struck Morgan with his fist, and hit him twice in the left eye, two following blows; they were very severe blows; the second blow caused Morgan to stagger—in consequence of that blow he let go of Callagher, and he said to me, "Mate, that is almost a <hi rend="italic">settler</hi>"—he said that to me in the presence of the prisoners—Murphy then laid hold of Callagher, and pulled him away, endeavouring to get him away from myself and Morgan—Morganhad let go of him after receiving the second blow in the eye, but took hold of him again directly—Murphy laid hold of Morgan's staff, and pulled him round in this position (sideways); he was standing with his back towards him at the time—Callagher dealt him several very heavy blows with his fist at the back of his head and neck—at that time Morgan's hat was off, I believe—I do not remember whether Morgan, after that, used his staff upon Callagher; I do not recollect—other constables then came up—after, Morgan was struck on the back of the head by Callagher, he received a blow at the back of the head from a stone, which cut through his hat—his hat had been put on again; at least, he had his hat on at that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know who threw that stone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not—it was thrown by one of the surrounding mob, I did not see where it came from, the stones came in showers—the road had been newly paved with broken granite.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see whether that second blow reached his head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it left an impression on his head, it was very slightly cut, it bled a little, it was more a bruise than a cut—I do not know whether the first stone that struck the back of his head produced any effect.</p>

I saw the commencement of this affray; it was close to my house—I did not see M'Carthy assaulted by Callagher—I saw some of the affray previous to that—at the time that occurred they had moved away a little distance—when I came up the second time, Callagher had stopped at the bottom of Leslie Street, and was holding on to the railings to prevent his being taken on—he was at that time in the custody of Pillars and Morgan—hewent with them from Leslie Street into Jubilee Street—at that time time there was a great crowd surrounding them; I should think 100 persons at least—I followed and kept close to the constables—when they got into Jubilee Street I heard Callagher say that he would go no further, and he attacked both Pillars and Morgan with his fists successively; first Pillars, and afterwards Morgan; he struck them with his fists—I saw him strike Pillars several times; but Morgan only one blow, from which he staggered—that was a blow on the left side of the face or head—it was a severe direct blow with the fist, and it caused him to stagger back a pace or two, and let go his hold—Callagher immediately attacked Pillars again with his fists—Morgan came back to his assistance; he struck Callagher a severe blow on the top of the head with his staff—there were loose stones in Jubilee Street—the road had been mended some little distance further up—</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in High Street, Stepney, and am surgeon to that divison of the police. I had known the deceased for three or four years—Iwas called to see him on Thursday, 31st Dec., at his house, No.9, Wat<lb></lb>ney Street, Commercial Road—I found him lying in bed in a partial state of insensibility—I asked him what he complained of—I roused him with some little difficulty; he wag in a state of stupor; he muttered, rather than spoke, that he had pain in his head, and he kept putting his hand to the left side of his head, and to the back of his head—I was not at that time aware that any violence had been done to him—I looked at the pupils of his eyes, one was contracted, and the other dilated, that indicated pressure on the brain—I con<lb></lb>sidered him in a dangerous state—I attended him twice daily, until he died, which was on the Saturday following, 2d Jan.; he never rallied—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the 4th—I found a black mark over the left eye—Iexamined carefully all the outer portion of the scalp, and found no other marks of violence, except the blackness over the eye—I then opened the head, and examined to see if there were any bruised marks, but there were none; there were no marks of violence there—I examined the dura mater, the vessels of which were very much congested—I found an escape of about two teaspoons full of black blood from the back part of the head—I did not see any lesion of any vessel from which that blood had escaped—I then exa<lb></lb>mined the arachnoid, or second membrane of the brain; I found it inflamed and vascular, with deposits of pus, or matter, on the surface of the mem<lb></lb>brane—Ishould think those deposits must have been made within a few days, or, perhaps, a few hours of his death—I consider they were sufficient to account for death—I believe the effusion of blood came from the vessels of the pia mater—that also was sufficient to cause death—the substance of the brain was healthy, but I found fluid in the lateral ventricles; that was not material, it would result from the inflammation of the membranes—I should say that the inflammation was recent—I opened the chest and examined the heart; it was somewhat flabby, and there were considerable adhesions of the pericardium to the heart—I consider they were of some standing, they were firm; I am not aware that those adhesions would indicate anything particular; I should say they would not account at all for the state of the head, the man having been perfectly healthy up to the time of the accident; the state of the heart was in no way due to the adhesions, they may have existed from birth; it is impossible for any one to say—I think that very severe blows on the head would tend to produce congestion of the vessels of the brain, and inflammation of the membranes of the brain, such as I found—I think that blows which left no external mark might cause the appearances I found; it is quite possible that the effusion at the back of the head might have arisen from the rupture of a small vessel at the time the blow was given, although</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185802010030"></xptr>
               <p>that blow might leave no mark; a small vessel might have been ruptured, and a slow effusion taken place, without preventing the deceased from doing his duty; that might be so until the blood had sufficiently accumulated to cause pressure on the brain, and cause death—the state of insensibility in which I first saw him, was quite consistent with that process going on; it was consistent with any pressure on the brain—I had known him for three or four years; he has called at my surgery on various occasions, and to the best of my recollection it was for pains in the head and for indigestion; he had medicine—that was three or four years ago; I had not seen him for the last three years, he made no further application to me; it would be my duty to see him, as surgeon to that part of the force—I gave him some medicine on that occasion, and from that time until his death I did not attend him professionally once—I believe his age was twenty-five or twenty-six, he was a very fine, tall, robust man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing you had heard nothing at all about this affray, but had been merely called in to make the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, were not the appear<lb></lb>ances you found consistent with natural causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should consider that the inflammation of the arachnoid membrane, with the deposit of pus, were consistent with natural causes, and I should also consider that the effusion of blood at the back of the brain, in an older subject, would be consistent with natural causes; but in a man so young, I believe it very rarely indeed, if ever, occurs—I must certainly say, that it might have arisen from natural causes—excitement would probably produce congestion of the membranes of the brain in some cases; and, consequent upon that, you might even get the rupture of the smaller vessels, and the effusion of blood that I saw; still that does not alter my opinion of the case—finding these appearances, if I had not been aware of any cause, I should have been led to make inquiries whether he had received blows on the head—if I had merely been called in to make the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, I certainly must have concluded that he had died from natural causes, but they were most extraordinary natural causes; I must have considered that there had been no violence, if it was not proved.</p>

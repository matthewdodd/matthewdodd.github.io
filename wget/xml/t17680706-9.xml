On the 20th of June the prisoner came to me, and desired I would recommend him to somebody to go to the West-Indies; I desired him to wait on me on the morrow, and I would go with him to Lloyd's Coffee-house; he came; I recommended him; I had two gentlemen in the house; I ordered my boy to go and draw me a mug of beer in a quart mug, it was put on the table; I told the prisoner he was welcome to take a draught of it; I went to the door, and when I returned I missed my mug and the prisoner; he was found and brought back, and the mug with him; I imagine this might be his first fact, I had a very good character of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Etherington. I was in the prosecutor's house when the alarm was given of the mug being lost; we went out, some one way and some another; I met him in Milk-alley with the mug in his pocket; he said he was going to drink a pint with an acquaintance, and then intended to come back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he walking or running?</p>
               <p>Etherington. He was walking; when I mentioned the mug, he said he had it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cou rt to prosecutor. Do you know there has been prosecutions for drawing in silver?</p>
               <p>Duffey. I know it; I do not use it for my customers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I went out to drink with an acquaintance, and intended to come and bring the mug back again; my acquaintance is Mr. Bromley.</p>
               <p>Q. to Etherington. Was he going towards Mr. Bromley's?</p>
               <p>Etherington. He was.</p>
               <p>He called two witnesses, one had known him four years, the other seven, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector N</hi>). On Thursday morning, 7th May, I was on duty at the Hackney station, when the prisoner was placed in the dock—I said to him "You have been arrested for wilfully and maliciously murdering Margaret Ball, at 13, Homer Road"—he said "Yes, that is right"—I said "You will be further charged with stealing a pair of gold ear-rings from her person—he replied "No, I did not steal them, she gave them to me just before"—I then entered the charge, and read it over to him—he said "I have nothing more to say, what I have to say I will say before the Magistrate"—on the day before this from information I received, I went to 13, Homer Road, and in the front parlour there I saw the dead body of the deceased—I examined her face, neck, and breast, and found no marks of violence, except an indentation round the neck, apparently caused by something being tied tightly round—I examined her hands, but I found no indication, of any struggle having taken place; they were perfectly clear—her dress was in no way disturbed or disordered—the furniture in the parlour appeared in its usual way, as would be expected, nothing disturbed—there were no signs of any struggle there—on the first floor landing between the door leading into the front bedroom and the banisters, there was a washstand, which was within a' few inches of the banisters, where the rope had been fixed, and had not been, disturbed; there was an accumulation of dust round the legs of it, and also on the top of the landing, near the banisters, which must have been moved, or swept off, or disturbed if there had been any struggle on that spot—the constable had taken down the cord at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was such a collection of dust on the landing that if there had been any struggle, or the woman's dress had passed over it, it must have been disturbed—in my opinion it was physically impossible that she could have bean thrown over the banisters without her weight breaking</p>

               <p>the cord or the banister rail giving way—a woman of the deceased's build by standing either on the fourth or fifth stair, could, with ease, have tied the rope to the rail above herself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It would not have been necessary for her to walk down two or three stairs to get the rope tight; by pushing off the fourth and fifth step it would ease her into the rope, and so strangle her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, I was called to 13, Homer Road, about 430 o'clook, on this day—Harris, the constable, was there at that time—I saw the body lying in the entrance passage at the bot<lb></lb>tom of the stairs, between the staircase and the door—the rope had been removed from the body and also from the banisters, the body was warm—I could only judge from my previous experience how long she had been dead, I could not say within half an hour; it is possible she may have been dead half an hour, or an hour—heat will remain in some bodies longer than in others—I should say she could not have been dead more than an hour—the dress was slightly disfigured about the neck, it opened in front, and two three, or it might be four hooks were open; that might have been the way in which it was worn, there was no sign of either of the hooks having been forced, or of the dress having been torn; there was no indication of any violence having been used to open it—there was a bruise round the neck, such as might have arisen from pressure by hanging—I saw nothing more on that examination; afterwards when the clothes were removed, I saw some marks—the bruise on the neck from the compression of the rope would not be produced upon a body hanged when insensible, where there is pressure on the windpipe of that nature insensibility will take place instanta<lb></lb>neously—when a man is hanged a bruise may he produced by the pressure of the rope—as long as animal heat exists in the body, I believe a bruise can be produced—in this case animal heat existed for half an hour, and possibly an hour—I believe during that time, a bruise might be produced-upon making a post mortem examination on the 7th, I found three bruises on the left side just over the hip joint, two were very indistinet, one was very distinct in<lb></lb>deed, and seemed of recent date, I should say within twenty-four hours; the others might have been caused a week before—the recent one was the worst, they were in row horizontal, or oblique rather, that mark may have been produced either by pressure or a blow—there, were some marks on the inner part of the thigh and leg which might have been ercohy-mosis, or they might have been some old standing disease of the skin—I think that was all that I noticed externally—I then made an internal exa<lb></lb>mination I opened the head—I found the brain healthy—there was about half an ounce of fluid between the bone and the membranes of the brain—the membranes were gorged with blood—that would probably be caused by pressure on the two vessels at the side of the neck, in fact from hanging—they are indications of strangulation—the lungs were healthy, but gorged with blood, that is another indication of strangulation—the stomach showed that some very unsubstantial food had been taken, within a few hours, it was only an indication of partially digested biscuit or something of that sort—the left verticle of the heart, the muscular portion was hyper<lb></lb>trified, there was thickening of the walls; I mean by that, diseased—the liver was fairly healthy—the uterus contained a foetus of about seven months—the other organs were, healthy—some severe pressure had. Been put upon the windpipe, causing some of the rings to he partially broken through—the woman unquestionably died from strangulation, and my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187406080080"></xptr>
               <p>opinion is that it was from continued pressure, not instantaneously as by a jerk from the footing being removed, but as if done by a bowstring—I should say there was no doubt that the injury to the windpipe was from the pressure of the rope—I did not measure the height of the body at the time, I did afterwards, but I can only give my opinion about it, because bodies lying after death will sometimes elongate—I should say when living she was about 5 feet 4 inches, or something of that sort, and her weight about 10 stone, that is allowing for her pregnancy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 12, Portland Place, Clapton—I was called in to see the body of the deceased on 6th May—I found the mark of a cord, applied in such a direction that it came round the front part of the neck and obliquely up behind the ear, the back part of the neck was free from any mark, the whole of the front and sides of the neck was marked by the cord, but it was not absolutely circularly round the neck—there were no other marks of violence whatever; the general aspect of the countenance was compatible with that of a person who had been hanged—that was the only thing I noticed—I was not at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—I can, therefore, only speak from the external appearances—the cause of death was suffocation from hanging—I think there is a distinction to be drawn, not between suffocation and strangulation, but between stran<lb></lb>gulation and hanging; if a person wants to kill another by suffocation that would be strangulation, but there was no mark of that—I think she died by hanging and not by strangulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I observed no marks or abrasions to denote a struggle—in my opinion the symptoms were perfectly consistent with her having hanged herself, and I think they were incompatible with anyone else having done it against her will—I think there would have been evidence of struggle and of far more violence—I saw the prisoner and I saw the build of the woman—in the event of any struggle I think she would have been a match for the prisoner; she was a muscularly-developed woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I used the term, "against her will," I, of course, assumed that she was able to exercise her will—I do not think the appear<lb></lb>ances were consistent with her being rendered insensible suddenly by pressure of the rope round the neck—that is just the point I was insisting upon, had the rope been tightly tied round the neck it would not have been in an oblique direction, but horizontal—I formed my opinion upon the mark of the bruise round the neck—I do not mean to say that insensibility may not be produced by sudden pressure on the wind-pipe without leaving a mark—I say that strangulation could not, in my opinion, have been exercised, otherwise the marks would have been different.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. Suffocation is a general term; I should" call it death from deprivation of oxygen—strangulation is that form in which, by a constricting band passing round the throat horizontally, a person is deprived of oxygen, like a person strangled by a bow string—in both cases they are deprived of oxygen, but there are hundreds of cases of suffocation to one of strangulation—one form of strangulation is by a ligature like a bow string, another is by hanging, which is not by a ligature horizontally round the neck but obliquely, and another is by throttling—those are all distinct things my opinion is entirely dependent upon the mark round the neck.</p>

The height from the place where the rope was attached to the bottom passage is 8 feet 7 3/4—the height from where anyone could fasten that rope to the stair on which they would stand would be about 6 feet.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>) I stood on the fourth step to try whether I could tie the rope where it was found—I did that the morning after the occurrence, and I tied my own handkerchief round the bottom of the particular banister that has been brought here—I believe I am 5 feet 7, the deceased was 5 feet 3 or 4—I twisted my hands round the banisters so as to give it a good tug, I had to reach forward a little to put it round.</p>

               <p>SIMON DAVILL ROBINSON. On the 28th of February about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was near the <placeName id="t18280410-108-crimeloc594">Brunswick Theatre</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long had you been in the crowd? A. Perhaps three minutes - there was a rush made upon me; Paget was as close to me as possible; I could not get rid of him - I had my purse safe when I was in the Minories about ten minutes before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WEST. Q. Were there not a great many people pushing? A. Yes; but no one had hold of my arm but you; I do not know whether you were pushed by others - but I was grasped round my body with considerable violence; I did not see a fire engine coming along.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was near the Theatre about five o'clock, and saw Paget, with five or six others, make a rush on the prosecutor - Paget then came out, and went into the Horn and Horse-shoe, public-house; he called for a glass of porter, which he drank - I took hold of him, and said I wanted him: he took something out from his pocket and threw it behind him - a gentleman took it up; I asked him for it; he would not give it me, but gave it to the landlord - I asked the landlord for it; he counted the money out of this purse and gave it me - I got Paget in the room with some difficulty; he swore he would not be handcuffed; I left him in charge while I went to look for the man who took up the purse, but I had my eye on him - it was not more than half a yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was the settle under which the purse was thrown? A. Close by me; it was a person named Robinson who took it; I have been for him, but he is not there - I do not think he is a very good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WEST. Q. Did you see me at the time Paget went into the house? A. Certainly, but he did not go into the house - he was close to the door; I saw him in the crowd with this stick - he was close to Mr. Robinson.</p>

            . I saw the two prisoners near the Brunswick Theatre, close to the prosecutor - I saw both Paget's hands round him; I said to Judge, "He has got it. follow him" - he went to the public-house, and drank the beer, and there he was taken; I saw him throw something down, hut could not see what it was - it was taken up by a man who has absconded; I saw him give it to the landlord, and he gave to Judge; West was close to Paget in the mob.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you could not see what was thrown away? A. No; the prosecutor was not a dozen yards from the place; there was not a fire-engine coming by - there was a rush among the people - not among all the people.</p>
               <p>Prisoner WEST. Q. How long have you known me? A. A long time - I never knew you charged with theft, but you have been in trouble about cups and balls.</p>

A labourer; I have been for ten months working at a pastry-cook's, in Cannon-street - I was along with Carter at the Theatre; I was going to get a situation; I was about to tell Carter and Judge of it - I am quite sure I saw Paget's right-hand come from Robinson's coat pocket, and just afterwards I saw the purse in his hand; I am quite sure it was not his breeches pocket - I saw the purse before the Magistrate, but I knew before that it was a red silk purse.(Purse produced and sworn to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by Her Majesty's Mint—on 15th October, in the forenoon, I went with Inspector Fife and some other officers to Commercial-street, Spitalfields, and placed myself in a position to watch the White Hart public-house—I saw the prisoners enter the house one after another (I knew Gray and Abbott before)—I followed them in with Fife, and found Gray sitting down, and the other two standing in front of him—as I entered, Watson's and Abbott's faces were towards Gray, whose back was towards me—I proceeded towards Gray, but was pushed back by Watson—Fife then laid hold of Watson, who threw these two paper parcels on to the seat, between Gray and the wall, who sat about a foot from the wall—I then saw three packets go from the woman's cloak to the same spot—Fife pushed the two away, and I pulled Gray away, and found five packets near the seat, and a calico bag containing five packets of shillings—I put my hand into Gray's trousers pocket, and asked him what he had got—he pulled out a paper parcel, and said, "You will see"—it contained twenty counterfeit crowns—he pulled another packet out of his coat pocket, and placed it on the table—I opened it, and found three small packets, each containing ten half-crowns, and four others containing ten florins each, making forty—I found a counterfeit shilling in his trousers pocket—the five packets that I took from the seat each contained ten bad shillings, and the five packets in the bag each contained ten bad shillings—the coins were all wrapped up in the usual way, with tissue paper between them to prevent their rubbing—I cannot identify the two packets that Watson threw, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186310260013"></xptr>
               <p>the five packets contain shillings corresponding in date with some of those found in the bag—when I asked Abbott for her address at the station, Gray said, "If she was my wife, I should refuse," and then she refused.</p>

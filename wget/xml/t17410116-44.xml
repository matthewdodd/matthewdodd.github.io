             . On the 19th of December my Wife having Occasion to go out, pull'd off her Watch; and hung it on the Sconce , and the next Day going to look for it it was gone. I advertis'd it the Monday following, and had Information of the Chain from a Pawnbroker, to whom it was offer'd by the Prisoner's Mother. I had the Prisoner taken up on Suspicion of stealing it, and he in Excuse said he found it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Has he taken Care of his Servants? He took me up on Suspicion of being Confederate with his Servants.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Goodman . On the Monday Morning before Christmas Day, the Prisoner's Mother brought me this Chain, and desired me to tell her whether it was Gold or Metal. I saw there had been something torn from it, and ask'd her how she came by it? I likewise told her I should detain it 'till I had seen the Person of whom she had it In a little while the Prisoner and another Man came and he said he had found it, but I was resolved to keep it till I knew farther; I examined the News-Paper and found such a Chain advertised, and the Prisoner coming to me again at Night, he was secured, and he said he found it in the Street by Queen-Hithe .</p>
               <p>Mr. Jenkins , I saw the Watch hanging on the Sconce, the 19th of Dec. just before it was lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is a Month next Monday since I found this Chain. I happen'd to come out into the Street, and saw the Chain on the Ground almost covered with Snow; I put it into my Pocket, and my Mother carried it to this Woman, to see what it was, and she stopp'd it.</p>

I knew them all before - I have often seen them in company; I followed them up Holborn, and lost sight of them; I then went down to the Vine public-house, in Laystall-street - stood there, and saw them all three come out of the Vine; they began to lark together, shoving each other about - I kept out of their sight - they went down by Mr. Burge's, the nightman's house. I saw them come up, and cross over to Henry-street, Gray's-inn-lane - they all three walked up and down by the prosecutor's door. Smith then went in - I cannot say how he got in, as I was at the corner of the street - it is a private house - I saw him stand at the door a short time, and then go in; the other two walked up and down by the door - he came out in about five minutes, then they all three went in, and remained there about ten minutes -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182704050029"></xptr>Ford came out first, with a lot of things in his white apron- the others came out directly after him - Wicks had some things in his apron - Smith had nothing; they came running up the street by me, as hard as they could. I let them pass, pretending not to notice them - then went over to the house, knocked at the door, and asked the prosecutor's wife if she had lost any thing; she said she did not know - I came away, and ran down Falconer's-alley, Cow-cross, having seen Smith go into a house there once, and just as I got to the corner of the alley, the three prisoners came up the alley; they then had the things in two bags, but still had their aprons on. Ford and Wicks each had a bag - I saw them go into a house in the alley with the things, and shut the door. I ran to Hatton-garden, and fetched Limbrick, and another officer, to Falconer's-alley - they went into the house; I stood at the window, and saw them sorting all the things out upon the bed, and the woman of the house with them.</p>

            . This house in Henry-street is mine, and is in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn - I did not come home till late on this evening - I had seen all this property secure, laying on the table, about ten o'clock in the morning - when I returned it was gone; I found it at Hatton garden the next morning - it consists of the articles stated in the indictment - here they are - they are worth 3l. 9s., the very lowest - the Irish cost me 2l. 2s. 8d. I know nothing of the prisoners - the door has a clasp lock to it - my wife is unwell.</p>
               <p>FORD'S Defence. I went to Falconer's-alley, to Mrs. Spencer, to ask if her husband, who is a pork-butcher, was at home - she said, No, but if I stopped a bit I should see him. Wicks came in, and asked if his tea was ready - in a short time in came Smith. As to Toole I have seen him at all the notorious houses.</p>
               <p>One witness gave Smith a good character.</p>
               <p> - SHORT. I live in Fox-court, Ray-street, Clerkenwell - Wicks was my apprentice; I have known him ten years. I left him at work about eleven o'clock on this morning, and he ought to have been at work all day - he bore a good character.</p>

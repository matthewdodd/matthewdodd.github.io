                  </hi>. I am cashier to Mr. Charles Fox and Mr. Henderson, they are contractors for the Crystal Palace at Hyde Park—they have about 2,400 persons employed there—the prisoner was in their service, but had absented himself from some indisposition—he was time-keeper in the department of the carpenters, under a foreman, named Lovell—the men are paid at the end of the week—the time-keeper makes a sheet, called the time sheet, of the time each person is employed—that is given to me—it shows what each person is entitled to—I deposit the money each person is entitled to, and it is put in a box—the time-keeper makes the sheet for the foreman, and the foreman conveys it to my office—he makes the sheet from the report of the time-keeper—the sheets are sent in on Friday, and the next day the money is allotted—if a man leaves short of a week he is paid for his time immediately—a note is sent for it—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was brought to my office by the prisoner on 2nd Jan. (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Jan. 2, 1851. Mr. Hall, please pay the bearer, William Halliwell, four days, five hours at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day; 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="smallCaps">E. LOVELL."</hi>—there was a man named William Halliwell there—the prisoner said Halliwell was discharged, and he wanted his money—this bill was calculated by my clerk, who found it should have been 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was added to it, and it was paid—here is the No. 1,400 on it—that was Halliwell's No.; each man has a brass ticket with his number—this signature of Mr. Lovell's is very much like his writing—I know his writing perfectly well—I paid the 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the credit I gave to the signature, with the money of Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the cashier's office; it if my duty when an order is brought in for payment to see that the sum demanded is accurate. On 2nd Jan. the prisoner handed this paper to me for payment—I checked the accuracy of the calculation—the sum of money on it was 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found the party was entitled to 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more—I made the alteration, put my initials to it, handed it to the prisoner, and he presented it for payment to Mr. Hall—Mr. Hall called my attention to the signature being Mr. Lovell's—I was busy at the time—I did not look into it minutely—I said, "Yes, I believed it was Mi.

The prisoner was employed under me, as time-keeper, from 18th Nov. till 27th Dec.—I had not discharged him, but I never saw him after—he was paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day—if a man was discharged, he would get his wages by an order like this, with my signature to it—a man named Halliwell had been in the employ a month, to the best of my recollection—the prisoner would know that—this order speaks of four days and five hours' work; and being on 2nd Jan., would be subsequent to 27th Dec, when the prisoner ceased to attend—Halliwell has never quitted the employ; he is at work for me now—the 2nd Jan. was on Thursday—the time-sheet had been last sent in on 27th Dec, by the prisoner—the name of Lovell is not my signature, nor written by my authority or knowledge—I have seen the prisoner write, and believe the body of this order to be his writing—I do not know whether he has seen me write; he has seen my signature in my books—I allowed him to sign, "John Watson, for Edward Lovell."</p>

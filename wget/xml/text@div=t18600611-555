Q.</hi> When did you first become acquainted with Mr. Richardson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think about August last year—it was not on the occa<lb></lb>sion of his calling upon me to ask if I would support Colonel Hicks as a candidate for the office of Governor of Whitecross-street—the first time I saw Mr. Richardson was in reference to the formation of the London Rifle Brigade; that would be about August or the latter end of July—I can't charge my memory exactly; it was some time in last summer—he called upon me suggesting that I should become Colonel of the brigade—he was, no doubt, the first to suggest to me my joining the brigade, he and Colonel Hicks—he was instrumental in getting up the brigade; I will not say he was mainly instrumental, but he was instrumental; he and Colonel Hicks were the two parties that called on me in the first instance—as to getting it up, I think I got it up as much as anybody, I think I did the majority of the work—I was, no doubt, very much assisted at the outset by Mr. Richardson and Colonel Hicks, and by the public—I had known nothing at all of him previous to that—after I joined the brigade I was Vice-President of the Council; I was made Vice-President at a public meeting—there was a reso<lb></lb>lution to that effect—Richardson was present at that meeting—I do not feel that he made me Vice-President; there was a public meeting called at the Guildhall: at that public meeting certain resolutions were passed, among others that the Lord Mayor, for the time being, should be President, and that I should be Vice-President, and certain gentlemen were named to be on the Council; and that was the origin of the London Rifle Brigade—I am not aware that there was any resolution appointing Richardson to be Secretary: you will find his appointment in the minutes of the Council—there was a special minute appointing him acting Secretary <hi rend="italic">pro tem</hi> with a commission of five per cent, on monies collected, which commission was to be arranged and de<lb></lb>termined by the Finance Committee, of which I was chairman—the five per cent, commission was to be upon sums collected by Mr. Richardson—there were large sums collected by individual exertions—that was to be his mode of payment; whether he was entitled upon particular sums, was to be de<lb></lb>termined by the Council, and there was a special minute to that effect—this is the minute first appointing him Secretary (<hi rend="italic">referring to the minute book</hi>), it is under the date of 3d August—(<hi rend="italic">Reads</hi>:) "A discussion ensued as to the office of Secretary—Mr. Richardson was requested to act as Secretary <hi rend="italic">pro tem.</hi>—"It was unanimously resolved that Mr. Richardson be empowered to collect donations and subscriptions for this brigade, and that he be allowed a commis<lb></lb>sion of five percent on all monies he has obtained or may obtain, and that should any question arise in reference to his commission account it be referred to the Finance Committee"—This is the resolution appointing me to the Finance Committee—"It was unanimously resolved that the next meeting of the Council take place at the Mansion House, on Wednesday next, at three o'clock precisely"—the date of this is 6th July, and then at the next meeting of the Council, "That the Finance Committee consist of Sir Francis Doyle, Bart., Mr. Alderman Carter, and Mr. Alderman Rose"—I dare say there is a resolution appointing trustees; I will endeavour to find</p>

               <p>it—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Giffard stated that there was no resolution nominating trustees, as such</hi>)—I know there was a resolution appointing trustees for the Crystal Palace agreement, and I had an idea there was one for that purpose—as an active member of the brigade, if there had been a resolution appointing trustees I should have known it, but these matters are very Voluminous, and I should not like to charge my memory without referring to the books; as Mr. Giffard informs me he has, and that there is no such resolution, of course that will save me the trouble of informing my mind of it—this little book (<hi rend="italic">looking at one produced by Mr. Gibbons</hi>) contains the original rules of the brigade—I believe it was published by our authority, but I should explain that those rules have been very much altered, and the authorised rules were only passed on the 16th of last month, but originally these rules were given out to the brigade—I do not know of my own knowledge that the prisoner is a mem<lb></lb>ber of the brigade besides being Secretary; he may be, but I do not know it—I took upon myself the duty of auditing the accounts—there are 1,500 members—I cannot charge my memory about the feet whether the prisoner paid his three guinea subscription as an honorary member, it may be so, I do not know it (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>); this paper indicates that he has paid his three guineas, and that he was a member of the corps; this is the first time I knew of the fact—this paper is evidence of the fact that he was a volunteer as well as myself—I never saw a docu<lb></lb>ment of that kind before in connexion with any other member of the brigade; I see it is signed by the Lord Mayor—I was chairman of the Finance Committee—I undertook, as my duty, to audit the accounts; I audited them personally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you audit them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had Mr. Richardson in the office and I had this book—I can give you the date when I first audited them—the first signature of mine here is 21st September—I cannot tell who was present then, I have no means of refreshing my memory, except that I was there because I find my signature: I have only that to guide me, I cannot charge my memory—the next occasion that I can speak to by reference to this book is 14th November—I can't say that that was the second occasion upon which I audited the accounts, it is the second occasion that I can speak positively to as to date—there would be a weekly audit, but this has my signature—I cannot tell who was present then, I only know I was there—I cannot say who was present on the next occa<lb></lb>sion, I can only say that I made the audit, because here is my signature, and here is my memorandum of the digest of the account in the book—it was very seldom that anybody else attended, I mostly had to do it all myself—Mr. Richardson and Jeffreys were always present, I am very clear about that—Richardson was at his desk, and Jeffreys, who was a clerk brought into the office by Richardson, was called in with this cash-book, the banker's book, and the vouchers, and upon that I made my audit, such as it was—I did not go through the accounts with Jeffreys, but with Richardson, Jeffreys being the man that wrote the papers under the direction of Richardson—Richardson took the part of explaining the accounts and producing the vouchers—the actual carrying of the books was done by Jeffreys, but the explanation was done by Richardson—the whole of this book is in Jeffreys' handwriting: all the entries are made by him—I am not speaking of all the audits—the first audit is in Richardson's handwriting, signed by me: that is to say the materials of the audit are put in and signed by me; all the audits after that are in my own handwriting completely, in red ink, showing the details of the explanation of the account—none of these</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186006110062"></xptr>
               <p>entries in this book are made by Richardson as far as—I can see, except the digest of 14th November; the book is made up by Jeffreys.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The original entries in the book that you had to audit are all in Jeffreys' handwriting; is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Jeffreys being a clerk put there by Richardson without any authority from the Council—he was paid by the Council, but he was engaged by Richardson and employed by him—there is no minute in the book appointing him—when I made the audit, in order that everybody might understand the book by looking at it, I put a sort of digest at the end of each audit in red ink—in the first instance that was done by Jeffreys and signed by Richardson—that was the one of 14th November, but I did it ever afterwards, and initialed it—there is no handwriting of Richardson's after 14th November, in the original entry nor in the digest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIBBONS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> None of the digests are in his handwriting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; there were two accounts: there was the fund belonging to the Rifle Brigade, and the monies received on account of Silver &amp; Co. for uniforms; and in order that any member of the council coming to the office should understand exactly what we had in hand as our own funds, and what belonging to Messrs. Silver, I put in red ink a digest of the audit, as an explanation of the account: the first of those was made by Jeffreys and signed by the prisoner, and all the rest were made by me and signed by me—my recollection of the first audit is, that I said, "No one can understand it in this way, you had better put an explanation in red ink, so that any one coming here may understand how the balance stands."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is very intelligible—you first put your receipts, then your disbursements, and then the apparent balance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; then from that I deduct so much as is pledged to Messrs. Silver, and then I make a final balance, which is available for all purposes—on the face of this it does not show from whence the amount due to Silver &amp; Co. is derived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIBBONS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you to say that you looked through the book on every occasion; all the items? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went through it and checked it with the banker's book, and you will find my tick in the banker's pass<lb></lb>book—I went through the book with the prisoner—Jeffreys took the one book and I took the other, the prisoner explaining each item as we went along—Jeffreys was the man who did the work, that is to say he was writing clerk, to save Richardson the labour, but Richardson was the man I had the explanation from—I believe Richardson was an attorney; I do not know whether he had his certificate and was practising as an attorney at that time—I suppose he was once employed by the brigade as an attorney, because an amount of five guineas was passed to him for "professional services"—Jeffreys was employed by Richardson without authority—he did not receive his orders from the Council, but from Richardson—I did not give him orders; not with regard to finance certainly—I never gave him orders when I came to audit the accounts, I treated him as Richardson's clerk—the brigade paid him, but I looked for no explanation of money matters from him—he wrote up the books by Richardson's direction, there was no other clerk employed, Richardson had to keep the accounts—I have seen all the books—the rough minute-book is in Richardson's handwriting—the petty cash-book is in Jeffreys' writing—I believe none of the account-books are in Richardson's handwriting—Richardson ought to have kept the accounts, he had the custody of the books—Jeffreys wrote the books, but they were in the custody of Richardson, and he was responsible for every entry, there being a true account of what took place with the cash—I believe Jeffreys was present at every audit I made—most likely he ticked one book while I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186006110063"></xptr>
               <p>ticked the other—very likely Jeffreys read out the items, but I looked to Richardson for the explanations—Richardson has read over the items to me, I cannot charge my memory with any distinct time, but I have no hesita<lb></lb>tion in saying that on several occasious he did as I have described Jeffreys to have done, ticked the items—I cannot identify any one particular time, but I have no hesitation in stating generally that Richardson always represented these sums as a true statement of the disbursements of the cash in his custody, and that Jeffreys was merely acting as an amanuensis—Richardson collected the money and paid it in to the bank, and he gave me this as an account of what he had received and collected; it was always brought before me as chairman of the Finance Committee, as the account of the monies collected and disbursed—other persons collected money, but it all went through Richardson's hands, and appears in the books—the money was all given by the persons collecting it into Richardson's hands, to pay into the bank—the money was always given to Richardson, on all occasions—money paid in the office would be given to Jeffreys—Silver's accounts were paid to him—if Richardson was out, money would be paid to whoever was there—no doubt Jeffreys has taken money on several occasions and Mr. Clearson also—he is a gentleman employed there by the Council some months ago to assist in the work of the office, and who is now acting as Secretary—during the time Richardson was there, there were a great many sums of money received, large and small—I can tell you exactly how much was received while he was there—it was 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was one sum of 100 guineas, a donation from the Corporation; I do not know whether he paid that in—that was the largest sum he received—the bulk of the sums were from 5 to 10 guineas, here they are (<hi rend="italic">reading over a variety of sums varying from I guinea to</hi> 20)—the prisoner was engaged in collecting subscriptions, as well as in the office—generally his mode of operation was to have one or two of the Council with him to go round to the leading firms—they introduced the subject and he acted as Secretary, and when the donations were given he took them home and paid them into the bank.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Besides that, I suppose, he did the puffing, wrote to the newspapers and all that sort of thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He put in the advertisements no doubt—he prepared the reports for the newspapers (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—I dare say I may have seen this before—one of our grouuds of complaint against Mr. Richardson was that he was in the habit of putting very incorrect reports in the papers, that he put in things which did not actually take place; perhaps that may be one of them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at another</hi>) I believe this is one that he prepared and sent out—all these things were not done under the sauction of the Council; he did a great many things that he had no sanction for at all—there was no special sanction for that paper that I know of; there was a general sanction for that sort of thing implied, not expressed—I think the first occasion of any complaint about his reporting was about 14th or 15th October—business had been before the Council and one mem<lb></lb>ber of the Council was in a minority, the remainder unanimously on the, other side, and the views of the one member were put into the report, and the decision of the Council and the bulk of the report was omitted—of course that was matter of complaint, and after that the reports were ordered to be revised; at least, I do not know whether it was after that, but at one period a minute was passed that some one was to be responsible for the reports—There was a petty cash-book kept—I was in the habit of drawing cheques for petty cash—the petty cash-book was kept in Jeffreys' handwriting, but the money was paid to Richardson to disburse; he was responsible for the money, and we looked to him for a true-account of it—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186006110064"></xptr>
               <p>was arrested on Monday, 5th March—the warrant was applied for the same day I believe—he had sent in his resignation some weeks before that—on 20th January a committee met to inquire into his duties and emolu<lb></lb>ments, and after that they brought up a report, and on that report his resignation was accepted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> His resignation was by letter, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIBBONS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you read his appointment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have read that, it was merely appointing him <hi rend="italic">pro tem.</hi>—I know of no other appoint<lb></lb>ment than that—there is no appointment on 10th January—there was no resolution about that date appointing him Secretary; there was a com<lb></lb>mittee appointed to inquire into the duties and emoluments of Secretary—that committee was called at the Mansion-house, and they brought up a report recommending that Mr. Richardson be appointed Secretary, but that report was not adopted, and Mr. Richardson's resignation as Secretary <hi rend="italic">pro tem</hi>, was accepted—his resignation was then in the hands of one of the mem<lb></lb>bers of the council, the Lord Mayor, at the time that report was brought in—at that time the prisoner had some petty cash in his hands—I do not know of Jeffreys' going down and receiving the petty cash from him—I do not know that it was paid over to the office; I know it was not, that is to say, the accountants tell me it was not, for it appears in the sum he was deficient, I think it was the balance of a 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque; the accountants will give you the exact amount—the sum total of his deficiency was 506<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd according to the accountants' statement—the accountants can explain better than I can the how that deficiency is made up—I arrived at the conclusion that there was that deficiency, upon the report of the accountants specially employed to go through the accounts—according to the resolution which I have read the prisoner was to have a commission of 5 per cent.—I cannot from memory tell you the amount of his commission account—he certainly did not collect 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—two sumsof 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. have been paid to him as commission—those were paid to him upon his own statement of account—I believe his commission accounts are in court—he made it 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the account was subjected to the examination of the finance com<lb></lb>mittee—the two first accounts were paid without examination because we thought he ought to have money, and at the end of any specified time his accounts would have been gone into, and if any amounts were improperly charged there as subject to his commission, they would have been struck out—he charged everything in his account that he could possibly lay claim to he did not claim 595<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there not a resolution passed to make him a donation of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. irrespective of his commission? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a resolution passed when this report was brought up recommending Mr. Richardson to be appointed secretary at a salary of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, that report was negatived by the coun<lb></lb>cil on 10th January; his resignation was accepted, and he was voted a sum of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in addition to his commission, provided his accounts were found to be correct—this is the resolution—it is on 20th January "Mr. Richardson's tender of resignation of the office of secretary having been read, it was moved by Mr. Kinnaird, M.P., seconded by Lieut-Colonel Hicks, and carried unanimously, "That the duties of Secretary to Rifle brigades being henceforth required by the authorities to be performed under the commanding officer and particularly requiring a military man for their performance, the resigna<lb></lb>tion of Mr. Richardson be accepted"—it was then moved "that he be paid his present claim for collecting subscriptions, and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in addition, in dis<lb></lb>charge of any claim he may have against the brigade up to 25th March next"—it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186006110065"></xptr>
               <p>was then moved by Mr. Alderman Allen, seconded by Mr. Alderman Rose, "that the Council empowers the Finance Committee to employ an accountant to examine the accounts at an expense of not more than twenty guineas, and report"—That sum of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was never paid to Mr. Richardson, because his accounts were wrong—he claimed 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as his commission—there was not another account of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for cab hire; this report recommends it, but that report was not adopted the first I heard of that claim was when the report was brought up—I did not know anything about it till then, I was not allowed to be one of the committee—I was present when the resolution was passed recommending his commission to be paid—I never heard that his claim included 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for cab hire as well as 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for commission—he never made a claim to the Council for cab hire, he may have made it to the com<lb></lb>mittee that met at the Mansion-house—I never heard of his claim of five guineas for professional services until I saw the report—he never could have made the claim for cab hire to me, because I have been through the petty cash, and found large sums charged for cab hire every day—the committee recommended the payment, but, as I have said, that recommendation was not adopted—this is the minute referring to it—(<hi rend="italic">Reads</hi>:) "Mr. Alderman Wire moved that the report brought up be received and agreed to, and that Mr. Richardson be appointed Secretary to the Council of this brigade on the terms and conditions named in this report—Mr. Richardson was requested to withdraw, and on his return was informed that further consideration of the subject would take place next Tuesday"—then on the Tuesday, the 17th Jan.—"a special meeting of the council was directed to be called for Friday next, at 1 o'clock, upon the office of Secretary; no other business to be dis<lb></lb>cussed" then the minute of the meeting of the 20th I have already read—his resignation was all this time in the hands of the Lord Mayor—it was sent in before the report was sent in, and it was formally accepted on 20th January.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Harding and Pullen—I went through the accounts—there is no entry in the banker's book or the cash-book of the sum of ten guineas received as a donation from Mr. J. Entwistle, or of three guineas of Alexander Frost on 18th October, nor of ten guineas from Mr. Simms on 15th December, 1859.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the prisoner present when you went through the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think the whole of the time I was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything said to you about Mr. Entwistle's donation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One item I know he said was omitted and must be entered before the next audit, but whether that was Mr. Entwistle's or not I cannot at this moment re<lb></lb>member—there was one item which I found was omitted, I do not say that was Mr. Entwistle's—I could see the amount of that item at the time, I cannot remember it now—I cannot swear it was not Mr. Entwistle's dona<lb></lb>tion that he mentioned.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">This being the case for the prosecution, Mr. Gibbons inquired whether Colonel Hicks, who was in attendance, was not to be examined. Mr. Giffard replied that he was not aware Colonel Hicks could prove any fact relevant to this prosecution, but if the Court desired him to be called he would put him in the box.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIBBONS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no evidence to support the Counts charging the prisoner as servant either to the Lord Mayor, the Duke of Cambridge, or Colonel Hicks.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARON BRAMWELL</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that by his accepting the office of Secretary, pro tem., he became the servant of the Council, consisting of the Lord Mayor and others.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIBBONS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that those gentlemen had no power to constitute themselves a Council or to hold property as such, and that it must be sfown that the money received by the prisoner was money belonging to them, and for their own use; that an indictment for embezzle<lb></lb>ment could not be sustained without proof of the money being the property of the persons alleged to be the masters; although therefore these parties might have employed him, still they not being a corporation or a partnership, had no power to hold property; that there was no proof of any trustees having been appointed, nor if there had been, was the property laid in them; the money subscribed was not intended for the Council or for their purposes, but for ike Rifle Brigade which was not then formed; and if it had been formed it would be the property of the Colonel, under the statute of George 3. c. 44. s. 56, and at the time in question, the appointment of Colonel had not been paid. The learned Counsel referred to the judgment of Mr. Baron Parke in the case of Reg. v. Goodbody, as supporting his argument, and contended that upon the grounds he had urged there was no case to go to the Juvy.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated that the case of Reg v. Goodbody did not touch the present question, and that the decision there had been overruled; the way in which he put the case was simply this, that the prisoner was employed by the gentlemen who were present at the meeting referred to, and he had received money on their behalf for which he had not accounted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIBBONS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">contended that the money must be the money of the parties on whose account he received it; if he was employed by the Lord Mayor and others, as the Council of the brigade, the monies he was alleged to have embezzled must be their monies, whereas the evidence established the fact that the monies were intended for the Rifle Brigade not then formed; that as far as the holding of money was concerned, the Council was in fact an illegal association until their rules were confirmed by the Secretary of State, and that until then each subscriber was the rightful owner of his own money and had a legal right to claim it back.</hi>

                  </hi>. "I think the objection is not tenable—if this were to be held to be a good objection, there has been no good indictment for embezzlement yet, it does not allege the money to be the money of the person upon whose behalf he received it in particular; all that is necessary to constitute the offence of em<lb></lb>bezzlement is, that the relation of master and servant should be established, that the servant received money for the master, and that having received it he embezzled it; if those three things are established, there is no question as to whose money it is, although I have no doubt that the property was. in the masters, and that they had a right to receive it from him, and if it was a chattel they would have a right to that cliattel; I think there is nothing in the objection."</p>

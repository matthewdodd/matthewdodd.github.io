                  </hi>. I am the acting-warder of the Millbank-prison—I knew Thomas Hall—he was a warder there in Nov., the prisoner was a convict, confined there at the commencement of this month—I do not recollect when he was brought there—I was not there when he was received in—I had been there a fortnight before this occurred—he was there all that time, but I do not know how long before that—the prisoner was confined in D ward, and No. 19 cell—on Wednesday afternoon, 7th Nov., Hall was the warder in charge of that ward—I was on duty in toe adjoining ward, letter C—about half-past three that afternoon my attention was called by several persons shouting as if for assistance, I supposed it eame from D ward; I immediately went there—to pass from C ward into D, I had to unlock two gates—when I entered D ward, I saw the prisoner in the passage in D ward, which runs right in front of the cells—the ward was all locked up at the time—I had keys, so that I could go from ward to ward—there was no one but the prisoner in the passage (<hi rend="italic">looking at a plan</hi>), this is a correct plan of the place—the prisoner's cell, No. 19, is put down there correctly, the next cell is Crawley's, the next to that is the store cell, and next to that the warder's room—in front of the warder's-room is the water-closet, and then, at an angle, the other cells go off the other way—where I saw the prisoner standing was nearly opposite No. 18 cell—that was next to his own—warder Sage entered into D ward almost immediately after me—he did not come the same way that I did, but the opposite end—I came in at the 19 end, and he came in at the opposite angle—Sage immediately seized the prisoner—the gates between the different wards were locked—I cannot tell whether Sage's gates were locked, I unlocked the gates from C to D—I tried every gate of the cells, and found them all locked—the prisoner's cell was locked also—it is the practice when a prisoner is taken out of his cell to lock the gate till he is brought back—I went into the officers' room, and there saw the deceased lying in a pool of blood—he laid on his left side, and the blood was all round his head—the door of that room was standing open when I came up to him—at the time I went into the Horn with Sage, there was no one in the ward but the prisoner and our two selves—no one could have got to that room, except the prisoner and the deceased—Sage had got the prisoner, we took him to the refractory cell after I had bolted all the doors of the other cells—I searched him and found on him a pair of scissors—I produce them—they were separated as they are now when I found them—they are unriveted, and in two pieces—they are the sort of scissors that are used in the gaol—the points are sharpened up in a manner not at all customary, both back and front—when I had locked up the prisoner, I returned to the officers' room where I had seen the deceased—Dr. Bailey, the surgeon to the Penitentiary, arrived in six or</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184911260044"></xptr>
               <p>seven minutes—Hall was not dead at that time—in the passage near the officers' room I saw the prisoner's pot which he used in his room—it was standing within about two and a half yards of the officers' door—it is an earthenware pot, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there was blood on the bottom and up the side—the lid of it was lying in the water-closet—it was then broken as it is now—we could not find the other part of the lid, we searched for it—the water-closet where they empty the pans has water which works on it when used—there is a pipe to it; I do not know the size of it, some very small things would go down it—if the piece of broken lid was broken in two or three pieces it might go down, it would not go down in one piece—while the prisoner was in the passage near the door of 18 cell, the witness Crawley said to me, "Seize the scoundrel, for he has murdered warder Hall I believe, for 1 heard him groan"—the prisoner made no reply.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Crawley say that to you in the prisoner's hearing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was when I had got about half-way down the passage, just as Sage was coming up—he said, "Seize this scoundrel, for he has murdered warder Hall" or "Mr. Hall"—the prisoner was within about two yards or two and a half yards of Crawley at the time—I am sure he heard it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There were two or three words in your first answer to a question, which you altered in a second: you say now that Crawley cried out, "Seize the scoundrel, for he has murdered Mr. Hall;" I understood you to say at first, "I think he has murdered Mr. Hall, for I heard him groan;" which was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say exactlv whether it was, "I think," or whether it was, "He has murdered Mr. Hall"—I am sure he said he heard him groan—the water-closet is in the centre part—I found the broken lid lying within the water-closet, a little to the right-hand side, as you enter the closet—all the prisoners' cells are of one sise, and have a single entrance into the passage—the width of the entrance is about two feet—there is a gate through which they can see—the whole of the gate is a grating through which they can see—there is a gate and a door; a solid door and a grating—the inside door is shut at night; it is always unbolted from the morning till four o'clock in the evening—the bars of the gratings are about four inches apart—you can put your arm through—the bars are square, but the hole between the grating is an oval—the prisoner would have an hour's exercise during the day—the wards are all scaled off for exercise at different times—there are regular hours for exercise, but not the same hour each day—during that exercise the prisoners are not allowed to have any communication with any of the other prisoners, neither by word of mouth or in any other way—the whole ward, consisting of thirty men, are exercised at the same time—the communication would depend upon whether we observed them or not—there is a warder employed, whose duty it is to take care that no communication takes place—they are required to walk as far from each other as we can extend them considering the number in the ward, about five or six yards apart—they do not wear masks, nor are they concealed in any way, merely the ordinary prison dress—with the exception of that hour of exercise, they are shut up in their cells for the remainder of the twenty-four hours, unless they want <hi rend="italic">to</hi> go out for anything, or in the morning for cleaning the wards—their meals are taken in <hi rend="italic">to</hi> them—they are not</p>

               <p>allowed to com<lb></lb>municate by word of mouth with the warders who take in their meals, except in the execution of duty—they have no right to address the warders except the warders address them, or they wish to ask for anything they want—if they ask for that which is necessary, it is considered to be a proper use of their voice; otherwise they are not to hold any communication—they are not allowed to speak unless they are spoken to, or want something necessary—if they do want anything necessary, such as going to the water-closet, there is a signal in each cell for that purpose, without using their voice—I have only been a short time at the Penitentiary this time—I was there two years before—the pool of blood was near the deceased's head; he laid with his feet towards the room-door; his head was inside, close by the side of his bed—he slept in the ward—the door of the warder's room is exactly opposite the door of the water-closet—Dr. Bailey and Mr. Rendel are the doctors of the prison.</p>

I think he has murdered Mr. Hall"—it was from Crawley calling out that I first heard the alarm—he said that loud enough for the prisoner to hear—he made no observation upon it—I saw this pan there; it was in the water-closet, both the pan and the top—I was examined before the Coroner, the prisoner was present, and put questions to me—he was also present when I was examined before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a prisoner, confined in the Millbank prison. On Wednesday, 7th Nov., I was in 18 cell, in D ward, that was the cell next to the one in which the prisoner was—to the best of my knowledge he had been in that cell about three weeks—I was there first—on Wednesday after<lb></lb>noon, 7th Nov., I delivered water to the prisoners in their cells in that ward, to the prisoner, as well as the others—about half-past three o'clock, or from</p>

               <p>that to four I was locked up in my own cell—warder Hall locked me up-after he had locked me up, I saw him go to the centre of the ward where his room is—he went to the centre to lock another prisoner up in No. 1 cell—I saw that prisoner waiting to be locked up when he locked me up—while Hall was gone away to lock him up, I heard Francis calling out for Mr. Hall—I told him it was no use for him to call out; I was sure Mr. Hall could not hear him, that he was gone down the other side to lock up a prisoner in No. 1.—he still kept on calling out for Mr. Hall—I saw Mr. Hall come round to the prisoner's cell soon afterwards—he asked Francis what he was calling for—he said, "I want to empty my pot"—Mr. Hall asked him if he had not a signal stick in his cell—he said, "You are not allowed to call out of your cell after me; you have been here long enough to know better—if the gover<lb></lb>nor should have been coming by at the time, you would have been sure to have got punished for it; mind you don't do so <hi rend="italic">no</hi> more"—Francis said he would not, or, "No, Sir, I won't"—Mr. Hall then let Francis out of his cell to empty his pot—to go from his cell to the water-closet he must pass my cell-door—from my cell-door I could see the entrance into the water-closet—I did not see Francis go into the water-closet—I saw him come out—I saw him pass with the pot in his hand—I got up to my gate as the prisoner passed, to ask Mr. Hall for some thread—he kept the thread in his room-before Francis came out of the water-closet, I saw Hall come across as if he had come from his room, and lean on the troughs by the water-closet door—I then saw Francis come out with his pot in one hand, and the lid in the other—Mr. Hall then turned round as if he was coming towards the cell to let the prisoner in—he went before the prisoner, and the prisoner was follow<lb></lb>ing him—he had the pot in his left hand—while they were walking in that way, I saw Francis strike Hall on the head with the lid of the pot; he screamed and fell—I could not say whether he had his cap on or not—I saw his cap on the ground at the time he fell; he had it as if he had had it in his hand—I never saw him walk the ward without his cap; it was a cloth cap, with an oil skin over it—Francis then rushed on him, and kicked him when he was on the ground—I said, "For God's sake, Francis, don't kill the poor old man"—he did not speak to me—he got up off Mr. Hall, and stood for a minute, and Mr. Hall then crawled away towards his own room—Francis then went towards Mr. Hall's room, and I could hear two blows—I then called out for help, for an officer, Mr. Murray—Francis then came running out from Mr. Hall's room, and stood by the check-gate, in the centre—he had then the pot in his right hand—there is a check-gate on each side the centre—they are the gates belonging to the passage—it is a tall gate that fastens up the centre that locks the passage—that is not a gate that a person would have to go through in going from ward D to C—it is a gate you would have to go through from my cell to the centre, where Hall's room is—those gates, when they are shut, prevent anybody from going into the side part of the ward where I was, and the other gate at the other side—when those gates are shut, there is no communication from Mr. Hall's room to the water-closet—Francis stood by the check-gate on my side; the check-gate was opened at that time—he then had the pot in his hand, not the lid, and there was blood on the outside of it—I said to him, "Francis, don't strike the officer any more, I am sure you will kill him"—he did not make any answer, but ran across the centre to the other side—I then saw him return again, and go in the direction of Mr. Hall's room again, and I then heard two more blows—I called out again for the officer—I kept calling all the time; some of the other prisoners called</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see the prisoner go into the warder's room at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw him go in that direction—he then had the pot in his hand; that was before I heard the first two blows; and after I heard the second two blows he had the pot in his hand, when he returned from the check-gate to go towards the officers' room—I cannot tell what had become of the lid at that time; it had dropped on the ground—I am quite sure the lid was in a perfect state between two and three o'clock that day—the top was perfect as well as the side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident-surgeon, at Millbank Prison. On 7th Nov. I was called to see Hall—he was insensible—he had a large wound on the right side of his head, above the right ear, bleeding very much—there was an extensive fracture extending to the base of the skull, commencing on the right side, and going over to the opposite side—it was sufficient to cause death—he died at eleven or twelve o'clock next evening—many blows must have been given to produce what I saw—I should think the fracture of the skull must have been produced by the larger part of this vessel—I first saw the prisoner on the day of his admission, and many times since—he was removed in the early part of this year, and I believe he had been back eight or nine weeks.</p>

               <p>there—it is separate confinement, which is very different—in solitary confinement, the prisoner sees no one, I believe, but his officer during the day—in separate confinement persons are continually passing and repassing, and they have the opportunity of speaking to prisoners and to their officer, and are provided with work—the work and imprisonment in Millbank would certainly not be likely to make lunacy return, in a case like this, unless it had been two or three months previously; it would not then be justifiable—if he had been well two years I should treat him in this way—it would certainly have no effect then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am visiting physician to Millbank Penitentiary—I believe the prisoner came there in Aug. last—I saw him about a fortnight afterwards, when the question was submitted to me, whether he was able to do the ordinary work of the prison, which is tailoring, picking oakum, shoemaking, and hard labour at the pumps—I said he was able to work at a trade, but not at the pumps, and I believe he was so employed—he was not a strong muscular man, and had a disease of the rectum—he had the ordi<lb></lb>nary diet of the prison—I saw him on three occasions, the one I have referred to, and a second time, in making a general inspection of the male convicts, when nothing particular passed, and a third time, when I inspected him and other men, to ascertain whether he was fit to be transported to Norfolk Island, in Oct., or the beginning of November, last year—he then complained of symptoms of <hi rend="italic">dyspepsia</hi>, of pain in the chest, and <hi rend="italic">of prolapsus ani</hi>—he told me he had passed blood that day through bis bowels, and I went with him to his cell to examine his utensil—I do not recollect whether I saw any blood, but the result was that I certified that he was not fit to be transported—that was about a week before 7th Nov.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You mean a variety of things by <hi rend="italic">dyspepsia? A</hi> I mean indigestion, I thought he was suffering slightly from indigestion—lunatic people do not generally suffer from giddiness, only from headache—in persons predisposed to affections of the brain, dyspepsia might induce an attack—I do not think dyspepsia would have a tendency to produce apoplexy, it would produce some kinds of disorder of the brain—I must have seen the prisoner in Feb., 1846—I have no memorandum of the observations I made then—the system at Millbank is not strictly solitary, it is a modified separate system—when I examined him in Feb. he was well in body and mind—on 5th March I was sent specially to the <hi rend="italic">Palmyra</hi>, convict-ship, to ascertain his state of mind—I believed him to be insane, and ordered him on board the hospital-ship, as an insane patient—I do not know how long be remained there—he was under Mr. Blyth's care—I believe his insanity arose from the prospect of transportation acting on his mind—that has acted on a sane mind—I have been several times sent for to Woolwich, to examine prisoners insane from a similar cause, and I know they were sane when sent on board the convict-ship—it is difficult to get satisfactory evidence of the state of the parents—if a person from birth was predisposed to insanity, he would be more likely to be affected in that way, by fear—as far as I recollect the pri<lb></lb>soner's state, he was of an average habit, rather weak than strong—his mad<lb></lb>ness was a sort of timidity and terror—he seemed afraid that individuals would do him an injury—as far as I recollect I made a report, but I have not seen it since, and I do not recollect it—I do not recollect that he broke out into any acts of violence—I should have considered it safe to have left him with other persons—his state would not lead to immediate acts of violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But if a person is labouring under the apprehension that another person</p>

               <p>will do him violence, is it not likely that he will act as if the violence is about to he committed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In any case of acute insanity there would be such a risk—I am now speaking of 1846—I had seen him in perfect health within a week or ten days before I declared him insane—it was immediately the terror began to operate upon him, on 5th March.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the cases you have mentioned, where persons under the apprehension of being transported hare exhibited symptoms of insanity, do you know what became of them afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some were sent, as this man was, to the hulks, and others to Bedlam—I have been ten years con<lb></lb>nected with the Penitentiary—during the first five or six years it had no rela<lb></lb>tion to the hulks, and all insane patients were sent to Bedlam—but now it is merely a depot for transports, and the hulks at Woolwich are part of the same establishment—I recollect one or two cases where patients have returned from Bedlam, and have been transported, and I have heard no more of them—I have never heard of temporary insanity returning, after the lapse of two years, under such circumstances as these—the prisoner Was at Millbank, on this last occasion, expecting to be transported, or removed to some other place of confinement—he did not know the object of my examination—I had examined him in the interval between Feb. 1846 and 1849—the examination in 1849 was to see if he was fit to be sent to the <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi> hulk—the questions I put to him would be the same as those in 1846, but the circumstances would be quite different—in 1846 I examined him, with a large number of others, in a passage, and it was quite obvious that they were about to be transported, or removed—on the last occasion I examined him in one of the central towers, under the examination of Captain O'Brien, and he did not know the object of the examination—I told the officer to take him before the surgeon next morning—bodies of prisoners are constantly being removed from Millbank to the Model Prison and the hulks—after they leave the Model Prison they are sent to the Isle of Portland, and afterwards transported—in all probability the prisoner heard me say that the surgeon should attend him.</p>

               <p>during her illness—hysterical mania is very common among females—it was necessary to confine her on the bed, and have persons to hold her—I think, for a short time, she was sent to the workhouse, and came back from there—she never was well, but there were periods at which she was much worse than at other times—she was a person of weakly constitution—these hysterical attacks would last four or five months together; in fact, she never was well, never in a sane mind; but at certain periods she was more violent, and required coercion—I only speak for the last three years of her life; I knew her before—I knew her mother from her earliest days, from her marriage, but I only saw them professionally; I did not associate with them—I believe no complaint was made of any disease of the sister until the time I speak of—she died eventually of that disease—I think she died in King-street, Commercial-road—if I remember right I was attending her at that time.</p>

I am a resident medical-officer, on board the <hi rend="italic">Unit'e</hi> hospital ship, lying off Woolwich, The prisoner was transferred from the <hi rend="italic">Lady Palmyra</hi> convict hulk, on 5th March, 1846—I attended him; Mr. Bossy, the superintendent, also saw him, and we were both of opinion that he was insane at that time—he was labouring under the delusion that some one intended to do him some personal injury—he showed evident signs of fear in his manner, and he was shouting out of the port of the ship all night the first night he came; he was shouting to the sentinels on the wharf opposite, and calling for assistance; that some one was murdering him; and he also spoke to any one that was passing, or any of the watermen, to the same effect, shouting out that he was being murdered—he was shouting in that manner all that night—he remained under my care several weeks at that time—he remained insane during the whole of that period—he gradually recovered, but he was more or less insane for several weeks—he had the ordinary diet at first—he has been frequently in the hospital, but not for insanity—he laboured under dyspepsia, and on one occasion he bad rather a sharp attack of fever—that did not produce delirium, or affect his brain—he also had an ulcerated sore throat once or twice—he was continually com<lb></lb>plaining of that ailment already mentioned, the <hi rend="italic">prolapsus anit</hi>—I ascertained that that was perfectly true—it is the bowel coming out at the time the <hi rend="italic">faces</hi> are discharged—I never saw him after he left the hulk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">referred to the decision in M'Naughten'scase.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">"I am aware of that decision, and am quite sure it was wrong, and the sooner it is corrected the better. What are the facts proved? Is Dr. Sutherland to be the Judge, or the Jury and I? It implies that the facts are proved; there are no facts proved at present. I decide that the question cannot be put as a matter of right, and I do not think it ought as a matter of convenience. The way to examine a scientific witness is to put general questions to him, such as 'What are the symptoms of insanity? 'In what way do you judge such a symptom to be one of insanity or the reverse? and the Jury will apply his hypothetic answer to the facts before them; if it agrees with the facts, they will apply the opinion; if not, it goes for nothing. If you wish to ask his judgment upon what he saw on the two occasions, you may; but my difficulty is, that your question implies that the facts are proved."</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you enabled to form any opinion as to the state of his mind from the two interviews you had with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I was—he did not, in my judgment in those interviews exhibit any symptom of insanity—I spoke to him on the subject of this charge—I only asked him whether he recollected the time the murder was committed—he said he did—I asked him as to his previous history, and as to his disease—he told me that he had been bad in his head, out of his mind, in March, or April, 1846—he said that he had been told so, and that the prisoners had told him that had it not been for the officers on board the ship he should have thrown himself overboard—he said ho had no recollection of the subject himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a man to have had an attack of insanity in the early part of 1846, under which he suffered a few weeks, gradually recovering; to have recovered, and to have been, from that time down to the latter part of 1849, without any symptom of disease of that kind, would you refer an act of violence, suddenly committed by him at the latter period, to an unsound state of mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not without very great inquiry as to the cause and the symp<lb></lb>toms at the time—I mean, as to the cause that produced the disease, and as to the symptoms of the disease itself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the man in his attack in 1846 to have exhibited as the symp<lb></lb>tom of his insanity, great terror and apprehension of being sent away from his own country, from which he recovered; and in Oct. this year he had reason to think some such removal was likely to take place, and he com<lb></lb>mitted an act of violence soon after that reached his knowledge; how would that affect your view, with reference to the question of insanity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think it very likely to re-produce a temporary attack of insanity.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A similar state of circumstances might produce a similar attack? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I should think if he was really mad in 1846 because he expected to be transported, it would not be at all improbable that if he ex<lb></lb>pected to be transported in 1849, it would produce a temporary state of mad<lb></lb>ness. The fact of his committing the violent act in a place from which he could not possibly escape, would be a symptom to be taken in connexion with others.</p>

Supposing a man to have been attacked with temporary insanity in the early part of 1846, to have exhibited a great degree of terror and alarm at the prospect of being removed from this country; to have recovered his mind, and continued to have his mind uninterrupted down to October last, when there was reason to believe he might be sent away in the same manner; under these circumstances would you refer an act of violence, committed by him, to a recurrence of the previous insanity or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should refer it to insanity.</p>

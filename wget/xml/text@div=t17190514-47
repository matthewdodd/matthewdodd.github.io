               uttering and selling Counterfeited Stamp Paper, knowing it to be counterfeit
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>It appeared that the Commissioners of the Stamp Office finding that their Stamps were counterfeited, employ'd Mr. Holland and others to buy up Stamp Paper in order to find out the Aggressors, and prevent such evil Practices; that accordingly he bought some double Penny Stamp Paper of Mr. Barber, which proved to be Counterfeit, and which Barber deposed he bought of the Prisoner (who was a <rs id="t17190514-47-deflabel268" type="occupation">Clerk in the Chancery Office</rs>

Whereupon Mr. Sydeuham, Mr. Rolles and Mr. Marshal went with a Warrant to apprehend the Prisoner to his Lodgings, and found him and a Coach at the Door with a Sack of Stamp Paper in it, and a Trunk with more Stamp Paper in his Lodgings, which was produc'd in Court and fully proved to be Counterfeit. The Prisoner owned the selling the Paper to Mr. Barber, and that in the Sack and Trunk; and in his Defence said he had it from his Brother, who owed him One Hundred Pound, and could not pay him; but told him he would let him have it out in Stamp Paper, which he had of a Stationer that died that he did not know that any of it was Counterfeit. His Master and several Gentleman of the Office gave him a very good Character; and there being no Evidence to fix the first Indictment upon him, of Counterfeiting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171905140008"></xptr> the Stamps, the Jury Acquitted him of that, and found him <rs id="t17190514-47-verdict269" type="verdictDescription">

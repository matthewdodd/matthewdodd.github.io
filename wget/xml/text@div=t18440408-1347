               <p>Andrew Spottiswood and others are the proprietors. The prisoner was in their service—on the 20th of March I placed some gas cocks and fitting in a drawer—I received information, and placed myself, with another party, on the watch—at twenty minutes past eight o'clock the prisoner undid the door at the bottom of the stairs, then undid the room door where these things were, and was inside about three minutes—he then came out, locked the door, went down stairs, and locked the bottom door—I went into the room, and missed these articles—when he left work, about five minutes past nine o'clock, we followed him to a marine store-shop, but we were too late there.</p>

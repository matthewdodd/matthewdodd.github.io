They were not of them which I sold him, they were women's gloves; he had put them that he had bought into his pocket; after he went out of the shop I followed him and brought him back again, and bid him take them gloves out of his pocket; he said he had got none of mine, but he pulled them out of his pocket, and threw them down on the counter (produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I took this pair from the other five pair, to leave for a lady going home; I bought them to sell again. This prosecution is the effect of prejudice, occasioned by my having had bad gloves of him before.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176605140036"></xptr>Q. to prosecutor. Are you certain these are not of the six pair you sold the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know they are not, I have the other at home now; he had not paid for them, and he owed me money before; there were four pair and an odd one in the parcel, when he delivered them to me again; he began to shuffle about when I took him back into the house, and he picked a hole in the paper and threw three odd ones out of the parcel into the fire-place, which made up the six pair.</p>
               <p>To his character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bradistone. I have known the prisoner about five years; he was servant to me; he has quitted my service about four years; I had him in very great respect; I do not think of all the servants I had, during almost fifty years, that I had above one that I thought to be a better servant; I parted with him with regret; I would not now scruple to take him into my service again, if he was in a capacity to go to service; he has a wife and two children; I hope this was a mistake.</p>

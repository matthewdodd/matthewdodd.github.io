                  </hi>. I am a bill discounter of No. 3, Gloucester-terrace, Hoxton—I know the prisoner; he is a farrier—before 20th April, I had one transaction with him about a bill—on Friday, 20th April, he came to my office—he told me that a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> proprietor of the name of Oram owed him between 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if he was to draw a bill on him would I discount it—I told him "No, I could not, unless he got a respectable party to endorse the bill"—I gave him a form of proposal to fill up, for which he paid me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was a proposal for a bill—I am a private bill and loan I society—I gave him the form, that he might copy a bill from that form—this is the paper I gave him—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—it is a form of application for a bill—it has to be filled up with the names of the applicant, the acceptor, and the endorser—I have then to make inquiries, and if they an satisfactory, I get the bill and give the money—the prisoner returned the proposal filled up in this way next morning—I went to Mr. Brooker, the endorser, and made inquiry about Mr. Oram, the acceptor—on Wednesday, 25th April, the prisoner came again, and gave me die bill filled up—he said, "Here is the bill, with Mr. Oram's acceptance, and Mr. Brooker' endorsement upon it"—I had previously called at his house, and told him I had been to Mr. Brooker's house, and inquired about Mr. Oram, and Mr. Brooker's servant had told me that Mr. Oram was an honest man, and I told him I was satisfied as to the respectability of Mr. Brooker—(<hi rend="italic">The bill being read, was for</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at three months, drawn by John Vincent on George Oram, accepted by George Oram, and endorsed by John Vincent and William Brooker.)</p>

Oram—I think 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was deducted for discounting the bill; that would be ten per cent, for three months; forty per cent per annum—I have not got the money back; it is in the hands of the police—they took it from the prisoner the same afternoon he got it—I had one other transact<lb></lb>tion with the prisoner between two and three months ago; that was about a bill—Mr. Oram's name was not upon that bill—that bill is not paid yet; it is not due.</p>

I said, "I have not"—he said, "Well, I did write Mr. Brooker's name upon it by direction of Mr. Salomons, and I have got the money in my pocket"—Mr. Salomons said, "You know I never told you to do it"—I took the prisoner to the station, searched him, and found 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his posses<lb></lb>sion, which I produce.</p>

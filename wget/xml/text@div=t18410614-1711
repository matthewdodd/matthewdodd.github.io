                  </hi>. I drive an ice cart. On the 9th of June I was in the tap-room of the Dolphin tavern, Hungerford market—I went off to sleep after having my dinner—the prisoner was sitting on my right-hand side—I did not see him before I went to sleep, but I awoke up and found his hand in my right-hand pocket—I dozed off to sleep again, and then found his hand in my left-hand pocket, where I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., consisting of three half-crowns, and the rest in shillings and sixpences—I caught his hand as he brought it out of my pocket, and accused him of robbing me—his hand was clenched—he put it into his own pocket directly, slipped by me, went out of the room down to the water side, and tried to go off by a steam-boat, but there was none going off—I brought him back, and he tried to get away twice—I gave him in charge to a policeman—I asked him for my money several times—he said he had not got it—it was between four and five o'clock in the afternoon—I missed two half-crowns, four shillings, and a sixpence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was in his company that afternoon, partly intoxicated, I did not know any thing—I went with him, it appears, to Hungerford mar<lb></lb>ket—I had met him at Smithfield, I believe. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He rode with me to Hungerford market in my cart—I have known him and his brothers for year—I left him in the cart when I went into the public-house, and did not see him there till I felt his hand in my pocket—I was sober—I had not drank more than would do me good—I had a pint of beer there, and I believe a pint and a half in the course of the day.</p>

I was on duty in Hungerforfl<lb></lb>market on the 9th of June—Steer called me and gave charge of the pri<lb></lb>soner—I asked him if he had got any money about him—he said, "Not a farthing"—I searched him at the station in Steer's presence, and found on him two half-crowns, five shillings, three sixpences, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—he then said he would give Steer all the money he had if he would let him go, and if that would not satisfy him, he would go and borrow a sovereign of somebody, and said, "Do pray let me go."</p>

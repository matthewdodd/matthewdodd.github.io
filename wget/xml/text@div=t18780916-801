I live at 88, Pemberton Street, Islington—on Tuesday night, 18th June, I locked up the house securely—I was aroused by a neigh bour between 5 and 6 a.m., went down, and found a man named Marshall in custody—my back door was broken open, and my parlour door cut away so as to insert a chisel; but the lock was too strong—a piece was cut out of the back parlour window, which was open—I missed a watch, which was found on Marshall; he has been convicted.

I live at 149, Pemberton Street, and am a carpet-beater—on 19th June, about 5.45 a.m, I was going down Clayton Street, and saw Marshall come out of Mr. Archer's house—the prisoner ran after him from my master's (Mr. Williams's) stable door, which is about 10 yards from the house—they went on together about 200 yards—I went up to Marshall and said "What do you do in that house?"—he said "Nothing"—I took him back, and the prisoner said "You bleeding long s—; if you don't let him go we will kill you"—I said nothing—I could not get near the prisoner—he went away, and I took Marshall to Archer's house—I have known the prisoner 10 years, and cannot be mistaken in him—he lives in Stroud Vale, Maiden Lane.</p>

He ran away after using that violent expression—I had come out of my house, which is 20 yards from Mr. Archer's—the prisoner came up before I got hold of Marshall—I did not say that he had better go away, and that if he did not I would have him too, nor did he reply, "What for?—he ran away before any policeman came up—I was the principal witness on Marshall's trial, and got a reward—I have not been pomised one in this case, and do not want one—I have been five times convicted—I had five months for larceny, four months for assault, and five years for stealing a sack of potatoes from the Great Northern Railway—I am now under police supervision.</p>

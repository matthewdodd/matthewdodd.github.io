                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 27, Wells Street, Oxford Street—on 8th August, about 12.30, I was standing at my own door, near the Tiger public-house, which was closed, and saw the prisoner and deceased standing talking together, very quietly, not loudly—they stood there for about ten minutes, and all of a sudden I saw the prisoner strike the deceased, and knock him down into the road—I could not say whether he hit him in the face, or the back of the head—the blow stunned him—he fell on his face, and hands and knees—it was not near the kerb; right out in the road—the prisoner struck him a second time in the road, while he was down on the ground—I directly ran across and said, "You ought to be ashamed of your<lb></lb>self for striking a man like that"—he said, "What have you to do with it? I will serve you the same"—a female named Morris came running across the road at the same time; several parties came round, and the deceased was picked up, and taken to the hospital—the prisoner followed—he said he was very sorry for what he had done, that he would not hurt a hair of his head; they had been great friends for a number of years—he did not say what they fell out about—the prisoner seemed to be middling sober—he did not seem to be any the worse for liquor—he might have had some<lb></lb>thing to drink for what I know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This was between 12 and 1 o'clock on the Sunday morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they were standing just ten paces from me—I have measured it by the kerb—I had been standing at my door about twenty minutes—I saw them come from the archway of the public-house when it closed—I saw the prisoner strike the deceased a second time, while he was on the ground; he lifted his head up with his left hand, and struck him</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital when the deceased was brought there, about 12.30 on the morning of 9th August—he was then dead—I made a post-mortem examination thirty-six hours afterwards—the immediate cause of death was effusion of blood on the brain—that would be caused by violence, a blow or a fall—the blow of a fist would not be so likely to produce it as the head coming in contact with the pavement, or any hard substance—the effusion was all over the surface of the brain, but a great deal more at the base—I have heard the evidence—that might account for the injuries I found; either a blow or a fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I think you have said that the appearances were more likely to be caused by a fall than anything else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if the man had been lifted up, and then fallen again on the back of his head, that would have caused it.<hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see any marks of violence externally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A con<lb></lb>fusion on either cheek—the man was certainly not healthy—all his internal organs were in a state of degeneration—the same consequences might not have happened to a healthy man; still I think his death was accelerated by the violence.</p>

I am a horse keeper, of 25, Wells Mews, Oxford Street—on this Saturday night, about 12.20, I was coming up Wells Street, and saw the deceased on the ground—the prisoner and several other men were there—I got some water, and the prisoner called for some brandy, which he paid for, to give the injured man, who was propped up in a sitting position against a man's leg; and while he was in that position I saw him fall very heavily on the ground—he seemed to slip sideways—it wan a heavy fall on the road—you could hear it some distance—after that he seemed to be very much changed, as if he was going—he seemed to change colour a good deal—he turned whiter—he was insensible from the time he fell.<hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came his head to slip? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was an altercation between the persons about him, and all their heads were turned, and his head was accidentally let go and fell—he was alive before that—he died on his way to the hospital—I assisted him there—the prisoner accompanied us, he was crying a good deal, and was very much cut up.</p>

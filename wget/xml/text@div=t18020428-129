             sworn. - I live in Northrow, Upper Park-street, and am a servant out of place: On the 3d of March, a little after eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to me at my lodgings, with another man, and told me, he was taken, and that was one of the Bow-street officers, for me, with a warrant; I asked him for what; he said, for taking linen out of a public-house where I had lived; I said, I did not take any, for it was out to wash, and was my own, and had paid for it; he took me to a public-house, and told me I had better make it up with the Bow-street runner; I told him I had nothing to make up; he said, I had better offer the man some money; I asked him what he wanted; he told me he could not take less than ten pounds, that he had been after me three days, and there were ten of them, and they must have a pound a-piece; the prisoner had lodged with me when I kept a public-house; he took me about from one public-house to another, till I did not know what I was about, and till I was unsensed; I had ten pounds in my pocket, which I threw on the table; there was eight guineas in gold, and two one-pound notes, out of which I had eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were you perfectly sober? - A. Yes; but I was unsensed, because I was frightened, as he said I should be imprisoned six months, and afterwards, transported for seven years; I think, the public-house was in King-street, the sign of the Grapes, just at the end of Shepherd's-mews; when we came out of the public-house, he told me I must get out of town by four o'clock the next day; I told him I could not till five; then he said, I must go to the City in the morning; next morning, he came to help me to the coach with my boxes, or else, he said, they would be after me again; I then suspected him, and told him he was a rogue; I then went to Bow-street, and inquired whether there was a warrant out against me; they said, no, and I took a warrant out against him; I never saw the other man before; we drank at every public-house, first, ale, and then, gin and water, but I drank very little; I don't know who kept the house; the prisoner was a job-tailor.</p>

             sworn. - I took the sign of the Castle after this woman left it, and the prisoner lodged with me, in the three pair of stairs: On the 3d of March, he went out with me; I left him at a public-house in Davis-street, and went home; he returned between nine and ten, and wanted change for a guinea; I would not give it him, as he was very much in liquor; in the course of the evening, he gave his daughter seven guineas, and two one-pound notes, to take care of for him; in the morning, he gave her a pound note for herself, took the seven guineas, and the other note, and went away, and I did not see him afterwards; I asked him before he went, where he got it; he said he won it, by tossing up for a guinea at a time; I said, suppose you had lost; O, says he, I had a friend by me, who would have paid for me.</p>

             sworn. - The prisoner was delivered into my custody at Bow-street; I searched him, and found five guineas, a one-pound note, half-a-guinea, two seven-shilling pieces, two sixpences, and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Moysey. This note I can swear to, having put a mark on it, though I cannot read or write.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On that night, a person came, and apprehended me, who said, he was a Bow-street officer, and asked me where Mrs. Moysey was; I told him, and we went to her; it was for taking things out of the house where she lived with a man as his wife; I was left in execution, and was given to understand she certainly had got many things off, such as sheets, and so on; as to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280100"></xptr>the money found upon me, I took it of three different people; she once charged a man with a rape without any cause.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Moysey.) Q.Did you ever accuse a man of having committed a rape upon you? - A. Yes, I did; the prisoner persuaded me to do it; he did commit it, and the prisoner went with me to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Kennedy. I am an officer, and the prosecutrix employed me to take a man from a public-house for committing a rape upon her, which I did, and took him before Mr. Conant, who saw through the business, and discharged the man; the story was - she lent some money to the man to go into a public-house, and she was to be his house-keeper; he left the house, and she was turned out.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character. GUILTY, aged 37.</p>

            . I am six years and a half old - I go to church sometimes; I live with my father, in Norwich-court, Fetter-lane. I remember playing with Henry Hall at the corner of Graystoke-place - the prisoner came, and told Henry Hall to go and find his donkey; he went, and the prisoner went after him - when they got to the top of Fetter-lane, I saw the prisoner take Henry Hall on his shoulder, and he went away; Hall had his clothes on then, his pinafore, shoes and stockings - I saw him in the evening when he came home; he had only his shirt, shoes and pinafore, and his sister's pelisse on - the prisoner had a black coat on at first; when I saw him again he had a white coat.</p>

I found Henry Hall on the Monday, in the privy of the yard belonging to the apartment - he had only his shirt, shoes, and stockings on, and his cap and pinafore in his hand; I took him in doors, and he told me where his parents lived - this was about four o'clock, and I suppose a mile and a half from his parents.</p>

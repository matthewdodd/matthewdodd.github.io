            . I am an officer. On the 17th of April, about five o'clock in the morning, I was called up, went to Pope's, and found the window broken open. In consequence of what Dempsey said, I went to look for the prisoner, but could not find him until the 15th of May, when I saw him with two others, but did not think proper to take him. I took him on the 19th.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 17th of April, I saw the prisoner coming up Duck-lane with two bundles - another man was with him. I put my hand on the bundle, and asked the prisoner what he had got there? he looked me in the face, and both ran off different ways; I sprung my rattle, and two watchmen came to my assistance; the prisoner ran into Duck-yard, and got off. I had seen him two or three times, but never had a view of his features before. I saw him again three weeks after - he was then dressed differently. I am sure he is the same man. I described him to Gilmore.</p>

On the 16th of April, about half-past nine o'clock at night, he came home to supper, and did not go out till about six o'clock the next morning. I was awake before five o'clock - I am certain of it.</p>

On the 30th of May the prisoner, with another young man came to our shop - the prisoner asked for a pair of shoes to fit him; he said, second-hand ones - I had been sitting in a chair, and my silk handkerchief was on that chair; the prisoner then sat down in it, and took the handkerchief up - when they were going out I followed them, and saw the prisoner give the other the handkerchief - he turned up Booth-street, and the prisoner went on - I had him taken.</p>

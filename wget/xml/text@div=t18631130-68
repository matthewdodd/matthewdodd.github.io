                  </hi>. I am a silk manufacturer, at 43, 44, and 45, New<lb></lb>gate-street—the name of the firm is Daniel Walters and Son—from informa<lb></lb>tion I received I went to the lodgings which were occupied by the prisoner, on 13th November—I think it was 29, Lion-street—I won't be quite sure of the number—a police-constable named Taylor accompanied me—I charged the prisoner with stealing my goods, and he said, "I have nothing here of yours"—I then said, "We must search your house"—he said, "You can do so"—I then said, "What is in that box?"—he said, "That box does not be<lb></lb>long to me," but on opening the box I found property of mine there (<hi rend="italic">articles produced</hi>)—these are only a few of the things—there were two large boxes of things—I cannot say whether these particular things were in the boxes or not, but there was a great deal of property in them of mine—I cannot be sure whether he said anything to me about whose the box was, but I think he said it belonged to some lady who lived over the way—I cannot say whether any of these particular articles were taken from the box, I believe some of them were—this red piece is a length of arras; about two yards and a half—it is worth about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is a length of drugget—it is difficult to esti<lb></lb>mate the value of it—it has been cut; I should think it is worth about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they resemble goods that were in my possession—the prisoner was fore<lb></lb>man of the packers—his duty would be to give in the goods to the clerk from a little ticket when they left the department—supposing goods left with a ticket of that kind and they were not given to the enterers, I should have no means of detecting whether they were taken or not—it was his duty to give in a ticket of all goods—he entered from these tickets, and then filed them—this is not his handwriting; it is from the department—he should copy from this ticket—he puts them on when he has entered them—tickets are now given with the goods, but not formerly—the prisoner would read from the ticket, and then put the ticket on the file—I did not hear him make any statement as to where those goods came from.</p>

               <p>understand your terms of the law—I heard these were to be abandoned, but last time I heard they were to be included—the second hearing was before Alderman Hale, and he said he wished the case gone thoroughly through again, and the chintzes were produced—the articles produced were found in a box—I do not know whether it was his wife's—I saw some ladies' dresses in them I really don't know when these patterns were last safe in my premises—the head of the department will tell you—I really don't know anything of the minute of my business, I attend to the general management; my foremen have authority to give away goods when they are perfectly useless—whether they are perfectly useless or not is left to their discretion; but perhaps you will call them patterns, and not goods—they are authorized to give away patterns—besides that, I sell to all the men in my employment if they desire to buy—I have in my employment thirty-five men in London, and about 400 at Braintree—I cannot say anything about there being anything in those particular goods to show that they have not been sold, because I had nothing to do with the sales—I did not buy the goods myself, and therefore I have not had them under my eyes—when a servant buys goods of us they are certainly entered to him—it is never entered to ready money, or chance if we know the name—I am a wholesale dealer, but we sometimes have chance customers—some persons may not wish their names known—our foreman would not enter it to chance if he sold it to any of our men—I have not made any alteration in my business in regard to the tickets, but I still have the terms "ready-money" and "chance"—if the foreman sold goods and forgot to whom, it would come under the head of "ready-money" or "chance"—I should cer<lb></lb>tainly not enter it to chance myself, if I knew the name of my customer—it is rather difficult to answer the question whether one of these pieces is a job lot—I don't know what you mean by a job lot—a job lot would be a lot of remnants that would be sold under their value, because they would not be long enough for ordinary use, and would be unsaleable, and would be sold cheap in consequence—it is very possible this might come under that—it de<lb></lb>pends upon whether we have any more of it—if we have any more of this in stock it would not be a job lot—I do not know whether it was or not.</p>

Q.</hi> How long have you had those chintz patters in use; I don't mean those particular ones, but chintz patterns of that character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Seven years—they are used for sending out to customers—I sometimes give away patterns of that kind to men in our employment—that has been done during the last six or seven years; during which the prisoner has been there—chintz patterns resemble one another—I know how long a pattern has been in use by looking at it—I cannot tell without the book—we did not go into that branch of the trade till seven years ago, and these could not have been in use before that—I never personally gave these particular patterns to the prisoner at the bar—I was examined before Mr. Alderman Challis—I cannot undertake to say that I have not given away those patterns to any other person in the employment—this first pattern has been in my master's service three years—I cannot undertake to say that during those three years I have not given that particular pattern to the prisoner, because I do not recollect—I have no recollection of doing so—I am not in the habit of doing it—I cannot say that I have not given it to him—I have a discretion to give away whatever I think is waste in my department—my judgment and honesty are relied on as to what is waste—when the patterns become useless to us we cease to keep them.</p>

               <p>two pieces that are dyed—I cannot tell whether each carpet warehouseman says that his piece is a special carpet—this drugget is half-width—our men have an opportunity of buying drugget when they require it, and cutting it up as they please—I can explain how I know that this piece has not been sold; the other half was exposed in our case that we had in the Exhibition, and it is now in our warehouse—I have taken this and compared it with the other piece—we do not sell half-widths—a piece was cut up in half-widths for the case we had in the Exhibition, and this is the other half—this is the half that was compared—I compared it two or three days ago—I compared it before the committal—we compared it with our duplicate in the pattern-book—we did not compare it with the article itself before we went to the Magistrate, only with the duplicate—I know that this particular piece has not been sold, because we never sell half-widths; we never have them in our establishment—when druggets are purchased of course they may be cut as they are required.</p>

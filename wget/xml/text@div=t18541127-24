                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live at Shaftsbury-terrace, Pimlico. On Wednesday, 8th Nov., about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, Young came for some grocery, and paid me a bad shilling—I gave it her back, and said it was bad—she said, she thought it was good—I took it again from her, and put it in my mouth, and it bent easily—I returned it to her, and she left the shop, taking the shilling with her—I saw her turn the corner, and I went through my warehouse and followed her—I saw her join Lynch—I followed them still, and they went to a public house, I believe the Warwick Arms, in Pimlico—Young went into the house, and Lynch sat on a door step very near the house—I flaw Young come out, and join Lynch—I went into the public house, and spoke to the barman—I afterwards saw the two prisoners in Charlton-street; Young was in a baker's shop, and Lynch was waiting opposite—Young came out, and joined Lynch again—I had a police<lb></lb>man behind me and we followed, and took them into custody.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 15th of September, I was in Long's-court, St. Martin's-lane, and saw the prisoner go into the shop of a dealer in marine stores, followed him, and asked what was under his jacket; he said it was nothing to me. I said I was an officer, and insisted on knowing - he then said it was a bottle of white brandy, which he bought of a man in the street for 3 s. I took him to his master, and asked Sayce if he allowed him to carry away spirits - he said No, and that he had suspected him for two years. I went to his lodgings, and found six more bottles, and 6 lbs. of candles, which he said he had bought at different times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He told you at once, who his master was - A. Yes. The bottles found at his house contained spirits.</p>

            . The prisoner was two years in their service - he was brought to me by Yates, with a bottle of white brandy - we had some of that description in use; only two or three bottles had been drawn as samples three or four hours before. He was employed in that part of the warehouse where the cask lay. I believe it to be my master's - the candles found at his lodgings are such as we use in the cellar - they are made for that purpose - he was never allowed to take spirits.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not always at home, I sup pose - A. No. I have no mark on the bottle - my master took him into his service in consequence of his distress - it is common brandy - he might have bought the candles.</p>

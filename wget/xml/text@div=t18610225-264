On the morning of 6th February I law Lillicrap struggling with the male prisoner about a quarter past 3 o'clock—the female prisoner had got hold of him by his arms, trying to force his arms from the male prisoner—the constable at that time was bleeding very much from the mouth—I took hold of the male prisoner and asked him to come with me—the constable said, "They have dropped something down the street"—the female prisoner then said, "No, it was not him dropped it, it was me dropped it"—I took the prisoners down the street some way, and found this corduroy some way down on the ground—I afterwards went to Mr. Grange's</p>

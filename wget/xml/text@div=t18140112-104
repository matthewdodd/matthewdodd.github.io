On the the 4th of December, in the evening, the prisoner knocked at the door; I opened the door to him. He said, he came from Mr. Hares, a hatter, in the Strand, for a hat to be made larger; I asked him who the person was; he said, a young gentleman, a slim young man. We had a young gentleman in the house of that description lodged and boarded in the house. I told him he could not see the gentleman, he was at dinner; he had better call in a quarter of an hour. The prisoner then particularly desired to take the hat back with him; in consequence of that I asked the prisoner to come in, and said I would inform the gentleman of it; I went into the back parlour, and when I returned the street door was a little way open; I asked him if any body had gone out; he said, no, the door opened of itself. I shut the door, left him in the passage, and went down stairs. When I came up the prisoner was gone, and likewise four great coats and a hat were gone; the four great coats were in the passage when the prisoner was there. I went in the parlour and informed the gentleman of it; the gentleman went in pursuit of him, and could not find him. The coats and the hat have never been found.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. On Sunday morning following. The 4th of December was on Saturday. Oddy, a Bow-street officer, asked me to go to the Park with him, and the first person I saw was the prisoner, I knew him by his dress, and features; no person pointed him out to me; there was a number of other people looking at the soldiers. I am quite sure the man I picked out in the park is the man. I asked the prisoner if he knew me; he said, no. I told him I knew him; I saw him at No. 19, Adam-street, Adelphi, and that he then said, he came from Mr. Hare in the Strand, for a hat to be made larger; he said it could not be him. I laid hold of him, and Oddy came and secured him.</p>
               <p>ABIGAIL MILLER. I live at No. 2, Michael-grove, Brompton. The prisoner is my son; he lives with me; he is a carpenter. On Saturday he had been at work at Vauxhall-bridge; he was discharged from there that evening, and brought his tools home about twenty minutes past five o'clock; he drank his tea with me; a person here came in the shop, and saw him drink his tea with me; her name is

               <p>Q. What time did he leave you to go for the basket -

            About ten minutes before six; he immediately returned with the basket. He set out again about five minutes before six o'clock; when he set out with the basket of things to his brother my watch hung up; I noticed the time; and when he returned home it was about half past nine. I am sure this was on Saturday the 4th of December. On Monday I heard my son was taken up.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street office. On the 29th of November I saw the two prisoners Blenhim and Welch at Mr. Parker's shop window. I perceived Blenhim moving his hand close to the glass; Blenhim and Welch were close together. I saw the motion of Blenhim's hand as if he was cutting the putty from glass. They both went away from the window, and then all the three prisoners got together, and just at the end of the shop window they were conversing together. Then the prisoners Welch and Blenhim left Werrall and went to the window again. I saw Blenhim in the same act as before stated. They both left the window again, and the three prisoners got into conversation at the window again; during the time a cart was going by the door. The prisoner Welch went to the glass, and pushed the glass in; he returned back to the other two, and said I have done it. The two prisoners Blenhim and Welch came to the other window, and Werrall crossed over the way. I saw Blenhim put his hand into the hole in the glass; he took his hand out, and removed half way up to the front of the window; he returned to Welch at the other window. I saw the prisoner Blenhim put his hand in again; the prisoner Welch stood at his right; there was a whistle from the other side of the way; they were making off with them. I took them into custody. I searched Blenhim, and found a knife on him, a tobacco box and a tobacco stopper.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw Blenhim and Welch where was Werrall then - A. At first he was standing two doors off.</p>

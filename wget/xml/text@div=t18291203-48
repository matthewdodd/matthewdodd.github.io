I had reason to suppose he removed some of the looking-glassed from my premises, and I got an officer to watch him - these glasses are mine; I saw them in a dark corner, under a staircase, in some workshops of mine in Little Vine-street, in a sack, covered with some hay and shavings, and I marked them - I have not the least doubt they are mine, and I have missed articles of this description; he has been with me five years.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CORNELIUS MOORE. I am in the service of Mr. Stubbs, a blind-maker - he has a workshop in Vine-street, over the prosecutor's. On the 4th of November I heard a noise in the workshop, and saw the prisoner bring in a sack and put it under the stairs - I went and told Mr. Cooper, who came and found these five looking-glasses in it; this was about seven o'clock in the morning, and about a quarter-past nine the prisoner came and took the same sack away - I followed him into he street, and then went and told the Police-officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOWLING. Q. Had you seen him before? A. Yes, and had spoken to him - I asked him the price of putting a glass in a frame which I had; he said he would put it in as cheap as any body.</p>

I took the prisoner in Regent-circus with these glasses in the sack - he wanted to know what I wanted him for; I said there was a person in Vine-street who wanted to see what he had got - he bounced a good deal, and said I should get into trouble by taking him, he was a respectable person.</p>

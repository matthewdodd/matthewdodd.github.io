There were frequently complaints of losing oil; I requested liberty to put mine in a yard, it was granted me. I went on for six or eight days, the oil was safe untill the 16th of last month; I put my oil in the yard as usual and went to work, and when I came back I found that almost all the oil was taken away; I asked the servant maid if any body had been there; she said, yes, a man had been there, he said he came from me, he was going to help me to work. I never saw the prisoner before I saw him at Marlborough-street office.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Porter leaving his oil there - A. Yes. The prisoner came in with a stone bottle on the 16th of last month between ten and eleven; I was washing my pots out.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew him before, did not you - A. Yes; I knew his father and mother; he took the oil out of the man's tin cann, put it into his stone bottle, and went away with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wood-carver, of 43, Singleton-street, Hoxton—this is my child; her name is Charlotte Louisa Russell—she is five years and seven months old—the prisoner has been in my employment nearly six years as <hi rend="italic">papering-up</hi> boy—on 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi> October, about 10 o'clock in the morning, he said, "It is my sister's birthday to-day"—I said, "Which one?"—he said, "The little one"—I said, "How old is she to-day?"—he said, "Ten years"—in the course of the day he said that there was to be a tea-party at his mother's—he did not exactly ask me, but I understood that my child was to go—she was to be taken there when he went to his own tea, and he was to return at his half-hour, and leave her at his mother's, which is about five minutes' walk off—she went away between 4 and half-past—he waited while some of her clothes were put on to make her smart—I next saw her about half-past 9; she was brought to me by two young men, Chapman and Tooke, wrapped up in a man's flannel shirt and Tooke's coat—her own clothes were in a bundle, and were ringing wet and dirty—I afterwards went with Chapman and Tooke to a ditch near the railway, in Hackney-marshes—there was about eighteen inches of water and eighteen inches of soft mud; it was about eight feet broad on the surface of the water—I put a stick in and tried the depth—that was at the place to which my attention was directed, and where the plank was pointed out to me by which they got across to get the child.</p>

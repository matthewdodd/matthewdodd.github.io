On the 27th of February, about half-past nine o'clock at night, I was at work in my shop, and heard glass break; I jumped up immediately, and seeing a hand in my window, taking watches, I called Stop thief! four watches hung together - two of them were dropped; the prisoner was secured in less than a minute and a half, without getting out of my sight - I saw him drop one watch, and saw the other found in the knee of his trousers; the other two were picked up outside the window; he looked me hard in the face, and said he had done nothing - at that time I saw him shoving the watch down his knee. Here are the watches - they are mine, and worth 23l. - they were all safe just before, and the window quite whole; the one found upon him is worth 9l. 7s.</p>

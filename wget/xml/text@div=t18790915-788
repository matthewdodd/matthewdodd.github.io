                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Ridley, of 1, Finlay Court, Old Street, St. Luke's—the prisoner and his wife lived at 134, Old Street, immediately opposite—from my window I could see half of their room; my room is on the second floor, and so is theirs—the width of the street is about four yards—on Monday, 18th August, at 1.15, I was at my window; it was open, and so was the prisoner's; I could see the dinner on the table in his room—I saw him take a chair and sit down at the table; his wife was standing in front of him—I heard them quarrelling, but could not hear what they said—after they had been quarrelling some little time I saw the prisoner strike his wife in the face with his open hand, one blow—she ran towards the window—he struck her again three or four times in the face and head with his fist and his open hand—she did nothing in return—he then picked up this piece of wood (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the side of the fireplace, ana jobbed her with it three or lour times in the side—she then picked a plate off the table and threw at him; it did not hit him; it struck the window-ledge—she said "I don't care a b—; you brute, you are slowly murdering me"—I halloed to him from the window, "You brutal fellow, why do you illtreat the. woman like that"—then he threw the wood down and struck her again with his hand—she reeled on one side, and then he shut the window and looked over the top of the curtain, and I could not see any more—the neigh<lb></lb>bours were all out at their doors by this time, hearing the noise—at 20 minutes to 3 the prisoner came out—I had seen the deceased go in with the dinner at about 10 minutes to 12; she appeared to be quite sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was up at my window then—I did not speak to her—I could only see half across the room; I have not been in the room since—the fireplace was in the middle of the room opposite the window—I could see the fireplace; I saw the prisoner stoop and pick up the piece of wood from the floor—the deceased had not moved when he first</p>

I am a rag merchant and furniture dealer, and am landlord of the house where the prisoner lives—on Monday evening, 18th August, between 7 and 8, I saw the prisoner come up the court from the house—I did not see him again that evening.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see his wife that day—she was a very drunken woman; she was nearly always so during the four weeks she was my tenant—the prisoner used to go out to his work in the morning, and she used to go out afterwards and get drunk, and then come home and lis about; that was her usual habit—he was a very regular man—I never saw him the worse for drink.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi>). On 20th August I went with Sergeant Canham to 134, Old Street, to the second-floor back room occupied by the prisoner and his wife—I found this piece of wood behind the door in the bedroom—that same night I searched for the prisoner, and found him in bed at 41, Baldwin Street—I asked what his name was—he said Gibson—I said I should take him into custody on suspicion of murdering his wife—he said, "I never murdered her; all the injuries she has received she got by falling about; I have got my subpoena to attend the inquest to-morrow morning; you might as well let me have my sleep out, for I should have been there; she was a very drunken woman, and it is a very bad job"—I had known her for several years as a drunken, dissi<lb></lb>pated woman—she had been convicted several times of pot-stealing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She had only been out about five weeks; she had 21 days for having a quantity of melted pewter in her possession—I have seen her very drunk; I have not seen her in fits—she was rather decrepid in the feet—she was about 45 or 50 years of age—the room where I found the prisoner was his son's room.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector G</hi>). On 22nd August I went to Mrs. Ridley's room, and from her window could see into the prisoner's room, as she has stated—I then went to the prisoner's room—I saw on the ceiling a black mark, such as would be produced by this piece of charred wood—I found three pieces of a broken plate there—I had known the deceased as a woman of drunken, dissipated habits. Eugene Yarrow. I am surgeon to the G Division of Police, and live at 87, Old Street Road—on 18th August, about a quarter past 9, I was called by the prisoner and another man to 134, Old Street—the prisoner said his wife was very ill, and would I come and see her—I asked him if she was sober—he said "She is very ill, and I think getting cold"—I went and found her lying on the mattress, dead—in my opinion she had been dead four, five, or six hours; the extremities were quite cold—she was about 52 or 53 years of age—I made post-mortem examination—the cause of death was effusion of blood on the brain, the result of a blow or an injury to the head—there was a contused wound right on the top of the head—this piece of wood would produce such a wound—she appeared to have been lifted on to the bed from the clothes being disordered, and from the huddled manner in which the body lay—the prisoner went up into the room with me—I said to him, "She is dead"—he said "You don't mean to say she has gone to her last home," and he lifted the body up, put his arms round her, and called out "Lizzie dear"—I asked him when he last saw her alive—he said at dinner-time—I said "Where did you leave her?"—he said "Where she is now"—I asked if she had been</p>

               <p>drinking—he said "I do not know; we had a few words, and both lost our temper"—he was slightly under the influence of drik—he came to me next morning, and asked if I could give him a certificate—I told him there would have to be an inquest, and that I had informed the Coroner's officer—on the post-mortem I found a great number of bruises in different parts of the body; the most recent was a very large one on the right side of the abdomen, by the side of the navel, about as large as the top of a teacup—it is not impossible that a fall might have caused the wound on the head—there was an iron bedstead in the room; if she had fallen head foremost against that it might have caused it—I had known her for some years as a drunken woman—I have attended her at the police station when drunk, and I was once called to her in the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been called to her by the police on many occasions—I never attended her for fits—I have seen her when she was said to be in fits, but they were fits of drunkenness—the cause of death was apoplexy, or effusion of blood—that does sometimes occur without any external injury—there was no outward wound; the contusion was under the skin, only visible when the scalp was removed—drunkenness would be a predisposing cause to the effusion.</p>

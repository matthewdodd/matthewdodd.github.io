I opened the shop-door, and saw that the skylight was thrown wide open, and the shop ladder was placed against the glass inside so that a person could get up—the blinds were pulled down, and a large quantity of ribbon rollers were lying on the ground, and the ribbon removed. I informed Mr. Priest.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is captain of a sailing barge—we live at Bankside—I know Ballard and his mother—I remember his being taken in custody—it was on the 12th—on the evening before that, Monday, he was with me at 8 o'clock, very tipsy—he had been so from the Friday before—he remained in the house till 8 on the next morning—I left him asleep in my husband's arm-chair between 9 and 10 o'clock on Monday evening, and found him there asleep when I came down next morning.</p>

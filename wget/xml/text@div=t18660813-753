                  </hi>. I am a commercial clerk, and live at 20, King William Street, City—on the 7th August I had been in the "Alfred's Head" public-house, at Newington—when I got home that night I missed my spectacles, a walking-stick, and four pawn tickets—the spectacles were in my waistcoat pocket, and the pawn tickets in my trousers pocket—I noticed at the time my trousers pockets were turned out—I was drunk—I remember being thrown down in the street, I don't know by whom—I re<lb></lb>member four parties in the dark—I had some money in my waistcoat pocket that was not taken—I recollect being at the station-house before I went home—I walked home and I walked to the station-house all right.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, New Street, New Kent Road—I am a gilder—about twenty minutes to twelve on the night of the 7th August I saw the prisoners and two other men with the prosecutor in the New Kent Road—the other two had got hold of his arm—the prisoners were behind, about a couple of yards—the two men not here knocked the prosecutor down, and picked him up again—they took him round the corner—I ran round the corner and saw the prosecutor come out with his pockets out—the prisoners were then at the time in the road—I was about two yards away from him—I was sitting down along with my mate, talking together, on the other side of the road—the road was not more than two yards wide.</p>

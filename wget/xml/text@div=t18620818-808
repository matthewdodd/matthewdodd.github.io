                  </hi>. I am a carman in the service of Messrs. Shoolbred, and live at 9, Huntley-street, Tottenham-court-road—on Sunday, 13th July, about 11 o'clock in the evening, I was at the end of Cannon-street—I saw the prisoner there, driving a Hansom's cab—he struck me across the face with the thong end of the whip—I let go my wife, who was on my arm, and caught him why the leg of his trousers and the stock of his whip behind, and asked him why he struck me—he made use of some foul expression, and said, why did not I get out of the way—I said, "My dear fellow, I was not in your way in the least; you neither had to pull your horse up, nor on one side, for me,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186208180015"></xptr>
               <p>and why did you strike me?"—he said, "Let me go, or I will kick your brains out"—I said, "I will if you promise not to strike me again"—some bystander said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> why don't you keep your whip still? the man has no wish to detain you"—I said that I had not, if he promised not to strike me again—with that I let go, thinking he would go about his business—he then turned round and struck me three or four times across my head; but, baring my head down, it did not hurt me—I made a dart at him to catch him again—he then thrust his whip back into my eye, and drove away over the bridge—I did not notice Burns at that time; there were several persons round—I followed the cab after that, nearly down to the dark arches at the Fresh-wharf, calling out, "Stop that cab"—I was then so exhausted that I stopped—the sight of my eye is quite gone—the prisoner is the man—I have not the least doubt of it, if I had he would have had the benefit of it long ago—this happened right opposite the Ring William statue, where there were five or six lights burning—I saw the prisoner next when he was brought out from his house; I do not know the date—I went with the policeman and Burns—I waited outside with Burns, about 200 yards away, in the same street or terrace—the policeman came out with one man first, and then came out again with two men—he did not bring out the prisoner there—the two men were brought out of the yard where the cabs stand—we then went across Primrose-hill to the prisoner's private house—the policeman went in—Burns and I stayed some 200 yards away from the house—we remained till the policeman came out with the prisoner—I at once identified him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 22, Acorn-street, Bishopsgate-street—on Sunday evening, 13th July, I was at the end of Cannon-street, near the King William statue—I saw the prisoner there, and the prosecutor holding him by the leg and his whip—the prisoner was driving a Hansom's cab—he said, "If you don't let go, I will kick your brains out"—he then took the whip deliberately and shoved it in his eye—I was close to him—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man—after that the cab drove off, and I fol<lb></lb>lowed it nearly half-way over London-bridge, when I was obliged to give over—I was not able to take the number; he kept whipping me—I then returned to where this happened—in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes he came back; somebody struck me with a whip, which made me look, up sharp, and I recognized the same man—I followed him; and he got down off his cab and kicked me in the ribs—he said, "I will give it to you for following me"—a policeman was then coming up St. Martin's-lane, Cannon-street, and he went off—he was twenty yards off of his cab; that was the reason I could not have the number—he ran back, got on to his</p>

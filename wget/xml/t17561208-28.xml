            . I was absent about ten minutes; when I return'd home the prisoner was apprehended. She hearing I was the master of the house, desir'd I'd let her go, and said she would never do so any more.</p>
               <p>Q. What was she charg'd with?</p>
               <p>Brooks. The sheet was found with the prisoner, who was charg'd with stealing of it. I was with her before the justice, where she own'd she had taken the sheet.</p>
               <p>Ustretia Mathews. I am servant to the prosecutor; I had been washing on the 5th of November backwards. I had hung a sheet upon the line. I open'd the back-door and saw the prisoner going out. I look'd and missed the sheet from off the line. I made after her, took hold on her, and she had got it; she said she'd never do so any more if I'd forgive her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the justice?</p>
               <p>U. Mathews. I was there, I heard her confess she took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property was it?</p>
               <p>U. Mathews. It was my master's property.</p>

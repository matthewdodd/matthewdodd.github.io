                  </hi>.

DUN<lb></lb>KIN, "</hi> are not my writing, nor my father's, or any one of our firm—the Com<lb></lb>missioners decided in the prisoner's favour, and I gave him into custody immediately after—the Magistrate accepted bail for the prisoner, and as he came out of the Court, he came up to me, and said, "I an very sorry, but I had had a drop too much aft the time"—I said, "I have nothing whatever to say," and pointing to my solicitor, said, "What you say must he said to my solicitor."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Had you told him before the 3rd of Nov. that you heard there was to be an officer to take him if he came there with that receipt again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had the receipt in my possession all the time—I had told him that when I went to serve the order of nisi, I told him a policeman had been waiting the whole day to take him—I was present before the Commissioners on the 6th of Oct. and 3rd of Nov.—several Commissioners said they con<lb></lb>sidered the debt barred by the statute of limitations—he said he would not take that objection, but insisted on proving his receipt—I think the pri<lb></lb>soner made that observation on both occasions—it was at the first occasion he said he should not take advantage of it—Mr. Dunkin applied to have the receipt impounded at the first and last hearing—the Commissioners said they thought it was the property of the prisoner, and they must give it up—the prisoner said he was quite willing it should remain in the hands of the chairman—I have lived fifty years in the neighbourhood—I have known the prisoner twelve or fourteen years—I never heard anything against him—I knew him to be a poor man, but never heard anything against his honesty.</p>

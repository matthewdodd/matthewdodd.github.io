I am assistant to a pawnbroker—on the night of 8th December I was walking along Bishopsgate-street—the prisoner came up to me and caught me by the arm as I was crossing Liverpool-street, and said, "Young man, I want to speak to you, I have just come from Australia, and I have got an Australian ring in my pocket, I am hard up and must have some money; "at the same time he said, "I have a silver chain, (pulling it off his neck,) and I can sell the two to you for a pound—directly he put the ring into my hand I saw that it was spurious, and then found the chain to be so too—he said, "Come a little further down, the b----bobbies Are continually watching me about here"—I said, "Is the ring gold?"—he said, "Yes, real Australian gold"—I said, "Is the chain silver?"—he said, "Yes, it is"—I said, "Well then you come along with me"—he said, "What are you going to do? can't I get an honest living; mind, I only asked you a crown for them"—I said, "Never mind, come along with me"—I saw a constable, told him what had happened, and gave the prisoner in custody—at the station-house he said at first he only asked a crown, that he was a dealer in these kind of goods, and bought them down "the lane;" and that all Jews down the lane sold them for gold, and then he said when he asked me a pound of course he did not expect to get it; he expected a few shillings less—he also said, "It is all right what has been said, the articles are not right"—he said the ring was not gold, nor the chain silver—I have</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of the Customs, and was on board the Thames East-Indiaman, laden with tea, laying at <placeName id="t18030706-54-crimeloc313">Blackwall</placeName>

               <p>THOMAS STEVENSON sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the East-India Company, and am a City constable; my duty is to inspect the lighters; I know the place where the Thames lay moored head and stern at Blackwall, and am sure it was on the Middlesex side, and the Hannah too; I saw her when she went to load the cargo, about two days before, and know she was found, no planks had started, and she hatchways were safe; when she came back to the quay, I saw that two boards had been broken off the foremost hatch; the prisoner is a lighterman, employed by Mr. Bryan, and had the Montreal lighter, employed there at the same time, but his duty was to come up with the Montreal; he had nothing to do with the Hannah.(Ralph Carr confirmed the testimony of Williams.)</p>

             sworn. - I am the East-India Company's surveyor; I saw the bags on board the Hannah; the tea in them was of the same quality as that on board the Thames, and the Hannah, value about three or four and twenty pounds; I saw two empty chests, and some tea scattered upon the floor.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Is it not customary if a chest breaks in the unloading, to put it in bags? - A. Yes; but they are different bags from those.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you find Skinner and Knife there, who belonged to the Hannah? - A. The lad, Knife, spoke out of the cabin; the Company's bags are always numbered; these bags appear to be the King's bread bags. (The tea and bags produced.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Monday, the 6th of June, I went to Blackwall with Davidson to load the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180307060035"></xptr>Montreal lighter; I went ashore, and got very much in liquor; Davidson told me he would shove the lighter off, and come for me to go away with the side; I went to sleep, but he never came; I went to the place where he appointed to haul the lighter to, but she was not there; I then went to the place where she was before, and going over the Hannah, I fell down the hold, being in liquor; as soon as I found myself, I got up as well as I could; then they came, and asked me how I came there; I told them I was in liquor, and fell down.</p>

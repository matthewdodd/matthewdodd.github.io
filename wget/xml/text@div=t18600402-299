I am a painter, and live in Davis-place, Cremorne-road, Chelsea—I did reside at 1, Winterton-place, Park-walk, Chelsea, for 16 or 17 years—in 1852 proceedings by ejectment were token against me by the prisoner—in consequence of something that transpired the proceedings stood over until October, 1859—the ejectment was then tried and a verdict was given for the lessor of the plaintiff—execution was stayed—the prisoner afterwards distrained upon me for the 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I replevined and got a verdict in my favour—I afterwards proceeded to serve a copy of the rule on the prisoner—on Saturday, 4th February, I went with Mr. Hempson to serve the prisoner with a piece of paper—there was no one with us—I saw the prisoner in the ground adjoining the house—the gate was open and we walked in, and Mr. Hempson gave him the piece of paper—I was close by him at the time—the back-door of the house that I had lived in so many years was open, and I walked into the house; and as soon as I got into the house the prisoner caught hold of me and struck me against the door-jamb, and shut the door and jammed me between the door and the jamb; he squeezed me so that I was hardly able to speak; at last I halloed out "Murder"—I thought I must have died in the place, my breath was taken away—I halloed out</p>

Willis and Willis—I did not know who they were—I employed an attorney afterwards—I heard from him that the Sheriff had given the prisoner possession—Hempson had some paper to serve on 4th February—I went to see it served, and as the gate was open I walked in—I did not consider they were the prisoner's premises—I did not know he was legally in possession—he had not been there from the 12th of the previous January—I believe he said once that he was not in possession, that Miss Calvert was—I do not know whether he was keeping the house for Miss Calvert—I saw him there in the yard—I do not know that he was in posses<lb></lb>sion from January 12th—I had not been to the house in the interval—I passed by sometimes four or five times a day; it was my business—I did not see the prisoner there all that time—I have seen him there sometimes when I have been going to my work at 6 in the morning—I had never been in the house after my goods were turned out till the day I went with Hempson—I went because part of my property was in the house; some lead pipe—I was told that Beeston had taken the lead pipe off my butt, my butt was turned out and the taps were gone, and I was told that Beeston took it off; and I went to see whether my dresser and shelves and fixtures were there—I went to see if my things were in the house—I thought as the door was open there was no harm in going to see if my things were there—I did not see Humphreys till he pushed me in at the door and released me—I was in the doorway before the prisoner—I never heard the prisoner call out that I had no business there, and tell me to go away—he did not go to the back-door after Hempson had given him the paper—I did not rush after him and try to force myself in—when I was jammed between the door and door-post I was not trying to force myself in, I would have cot out if I could—I said "For God's sake don't kill me"—I could not get either one way or the other; I had no more power than a child; I was not trying to force myself into the house—I was going in when he jammed me in the door—I</p>

               <p>have never sworn that went there because Hempson proposed to put me in possession of the premises—did not swear that in an affidavit at the Judges Chambers—did not hear Hempson call Humphreys to my assistance—Humphreys pushed open the door and pushed me in, and he went in with me and remained with me till the police came—the police were present when was put out—went to the Westminster police-court for a summons in this matter—Mr. Paynter, the magistrate, did not refuse the summons, it was granted—I believe, the magistrate stated that he was satisfied that the prisoner was perfectly justified—Mr. Hempson and I were bound over in our recognisances to appear at the Middlesex Sessions, and also Boud, Campbell and Dyer; and two of them were not in the house at all—I was tried at the last Middlesex Sessions with Hempson, for riot and assault, and was found guilty—I am now under recognisance to come up for judgment when called upon—I then came here and got this bill found—the Magistrate did not commit the prisoner or hold him to bail, because he stated a false case—I made no forcible entry, and did not wish it—l do not know whether Chapman, Campbell and Dyer were seen about the place in the course of the day before went there; did not meet any of them before went there—I was not at the Goat and Boots that morning, and did not see any of these men there—was at the Goat and Boots at near 4 o'clock, and this occurred about five minutes afterwards—all these men are friends of mine—I saw Campbell come in when I was in the passage hallooing out "Murder"—Boud was not in the house; I never saw Boud until he came in stripped to his shirt sleeves and was going to knock me over the banisters—have indicted Boud for hitting me—it was Boud's wife that gave me the cup of tea—Boud struck me when was being taken out—I resisted being taken out—they hurt me so much hardly knew what I was about—I don't know whether I kicked and put my feet against the door; I only resisted when they hurt me, when they were knocking me about in the passage, they would not let any one come to my assistance; I do not know how many of my friends were collected outside—almost everybody in the neighbourhood knows me, having lived there so many years—I did not hear any one shouting to me to keep in—I am called "the <hi rend="italic">Don</hi>” I do not know why; it is a <hi rend="italic">nick name</hi>—did not hear the mob shout out "Now, <hi rend="italic">Don</hi>, you are in keep in; don't let them turn you out"—I did not see Boud come down stairs and go out at the front door for the police—I saw him when he came in—Campbell and the others came in to my assistance on my hallooing "Murder"—I was not engaged in my ordinary occupation the next day; I was not out of my bed from the Saturday till Monday when I went to the police-court, I "laid in bed all Sunday—I was at a public house the same evening but could not stop long, I was obliged to go home and go to bed—I live at a little cottage belonging to the King's Arms—I did not go to the King's Arms that night.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having obtained a rule, did you go with Mr. Bikher to serve a copy of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—I served a copy of that order on the attorney, and then the case remained until the 12th January following before I heard anything further about the order—I then found that a judgment had been signed—an application was then made to the court to set aside the judgment: it was set aside on 31st January, and this rule made. (<hi rend="italic">This being read, ordered judgment to be signed and all sub<lb></lb>sequent proceedings to be set aside for irregularity</hi>)—After that on 4th February, I met Bikher—I took no one else with me; I had employed no one else—I went by appointment to meet him, and we went to the premises—the dustman was there taking out the dust; Beeston was in the ground—I walked in and served him with a copy of that rule—I then turned round to come out the way I went in, and when I got very near to the door, I heard a cry of "Murderw"—it was near the gate, near the window—it is a gate in the grounds—in consequence of that, I turned back to the back-door of the cottage—I there saw Mr. Bikher and the defendant jamming him against the door-post, between the door and the door-post, just inside the place—I could see the prisoner, ho was pressing the door against him, and swore he should not come in there—Bikher appeared in much pain—a man of the name of Humphreys came almost immediately, and pressed against the door and Mr. Bikher went inside—I came away directly—I never went inside the door at all—I immediately turned away and went home—when I was taken before the Sessions court, Bikher and others who were witnesses for me, were pri<lb></lb>soners with me, so that I had no witnesses to call—Humphreys was the only person, and I did not know him; he was a stranger to me—I never saw him before.</p>

               <p>whether even spoke to him—I would not swear positively did not—he came up to the door and said something—I did not see Humphreys push Bikher in; he came to the door—I went right away home—I went from the door—he was between the door and the gate—I heard him cry out, "I am in"—I think the action of ejectment was tried last July—I bad nothing to do with it—I am aware that there was a verdict for Beeston as the executor of Mrs. Wilby—that verdict does not still stand<lb></lb>there was an action brought for trespass—the order made by Mr. Baron Martin set the whole of it aside—after the verdict has been obtained in the ejectment, he stayed the execution that gave Bikher the opportunity of applying to the Court in the following term—in the Interim they seized the goods of Bikher for the alleged sum of 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for rent—that was reple<lb></lb>vined, and an act on was brought for the trespass; that came on, on the second day of term, before Mr. Baron Martin, after he had heard the case for the plaintiff, the defendant's counsel said he was not going to call any witnesses—Mr. Baron Martin then said if so he should direct the Jury to find a verdict for Bikher, with such reasonable damages as he had sustained, but he suggested that it would be best to let this verdict determine the two actions, and, if not, he should take care the verdict did not stand n the ejectment, and he postponed the trial till the 21st—on the 21st Beeston's counsel went on the case, and after the defendant's case was closed the arrangement there stated was come to—I have the briefs signed by both counsel, and that verdict was set aside—Beeston did not, after he had established his right by the act on of ejectment, distrain for rent—that was long before the act on commenced, I think as long ago as 1852; then he distrained for 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and an act on for trespass was brought against him for an illegal distress—he knew there was no contract, and no rent was due—Bikher said,"I am not tenant, and therefore you have no right to dis<lb></lb>train"—when the act on for the illegal distress came on for trial, Mr. Baron Martin suggested that there should be a settlement of the whole matter, and a juror was withdrawn, and no verdict given—Miss Ann Elizabeth Calvert is not the person interested in the property—she is no relation to Beeston—I do not know whether Beeston sued n the character of her trustee—I had nothing to do with that—Mr. Baron Martin said that Miss Calvert was the only person that he saw who had a right to the property—the mother had died—the order was drawn up that Bikher should give possess on in a fortnight—do not know whether Beeston always appeared as Miss Calvert's trustee—I hadnothing to do with the ejectment—Nicholson and Clark were thesolicitors for the ejectment—possess was not given up at the end of the fortnight.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>not swear I did not; I have no doubt I did say that he wanted help—I was at the police-court, and was held on my recognisances to appear and take my trial at the Middlesex sessions, and the Magistrate ordered Beeston to be held to bail to answer the charge of assault—I and Bikher and the others were bound over; Beeston was not, on that occasion—I did not mean to say that he was bound over to answer any charge at the sessions—I was convicted of a forcible entry, and am now under recognisance to come up for judgment—I came here and preferred this indictment in the regular way, and the defendant was taken into custody ten days ago—I made inquiry about his bail—I did not go and talk to them in such a way as to prevent their becoming bail for him.</p>

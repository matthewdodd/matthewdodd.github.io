               <p>Had the bottles any seals? - The bottles, several of them, were marked at the bottom with two dots, white spots, and likewise<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100079"></xptr>the red wine was sealed with a black seal, with St. John of Jerusalem upon it; it was not my seal, it was the seal of Mr. Mendham; I cannot say as to that mark, it came from the Jerusalem tavern; I cannot swear to the bottles, because they came from a wine-merchant, and there are others marked the same; I asked her how she could account for having the brandy particularly; I said to her, I made no doubt but it was mine; she said, there was an accident happened in the bar; there are casks in the bar, for convenience; and she said, that in the night there was an accident, and it was spilt on the floor, and the bar-maid gave her leave to take it up; she said, she took the soap from the Angel-inn at Islington, which belongs to me; she was one of the servants that went there to wash the linen; but it is more than twelve months ago since she went to the Angel; she said, she brought the soap from the Angel, for the purpose of washing her own linen, but she had had no occasion to do that, for her linen was washed with the other cloaths.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Mr. Bartholomew, you keep the White-conduit-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had this young woman lived in your service? - Very near three years.</p>
               <p>Do you know from whom she came to you? - I hired her at Waltham statute, and I had a very good character of her from a farm-house.</p>
               <p>She is an Essex girl? - I have heard her say so.</p>
               <p>She was in the capacity of a dairymaid? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You at the White-conduit-house, I understand, I have not the happiness of knowing much of the house, I wish I knew more from the appearance of the master, you make a great many syllabubs? - A great many.</p>
               <p>Is it a common thing for gentlemen, who wish to indulge themselves, to carry their own wine to make syllabubs? - It has been desired, and therefore a prohibition was made.</p>

               <p>Now if there is a prohibition, that shews it has been done; things are never prohibited that are never committed, but as a smuggler throws a tub of liquor to an officer, so if the dairy-maid now and then makes a syllabub, is it not a common thing to give the wine that is left to the dairymaid? - I never knew it.</p>
               <p>We know that at all taverns the waiters sweep away the dead men, and some of the living among them; your business is very much conducted by a lady of the name of Wagner? - She is the bar-maid.</p>
               <p>She is related to you? - No; I have a sister; Miss Wagner's mother is my housekeeper at the Angel; I discharged the prisoner, and took a receipt for her wages.</p>
               <p>Did she desire the ladies to examine her boxes? - I had no reason to suspect this woman, I heard nothing of it.</p>
               <p>She desired, however, that her box, instead of going away with her, might remain there till the next day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She took a lodging close by your house instead of coming to London and quitting the neighbourhood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She was preparing to reside there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At what time did you understand her box had been fetched away? - I believe I returned about twelve and it was gone.</p>
               <p>At what time did you go with the search warrant? - That was two hours after.</p>
               <p>The sheet had your mark unaltered? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The corks of the wine had the seals still remaining unaltered? - Some of them, one had been drawn, but several of them had never been drawn.</p>
               <p>Have you the same cook in your service which you had when she quitted you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know whether that cook and the prisoner were on good terms? - I have heard more since this trial commenced than I did before.</p>
               <p>Have you reason to know that there was a considerable degree of animosity between these two persons? - I do not know of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have you heard that that same cook has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100080"></xptr>a faculty of using keys that are not her own? - No.</p>
               <p>You never heard of her bringing a key from her late mistress that unlocks a closet of yours? - No.</p>
               <p>The value of this soap was not very considerable, I dare say? - Why, sir, it is only laid at a shilling, but there was more.</p>
               <p>You said this box was in an outhouse, but you sunk your voice, and added it was a small house, you did not mean it was put there for concealment? - No, sir, it was quite open, you might see it as soon as you went into the passage, but the sheet and wine were hid about the room; I understood she and another of my servants brought it down stairs, but their strength would not permit them to raise it, and it knocked against the stairs, and a bottle of wine and a bottle of brandy and some soap dropt out.</p>
               <p>So that the prisoner was perfectly aware of its being known in your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She had near 20 l. to receive? - She had not taken any of her wages on account, that was the reason of my parting with her; she took the money for my milk, and used to pay that over to Miss Wagner; I mentioned it to her, I thought I had not my property.</p>
               <p>I believe that she, upon that occasion, insisted that she had paid to Mrs. Wagner, or to your sister, all that came to her hands? - That was her insinuation.</p>
               <p>How long had that insinuation been made? - About a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Of course, after that, she was not a very favourite servant of any body in the family? - I suspected her, and therefore discharged her; she said she was convinced there was not the money, and she thought there was not the money, but she insisted it was all the money that she had received; there is a cowman also takes money; it is a very great trust; I had not the least suspicion of her till laterly.</p>
               <p>Jury. You have just now told us about a misfortune that happened in your bar, did any such misfortune happen? - It was impossible she could gather it up; I did not know that till upon her saying so, I made an enquiry, and so it was; when the casks were put into the cupboard, the nob of the door hit against the cock and so spilt the contents.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. The prisoner's box did not go away the day she was discharged? - No, the next morning; she desired it might stand there all night; that was cook's room.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the prisoner asking you to search her box before she went? - Yes, sir, she did.</p>
               <p>Did you search it? - No, sir, I never searched any servant's box.</p>
               <p>This young woman had lived a good while in the service? - Yes, about three years.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>There was nobody in the family had any dislike to her? - Not that I knew of; she used to quarrel sometimes with the servants.</p>
               <p>When you saw these things dropping out of the box, why did not you speak to her? - She went up so fast I could not speak to her.</p>
               <p>Who wiped up the place and picked up the things? - The kitchen-maid did; she gave the box to the man and he took it away.</p>
               <p>Some of the servants were about the house; you should have said, why, you desired me to search the box, it is high time now? - I might, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Who did receive the milk money while the prisoner was in the service? - I and my sister, through her hands.</p>
               <p>Do you remember at any time any complaints from the prosecutor that it did not amount to as much as it used to do? - Yes, I do; she said, she thought I and my sister wronged Mr. Bartholomew of it.</p>
               <p>She had the misfortune to continue in the service a short time after? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The cook is a favourite servant? - I do not know that she is a particular favourite.</p>
               <p>She generally was a party in the little dissentions? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard the cook say she would be the ruin of this young woman? - No, sir.</p>
               <p>What may you have heard her say? - I do not remember any thing particular; when servants quarrel, I never take any notice, I go and make them hold their tongues, if I can; I never heard her say what she would do with her; I have heard them quarrel frequently.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have you not heard her express herself with great violence against this young woman? - No, sir, never.</p>
               <p>Have you not heard her speak of her as a person she would be the ruin of? - No, never, I do not know what she said, she said she was glad of the prisoner being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100083"></xptr>found out, for this person used to call her dishonest.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner tell some aukward story about the key of a closet? - No, sir, I never heard that, never in my life.</p>
               <p>But generally that she was a thief? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the circumstance of the brandy being spilt in the bar? - Yes, I do, it was at two different occasions.</p>
               <p>Was any of it given to any servant in the house? - There was none to give, it was all sunk in the floor; I bid her mop the floor, but there was not any to take up.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself, Miss Wagner? - I do recollect myself; I know what I am saying of.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to say, that you do not know of any occasion upon which there was some brandy spilt in the bar, and the prisoner was permitted to take it up? - I never heard that she could take any up.</p>
               <p>I do not ask you if she could, but whether she was not told she might if she could? - I bid her mop it up; but I am sure there was none to take up.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know whether it now and then happens that the gentlemen make their own syllabubs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not take a very strict account of the remains of the bottles; pray madam, I think you said, Miss Birds was your sister? - No, she is not; I have a sister there.</p>
               <p>Are you related to Mr. Bartholomew? - No, sir.</p>

               <p>On the 7th of August last, Mr. Bartholomew applied to our office for a search warrant, to search the prisoner's room; we found a sheet under the bed upon the ground; and under the bed there were some bottles of wine along side of the wall; she said, they were her own.</p>
               <p>What did she say about the sheet? - She did not say any thing particular about the sheet, any more than that it was her own, till it was produced before a young lady that is here, and the young lady said, it was their property; the prisoner said nothing then; in the box there was some soap found, and in another box there was a bottle of brandy found, and in another box there was some wine found, and five bottles of wine lay upon the ground; she said the wine was given to her, and the brandy was given to her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Recollect yourself; after she saw the mark on the sheet, did not she say she did not know how it came there? - I believe she did.</p>
               <p>There had been no attempt to take out the mark? - Not that I know of; I believe she did say so; she acknowledged that she had brought the soap from the Angel.</p>

               <p>Did not I tell you when you spoke about the sheet, I did not know how it came there; you said, Martha, I want you to look at your box, yes, says I, and welcome.</p>
               <p>Jury to Isaacs. Did she give you permission to examine her box? - Yes, she did freely from herself without any hesitation whatever.</p>

               <p>I have been cellarman to Mr. Bartholomew about sixteen months; I found the prisoner in his service; I know the cook, and all the servants of the house.</p>
               <p>Were they on very good terms, the cook and the dairy-maid? - Very often wrangling.</p>
               <p>The Dairy-maid used to call the cook a thief? - I never heard her.</p>
               <p>There was a sort of animosity between them, and they have quarelled, and said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100084"></xptr>one would do for the other? - The cook told the dairy-maid to take care she did not do for her first.</p>
               <p>Court to Isaacs. What sort of a box was the prisoner's box, when you found the sheet? - The box in which the soap was, was a small caravan box, I believe it was open.</p>

               <p>The sheet was found under the bed, not in the box? - Yes, and the wine.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

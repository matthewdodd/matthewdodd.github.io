                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Inspector City Police</hi>). I received a communication from the last witness on the 13th or 14th of June, in consequence of which I gave him instructions and went with him on the 26th to the prisoner's premises, and took the prisoner into custody—before doing so I saw the prisoner come out of his shop and look up the Mile End Road—a few minutes afterwards a potman named Laskey, came out of Mr. Johnson's house with four parcels—I stopped him and examined a parcel, tearing the paper wrapper and seeing they contained silk handkerchiefs—I took them to the prisoner's house and said "I am a police officer, I have here some parcels of silk handkerchiefs which have been stolen"—they have been left at the premises of Mr. Johnson, and this man says "You left them there, will you come and see"—on the way he said "I left them with another man, I will tell you who they belong to"—I then took him to Mr. John<lb></lb>son's, and he denied having left them there, but Mr. Johnson said "Yes, you left them yesterday"—the prisoner said "I will tell you the man they belong to, and pulled out of his pocket some money and put it into John<lb></lb>son's hand saying "That is the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I got of you this morning"—Johnson said "You got no 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I don't know what you mean "—the prisoner said You know—Johnson said "I don't know anything at all about it"—I then said to the prisoner "I shall have to charge you with having stolen these silk handkerchiefs from the premises of Messrs. Spall of 120 Cheap<lb></lb>side; you will also be charged with receiving them, well knowing them to be stolen—he said "I did not steal them, I will tell you the man they belong to—I said "You keep on saying you ill tell me, but you do not do so"—after some hesitation he said "I got them of a man named Lee, at 4, Jupp's Road"—I asked the prisoner if he had any books—he reached down some invoices and gave them to me—I said "Do these refer to these goods" he</p>

               <p>

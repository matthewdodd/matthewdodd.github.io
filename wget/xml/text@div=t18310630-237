The prisoner is also an unfortunate girl, and lived in the opposite house; I heard she had been robbed of some wearing-apparel, but swear I know nothing of it - I was sitting at dinner about three o'clock, with my knife and fork in my hand; Mrs. Dudfield and her niece were with me - the prisoner came in; I did not speak to her, nor she to me, nor had I quarrelled with, her before - she first hit me in the eye, and knocked me backwards, then drew the knife which I was eating with, through my hand, and cut my little finger; she then stabbed me in three places in the eye with the knife - I have the marks now; she also stabbed me in one place at the back of my head, and two in the back - I got one cut in my arm; I screamed out, and endeavoured to get away - Maria Green came to my assistance; I believe she has been fee'd to keep away - she took the knife out of her hand, and I at last got from her; I went to Mr. Lowden's in Fleet-street, and was sent to St. Bartholomew's-hospital, on account of these cuts - I remained there for a month - I had had no quarrel with the prisoner; I never spoke to her, nor offered to strike her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Nor offered to make the least resistance? A. No; I tried to get away - she did not say a single word to me; Mrs. Dudfield was bound over, but is not here - my father's name is John Brown; I have gone by the name of Hamilton, but my own name is Brown - I did not assist in dressing a person in the prisoner's clothes; I do not know

               <p>THOMAS THORPE. I am a Policeman. I heard of this transaction; I went to the house about four or five o'clock, and this knife was given to me - the prosecutrix was gone to the surgeon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the prosecutrix? A. Yes; I would not credit what she says - I would not believe her on her oath; her father goes by the name of Harrington, and that is his name.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you would not believe her on her oath - is that from her general character as a <rs id="t18310630-237-viclabel1250" type="occupation">prostitute</rs>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, and live in Wellington-street, Gos<lb></lb>well-street—I am agent to Samuel Starkey, who is owner of the house No. 12, Lower Ashby-street, Clerkenwell, which was unoccupied. On Saturday evening, the 23rd of April, about twenty minutes past six o'clock, I was at the house, and saw the copper and water-pipe safe in the back-kitchen—the copper was fixed in the brick-work, and the pipe was fixed along the wall with holdfasts—when I left the house I locked the street-door—I did not leave any one in the house—I went to the house about six on the Monday morning following, to admit the workmen, and found the lead pipe and copper gone—the door was on the latch—I had locked it on the Saturday night—I afterwards saw the copper produced and fitted to the place where it had been, and it exactly fitted it—I do not know the pri<lb></lb>soners—Smith had called on the Friday before, about twelve o'clock, and asked if the chimneys wanted sweeping.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Sunday night, the 24th of April, about a quarter-past ten o'clock, I was in Lower Ashby-street—I heard a noise inside No. 12, went to the door, pushed it, and it opened—I went into the passage, and saw the prisoner Smith just inside the door—as I opened the door, he slipped behind it, and dropped some lead pipe from under his arm—I asked what he did there—he said he got over into the area to ease himself—I saw Wood at the end of the passage with</p>

               <p>something in a sack—I called Arnot to my assistance, and got a light—as soon as it was brought, Wood dropped the sack, ran up stairs, and escaped out of the staircase-window—Arnot went after him—I searched the sack, and it contained the copper—a little further in the passage I found another lot of lead pipe, tied up in an apron—I examined the back kitchen, and found that the copper had been wrenched from there—it fitted the place exactly—I found a knife on the mantel-piece, just by where the lead pipe was taken down.</p>

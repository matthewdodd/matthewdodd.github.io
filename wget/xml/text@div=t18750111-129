                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at 44, Hatton Garden—on Tuesday, 29th December, about 3.45, I was called to 17, Eyre Street Hill—I found a woman sitting on a sofa in the front kitchen, supported by an Italian roan and woman—I removed her clothes and found a spot of blood about 1 1/2 or 2 inches in diameter—there was no wound apparent at first—the left breast was hanging over the wound, but upon lifting it I found a wound about five-twelfths of an inch in its long diameter—I did not probe it—I advised her removal to the hospital—the room was full of people—it was a wound that might have been caused by a sharp pointed instalment, and I believe a metallic one—I don't think such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">produced by Cortzi</hi>) would have caused it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital when the deceased was brought there by some constables; she was dead—I at once examined her and found a small wound immediately below the left breast, nearly over the heart—it was about half an inch long—that was the only wound—there was a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—there was nothing else to cause death except that wound—it penetrated the chest wall and into the left ventricle of the heart; it was about 2 1/2 inches deep—a sharp pointed instrument of some kind would have caused it—I think a very sharp pair scizzors would have done so—it was hot a clean out; it was rather jagged—many things might have caused it—in my opinion that wound was the cause of death.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector G</hi>). I was at the station when the charge was brought and have since had the investigation of the matter—I have been to the premises, 17, Eyre Street Hill—there is a front and back kitchen—the front kitchen is about 12 or 15 feet square—there is a door which leads into a small passage and a door leading upstairs—on going out of the kitchen and turning to the right there is the door of the small room—I told the prisoners the charge at the station through the interpreter, and Mariana said that Cura had got a knife in his sleeve—he and the others said that was not so—Philomena said nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not take a rule to measure the passage, but I did it as well as I could without that—it was about 5 feet 5 inches by 4 feet, and dark—there was no evidence against the husband.</p>

The Evidence to the Second Marriage was the Parson of Hornsey, who deposed that the Prisoner and Mrs. Simpson, on the 2d of July last brought a Licence to him for Marriage from the Archbishop of Canterbury, that he found it to be a good Licence, and he Married them. The Prisoner in his Defence said, that he did not know his first Wife was alive, when he Married the second, but thought she had been Dead above 7 Years: But produc'd no Proof to Induce the Court to believe him. It appeared by the Evidence that he had used Artful ways to gain the Consent of Mrs. Simpson, that he feign'd himself Sick, to obtain a sight of her, that he put on a shew of Religion, and one time gave her a Visit, with the Practice of Piety in his Hand, and at another time with a Book to teach them how to Dye well.

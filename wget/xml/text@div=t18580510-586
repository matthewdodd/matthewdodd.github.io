                  </hi>. I live at No. 32, Belmoth Street, Greenwich, and am a carpenter, in the service of the last witness. On Friday morning, 9th April, about half past 6 o'clock, I went to his workshop alone, and saw that the shop bar had been taken down, and the window opened—the apprentice was there—he is not here—I do not think he had gone into the shop—I saw him a few yards from the door—I went in about five minutes afterwards—the apprentice had opened the door with the key before I came—I missed these tools, which were there the night before—I believe I saw the prisoner on the Wednesday before, come to the shop for a job.</p>

On Thursday night, 8th April, I was in Deptford Broadway, at half past nine o'clock, and met the prisoner carrying this basket; he had this plane in front of him; there was a jacket, six saws, ten planes, a stock, and a mitre square—I called after him, "Are you a carpenter;" he said, "Yes;" I said, "If you are a honest man, you will give me an account, as we are loosing a great many things; what is your name?" he said, "Look;" I asked him if his name was stamped upon the tools; he said, "Yes"—he said he had been working for a gentleman named Watson, up a new street by the barracks, and was discharged on the Saturday night, but did not take his tools home with him; I said that I did not under<lb></lb>stand his tale, and I knew Woolwich pretty well—I took him to the station—hesaid that he lived in New Street, New Kent Road—I have been there, and asked, and saw a woman—Allen is the name on the tools.</p>

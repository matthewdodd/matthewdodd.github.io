                  </hi>. I live at West-hill, Sydenham—on 14th December, about half-past 1 in the morning, I was awakened by a noise—I rose from my bed, went out on the landing, looked over the banisters, and saw the reflec<lb></lb>tion of a light from the dining-room, and heard the voices of men talking below—I returned to my bedroom, opened the window, and called for the police—in the course of a very few minutes a constable appeared—I told him that there were men in the house—he went to the back of the house, returned immediately, and told me something—I then went down stairs, and let him into the house—we went into the kitchen—the place seemed in dis<lb></lb>order—we went into the scullery and pantry, and saw that the centre iron bar of the pantry window inside had been removed—that would enable a person to get in—the policeman afterwards showed me some silver spoons, a pair of silver sugar-tongs, the tops of some cruets, and a card case, which I identified.</p>

I went to the prosecutor's house, about half-past 1 on, 14th December, from hearing him cry "Police!"—I went round to the back, and saw the prisoner getting over Mr. Oliver's garden fence—I ran after him, and caught him—he was without boots or coat—I took him to the station-house—on the way he asked for his boots—I asked him where they were—he said, "Up there"—he did not point anywhere—I had seen him on the night before, at half-past 11, in Jew's-walk, about 300 yards from Mr. Oliver's house, with two more—after I had locked</p>

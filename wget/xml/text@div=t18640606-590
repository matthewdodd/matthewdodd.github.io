                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Gass and Co., 166, Regent-street, jewelers—about six or seven weeks ago, I should think, the prisoner came and asked to look at some waistcoat chains—I showed him some, and then he asked to look at several other things—I showed him some charms at his request—I afterwards missed some—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the value of them is about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not sell them to him—they are some of the same I showed to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you tell me the exact day the prisoner came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I saw him altogether about three times—he came twice before with some trivial excuse, and the third time I missed these things—they were made in Paris—they are not sent over in large quantities—they are not manufactured exactly for our shop, but you would have great difficulty in matching them in London, because there are so few of them made—all I can say is that I had in the shop at this time similar charms to these—I was not at the prisoner's premises when they were searched—he gave me no address—I did not ask for any—he said he had to purchase a chain for a friend, and he left the money on condition that I should return it to him if his friend did not like it—he paid me 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, the value of the chain—he brought the chain back again the next day with some trivial excuse, and I missed the charms the morning after—I did not look at them when he brought the chain back—if those charms were taken at all by him they must have been taken when he bought the chain—we kept these charms in a tray, not in the window—there were not many of this descrip<lb></lb>tion in the tray.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer—on 11th May, I searched a box at the prisoner's lodgings and found these two charms in a secret place in the box; there were two secret places, and these were in one—I searched it twice before I found them.</p>

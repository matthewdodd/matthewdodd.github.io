On the 3d of November, in the evening, about half past four, Lewington and Jones were in my shop, Lewington came in to buy some ribbon; I was informed by one of the shop women that she had stolen something as she was going out of the shop door; I followed her, and while I was looking after her, the prisoner

             came out and followed after Lewington; they both spoke together; I followed them at a distance of about ten yards, still approaching nearer; and momentary they came to Earl court in Little Newport street, Jones and Lewington met Spike, they conversed together, all three; Jones and Spike went down this court and left Lewington at the top of the court; I saw Jones pass out of her apron into the apron of Spike, some lace; when I approached Lewington she dropped from under her red cloak a ribbon block and the paper that was round it; there was no ribbon on it, that gave me suspicion that Lewington had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300042"></xptr>stole something, at the time she was in the shop; I immediately told them all three I must detain them, that I had something to say to them; I called a man to my assistance, that was going into a leather seller's shop; he came, and Lewington dropped a half piece of ribbon from under her cloak, with my own mark upon it; I took it up and took the prisoners back to my house; on my taking them up stairs Spike made a stumble and flung out of her apron two pieces of lace; aye. said I, this is what I wanted; immediately I took them all up stairs, and they were all searched; I found on Lewington a small bit of paper, containing a yard of white ribbon, folded up in one of my shop bills, which I understood had been bought the night before by the same woman; I immediately sent for the constable and gave them in change.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the ribbons here - A. Yes; there is eighteen yards; it is worth nine shillings; this ribbon was dropped from Lewington, this blue ribbon was found on the ground, where they stood in the passage, after they were taken up; it was the ribbon that was wound round the block, and here is the lace that passed from Jones to Spike, and found upon Spike; it is worth thirty three shillings; I had seen it in the shop on that day; Spike denied ever having it.</p>

            . I was going into a shop in Newport street; Mr. Kenyon desired me to give him assistance, as he suspected he had been robbed; in the mean time I saw a piece of ribbon lay by Lewington on the pavement. I assisted in taking them to Mr. Kenyon's house.</p>

               <p>Lewington's Defence. I made up a bonnet for a little girl, she told me to bring her a yard of five penny ribbon she gave me the fivepence for the ribbon; I told the gentlewoman I wanted a yard of fivepenny ribbon; he made answer to the woman, you serve the thread and I will serve the ribbon; in the mean time I had this ribbon in my hand, I asked the price; he said six pence; I said I have got but fivepence, I want five-penny ribbon; I went out of the shop; he came after me and said he picked up this ribbon; well, says I, I do not know how that came there, I never had such a ribbon in my hand.</p>
               <p>Jones's Defence. I was going to Cranbourn alley the same day; I bought a new pair of shoes; I went into this gentleman's shop and bought three pennyworth of ribbon, and paid him. On my going out I met this gentlewoman, I asked her the way to Cranbourn alley; I never saw her before; I turned down the court, I met another woman with a pail in her hand, I said to her is this the nearest way to Cranbourn alley. He said come back; I said go along fellow; he said I will make you suffer, I have been robbed for a twelvemonth; he said to me and these two women, if it is in my power I will hang you; he took me into his place along with these two women, up stairs in the dark, and called for a candle; he stripped me start naked, all but my shift; he found nothing about me but the yard of ribbon.</p>
               <p>Spike's Defence. He pushed us all three in together; how can he say he saw the lace fall from me, when we were all pushed in together.</p>

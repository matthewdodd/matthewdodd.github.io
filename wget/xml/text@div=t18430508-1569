                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop in the Hackney-road. I live next door to the prosecutor. On the afternoon of the 8th of March, in consequence of something the prosecutor's wife said, I went to fetch the prosecutor from a brothel, in Plumber's-row, Commercial-road—I found him and the prisoner there, from two to four o'clock in the afternoon—I took them to the prose<lb></lb>cutor's house in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I left the prisoner and prosecutor there for a short time—I went into the house with them—in the course of the evening I went to the play with Rose, leaving the prisoner and Mrs. Rose in the house—we returned at twelve—I went into the prosecutor's house, and saw Mrs. Rose and the prisoner, and the servant, in the parlour—I said to Mrs. Rose, "Here</p>

               <p>he is, Mrs. Rose, according to my word, safe and sound, and there is his book and his money," pointing to his waistcoat—previous to our going to the theatre, I saw the pocket-book and its contents on my counter, and all the evening, if I turned and looked towards him, I could see the corner of the book in his waistcoat—I had seen Rose count his notes previous to his going to the theatre, and he put the book into his inside waistcoat pocket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I know no ill of her.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, cannot we bring it under forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. You are to exercise your own judgment! The Court does not enquire into value, in order that Juries may exercise a degree of liberality; though to besure this is not like the case of grand and petty larceny, because there 12 d. was a rule that was established many, many hundred years ago, and there is a vast disproportion, between the value of 12 d. then, and 12 d. now: But this depends upon the value of money, since King William's time, in which there is not so great a difference: I do not know how many ounces this tankard weighs; the value is not found by evidence before you, to be above forty shillings, therefore upon that you must exercise your Judgment.</p>

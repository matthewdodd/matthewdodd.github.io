                  </hi>. On the 28th of November I was drinking at the Spotted Dog, in High-street, Poplar—I had a sovereign in my pocket, and eight half-crowns, twelve shillings, and four sixpences—I was nearly drunk, but I am certain I had the money when I went in—the prisoner put his hand into my pocket—I <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> him away, and said, "Tom, I won't have that "—the landlady hearing me speak to him, came and said to him, "If you have been getting drunk at another house, you must go there again "—he said, "We will all be peaceable and quiet"—I went to sleep, and when I awoke he was gone, and all my money too—I saw him next morning, down at Blackwall, and stopped him—he said he had not taken my money, and in coming along he said to my friend, "Wait a bit</p>

               <p>till I go to see a particular friend "—he ran into a stable, and I was going to see for him—he came out at the gate, and said he had been to see a person who had a pair of shoes of his for three months—he said he had not a farthing of money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Lee, who keeps the Spotted Dog. I saw the prisoner and prosecutor in the house—the prosecutor was tipsy, and the prisoner was leading him along—I heard a scuffling, in the tap-room—I went and told them that where they had got tipsy they must go and get sober—I heard the prosecutor say, "I won't have it, Tom"—soon after the prisoner came to the bar for a glass of rum-and-water, and paid me half a crown—I gave him change, and took the glass of rum-and-water into the tap-room—he drank it and left—there was nobody else there to take the money, and nobody else came in till the prosecutor missed his money, I am certain.</p>

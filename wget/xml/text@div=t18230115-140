            . On the 22d of December, about half-past eight o'clock at night, I got on the Isleworth coach, at Kensington; I had a bundle containing this property. I was quite sober; the prisoner was on the coach-top; he had no bundle on the coach-top, but one in the boot; the coach stopped on <placeName id="t18230115-140-crimeloc767">Turnham-green</placeName>

            . I am a patrol. I stopped the prisoner on Turnham-green, in the way to Isleworth, with the bundle under his arm, I asked how he came to take it off the coach, he said, a soldier had given it him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did he appear intoxicated - A. Yes, he staggered a good deal, he was behind the coach; it must have passed him, he had left a band-box in the boot; he was let go, and afterwards taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was intoxicated and did not know what I was doing.</p>

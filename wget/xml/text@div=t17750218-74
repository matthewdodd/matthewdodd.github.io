            . I am a watchman. I had the care of Mr. Herbert's house. On the 22d of December I left the house safe at eight at night, the door and windows were then fast: This house is in upper Brook-street: the next morning when I went off my watch, I came to the house about seven in the morning, upon putting the key into the look, the door gave way immediately, that alarmed me. I went into the house, I found the door above the china closet broke open, that alarmed me more. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177502180055"></xptr> went up stairs, and saw several doors broke open I went up to Mr. Stratford, who is the son in law of Mr. Herbert and lives in Somerset-street, Portland Square, he sent Mr. Strokes an attorney he was not at home, I came back to Mr. Herbert's house coming up stairs again I saw a bureau with eighteen or twenty drawers that were locked up when I went to it I found these broke open and a japan chest open, several boxes and trunks too were broke and all the things lying about the house except what were taken away I know nothing of the Prisoner.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. James's, Clerkenwell, upon an information that was made against the prisoner and one Burton, I went to Burton's lodging, there I met with the prisoner, I had received an information which caused me to search Burtons lodging. I went afterwards to the prisoners lodgings with him at the corner of Bridge-water Square, there I found the bunch of pick-locks, a loaded pistol, a dark lanthron, and a pocket tinder box, The prisoner said, I see you have some information, therefore I may as well tell you all. He asked me if I could get him admitted an evidence, I said I would if it lay in my power, but it did not, therefore I would hear no more of it.</p>

             clapped a pistol to my breast and demanded my money.</p>
               <p>Were you walking or in the cart? - I was sat down in my cart, he damned me, and said make haste, I told him I was lame, I would make all the haste I could; I gave him two shillings, he asked me if that was all I had, I told him I had a few half pence in my waistcoat pocket; then he put his hand over to my left-hand breeches pocket, and he asked me what I had there, I told him I had some parcels of writings, which would do him no good, and he did not take them; he then went away from me.</p>
               <p>How were the other two men employed at this time? - They stood at a distance off, they all three rode off together.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - A very clear night.</p>
               <p>Was it moon-light? - No, it was not, but the sky was very clear indeed.</p>
               <p>You say you did not at the first know that that was the person? - I did not at first in my fright, but I know it was he that robbed me very well, I knew him very well<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260131"></xptr> when we took him, that was the man I know that had my money.</p>
               <p>Did you know him at the time of the robbery? - I knew I could know him again.</p>
               <p>But you did not know who it was at the time? - No, I did not know then, I was frightened.</p>

               <p>Was any body else taken but him? - No, the others rode away.</p>
               <p>How was he taken? - Two other men that had been robbed came up and followed him, and told us to follow, and we did; they took this Wingrove, and the others rode away and left us.</p>
               <p>Did you see him taken? - Yes, I helped to take him.</p>
               <p>What did you pursue with your cart? - Yes, we had not above a mile to go, and we gallopped the cart as fast as we could.</p>
               <p>And did you in your cart overtake him on horseback? - They had stopped him, and knocked him off his horse, the other men had, we carried him two miles in the cart afterwards, they would make me carry him.</p>

               <p>How long had he been knocked down before you came? - Just that moment.</p>
               <p>Which way did they ride after they stopped you? - They rode away for Feltham.</p>
               <p>So they rode on so leisurely? - No, No, they did not ride so leisurely.</p>

               <p>What business are they, are not they a sort of moon light men? - It was not moonlight.</p>
               <p>Are not they a couple of smugglers? - They may as far as I know.</p>
               <p>They go for that they say? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>I believe you do, you are pretty well used to charges; did these two smugglers of your's give any charge against this prisoner? - They are no smugglers of mine.</p>
               <p>They are friends of your's? - They are no friends of mine.</p>
               <p>Then these two fellows, did they make any charge against Mr. Wingrove for robbing them? - Yes, they did make a charge.</p>

               <p>I will make you know directly; upon your oath did not these two men attend the next day at Mr. Taylor's, and say that Wingrove was not one of the men that robbed them? - He is the man that robbed me, I will tell you the truth, he was the man that robbed me, I did not hear them say that he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not they say it? - No, they did not say it, I never heard them say it, that he was not the man that robbed them, I can swear that very safely, I never heard them say any such word as he was not the man.</p>
               <p>What did they say about the robbery? - They said he was one of the men in the company.</p>
               <p>Is that true that they said he robbed them? - They said he was one in the company.</p>
               <p>That they swore? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he committed for robbing them? - No, he was committed for robbing me.</p>
               <p>That is pretty singular you know? - I do not understand the law, I never was in it before.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you never say so? - No, never in my life, I never said such a word.</p>

            , the elder, I was with my father when he was robbed, it was last Saturday night three weeks.</p>
               <p>Where? - In Hamworth parish, just as you go off the Heath.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - Nigh about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>How many men robbed you? - One.</p>
               <p>Did he meet you or overtake you? - He overtook us.</p>
               <p>Was he on horseback? - On horseback, I was upon a horse driving the team, and my father was in the cart; the man on horseback overtook me, he asked me where that road went to, I told him, and he asked me how far it was to Chertsey, and I told him about six miles, and he asked me what money I had, he took hold of my horse's bridle, and put a pistol up to my cheek, and I told him I had none; he said I had, and I said I had nothing but a note in my pocket, and I took it out.</p>
               <p>Did he do any thing to your father? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260134"></xptr> He then went away from me and went to my father.</p>
               <p>What did he say or do to your father? - He asked him for his money.</p>
               <p>What did your father say? - He told him he had but two shillings in his pocket, and he took it and went away.</p>
               <p>What did he do with the pistol after he robbed you? - I do not know, I never saw any more of it after he put it to my check.</p>
               <p>Did he take any thing from you? - Yes, Sir, a note in a purse.</p>
               <p>What note was it? - It was of no account, it was only a bill of parcels of some cheese which I had in my cart.</p>
               <p>Was it a moon-light night? - It was not dark, but it was not moon-light.</p>
               <p>After he had left you and left your father which way did he ride? - He rode to the back part of the cart, away from me behind.</p>
               <p>He rode the opposite way then to what you were going? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I suppose you were frightened at the pistol, that made you let one man rob you? - I do not know I was frightened, it was an ugly tool to be frightened with; there were two more with him.</p>
               <p>How came you to forget that till now? - I have mentioned it now.</p>
               <p>How happened you did not mention it before? - This is the man that robbed me; I mentioned it to Mr. Taylor, the Justice, that there were two more men.</p>
               <p>How did these two men employ themselves while the other was robbing you? - One stood at the tail of the cart, and the other stood at the head of the fore horse.</p>
               <p>Did the man at the tail of the cart do or say any thing while this man was robbing you both? - No, Sir, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Stood looking on? - Yes; this man ordered the man that stood foremost to go and take what my father had, but he did not take it, and the other went round immediately and took it himself.</p>
               <p>Who was this man that robbed you? -

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I have two applications to make to the Court; one, that the constable may restore the prisoner's watch, and the other, that these two witnesses, the father and son, may be both committed to Newgate; I think it my duty to ask this, as it is a very foul perjury, and I will undertake to prosecute them at my own expence.</p>
               <p>Court. Let Groves the elder and younger be both committed to Newgate till they find sureties.</p>

             the elder and younger. The conduct of each of you in this cause has been extremely reprehensible, the best light in which your conduct can stand is, that of rashly charging a man in a case where there is a reward; and you may think yourselves very fortunate that the prisoner and his friends decline an immediate prosecution for perjury; therefore, I shall not order you to be detained, but leave the prisoner to take such remedy as his Council shall advise; and if it is applied for, I shall order a copy of the indictment.</p>

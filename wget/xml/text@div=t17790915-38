On the 12th of August, about five in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my shop and asked for a pair of callimanco pumps; I shewed her several pair; she found fault with them; I left one pair by her and went to reach some more; when I returned I saw that pair a good way under her petticoats; I showed her a pair then that fitted her; she desired me to put some sprigs in the heels, whilst I was doing that, I kept my eye upon her, and saw her with her left hand put the shoes up her petticoats; she then said she had not money enough; she would return for the shoes; she went out of the shop; I followed her into the street, laid hold of her and told her I must have the shoes she had secreted; she seemed a good deal surprised, and said she did not know what I meant; I told her it was in vain to conceal it, for I saw her secret them. I brought her back into the shop and my sister found them upon her.</p>

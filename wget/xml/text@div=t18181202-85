            . I lived servant with the prosecutor nine days. On the 5th of November, while he was out, the prisoner, who is my mother, came about three o'clock, and asked if my mistress was at home? I said No. She came in and asked if there was any rooms up stairs? I said Yes. She asked where the stairs were? I showed them to her, and asked what she wanted? She went up; I heard her open the drawers. I shut the street-door, went up, and asked what she was doing? She said nothing particular. She took every thing out of the drawers, tied them up, and came down with them. I told her when mistress came home she would know it. She ran away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020041"></xptr>with them. I went over the way and told the Gentleman that somebody had come in and robbed the house. The Gentleman went over the house, said he could see nobody there, and staid until my mistress came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him it was your mother - A. Not at first. Mistress asked me who it was? I at first said I did not know. She said if I did not tell, she would send for an officer, and have me and my mother taken up. She still kept asking me. I said I did not know. Master sent for an officer. He came and asked me. I said I did not know. He said if I did not tell directly, he would take me to the watch-house. I then told him my mother had come in, and robbed the house. He went and took her up.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was her - A. Yes. I did not like to tell at first. The prisoner, Stevenson, is my grandfather. He came to my mother's to tea that afternoon. I am between thirteen and fourteen years of age.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 5th of November the prosecutor fetched me. I asked the girl who had robbed the house? She said she did not know the person, but it was a man. I said she had better tell me who it was, and where they lived. She said if I would give her till the morning, they should be returned. In about ten minutes she said her mother had been and robbed the house. I went and told her mother she had been robbing Mr. Perkins. She denied any knowledge of it. She said they should be returned next day. She then asked if I would forgive her robbing the place if she told where the things were? I said I could make no promise of the kind. She said they were not in the house, she had given them to a man, but she did not know who he was, or where he lived, but she would find him to-morrow morning. She took me to Wapping, workhouse, and said a man in there, named Stevenson, had got them. I went in, the prisoner, Stevenson, was brought to me. On searching him I found the whole of the property, except the five gowns, and a snuffer-tray, about his person. He said he knew nothing about them, never had them, and persisted in it for half an hour. I said I must take him for the robbery. He then said he would show me where the rest of the things were. He took me to a man in East Smithfield, where I found them. He asked the man for the things he had left there.</p>

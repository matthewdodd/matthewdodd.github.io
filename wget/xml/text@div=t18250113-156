            . I am assistant to the solicitor of the Mint. I have a record of the conviction of the prisoner at Rochester, on Monday, the 14th of October, 1822, which states that James Lennard, late of the parish of St. Margaret, within the City of Rochester, labourer, on the 27th of August, did put off a piece of money, of the likeness of a good shilling, to

            , and the same day to one James Russell did deliver a piece of false and counterfeit money, made like unto a piece of good money, called a shilling, to which the verdict is, guilty - and the prisoner was sentenced to be imprisoned one year, in the gaol of the said City, and to give securities for his good behaviour for two years.</p>

            . I am keeper of the gaol at Rochester. The prisoner was convicted at Rochester, on the 14th of October, 1822 - he was in my custody for one year. I am certain of his person.</p>
               <p>NATHANIEL ENTWISTLE. I keep the Crane, public-house, in the parish of St. John, Hackney. The prisoner came to my house several times before the 2d of December - he came about eight o'clock in the morning of that day, and called for a glass of gin, which came to 2 d; I served him, and he gave me a shilling: I gave him change - I then went back towards the light, and found the shilling was a bad one; he was then walking out: he got out - I went after him, and found he was gone. I took care of that shilling - I wrapped it up, and kept it by itself: and have kept it ever since. He came again about eleven o'clock the same forenoon, for a pint of beer, which came to 2 1/2 d.; he gave me a shilling, and I gave him change: this was in the tap-room, which is lighter than the bar, and I saw that it was bad. I went out, and sent a man for Garva, the constable - he came, and we went into the taproom; I showed him the two shillings, and gave charge of the prisoner. Garva marked the two shillings, and gave them back to me; they were never out of my sight. Garva searched him, and found one shilling and a sixpence, in his pocket, some halfpence, and a bit of beef steak.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody on the 2d of December - Entwistle showed me two shillings; these are them, (looking at them;) I put a mark upon them, and gave them to Entwistle. I found 1 s. 6 d. in good money in the prisoner's breeches pocket, and in his waistcoat pocket 4 1/2 d. in copper. I searched him further, and found under his arm a bag, which came round his neck, and hung under his shirt - I told him to pull off his coat; he would not: he made a sad resistance when he found I had got hold of the bag. I pulled it from under his shirt - it contained twenty-three good sixpences and there were five bad shillings wrapped up in a piece of paper, and wrapped up all separate in the paper; they appeared quite fresh. I found 3 s. 5 d. in copper, and a piece of beef steak in his pocket, and some cheese, and four onions, all in his coat pocket. I asked him where he got the money, and he said more misfortune to him.</p>

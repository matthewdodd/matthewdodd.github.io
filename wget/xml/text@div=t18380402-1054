                  </hi>. I live with William Brown, at Harlington. He lost some wooden posts and rails from round his meadows—they were put up to keep his cows in—the rails were nailed on the top, and</p>

               <p>the posts fixed in the ground—the prisoner lived in a little low cottage three hundred or four hundred yards from Mr. Brown—we found the posts and rails in his garden at the back of his house—he put them up to make a pig-stye—they are here—they are elm—I know them because they are elm wood—I can swear to them—I helped to put them up—I drove some nails in to nail the rails on—some of them might have been loose—I can not say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. Last Tuesday morning Mr. Brown sent for me, and said he had lost a large quantity of posts and rails at sundry times, and he had a suspicion that some of them were on Best's premises—I got a search warrant, went with the servant, and found these five posts and two rails.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was going to work one morning about seven o'clock, and found these on the road—I took them, and brought them home about five o'clock in the evening—I did not know whether they had dropped off a cart or what.</p>

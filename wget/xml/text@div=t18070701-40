            . Q Do you keep the York hotel in Charles-street, Covent Garden. - A. Yes, it is in the parish of St. Pauls, Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the keeper of the house, are you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Newton sleeping at your house. - A. Yes, he came to town on the 23rd of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time he went up stairs. - A. It was between one and two o'clock when Mr. Newton went to bed; he went to the theatre that night and the theatre was very late.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner Sparks lodge at your house that night. - A. Yes, he came between ten and eleven o'clock, he asked if he could have a bed. I looked at him, and after some hesitation I told him he might, as he was drest genteel and respectable; he ordered a glass of brandy and water, and sat down in the coffee room, he sat there till near two o'clock, till the coffee room was quite clear. I desired the waiter to give him a bed pair of slippers, and a bed candle, and to shew him his room, which he did; and he went to bed directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his room near that in which Mr. Newton slept. - A. The adjoining room. After he had gone up stairs I went up to bed in nearly a quarter of an hour; I went to my own room, which is in the next floor above to where the prisoner, lay; I shut my door to, and had partly undressed myself, I heard some little noise, as if some person was opening a door or moving about the passage; it was a very trifling noise; knowing there was a stranger in the house, I opened my door to see what it was, I saw a light, and by my opening the door it made some little noise, and the light vanished away, it was gone; I stopped outside of the door a minute or two till the light came again; I then went down two stairs, in doing that the stairs made some little noise, and the light went away again; I was then sufficiently got enough down the stairs to see the door of the prisoner's room stood at that time a-jar, and the light was in his room; I concluded that it was not right for him to have the door open; I stopped where I was for the space of ten minutes, then I saw him come out with the candle in his hand, he was undressed, he slept in the room No. 5, he came across the passage and went into the room No. 3.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Mr. Newton's. - A. No, no person slept in that room that night. He then went to the drawers, which he opened one by one; I stood on the stairs and heard him open the drawers one by one; there were just five drawers, he opened four, one was locked. I was then fully satisfied what his intention was. I went into the room to inform Mrs. Stonnard, and when I was comming down the stairs again, the stairs made further noise; the prisoner ran into his room again, and locked the door; when the prisoner had locked his door he could not unlock it again. In the same room where he slept, in the cupboard, were some trunks of a gentleman; I was afraid he was trying to open them, I found them safe afterwards. I called one of my waiters up to get an officer, that I might give the prisoner in charge; one of the waiters went out and got an officer, I went down stairs myself just after the waiter was gone; and while I was down stairs I heard the prisoner come out of his room with a candle in his hand, he was naked; one of the maid servants at that time was on the stairs, she called to him; I was at the bottom of the stairs below; I heard her call to him. I ran up stairs and went into his room, the prisoner pretended to be much frightened; I insisted upon his going out of the house directly; I told him I knew what his intention was. I looked in the cupboard and found every thing was safe.</p>

               <p>Q. You having no reason to suppose that he had taken any thing let him go. - A. Yes, I told the officer to let him go, and he went away. The next morning Mr. Newton asked me if I had seen his watch, if he had left it in the coffee room on the over night; I told him no. In consequence of that I went to the office, got an officer; we went to No. 4, Leather-lane, where the prisoner had stated he lived; we there learned that he was at a house, No. 7, Earl-street, Seven Dials; we went there, and there we saw the prisoner coming from a house No. 7, Earl-street, Seven Dials. We searched him and took the watch out of his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. (to prosecutor) Is that your watch, chain and seal. - A. It is the same, it is worth ten pounds; it is a gold watch, capped and jewelled.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. I think you said you did not know whether you lost it coming out of the theatre. - A.

We advertised them on the Friday; and a gentleman brought us a piece and the prisoner. In the piece was about seven yards and half, (produced in court, and deposed to,) mark'd by the initial letters of all their names, being three partners; he looks at it; This is the piece we had sold to Mr. Dyer. It had met with an accident and been at the whitsters, then we put the initial letters of our names. They were sold to him before they had been to Barbardoes, and met with an accident coming back, which occasioned them to be whitened.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Brown, a pawn-broker in Marybone. That on the 31st of July the prisoner brought me a remnant of lawn, he asked me twelve shillings upon it. I lent him half a guinea. On the Monday folowing, he brought another piece, red and white, which my master would not take in. I told my master, that it had been advertis'd, we saw it answer'd the advertisement. I stop'd him in Coventry-street and brought him to my master. He took him to Mr. Chancey.</p>

            . The next morning, being the 30th of July, when we came to ship the goods this package was missing, upon which it was advertis'd; after which, this piece, with the prisoner was brought to our house by Mr. Brown the pawnbroker. Then the prisoner said he had taken it for work which he had done, but could not tell where the persons liv'd, nor tell their names. The next morning he was taken before my Lord Mayor, but before his Lordship came to the hall, he acknowledged to Mr. Chancey, in my hearing, that he was the person who took the box out of the shop, and hop'd he'd be as favourable as possible to him, and he'd let him know where the rest of the goods were, and desired we would stay till his daughter came to us, and then he would give us the keys of the room in order for us to find them. We were agreeable to this, staid till she came, and then went with her into some street near Bloomsbury-square, and found some of the lawns, some of them were torn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am used to draw for people that pay me in goods, sometimes in money. This was brought to me by a man that told me he had no money at that time, so I took the things. It is not to be imagin'd I'd go to pawn things with marks on them, if I had any notion of their being stolen. I have lived threescore and ten years in town, and never was charg'd with any thing of this sort. I have drawn for nobility and could have cheated them of hundreds of pounds had I been inclined so to do.</p>

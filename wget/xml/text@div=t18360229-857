                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Alfred—place, St. George's, Southwark. The prisoner was my errand—boy for about six months—I sent him with some trowsers, to be cleaned, on the 11th of February, about half-past nine—o'clock in the morning, to Mr. Rolls, the dyer—I saw him again in five minutes; and about four o'clock in the afternoon I missed my purse,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183602290220"></xptr>
               <p>containing a double-sovereign, five sovereigns, and seven half-sovereigns—it was a common leather purse—I recollected leaving it in the fob-pocket of the trowsers I had sent to the dyer's, having worn them the day before—I directly went to Rolls, and saw the trowsers—the purse was not there—I told a young woman there the contents of the purse—the prisoner went out with me in my chaise, and after he had taken out the medicine in the afternoon, I said to him, "You took the trowsers to the dyer's, was there any thing in the pocket?"—"Yes," he said, "there was a lump, Sir, which I took with the trowsers, and laid them on the counter, at Mr. Rolls"—that he carried the lump in his hand, and laid it on the counter, and told the young woman to get the trowsers done as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I left the lump with the trowsers—I did not know it was a purse as I was going along the street I felt a lump, but took no notice of it—I left the trowsers at the dyer's, and returned to my master directly; and in the afternoon he said, "You took my trowsers, did you feel any thing in them?"—I said, "Yes, a lump, but I did not take any notice of it—and when I got to the shop I left it there"—he asked if I could take my oath that I left the lump—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Well, go to the dyer's and ask for the trowsers, and examine them," which I did—I said to the young woman, "When I brought them, there was a lump in them"—she said, "No, there was not, "—but she said there were five sovereigns, a double-sovereign, and seven half-sovereigns—I came back to master, and he said, "How the devil should she know what was in the purse?"—he said, "Put your hat on"—I went back with him—he said, "Fetch up your box," which I did, and he searched it, but found nothing—he said, "Go to Rolls, and say I will have a search-warrant"—I went there, and they said, "The sooner the better"—master asked if I could take my oath that I left the lump there, and I said I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been three years at Mr. Rolls' next August—I saw the prisoner when he brought the trowsers, about a quarter to ten o'clock on the 11th of February—he said he had brought his master's trow<lb></lb>sers to be cleaned, and asked when they would be done—I said on Satur<lb></lb>day; and as soon as they were done we would send them home—he left them—I laid them down behind the counter till a quarter to twelve o'clock, when I entered them in the day-book—I did not feel any thing in the pocket—if there had been the smallest thing possible in the fob I must have felt it—I am positive there was no lump at all—the prisoner said nothing to me about a lump—the trowsers were rolled up when he brought them; but I opened them when I entered them in the day-book—I threw them open on the counter—the flap came completely open—I saw all the pockets and the fob, and am certain there was nothing in them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am turnkey of Surrey gaol. On the 11th of February I received the prisoner in charge—seeing him in livery as a servant, I asked what he was charged with—he said with stealing five sovereigns—I said,</p>

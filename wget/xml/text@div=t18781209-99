                  </hi>. I am a plasterer, of Robert Street, Commercial Road, Pimlico—on 17th November, about 12.30 at night, I was in Great Peter Street—I had had a little drop, but knew what I was about—the prisoners met me at the corner of St. Ann's Lane, and one of them asked me for a piece of tobacco—I told him I did not use it—the other two got hold of me and threw me over on my back; Barry held me by the throat, while Geary tried my pockets, where I had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some pawn tickets—I called "Police," and a policeman came and took them and took Geary's Hand out of my pocket—I have seen them about before, but they are not <hi rend="italic">pals</hi> of mine.</p>

I was with some <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> I knew, but they went away—I had come from Stoney's, where I had been drinking—Robert Street is about a quarter of a mile from Great Peter Street—I had not been into Doudney's public-house that night—I had not been at work that afternoon; I had been to my father—this was Sunday morning, after the "houses" had shut up on Saturday night—I was not seriously injured; I got a scratch on my neck—they pushed me and I fell over with the force of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Barry</hi>. I was not drunk, for I signed my name to the charge sheet—I did not ask for a lodging on trust that evening—I do not know where Geary lives, but he was standing at the corner of the lane.</p>

I heard cries of "Police," went in that direction, and found Frith on his back, with Barry's hand on his neck, and Geary had his hand in his pocket—Barry said, "It is all right, we are all <hi rend="italic">pals</hi>" but Frith said that he knew nothing of them whatever—I saw the sergeant take Geary's hand out of Frith's pocket.</p>

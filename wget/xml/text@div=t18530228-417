                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 180). On 31st Jan. I was on duty in Church-street, Deptford, about a quarter before 9 o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner coming down Church-street—he appeared to me to have something very bulky in his pockets—he turned up Giffin-street, and I followed him—he went into a little grocer's shop—I went in, and asked him where he lived—he told me, "Down by the Thames-tunnel"—I asked what he had got in his pocket—he said, "Some fowls"—I pulled his coat on one side, and saw two fowls' heads, which I knew to be very valuable fowls—I took him to the station—he was charged with having them, and giving no account of them—he made no answer—he was asked his address, which he refused to give—I was about to search him, and he said, "I will take them out"—he took two hens out of one pocket, and two from another—he undid the fall of his trowsers, and took the male bird from thence—I gave the fowls up to Mr. Morris—one of them is here.</p>

                  </hi>. This is one of my fowls—I received it from the last witness—I saw the five fowls at the station—the others were delivered to me—they were mine—I had seen them safe on my lawn about 5 o'clock the same evening—the lawn is inclosed by a fence, and the yard by a brick wall—I was not aware of the loss of the fowls till the policeman informed me of it—they are Cochin China fowls; I have a fowl house for them on the lawn.</p>

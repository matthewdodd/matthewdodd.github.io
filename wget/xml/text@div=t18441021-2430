I was on duty on Satur<lb></lb>day night, the 10th of Oct., about half-past ten o'clock, or rather more, in the neighbourhood of the Broadway, Westminster—there was a great crowd of persons assembled in Strutton-ground, which is a sort of market on a Satur<lb></lb>day night—I saw the prisoner there—I knew him before, and thought it right to watch him—he observed that I was watching him—he said nothing then, but after he got further he called me a black looking b—, what was I watching him for? and made use of very abusive language—I took no notice of him, and made him no answer—he had no stick in his hand at that time—he kept on abusing me—I said, "I don't want to have anything to do with you at all, I wish you would go away, I don't want to be <hi rend="italic">bothered</hi> by you"—he went away, threatening that he would knock my b—head off—I did not see him again for above half an hour after, he was then in York-st.—that is in the same neighbourhood—I was still on duty—as I was walking up York-street, I saw him coming down the street with the bludgeon, now produced, in his hand—he began abusing me, and said he would knock my b—head off—I walked along for above 100 yards, and took no notice of him—he fol<lb></lb>lowed me, and kept abusing me all the way I went—he was in the road, and I on the pavement—I said not a word to him—he followed me about 100 yards, and then came up with this stick, and struck me a violent blow on the right eye with it—I closed on him at the time, or else I should have had all the full length of it—I closed on him, so as to shorten it as the blow was aimed—it knocked me down and stunned me—in closing in, I got hold of the stick, and when I was down, the prisoner got hold of * * *—I kept hold of the stick when I was down, that pulled him down—he fell with me—he held me by my * * * three or four minutes, I cannot exactly say how long, till I was very sick—another constable came up—I begged and prayed of him to take his hand away from me—my trowsers are here, with the front all torn out—my eye bled very much indeed, it was cut—I was taken to a surgeon—I was very sore in the other part of my person, and have been so ever since—he also kicked the other constable, and kicked me very violently too.</p>

On Saturday night I was on duty in York-street, and saw the prisoner on the ground, and Millerman on the top of him—the prisoner had hold of Millerman's * * *—they were not struggling together—Millerman was begging of me to get the prisoner's hand away from him—I tried for about five minutes, I should say, to get his hand away, and at last succeeded, by taking him by the throat, and choking him—I found that was the only way—when he did let go, Millerman got up—we let the prisoner get up—he made a kick at Millerman three or four times, kicked him in the leg, and said, "You b—, I will kill you"—he kicked him three or four times in the thick part of the thigh in front—I threw him down—he then seized Millerman by the * * * again—I tried again for four or five minutes to get his hands away, but could not—I was obliged to choke him again, to make him let go—with some assistance he was then secured, and went along to the station—I had hold of his collar, and he kicked me—in going along, he said to Millerman he would do for him, if ever he got loose, and me also—when we got into Tothill-street, we got the assistance of another constable, and going through a little passage to the station, he kicked me in the thick part of the thigh, and made a kick at my * * *—he kicked me two or three times—at last we got him to the station—Millerman's head was bleeding.</p>

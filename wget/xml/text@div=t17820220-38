               <p>What was the work? - A blue manteau, shot with white, cut in the loom and left there; it was cut clear from the reed; on examining the window, we found it open, and saw the mark of a foot, as if somebody had gone out there; I found a candle burning in the house, on the ledge of a wall; I saw nobody in the house but the prisoner; he was in the kitchen, standing upright in it, between seven and eight at night; we searched the prisoner, found nothing but a clasp knife, and some half-pence; I saw the light on the stair-case, on a pier of the wall.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether he did not knock me down with a poker? - I did not knock him down, I had one which he endeavoured to take from me.</p>

               <p>Did the light change its situation? - When I first saw it, it was close to the window; a little time after, I saw a glimmering light, it seemed to me to be moving towards the stair-case, according to the appearance.</p>

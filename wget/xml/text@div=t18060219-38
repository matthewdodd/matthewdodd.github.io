             sworn. I am an officer, I received these things from the prosecutrix; the prisoner was taken to the watchhouse before I saw him, I searched him and found nothing on him; he begged forgiveness, he said he was very much in liquor, he did not know what he was doing of.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I was at work between the hours of four and five in the afternoon, I heard a cry of Stop thief, I ran out and collared the man, just at the bottom of Fashion-street, and took him to the watchhouse; he went down upon his knees and begged my pardon, thinking I was the prosecutrix's husband.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place, is that the bundle that you took from him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix) Whose piece of patchwork is that. - A. The patchwork and cotton is mine, they laid upon a box in the two pair of stairs room, I had seen them in about twenty minutes before, I had been in the room hanging up a few things I had been washing; the boots are my son's, he is nineteen years old.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never was in that place, I was coming from Blackwall, going home to my family; as I was coming down Fashion-street I saw two men, one of them throwed a bundle and a pair of boots to me, I catched the bundle and the pair of boots, and endeavoured to run after them, this woman came up to me, I said is this your property, she said it is, she immediately took the property and turned from me; and going on further, two or three men came up to me, they said they thought it proper to take me to the watchhouse; I went to the justice, and while I was there a man came in, who said he saw two men run, and saw them drop the things, this woman immediately wanted me to be turned over to my regiment, I said I did not like to be exposed to my regiment, I had not been guilty of what I had been charged with.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the man here that said he saw them drop the bundle. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is no such thing, nothing of the kind passed at the magistrate's.</p>

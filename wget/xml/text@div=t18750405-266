                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On the 4th March, from information I received, I went to Foster's Parcels Delivery Office, Bennett's Hill, Doctors' Commons, accompanied by Mitchell, another officer, and there saw the two prisoners—we told them we were police officers, and mentioned to them the fact of a case of umbrellas sent to Ipswich having been broken open—I asked the two prisoners if they knew anything about a case being broken open in the basement and three umbrellas abstracted—they said they knew nothing about it—I said "It is very clear that this case was broken open in the basement," and asked Joyce first if he had anything about him which did not belong to him—he said "No"—I then searched him, and in his coat breast pocket I found these three white silk handker<lb></lb>chiefs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked "How do you account for these?<hi rend="italic"></hi>"—he said "I had them from Fowler," referring to another porter who was present—he' said "Sexton had them first"—I then took Joyce to Fleet Street Police Station and searched him there, when I found a key upon him—he took it out of his pocket—on the way to the station he said "I will tell you the truth; you will find one of the umbrellas at home"—he gave me his address, No. 2, Scarsdale Road, Camberwell—he also said "Those white handkerchiefs we took out of a parcel the other day"—when I got to his residence I opened the door with the key I obtained from him—I found a green box in which I found two other white handkerchiefs similar to the three I found upon him, and thirty-five pieces of skin, some of sable—then there was a small box with six scarfs in it, and another box with six scarfs and three pairs of ladies' kid gloves, another box with eight silk scarfs, three cambric handkerchiefs, a pair of braces, a piece of velvet, twenty-nine linen collars, twenty-eight valentines, a lady's companion; and the umbrella I found in the room—I took all these things back to the Fleet Strett Station—I showed them to Joyce—he picked out several of the boxes—this is one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), containing six scarfs—he said "I took them"—that is <hi rend="italic">this</hi> box, also a small box with these three pairs of ladies' kid gloves—he picked out several other things, the valentines—this umbrella he told me was at the house—there is a ring on it—that is all with reference to Joyce—when I went to Foster's place I said to Sexton "Have you any objection to your place being searched?"—he said no, he had not, and Mitchell and Sexton went on to his place—Mitchell found these two handkerchiefs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but I spoke to the prisoner respecting them—I said "What have you got to say to this, Sexton?"—he said "What can I say? It is a bad job"—I looked in the clock in the bed-room on the mantel-shelf, a</p>

On the afternoon of the 4th March I went with Outram to Foster's Parcel Delivery Company, Bennett's Hill—Outram was spokesman—I after that went alone with Sexton to his lodging—I asked him if he had any objection to have his place searched—he said "No"—we then went into the back room and in a drawer I found four pairs of socks—I asked him how he accounted for them—he said "I bought them"—I said "Where"—he said "I don't know"—in the same drawer I found these kid gloves—I asked him how he accounted for them—he made no answer—in the same drawer I found this bit of wire, and there was a Cardigan jacket—I then said "Have you anything else?"—he said "No"—I said "Where is your bed-room?<hi rend="italic"></hi>"—he said "I cannot get in there because I have not the key, you must wait till my father comes home, he will be here in a few minutes"—his father came up but did not know where the key was—the prisoner then volunteered to get through the window of the bed-room by the landing and open the door—I said "Do so"—as soon as he got in he shut the window—I listened and heard the sound of a lock and key and I then got in through the same window and found him concealing something under the bed-clothing—he had not unlocked the door—I said "What are you doing?"—he made no answer—I then turned the bed clothing down and I found those two silk handkerchiefs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said "How do you account for those, Sexton?"—he said "It is no good, it is a bad job"—that piece of wire looks to me as if it had been used for opening locks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Joyce's Defence.</hi> The principal of the property found on me was given to me by a porter named Fowler, and I took it and went away; there are several others employed there; there was an assistant clerk there the same day I was taken into custody; there was a heap of parcels there, and I saw him standing with his back to the stairs; I said "Holloa, Corbett! what are you doing there?" he was tying up a parcel; it was going to Exeter; that would be one of the parcels; he threw it down; I picked up the string and I said "Look here, Fowler!" and opened it before Fowler, it contained light gloves done up in sections of two, and there was a pair missing out of that parcel, so I took it up and put it down again.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">recalled</hi>). Fowler is one of the porters—I went to search his place and there was nothing to implicate him in the matter—I had all three down in the basement together.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Joyce.</hi> Corbett went upstairs laughing, and he came down again and went up again; he had a parcel in his pocket, I noticed it by the red seal; I shouted out to Corbett and said "Corbett, what is that you have got in your pocket <hi rend="italic">V</hi> He threw it down. This was a small parcel going to Gloucester; that would be one of mine, so I said "You have got pretty cheek, if anything is the matter I shall get the blame of it;" so I put it down again and went to get the labels to label my own parcels; I then returned, and while I was labelling them I said "Holloa! Fowler, that parcel is gone." I turned over the rest of the parcels and I said "It isn't here;" so I ran upstairs, just as I got upstairs, he was turning back again with the parcel and he said "I thought there was sixpence out on that one"—I know what that parcel is;" I said "Do you? whether you know what it is or not, you leave my things alone;" the seal was broken; the principal of those goods was given to me by Fowler; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know nothing about the two umbrellas; I never <hi rend="italic">got</hi> back till 5 or 6 minutes to 4 o'clock, and then all the goods were sorted, be<lb></lb>cause 1 lived at the West End and went to my dinner and walked back again. There were two or three porters in the way. That umbrella was under the. stairs.</p>

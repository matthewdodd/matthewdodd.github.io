This beef was in my slaughter-house, which has an internal communication with my house by a door; I saw this beef safe in my slaughter-house on Monday night, the 2d of April, at eleven o'clock; it was two pieces, weighing 40 lbs. - it was cut off a quarter of beef; the slaughter-house was safe at night. I went to the slaughter-house about seven o'clock the next morning, and found the lattice, which was made to let the air in, was broken, large enough to admit the body of a man in - that was quite safe over night. I missed this beef, and found it at the watch-house that morning - I knew it to be part of what was cut from my quarter of beef. I compared it with what remained; it had formed one piece the night before, and was worth about 15s.

            . I am a watchman of St. Luke's; my beat is in Banner-street, one end of which leads into Whitecross-street. On Monday night, at half-past twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner going down Banner-street, with a great weight on his back; I asked what he had got there? he said it was his master's property. I got nearer to him, and said, I should like to see it - he then dropped it and ran away; I sprang my rattle, calling Stop thief! - and in four or five minutes, found him in custody at the watch-house. I was quite sure of him - I took the meat and carried it to the watch-house - it was beef. I am certain he is the man.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard the rattles spring, and saw the prisoner running; the watchman was calling Stop thief! I ran and caught the prisoner by the collar, without losing sight of him, and took him to the watch-house; another watchman came and secured him. Belshaw came in, in a very few minutes, with the beef, and said, "That is the person who had the beef." I found a knife on him, with a small piece of raw fat on it, as if it had been cutting meat.</p>

            . I am watch-house keeper, and was there when the prisoner was brought in. Chalkley came about ten o'clock in the morning, and claimed the beef. I saw it afterwards fitted to the rest of the carcase - it had undoubtedly been part of the same. I saw two small pieces of raw fat on the prisoner's knife.</p>
               <p>F. CHALKLEY re-examined. The beef was not cut as a butcher would do it; it had been cut three times and then twisted up.</p>

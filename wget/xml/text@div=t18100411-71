On the 5th of March, about six o'clock, Mrs. Gorden was paying me some money. She laid down four five-shilling papers of halfpence as part of the money. While I was settling with her the prisoner and two others came in and called for a quartern of gin; the halfpence laid on the counter, and the moment they called for the gin the prisoner catched a five-shilling paper of halfpence off the counter in an instant, and throwed them to a short man behind him and he ran out of the door. I directly challenged the prisoner. I said you have stole five-shillings, worth of halfpence from me. He said he did not know any thing about it. I detained him and sent for a constable.

            Yes, I cannot say how much I was to pay him; there were two one-pound notes, four five-shilling papers. I had put these papers out of my hand on the counter. Three men came to the bar the prisoner was one of them, they called for some gin, the prisoner stood opposite of the counter; Mr. Suter was settling my account in the book. On a sudden he ran out into the lobby and took hold of the prisoner, saying, you have taken five-shillings of halfpence and given them to that man that ran out of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did one of the three run away - A. Yes, instantly. Mr. Suter then said to me, did not you see that. I said, what Sir, he replied, why this villain has handed off five-shillings to that fellow that ran out of the door. I did not see it, and so I told him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Suter stand by the loss - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met two men, I was intoxicated, and when I came into this house I called for a quartern of gin. I never touched a halfpenny belonging to him.</p>

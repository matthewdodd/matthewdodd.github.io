I did not do it; I know nothing of it;" and then she said, "I heard a noise outside the area railings last night, but I not tell you, dear" (addressing her husband), "as I thought it would make you timid"—the husband was standing close to us—I then took her into custody, and took her in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the station, and the husband as well—the husband was afterwards taken before the Magistrate, and discharged—directly after I had conveyed them to the station, I went back to the house with the surgeon—I made a search up stairs, in the bedroom, and under the bed I found a black gown—I noticed upon it some blood, apparently as if it had been partially washed, still there were evident spots of blood—this is the dress (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I noticed some bloody finger marks on the cellar door, and also on the door leading into the kitchen—I examined the bed in which the servant slept, and saw one or two small spots of blood on the upper part of the sheet, the part that turns over—this lucifer box, with bloody finger marks upon it, was handed to me by the surgeon.</p>

Q.</hi> Was she speaking to you, or muttering to herself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—she was talking aloud to herself—I sat at the back of her—I do not know whether she saw me or not—she spoke about Mr. Phelps taking the part of Hamlet and Richard the Third—she said she liked to see Mr. Phelps take the part much better than she did Kean—that was the beginning—she talked about the history of Hamlet and Richard the Third—she was sitting in a chair at the time, with her hands in her lap—her head was up, the same as it would be if she was sitting anywhere else—I was in the room when it began—I was behind her—I had seen her before at the station—I I had had no conversation with her before—I was then watching her—her first words were that she should like to see Mr. Phelps take the part of Hamlet and Richard the Third—she was talking a long time about that, but I really cannot recollect the words that she mentioned—she talked about the history of Hamlet and Richard the Third—I cannot recollect what she said about it—she said she knew the history of Richard the Third, and she was talking about it for some time—I cannot recollect what she said about it—she did not appear to me to be rambling—she spoke loud enough to be heard distinctly by any one—she might have been talking for half an hour or three quarters, I cannot say exactly the time, talking in that way—she mentioned about the two children that were murdered in Richard the Third—I cannot recollect what she said about the children—all she said about Hamlet, was about Mr. Phelps taking the part of Hamlet—she mentioned the history of Hamlet, but I cannot recollect what it was—she did not say anything about murders there—I had never seen her before to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in Si John's. terrace, Hoxton; I am surgeon to the police—I was called to the house, No. 18, Linton-street, on Sunday afternoon, 17th Feb.—I got there about half past 5 o'clock—I saw the dead body of a child lying in the cellar—it was lying on its back, and rather directed towards the right side—there I were three wounds on the left side of the neck, extending from the centre of the back of the neck to the trachea in front—the carotid artery was wounded in two places—the hæmorrhage from those two wounds in that artery was the cause of death—there were a number of superficial wounds in both hands, and likewise about the face—it is possible that such an in<lb></lb>strument as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) may have inflicted the wounds about the I throat and person of the child—I saw this knife at the Coroner's inquest—they were wounds by a sharp instrument—I found this match box on the chimney piece in the front kitchen of the house—there are apparently stains of blood upon it—I gave it to the policeman—this petticoat and dress were shown to me before the Coroner—I believe them to be stained with blood.</p>

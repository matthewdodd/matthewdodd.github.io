                  </hi>. I am the wife of Moses Nathan—we keep a slop-shop. The prisoner came in about twelve o'clock, and asked if Mr. Nathan was at home—I told him no, and asked his pleasure, saying I could do just the same as him—he said, "I wanted to see Mr. Nathan, "that Mr. Wilcock had recommended him to my husband to get him a ship—I said he would be at home about half-past one o'clock—he left, and called about one o'clock—Mr. Nathan was then at home—he went on board a ship with him, and came back and dined with us—we dined about two o'clock—he stopped for a letter to take to Wilcock, and my husband went with him as far as the 'Change—immediately he was gone I missed one table-spoon from the table, and one from the sideboard where the prisoner had sat—there was nobody else in the house to take it, but our little servant in the kitchen—I have never recovered them.</p>

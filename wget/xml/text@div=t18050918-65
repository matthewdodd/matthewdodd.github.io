About eleven o'clock I shut up the shutters, I lived there, I asked who was going home, or who was going to-bed; (the foreigners had asked for a lodging:) while I was holding the door in my hand, Barrett and Stanford rushed out of the door together; under Barrett's jacket I saw some striped cotton shirts, I instantly ran to the bundle, and perceiving it slack to what it was when it came in, I ran out, and catched Barrett just at the end of the shutters outside of the house; I asked him what he had got; he said, nothing; I just felt him, I found nothing; I overtook the woman, I said to her, Bella, what have you got? she said, nothing; I brought her back into the house, and took it out of her apron: there were two cotton shirts, and a pair of new cotton stockings; she told me that Barrett had given them to her at the door; Barrett was in the tap-room, he asked me to forgive him, I told him it was out of my power; the shirts were delivered to the foreigner by the Magistrate's order, the ship sailed before the trial came on; the foreigner, John-

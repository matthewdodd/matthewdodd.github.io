                  </hi>. I have been a master mariner since 1838—I commanded a ship for Holdsworth before 1866, called the <hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi>, which was lost in a gale of wind off the west coast of Scotland—in March, 1866, I received a letter from Holdsworth—it is destroyed—it was to hold myself in readiness to take command of the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>, which his friends were about buying at that time—on the receipt of that letter I came up from Liverpool to London, and saw Holdsworth at his office in Fenchurch Street—I had known him before that in Liverpool—I saw Dean in Fenchurch Street, he was a clerk in Holdsworth's office at the time—Holdsworth told me that his friends were about buying the ship <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>, that she was then on her passage from London to Newport, and was chartered for Shanghae, and that if the ship was purchased they would give me the command—he told me to hold myself in readiness—I went back to Liverpool and re<lb></lb>ceived a telegram or letter, I am not certain which, to proceed to New<lb></lb>port and meet him there—I destroyed that letter—I destroyed all my papers—I went to Newport, and there met Holdsworth and Berwick—that was on the 20th of of March, 1866, to the best of my recollection—I went from the Newport railway station to the King's Head hotel in a cab—on the way to the King's Head I met Holdsworth and Berwick—Holdsworth told me to drive on to the King's Head—I did so and met them there—I dined with them that day, in the coffee-room—Berwick told me that he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701280052"></xptr>
               <p>had purchased the ship, and that he had brought a mate from London to go out in the ship as mate—he said that he had known him for some time, and that he was a very trustworthy man—he said his name was Webb—the conversation was about the value of the ship, what it cost, and I think Berwick told me it would cost him 7000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to put her to sea, that they intended to insure her for 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that they did not think she would ever reach China—this conversation was at the dinner-table in the coffee-room of the King's Head—they told me, in the event of the ship not reaching China, it would be worth 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me, that Webb was a man whom they could depend upon, and that I was not to interfere with him, he knew what he was sent on board for—nothing more was said daring that conversation—Holdsworth said that Webb was an eccentric character, but that I would have to sail with him, as the owners wished him to go in the ship—he also told me I had better insure my effects for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was after Berwick had left—I said that I would insure my effects for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and my life for another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I had not 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property—I do not remember anything more being said—I was introduced to Webb the same evening by Holdsworth, who told me that he was a parti<lb></lb>cular friend of Berwick's, and that Berwick wished him to go in the ship—I received the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> papers that evening from the late captain—on the following day I told Webb to go on board and take charge of the ship, and take an inventory of her stores—Holdsworth and Berwick left at noon the next day—the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> was lying at Newport at that time—Berwick told me that he had been through the vessel a few days before, and said she was a very magnificent ship—I remained at Newport until the vessel sailed—Webb remained by the ship, but had liberty to go to London—that was three or four weeks after this interview—he went because the ship was neaped in dock, and the outer dock was dry—he asked my leave, and I gave it him—he was absent three days—shortly after his return Holds-worth came down to Newport, it may have been a week after—before that I had made a complaint to Holdsworth by letter—I received a reply from him—I have destroyed that letter—he told me to bear with Webb, as the owners wished him to go in the ship, and I was not to discharge him on any account until I saw him—when Holdsworth came down Webb took him into my cabin and was with him there about ten minutes—after that Holds-worth told me he had spoken to Webb, and I should have no further trouble with him—he told me he was put on board by the owner for a special purpose, and must go, and that it would only be for the passage out—a few days after that I saw Holdsworth at Newport, when he came down to clear the ship out—he handed me a bill of lading to sign for some cases that were on board, that came from Allsopp's—he had spoken to me before this about the cases, about a month before we sailed—we left the dock, and hauled out in the roads on the 15th of May—he told me that Allsopp and Co. had a dozen cases of hardware or fire<lb></lb>arms, I am not certain which, and that I should have ten pounds for carry<lb></lb>ing them as cabin freight—he gave me the ten pounds when he came to clear the ship—he afterwards gave me a brace of revolvers—the cases came that I was to carry in the cabin about ten days before we sailed—they were put in the store-room, and were addressed, "The Captain, Ship <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>"—they were marked in a diamond with a "W"—the cases were on board at the time he brought me this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to sign—I signed three other documents in blank; they were not filled up with the contents, but this one was filled up with the exception of my signature.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">This stated the shipment on board the</hi> Severn, <hi rend="italic">from William Allsopp and Co., of twelve cases, containing</hi> 500 <hi rend="italic">revolvers</hi>, 200 <hi rend="italic">carbines</hi>, 200 <hi rend="italic">sabres, and</hi> 200 <hi rend="italic">swords, to be delivered at Shanghae, dated London, May</hi> 12,1866, <hi rend="italic">signed by the witness, endorsed "William Allsop and Co.," and in the margin was a diamond, with "W. S."</hi>) The cases were marked with an "S," as well as a "W"—I think Holdsworth said the contents of the cases were hardware—when he gave me the revolvers he said they were a specimen of the contents of the cases—they were small soft-wood cases, bound with iron hoops—I never received any instructions from Holds worth, or any of the prisoners, what was to become of the cases—they were not addressed to any one else but myself—the ship was well provisioned for a twelve months' voyage—Holdsworth managed the provisioning of the ship—he ordered the stores—when the ship was in the dock I had an opportunity of seeing whether the ship was tight and strong—she was perfectly tight, and newly coppered—the copper was carried twenty feet forward and nineteen and a half aft—that is quite as high as usual—she also had a wood sheathing which went about five feet above the copper amidships, and three feet above aft, which would cover all trenail holes in the outer skin of the vessel—the object of the wood sheathing is to prevent the galvanic action of the sea upon the copper nails of the vessel—it is fastened on by nails from five to six inches long—they are of yellow metal—they are not fastened on by trenails or bolts—when we hauled out of Newport the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> drew twenty-two feet six inches of water—about a week after we sailed from Newport Webb asked me whether he might put some hands in the boats, and I told him he could do so—the boats were all put in good order and fit for use—some time after that I remember Webb being in the store-room, where the twelve cases were—the store-room was in the after end, under the cabin, between decks—the cabin was in a house on deck—the vessel was American-built—after Webb came out of the store-room he said he had opened one of the cases, and found that it contained salt—I said, "You had no right to open the case"—he said he was anxious to know what was inside the cases, as he thought they did not contain arms, from their being so light—there was a little salt in the vessel, for the ship's use, which came from Liverpool—we had tolerably good weather until we were off Cape St. Vincent, where we had an ordinary gale of wind—it did not amount to a storm—we close-reefed the upper topsails—there was nothing in that weather, in my judgment, that would cause the ship to make water—she did make water, and increased her leakage very suddenly—that was about a fortnight before she went down—we had then been out about a fortnight—when we found the ship make water we pumped her dry—we had to pump her every two hours after that, till there was no water in her—the strength of the gale lasted about twelve hours; after that, we got to the trade winds—we had very fine weather then—we continued to pump her every two hours up to the 14th of June—the pumps sucked her every two hours—on the 14th of June we found that the vessel began to make more water, about four o'clock in the afternoon (she had made water before that)—it took some twenty minutes to half an hour to get the pumps dry, before they sucked—when the pumps sucked there was about seven inches of water in her—about four o'clock on the 14th of June I observed that the men at the pumps had a much longer spell than usual—they had been pumping an hour without suck—I then sounded the pumps myself, and found about twenty-six inches of water I think; I do not remember exactly—about eight o'clock that night Webb came to me on the poop and asked me if I would get the boats out, as the water was gaining on the</p>

               <p>pumps, and that the ship was going down—I told him I thought he had tampered with the ship—he said it was done, and could not he undone—I asked what he had done—he said he had bored a hole, and in the act of driving a plug in he had broken the plug in the skin, and he could not possibly stop it—I told him he was mad to do such a thing to a ship in such a position, so far off the land, and told him to go below and endeavour to stop it, for it was plain to every person that the ship had been tampered with—this was about eight o'clock—he went down, and was there about ten minutes—he came again to me, and said it was impossible to stop it, as the water had flowed over the hole—if a plug had been broken in driving it into the inner skin, that would let the water in—the timber would be a foot or fifteen inches thick where I suppose the hole would have been bored, and there would have been fifteen or sixteen inches of space between the inner and outer skin, and the water would flow in there—when he said the water had flowed over the hole I said he was mad, for he would destroy every man in the ship—he said it would be better to get the boats out at once, as there Was no chance of saving the ship—I told him I would not get the boats out till the morning, and that I would hold the ship up for the Cape de Verd—that was the nearest land, but we were 180 miles to leeward of the nearest point—they were to the windward of the ship, and we were to the leeward of the islands—I held the ship up for the islands, for Port Baya, which was the only port we could fetch, and continued pumping the water in the vessel until noon next day—I divided the crew into three watches, and kept them continually at the pumps—at eight o'clock the next morning some of the crew came to me and requested me to get the boats out—the water was then gaining on the pumps, about six inches of water an hour—I kept them pumping up to twelve or one o'clock the next morning, the 15th of June—about two o'clock in the afternoon I gave directions to have the boats got out, and told the mate to provision the boats for twenty days—he told me the breakers were not filled, and that he would fill them himself—they were ten-gallon breakers—there were either ten or a dozen of them—they had been ordered by Webb in Newport—the boats were provisioned and the long boat filled with men—I was in the cabin when the long boat was manned—it was loosed down by the tackle and allowed to go astern—several of the crew were in her at that time—after that had been done Webb came to me in the cabin and told me that the men were crying out that there were two holes in the stern, and that he would have to shove off—he then went away in the long boat and cruised off in the distance, ahead of the ship—the long boat never got astern of the ship after that, as far as I know—Webb came to me on board again about six in the evening, on the starboard gangway—I hailed him—I called him into the cabin and told him that the merest child on board the ship could see that she had been wilfully destroyed—he said that there was no fear, he could buy the whole of the crew over, and that he did not believe any of them had seen the holes—he wanted me to leave the ship, but I told him I would not, and that I would rather go down in the ship than face the exposure—she was in a sinking state then—Webb did not say anything then that I recollect—he left me and went away in the boat—the carpenter, the boatswain, and three others, my boat's crew of the gig, were left on board—I remained until half-past seven, and then by the persuasion of the boatswain and carpenter I left—the ship could not have remained above water more than an hour after I left her I should think—I did not see her go do down—Webb had the log-book</p>

               <p>very uneasy about it—about ten or eleven o'clock the next day I went again to Holdsworth's office—I found Holdsworth and Webb there—Webb said that the ship's company had seen him to the station at Southampton, and had given him three cheers, and that it was all right, and would never be found out—Holdsworth looked at the log-book, and said that it would be all right—Webb brought the log-book—Holdsworth examined the protest, and said it was all correct—Webb said that he had sounded the carpenter, that he had not seen the holes, and that no person but Kelly and the boatswain had seen them, and that they had threatened to report having seen them, because I had punished them for stealing rum, but that he had talked them over, and we should hear no more about it—Webb told me that Kelly had taken rum, but I had no other proof—I did not speak to Kelly about it—Webb spoke to me about Kelly having taken rum, on board the <hi rend="italic">Arequipa</hi>—some days after this I was again at Holdsworth's office, when Berwick, Webb, Holds<lb></lb>worth, and Dean were present—Holdsworth sent Dean out of the office, and took the log-book out of his desk, and asked me how it would do—before this I had had a conversation with Holdsworth about another log-book, about a week after I arrived—after that he told Webb he had better get another log-book, because it had been tempered with and re-written—Webb said that he could get a new log-book and copy it—I went to Liverpool im<lb></lb>mediately after that—I was away a week I think, and when I returned I saw this one (<hi rend="italic">marked A</hi>)—Webb was in the office at the time with the book—he brought the book there that morning, and he was turning down the leaves and soiling it by rubbing each page with his hand—it was all written then—it is in Webb's handwriting—Dean was sent out before the book was produced—I told them that the log would never pass muster, because any person could see at once that it was a new book, and had never been to sea—Holdsworth and Berwick both wetted the edges of the leaves and rubbed them—Holdsworth told me he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month to keep me going until the insurances were recovered—only Holdsworth and my<lb></lb>self were present then—this was about the time this book was produced—I last saw the book in Captain Downward's office—before I saw it there I last saw it at Holdsworth's office, on the occasion when they were wetting the edges of the leaves and turning them down—I got back to Liverpool on the 4th or 5th of November—in consequence of a communication I received on my arrival, I went to Berwick's house and saw him there—that was at the Willows, near Liverpool—that is the name of the street I believe—I think his house is 25, the Willows—he said that he had asked me to call upon him to let me know that he was going to London the next day to see how the business was going on, because he could get no information about it from any person—I told him that I thought the business would fall through—I also told him that there were inquiries about it, and that it was in the hands of Captain Downward—he said that he had had a letter from Holdsworth a few days previously, stating that the case was going on all right, that the underwriters wanted to compromise the matter—I told him that I was very short of money, that I had not had a remittance from Holdsworth lately, and I asked if he would lend me a few pounds—he lent me a sovereign, and said that he would send me a remittance as soon as he got to London—about three days after, Holdsworth came to Liver<lb></lb>pool, and gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he told me the underwriters were going to prose<lb></lb>cute me criminally, in consequence of my insuring my effects for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said my insurance was the cause of all the row—I told him I did it at his</p>

               <p>suggestion, or that he did it for me rather—he told me to go up to London and meet him there the following day—we parted then, and I never saw Holdsworth again until he was in custody—I had consented to insure for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my life and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my effects—I had given those direc<lb></lb>tions to Holdsworth—I never heard from him whether he had done it, until I returned—I then heard from him that he had insured 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on my effects, and he sent the policy—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I returned it to Holdsworth, (<hi rend="italic">This was in the Friend-in-Need, dated the 8th of June, 1866, for </hi>200<hi rend="italic">l., on chronometer, nautical instruments, charts, books, wearing apparel, &amp;c.

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been in the business you are now in? you are a master mariner I understand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since 1838—this was not the first accident of the kind that happened while I was master of a ship—the first I had was with a ship in 1845—that was the <hi rend="italic">Edward Robinson</hi>—she sunk with a cargo of tea at Sheerness—she was under water and damaged her tea—I was master of that ship—an anchor pricked her bottom I believe—there was some inquiry about it—I had a pilot on board at the time—the inquiry was as to the nature of the loss of the ship, or rather the sinking—there was no impu<lb></lb>tation on me, no charge of any kind, I am quite sure of that—the pilot was examined—he had the charge of the ship at the time—that is not the only ship that has gone down while I have been the master—I lost a ship last year—I have known Berwick personally not twelve months—I had known him more than a month before I met him at Newport; two or three months—Holdsworth introduced me—I went out in this vessel, knowing that it was to be sunk, but I did not intend to sink her—I did not go out as a party to assist in that—I did not go out as a party to prevent it—I went out as a person to have the appearance of the captain, but to do nothing either to assist or prevent—that was the position in which I was placed on board—that was the position that I understood I was there for the purpose of carrying out—I knew that there was a gross and scandalous fraud to be committed, and I was willing to lend myself to it—I did lend myself to it—that was the first of any kind of fraud that I lent myself to—up to that time I had been a respectable man, with a character—no act of dishonesty was ever brought home to me—I believe I was thoroughly respectable, according to the world's ideas, up to that time—I cannot tell you why they selected me for this—I cannot give you an idea—I was recommended as a thoroughly good seaman, and, I believe, as a thoroughly respectable man—</p>

               <p>I am fifty-one years of age—I did not remonstrate with them when this was proposed to me—I did not endeavour to persuade my owners against it—I took command of the vessel, knowing that they wished her to be destroyed, and that there was a party sent on board for the purpose of destroying her, and that they wished me to stand by and see it done—I admit that I was very wrong in doing so, and I am very sorry for it, perhaps not so sorry as if I had been in the dock—I did not intend to do it—I intended to take the ship to China—I was engaged for the purpose of standing by and seeing it done, but I intended to take the ship to China—at the time I took her out of the dock at Newport I intended her to arrive safely in China—I had no idea of allowing her to be scuttled—I intended to prevent it by all the means in my power.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What made you swear just now that you knew the purpose for which you were employed, and that you intended to stand by and allow her to be scuttled? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think I said that—I did not go out inno<lb></lb>cently—I intended to have rogued the owners—I intended to have taken the ship to China—I intended to rogue the owners by taking the vessel safe—when I heard there was a hole in the bottom of the ship I did not go down to look at it—I was in complicity—I was an accomplice as far as lending myself to the transaction—I did not wish it to be exposed—had I gone down there, or sent the carpenter down, of course it would have then been known to all hands clearly that the ship was to be sunk, and I did not wish to save her then—I was engaged by the owners, and when Webb was put on board they told me that he was put on board for the special purpose of destroy<lb></lb>ing the ship; that I knew—I knew there was something the matter with the ship in calm water—I did not go down and see what it was, because I was afraid of being detected by the crew—I intended to do honestly to the underwriters—I was afraid of detection, or I should have stopped the leak—I went out to make a living anyhow, that is about it, and which<lb></lb>ever line roguery might take, I was willing to adopt it at that time—I thought the better plan would be to take the ship to China—that would be the most profitable to me and the most upright.</p>

               <p>not catch fire—the mate did not put it out—the boatswain did I believe—the mate and I were both present—the mate assisted in putting it out, all the crew assisted—the mate was not the first man that came up—the boat<lb></lb>swain was the first man at the fire I believe, I am not sure—Webb him<lb></lb>self told me that the boatswain put it out—it was about four or five days after that that I heard the knocking in the after part of the ship—I knew from the commencement that she was intended to be destroyed, but I did not know she was to be destroyed at that time—I had not the shadow of an idea of it—I did not make inquiries about the knocking—I thought it was the carpenter at work—it never struck me who it was knocking—perhaps it might have been the carpenter—I was not on deck that after<lb></lb>noon from dinner time to four o'clock—it was not a heavy gale that we had—we have the topsails reefed in a gale in a deep sea, when the wind is contrary—she was tolerably deep, well laden; with a contrary wind we generally bring the ship under a snug canvas—Webb sent the man Kelly to me to apologise for having said he would report seeing holes in the stern of the ship—he said he was very sorry for it, but he did not intend to make any report of the sort—he said he was very sorry for what he had said to Webb—I never knew that there was a quarrel between Webb and Kelly about taking spirits from the ship—Webb mentioned that Kelly had stolen a bottle of rum, but that was after Kelly had reported seeing holes in the stern—when I went to Holds worth's I saw the old log-book—I knew where Webb was lodging at the time—I went to his lodgings from time to time—I did not take with me either that log-book or another at any time—I do not know the name of the woman where he lodged—I should know her if I saw her—she washed some clothes for me—I did not take the blue log-book, as well as the other log-book, to Webb's lodgings, not to my recollection, I did not—I never had it my possession away from Holdsworth's premises—I never went to Webb's place with the real ship's log-book, never to my knowledge—the log-book did not come into my possession when I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Arequipa</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Oneida</hi>—Webb kept it—he did not give it to me, nor did I take it to Holdsworth's.</p>

               <p>destroying the vessel—it struck me as somewhat strange that he should tell me I should find my instructions at Shanghae—I do not think I made any remark upon it at the time—while I was at Newport I had a quarrel with Webb, and a communication was made to Holdsworth about it—I do not think Holdsworth told me when I communicated with him that I might please myself whether I took Webb out or not—I think he said that the owners wished him to go out in the ship—Holdsworth told me to keep aloof from him—I do not recollect whether he told me that I might please myself whether I took Webb out or not—he told me that the owners wished Webb to join the ship—I do not recollect his telling me I could discharge him if I thought proper, I think not—I believe I said that I had no fault to find in him, but that he was a talking fool and very "gassy"—I do not remember his telling me that I could discharge him if I thought proper—Holdsworth asked me whether I would insure my effects for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I did so, the chronometer was a part of the effects—I brought the remnants of it back, it had been under water four days—I brought what there was of it back—I made a representation before the Magistrate with regard to my loss—I think I stated that I only saved my sextant and clothes, to the value of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not say anything about the chronometer or what remained of it at that time—I did not know the value of it—I went to a Magistrate to make a statement, in order to get my money—I made a written declara<lb></lb>tion to the Magistrate—I was sworn in the Court—I furnished a written declaration to the "Friend in Need" office—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my handwriting—it is dated 17th May, 1866, and is addressed to Messrs. Holdsworth &amp; Co.—it says, "I have to inform you that I got my men on board last night"—in this letter I said I hoped to make a good run out—at the time I wrote that I did intend to make a good run out—the offer of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been made long before that—we had an ordinary gale and sprung a leak, and we were at work at the pumps every two hours—springing a leak is a serious affair, but making water is an ordinary thing—I made a pro<lb></lb>test with some other men at Pernambuco (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is only a copy—that protest was taken from the log-book—it was prepared by the Consul's clerk, from information forwarded by me, by Webb, and by the ship's crew—there were some of the crew, I believe, who signed the protest, and there were some who did not; they were all about the Consul's office—I was sworn to the truth of that protest—the protest says, "Sworn on the Holy Evangelists"—I stated in that protest that on the 29th May there were heavy gales, and that there was a violent squall that lasted an hour—that was taken from the log-book—Webb wrote it in the log-book, and that part of it was copied—it is not true—I swore that on the same day the ship was completely buried in the sea, and that the boats were adrift and everything unloosed, that the ship strained greatly, and that there was three feet of water in the well, that she was making sixteen inches of water in the hour, and that she had sprung a serious leak—all this was untrue—I also swore that the hands were constantly at the pumps, and that we passed a wreck on the sea, consisting of orange chests and a variety of seamen's effects; that was true.</p>

               <p>cross seas—it is a fact that the vessel was hit in all directions—the decks were flooded sometimes, the fore-scuttle was smashed, and a little water got into the cabin—it is a fact that on the 29th of May the gale abated—it is not true that the pumps were almost constantly kept going—the vessel was pumped out every two hours—it is not true that we still made sixteen to eighteen inches of water, but it was sworn to by me—on the 1st of June the carpenter reported to the mate that he could hear water rushing into the forehold—the carpenter and mate went down with a light, but the carpenter told me he could hear no water—I said, "After carefully overhauling, they could not find water, although they could dis<lb></lb>tinctly hear water coming in"—I swore to that, but it was untrue, like the whole of the document; not the whole, but the greater part—I said that the loss of the vessel was caused solely by the wind and sea, and not through any default or neglect of any person on board—I was sworn to that, but it is not true—I do not remember, when I came to London and law Mr. Holdsworth, his asking how the vessel was lost, I told him—he did not ask me—I told him that we had had very bad weather, and that no doubt the original leak was caused by the vessel touching the ground when leaving Newport harbour—we had touched the ground when we left Newport harbour, in going out of dock—we were drawing twenty<lb></lb>two feet—I don't remember telling him we were in such a state that we should have lost the ship and all hands if we had attempted to round the Cape—I did not, just before leaving the ship, order the carpenter to throw overboard the handles of the pumps—I told him to unrig them—I said if we could not save the ship nobody else should—he said she was past saving, there was ten and a half feet of water in her—the carpenter pitched one of the pump handles overboard in my sight, not by my order—I don't think I gave any order—I did not, I swear I told him to unrig the pumps—that was for the purpose of disabling the pumps, so that no one else could save her, because had she been saved it would have been evident to any person that she had been scuttled—I meant by "doing honest" to the underwriters, to take the ship to China—at the time I told the carpenter to unrig the pumps she was past recovery, a steam-engine would scarcely have taken the water out of her then—I was not drunk when I got into the gig and left the vessel—I am sure of that—I had drunk some brandy—there were three bottles drunk—I had drank the largest share—I fell asleep in the boat, and so did we all—when I was lying asleep atop of the thwarts I was awoke by the water coming up my legs—I was decidedly not drunk when I got into the boat.</p>

                  </hi>. I shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> as second mate on the 10th of April, 1866—I remained on board, except on Sunday, until the 15th of May, when she sailed—I superintended the taking on board of several cases, between three and four feet long, and seventeen or eighteen inches high—Webb said they contained carbines and revolvers, and I think he said sabres—Webb would be the person to keep the log, according to the course of the ship's duty—the log was entered on a slate in the cabin—I kept a log of my own—I did that for myself, to see how to keep a log afterwards—the entries of latitude and longitude would not be made on the slate—I should work the latitude for myself—courses and distances, and the rate of sailing would be copied from the slate—in those respects the log and slate ought to be the same—in those respects the ship's log and mine ought to be the same—when it was my watch I should make the original entry on the slate, and when it was Webb's watch he would make it—I should occasionally write remarks on the slate also—I should fill up the rate of sailing on the slate—I do not know any other source from which the ship's log-book could be made than the slate—the state of the weather and so forth was written on the slate at the end of every four hours, with observations; that is, the officer of the watch wrote it down at the end of every four hours—(<hi rend="italic">log-book produced</hi>)—my log was copied from a piece of paper, which was copied from the slate—the slate is not allowed to go out of the cabin—I copied it from the slate on to a piece of paper, and then took it to my berth and copied it in the book—the pieces of paper are gone, with my clothes, down to the bottom—on the 20th of May I find by Webb's account that the rate of the ship's sailing is a uniform rate of four knots, and never less than three knots an hour—that is not the fact—she went as much as six and a half knots sometimes, and sometimes as little as two—at the end of twenty-four hours all the entries on the slate were rubbed off, to make room for fresh ones—in Webb's log on the 21st of May I fined that the ship's sailing during the twenty-four hours was seventy-three knots, in fact the ship's sailing was forty-eight and a half knots in the twenty-four hours, by my own log-book—on the 22nd of May</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701280063"></xptr>
               <p>the logs differ considerably—on the 24th of May the mate's log shows the ship steering one course the whole day—she steered two different courses by my own log—on the 25th of May the courses and the rate of sailing do not agree with my log—neither do the courses nor the winds—nor do they agree with my log on the 28th of May—that is my own log I am looking at. (<hi rend="italic">Reading</hi>: "7.30 a.m., blowing hard, with clear weather; double-reefed the fore and main topsails, stowed the crossjack, and unbent the mizen-topsail. 9 a.m., stowed the mainsail and jib, set the main spencer. 11.30, blowing hard, ship taking in water fore and aft; passed a quantity of oranges and broken cases; bent, unfurled a new mizen-topsail. Noon, reefed the foresail, pumped ship every two hours.") That is all that day—the corresponding entry in point of date in the mate's log, beginning at 4 a.m., is (<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>:) "4 a.m., barometer fell to 29 degrees, stowed foresail, blowing a heavy gale, which completely buried the ship by the sea. At 5 a.m. a heavy squall struck the ship, which split mizen-topsail and foretop-mast staysail, and blowed terrific for one hour; several seas, breaking on board, washed our boats adrift, and straining the ship greatly; sounded the pumps, and found three feet of water in her well; set on the pumps; pumped her out, and found she was making sixteen inches an hour, having sprang a serious leak; bands constantly at the pumps. 11.30 a.m., passed some wrecked sailors' chests, boxes of oranges, apparently not long in the water, pumps constantly going"—It could not have blown so hard as that, because it happened that while I was on deck a harpoon was fetched, in order that we might see if we could catch some of the oranges which were floating past, and if it had been blowing hard I don't think we would have cared for that—on the 29th of May the ship sailed four courses by my log—I don't see that she sailed anything at all according to the mate's log—there is one course put down in the morning, but no rate of sailing—the mate's report as to the weather on that day is: "May the 29th, Tues<lb></lb>day, p.m., blowing heavy gale and cloudy, with dangerous seas on ship, reaching under close-reefed topsails; shipping heavy seas and straining much. At 5 p.m. wind suddenly shifted to N.W. in a violent squall, causing a fearful cross sea, which hit the ship in all directions, flooding the decks and cabin, and smashing the fore scuttle. Wore ship, when she lay somewhat easier. Barometer rising. At 6 p.m. the gale abated; shook out a reef of topsails. Ship very uneasy, and kept the pumps almost con<lb></lb>stantly going. Split the crossjack. Midnight, more moderate, the sea going down, made all plain sail. A.M., strong breeze and clear. 4 a.m. ditto, ditto weather. 8 a.m. light winds and clear moon; ditto weather; people employed repairing damage; carpenter repairing boats. "The state of the weather by my own log was:" Tuesday, May the 29th, blowing hard, and a heavy head sea, with clear weather. 3 p.m., ditto wind and weather. 5.30, wore ship and set the mainsail and jib shortreef out of the foresail. 7 p.m., set the mizentopsail double-reefed. 9.30, short reef out of the fore and main topsails and spanker. Midnight, set the fore and maintop-gallant sails, shook reef out of the mizentopsail, and set the mizentop-gallant sail and crossjack; latitude being observation. 3.50 p.m., fresh breeze and bright clear weather; a good deal less sea on. 2 a.m., Bet the fore royal. Noon, bright clear weather, with light breeze; people winding sails; pumped the ship every two hours"—In the early part of the night before we had been constantly making more sail—she was pumped every two hours, it might be oftener than that—they would begin every two hours, and they might leave off in ten minutes, and then</p>

               <p>they would take ten minutes in the next two hours—she was pumped twice in every four hours—the entry in the mate's log about the fearful cross seas, which hit the ship in all directions and smashed the fore scuttle, is not correct; it could not have been so, or it would have filled my cabin, which was on deck, right in the middle of the ship, where she would take in more water than where he was—on the 30th of May the wind and rate of sailing in the mate's log does not agree with mine—there is two points difference in the wind, and the rate of sailing does not agree—on the 30th of May the mate's log says, "Moderate and clear, leak seems to increase"—that is represented to be at midnight, one o'clock in the morning—the nautical day begins at noon—my entry is, "Midnight, clear weather and light winds, pumps constantly working every two hours, ship making five inches in the hour"—(<hi rend="italic">the witness then read the entries of the 1st of June</hi>)—in the mate's log it states that we passed Madeira at ten that night—by my log we passed Madeira at two p.m. on the 2nd of June—on the 3rd of June the entry in the mate's log is: "P.M., fine breeze and cloudy; car<lb></lb>penter reported he could hear water in forwards. He and the chief officer went below with a light, but could not find it out, but could hear it plainly. The leak gradually increasing. 4 p.m., ditto weather. 8, ditto weather; all plain sail set. Midnight, ditto weather; pumps at<lb></lb>tended constantly to. A.M., fine breeze and clear. 4 a.m., ditto weather, 8 a.m., ditto; crew employed' repairing head gear; carpenters required Noon, lat., by observation, 29-30 N.; long., chron., 20-12 W."—My log says, "Sunday, June 3rd, strong breeze and clear weather; 4 p.m., dry wind and weather; 8 p.m., took in the spanker-jibs and staysails; 10, fresh breeze and strong weather; midnight, dark and cloudy, people vari<lb></lb>ously employed; latitude by observation 29-8 N., long. 19-12"—The rate of sailing in the mate's log is not right, according to mine, neither lati<lb></lb>tude nor longitude; I have no entry of the carpenter's repairing—I can't say who would have the morning watch on the 3rd of June; I can tell you whose watch it was when the mate went down, because if I had been on deck the carpenter would have reported it to me, and it did not happen in my watch—I heard something of it, but I did not hear the carpenter's report, because I was below then—I saw the mate pass my cabin door with a bull's-eye lamp; where he went to I don't know, I heard afterwards. (<hi rend="italic">The witness then read the several entries from the mate's log and his own up to the 14th of June, which differed materially in most respects.</hi>) If the pumps had been constantly attended to, as stated in the mate's log, on the 12th of June, I should have entered it in mine, and another thing, I should not have got any sleep, or very little; it was right in front of my door, and made an awful noise—the meaning of "pumps constantly attended to" is that they are sounded I should imagine; if that was all I should not necessarily hear it; he has not put whether they were worked at all, he only says "constantly attended to," in other places it is "constantly going"—on the 14th of June the entry in the mate's log is: "Midnight, heavy squalls; shipping water over all. A.M., light winds and cloudy; heavy cross sea on; ship making water fearfully, and rolling heavily; crew constantly at the pumps, only stopping to clear them of the small coal and cotton seed in the pumps. Noon, latitude 16-52, and longitude 28-13 west." My entry is: "Thursday, June 14th. Course, S.W. by S.; parrots, wind E.N.E.; fine clear warm weather, with light breeze; 4 p.m., ditto wind and weather; 7 p.m., light wind, part cloudy; 9 pan, fine breeze, and clear weather; midnight, ditto wind</p>

Latitude by observation, 16-5-2; longitude, 28-11-45 W. 1 a.m., fine breeze and clear weather; 4 a.m., strong wind and mild weather 8 a.m., ditto wind and weather; noon, strong breeze, weather part cloudy. People employed fitting new upper foretopsail, foot-ropes, and securing fore lifts; one hand mending the cross jack; pumps worked every two hours, ship makes 4 to 5 inches per hour." If what is entered in the mate's log about the heavy sea, the ship making water fearfully and rolling heavily, had occurred, I should have known it and entered it; it did not happen—on the 15th of June Webb's log says: "P.M., moderate breeze and clear, thought the ship steered wild, sounded the pumps and found three feet of water in the well; set all hands at the pumps, which were frequently choked with small coal and cotton seeds. 8.20, the crew came aft and said they could not hold out much longer, and begged the captain to bear up for the nearest port. The captain told the men that he was making for Pernambuco or Bahia ever since the ship sprung a leak. Captain Layland called the officers and carpenter aft and consulted them; they were of opinion that the ship could not reach that port, but might reach Porto Baya. We then shaped our course for that port, but making small way, having too much water in her, which put her down very much by the head. Both pumps at work all night, the water still gaining on the pumps. A.M., fresh breeze under all sail, heading up for Porto Baya, but making little way; 9 a.m., the crew came aft, being exhausted and alarmed, requested the captain to put the boats, as they were afraid that the ship might founder at any moment The captain then again consulted his officers and carpenter, and they were unanimously of opinion that the ship could not reach Porto Baya, and that it would be advisable to get the boats out. Put water and provisions, in them. The chief mate and ten hands in the long boat, second mate with five hands in the first cutter left the ship at dusk, and lay to. 7 p.m., captain, carpenter, and boat's crew then left the ship, there being ten feet nine inches of water in the ship, and ship settling fast by the head. The cap<lb></lb>tain, carpenter, and boat's crew then left the ship, all three boats having a lamp on board. Captain ordered them to keep lamps burning and boats to keep together and make sail for Porto Baya, bearing about east-south-east, distance 2.50, latitude at noon 16.10 north, longitude chron, 27.50 W. "I have only half a day's log in my book:" Friday, June 15th, fine weather and strong breeae. 4 p.m., sounded the pumps as usual and found twenty inches in her; pumped for half an hour again; sounded twenty-one inches. 5 p.m., 22 inches, all hands pumping. 8 p.m., thirty-one inches. Half-past 8, hands came aft and requested the captain to bear up for the nearest port; hauled ship close to the wind and bore up for St. Vincent. Midnight, thirty-nine inches in her." That is all I have here—the same sort of weather continued the whole of the 15th—I cannot tell what time I left the ship finally—just about dusk I had gone into the cutter before I finally left, and was there five or six hours—I went into the cutter in the first place between two and three o'clock—it was part of my duty to get the provisions into the cutter—I did not see any attempt made to discover where the leak was—there was nothing in the weather to account for the ship making water so suddenly as that—I recollect coming alongside the ship to take the boy Jones on board—that was after I had gone into the cutter to superintend the provisioning of it—I observed something in the outer planking of the ship's stern, on the port quarter—I had been away from the ship about two hours and a half—I left the vessel finally about dusk—I</p>

               <p>Mr. Berwick, the Willows, Liverpool—there were some to London, but I don't know the names—I recollect taking two or three augers and a hatchet out of the carpenter's tool chest by the direction of Webb, and taking them into his berth—they were three or four feet long, they would bore a hole about an inch and a half or two inches each—I recollect leaving Newport—it was my first voyage in that ship; it was my first voyage altogether—I slept in the carpenter's room—I recollect upsetting some turpentine, and it ran along by the lamp and caught fire—I ran on deck and gave an alarm, and the boatswain and others came down, threw some oakum on the flame, and put it out; that was about a week before the ship went down—it was very fine weather on the 14th of June—I remember being called to the pump about four, or ten minutes to four—there was a leak on the 15th; we ceased pumping the vessel about twelve o'clock—I never saw the captain or mate do anything for the purpose of saving the ship—I recollect the long boat being put out—I do not recollect much of what took place afterwards—I went into the captain's gig by direction of the captain, and was afterwards passed into the long boat by order of Mr. Webb—Webb did not give me any directions—it was about half-past seven or eight in the evening when I left the ship for the last time, she was very deep in the water then—I was in the end taken on board the <hi rend="italic">Arequipa</hi> to Pernambuco—whilst I was on board there Webb told me I was to listen to the men, and if I heard them say anything about the sinking of the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> I was to let him know—after he had given me these instructions he called me aft, and asked me if I had heard anything—I said, "No," but he said that I had, only that I would not let him know anything about it—I had seen the log-book in the ship's cabin a good many times—I saw it in the cabin, and afterwards in the long boat, after we had left the ship—I afterwards saw it in a tin box, after we arrived in London, at the mate's lodgings—I was lodging with Webb at the time, in Raven Street—that was after we arrived in London from Southampton—this is not the log-book of the <hi rend="italic">Seven</hi>, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is much larger than the log-book of the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>, and much thicker and newer-looking, and the colour is not the same—it was a deal lighter at the back, and the morocco came further on to the paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and in May last I shipped in the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>—I was in the mate Webb's watch—I recollect some new sails being made for the boats about a day or so after we left Newport—I recollect the boats being caulked, and masts and spars being made for them—the carpenter did that—after that was done the boats were seaworthy, as far as I know—it is not usual to commence such work immediately after sailing from a port—I saw Webb the mate and the second mate fitting the rigging for the boats—I also saw the mate strapping the water-kegs—the boats were finished previously to the sails being finished—I believe the last sail was finished about twelve o'clock on the day she sprung a leak, the 14th of June—on that day my watch was from twelve o'clock to four—I cannot say who gave orders as to pumping the ship—there must have been orders given—I did not hear the order—another man sung out to me to pump the ship, and I went to the pumps there and then, about a quarter-past two—there were four of us pumping—Webb ought to be walking the poop the whole of the four hours, except the time he was dining—I never saw him at all until we were at the pumps—it was very fine weather—I did not see any reason for the ship making water—I assisted in the pumping—the water gained on the pumps—at six o'clock there was about two feet ten inches of water in the hold; I am not positive, I cannot say—I saw the carpenter sounding the depth from time to time—I saw Webb about five o'clock—he came forward to the pumps, and looked rather excited—when he was told the ship was making water he said it was all right; if he went to hell he had plenty of friends there—I recollect preparations being made for filling the water-kegs—that was between four and six o'clock—I did not see them filled—at eight o'clock the water still gained on the pumps—I remained pumping from eight to ten the next morning, till it was our watch below—then our watch got the boats over the side—at that time it was very moderate weather, very fine—the water still gained on the pumps—I recommended the crew being divided into crews, but it was not done—I think we breakfasted about eight o'clock that morning, perhaps earlier—the boats' tackle was got ready for the boats between eight and ten o'clock in the morning—I was at the helm—the boats were got over the side between ten and twelve o'clock, with the exception of the long boat, which was got over after—I was relieved at twelve, and went to dinner—the long boat was lowered directly after we refused to pump any longer—that was about one o'clock, when Webb, the mate, came down and said we were drifting away from land all the time, then we refused to pump any longer—eventually I got into the long boat—it was from about half-past two to three o'clock that I got into the long boat—I recollect the long boat being astern of the ship—at that time I noticed two holes in her stern—they appeared to me to have been made from the inside, as the outside was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701280070"></xptr>
               <p>splintered—the holes were from an inch and a half to two inches—they were in like a straight line—one might be a little lower than the other—. they were under the stern, about a foot and a half or two feet above the coppering, on the port side—I saw them three times at least; it was only when the ship plunged very heavily by the head that you could see them—Webb was at that time looking over the stern, almost right over where the holes were—I reported the holes—I said, "Two b----big holes in the stern"—Webb said, "Oh! it is nothing; it must have been the London carpenters that left a couple of trenails there," and that he would like to have a rope round their necks, towing them after the ship—the holes seemed capable of being plugged—if you bore a hole you can plug it—I recollect the carpenter getting into the long boat at half-past seven—I originally went into the long boat, but at that time I had got into the captain's gig—that may have been about four hours after I had spoken to Webb—Webb disappeared immediately after I spoke to him, and the first I saw of him after that was when he was getting over the side into the long boat—that might hare been a quarter of an hour after, or perhaps less—Webb took command of the long boat, and we cruised about the head of the vessel, but never went near the stern—we never went near enough to see the holes again—we never went nearer aft than the main gangway—I recollect the three boats going away—it was getting dark at the time we parted—the ship was then rather deep about the head, her fore-chains were in the water—the gig lost sight of the long boat—during the night I showed a dark lantern a couple of dozen times, and was never answered by either boats—in the end we were picked up by the <hi rend="italic">Arequipa</hi>—while on board the <hi rend="italic">Arequipa</hi> I had two or three conversations with Webb—the first con<lb></lb>versation was the day after we had played a trick upon a foreigner who was there, and who told the mate we had robbed him of a box of matches—the mate called me aft and asked me about it, and in talking I happened to mention that I saw two holes in the stern—I said a man said he saw two holes in the stern—he started and said, "Don't you believe it, for the ship was top-booted"—by "a man" I meant myself—what made me say that was that he said he would put some of them where they would not get out so easy when we got to Pernambuco—I then said I had seen them myself—he said if he was me he would say no more about it, for if I was to say it when we arrived in England he should prosecute me or anybody else that would say that; that if it cost him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he would do it—the next time I spoke to him he asked me who broke into the spirit-room—I said I did not know, but, as all command was given up of the ship, and everybody was left to do as they liked, he could not be surprised if spirits were taken—he said, "Did you take any?"—I said, "Yes, I collared a bottle that was about half full of rum, and if there had been any more I would have taken it too"—he said, "Well, I don't blame you, I should have done it myself, but it is the boatswain I want to get hold of"—he might not have said those very words, but it meant the same anyhow—I said, "I know nothing about the boatswain, all I know is that I got half a bottle of rum," I did not care whether he knew it or not—the next conversation I had with him was in Pernambuco—the first time was on the night we left the ship—the second time was when he came to me drunk at Pernambuco, in the Consul's office—he said, "Kelly, if I was you I would apologise to the captain for what you have said, because I told him"—I said, "That is very gentle<lb></lb>manly of you any way"—he said, "He told the Consul, and the Consul gave him a letter to the Magistrates in England to prosecute you"—I said,</p>

               <p>"Well, I have said nothing that I know of to induce an apology, but if I have said anything I will apologise to him"—he said, "Well, I have interceded with him, and if you do apologise to him the matter will be allowed to drop"—I said, "Thank you"—so I went to the captain; the first time he was busy and would not speak to me—there was plenty to eat on board—there was no allowance of anything—there was far more than we had signed for, far more variety, in fact we lived in the forecastle a deal better than some captains—rations were not served out, we got them whenever we liked—I saw the ship's log-book on the captain's table—I carried it up and left it on the poop—the cover was blue—the book produced is nothing like it—I rather think the log-book of the Severn was rather thicker than this.</p>

               <p>orange boxes float by, and, to give the mate something to put in his log, I told him there was a sailor's chest; that was a bit of a sensational thing—it was perfectly fictitious, or it was a lie if you like—we are not all imma<lb></lb>culate—now and then I do indulge in a little bit of fiction if I think it will cause a bit of a sensation or a fight, but I am not on my oath on all those occasions you know—I wanted to ship on board this vessel as able seaman, but the captain said I was looking too young—I represented myself as an able seaman, and asked to be shipped as such—the qualification of an able seaman is according to the intellect of the man—I had been on board a vessel previously as an able seaman, and since—the captain would not receive me as such, because I had no discharge with me—the last vessel I was in as an able seaman was the <hi rend="italic">Constitution</hi>—I did not get my discharge from her—they never give discharges out of that vessel, she is an American ship—they did not give me a discharge, nor the rest of the crew either—I was not on board the ship after the boat in which Webb was was pushed finally from the ship—I was in the boat all the time until the captain called the mate back; the mate went on board, and he and the captain went into the cabin—I followed them on board—I went and filled a bottle of water—he told me to go into the boat again—I did so, and never left till I went in the gig—I could not say how long I had been in the boat before I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> again—I was on board the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> about three minutes before I went into the boat again—I can swear that, because I had only time to go forward into the forecastle, take a bottle out, and fill it with water—the mate saw me at the barrel and said, "Go into the boat, Kelly"—I said, "All right, sir"—I was going back again, and he made me come back again and go in the boat—the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Arequipa</hi> were not all English—I do not know whether the captain was—he spoke English; they all spoke English, but there were three or four Dutchmen on board—I do not remember how long the captain and crew of the <hi rend="italic">Arequipa</hi> were at Pernambuco while I was there—I think I saw a couple of the crew once, and the captain once or twice—I never signed the pro<lb></lb>test—I was at the English Consul's office at Pernambuco, but I never heard of a protest being signed till I came to England—I told Webb that I took half a bottle of rum—he did not threaten to prosecute me for stealing some of the seamen's clothes—he said he would fetch me before the Consul—he said I stole them, but it was in consequence of the man having no bag to put his clothes in, and I put them into my bag—I was asked to take care of them; every man in the ship knew I had them, and when we got to Pernambuco I gave them up—Webb never threatened to prosecute me if I did not give them up—he asked me to leave the things in the office and I said I would, and I took them out of the bag and put them on the counter—he came in and said, "Where is the bag?" and, "Does any one know the boy's clothes?"—Webb did not have me before the Consul and charge me with detaining and stealing the clothes—it was not then that I gave them up—the only person I saw at the Consul's office was a boy of fifteen—nothing was said by him about the clothes—I never saw the Consul—there was no one present on any occasion when I had a conver<lb></lb>sation with Webb—I was spoken to in reference to this matter about six weeks after coming to England—I had been to sea again, and on account of heavy weather we had to put back to Queenstown, and there I was asked to come to London—I do not know who asked me—I do not know where I went when I did come up—I went next morning to Lloyd's—since I have been in London I have received 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week</p>

               <p>he said it was a bad job the ship springing a leak like that (the springing of the leak took place about four o'clock that afternoon), and I had better go aft to the captain to know what he intended to do with her—he said, "We are a long way from land"—I and the other men went to the captain about two or three minutes after he told us to go—the captain was in the cabin with Webb—Webb came out and asked what we wanted—I said we wanted to see the captain—he went in to tell the captain—the captain came out and asked us what we wanted—Webb was there too—we asked the captain, in Webb's presence, what he meant to do with the ship—he said he knew what to do with the ship, and he did not want us to come and tell him—he said he was running for the nighest land—we asked him how far it was, and he said a thousand miles—we asked him if there wad no land nearer than that—he said there was to windward, and we told him we had better hold for the nearest land—he told us to go forward, for he knew what to do with the ship—the vessel was hauled off about half an hour afterwards—I think she steered to the southward—the last time the men pumped was twelve o'clock the next day—when we left the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> we went in the long boat—we first got into the long boat about three o'clock in the afternoon, to rig her out, to put the masts and sails in—while I was in the long boat it dropped astern, and I saw two holes in the stern of the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>—I saw them about half-past three, I suppose about half an hour after I got into the long boat—the holes were about ten or twelve inches above the copper, and six or seven feet from the stern port—they were on the port side—I saw Webb on the poop at the time I saw the holes—I sang out to him that there were two holes in the vessel's side—I sang out so as Webb could hear, but he did not say anything, he went forward—I saw the holes two or three times when I was in the long boat—they appeared to be auger holes—they appeared to have been made from the inside, because the splinters where the auger came through were hanging from the ship—you could see the wood looking fresh where the splinters came off—there was no tar on them, I am sure of that—I know what is the top-booting of a vessel—these holes were through the top-booting—I got the long boat up to the port side of the vessel, and Webb went into the boat, and we cruised about—after I had called Webb's attention to the holes we did not go astern of the vessel again—we went a good bit off the stern—we did not go near enough to see the holes—Webb commanded the boat—after we had been cruising about for two hours we returned to the vessel—Webb went out of the boat for an hour I should say—after his return we stopped alongside for a bit, and then went away for good—we went to Pernambuco, and I came home in the <hi rend="italic">Edith Marian</hi>—I did not see any cause, except the holes, for the ship making so much water, as we had fine weather all the time—the living on board was very good.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Swede—I shipped on board the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi> as ship's carpenter—I have been a ship's carpenter and used to the sea for about ten years—I shipped in her the day before she left New<lb></lb>port—I think it was on the 17th that she got under weigh and proceeded to sea—at the time she left she appeared to be seaworthy—I remember having a breeze or some rough weather—that was about a fortnight after we left Newport—we were then close to Madeira I should think—the rough weather did not last long—after that the water had to be pumped out twice in a watch—by pumping it in that way we got the pumps to suck each time we pumped—that continued till the 14th of June—by that time we had got considerably past Madeira—before the 14th of June, and after the rough weather, the mate gave orders about pumping—we had to pump her twice in a watch—I told the mate one day, about two days after the rough weather, that one of the sailors said there was a leak in the forecastle—that was after we had orders to pump out twice every watch, and that if he liked to go down with me I would go down—we went down with a light, and made a careful examination, but did not see any signs of a leak—I did not hear any water coming in at all—after that we continued to pump as before, which kept the water down—on the 14th of June I sounded the pumps, and found water in her—that was about two minutes to four—up to that time they had pumped twice in a watch as before—when I sounded there were twenty inches of water in the ship—upon that we immediately set to work at the pumps—twenty minutes after I sounded her again, and there were twenty-one inches of water in her—the water was then gaining upon her—the crew kept pumping till the pumps drew clear water—I had not known of anything at the time which would be likely to occasion the sudden leak of the vessel—Webb came up and I told him about the leak, that it was very bad—that was in the carpenter's shop—he said, "Never mind that, carpenter; it will soon be over; it will soon be all right again, and I hope she will reach her destination in China"—he said, "When we get there I shall try and get you into my new ship, which I am going to be captain of, and I will give you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more in a month"—I had shipped to go out and home in the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>—on the evening of that day orders were given for the purpose of getting the water-kegs ready—they were</p>

I will get them punished"—that passed between us on board the <hi rend="italic">Arequipa</hi>—I told him what I had done before I left the ship, by the captain's orders; that was the unrigging the pumps—I asked him if there could be anything done to me for that—he said, "No, no, carpenter, you are all right, but keep still, and do not say anything to any one"—it would not have been possible to have saved the vessel with so much water in her, even if the pumps had not been unrigged—I went to Pernambuco, and remained there two or three days, and was one of those who made the protest—I did not give any instructions for the protest—I first heard about it at Pernambuco, at the Consul's office, before the paper was brought—I was there from nine or ten in the forenoon to four o'clock in the afternoon, standing waiting the whole time—the protest was read over in my presence by a boy about fourteen or fifteen years of age, and I signed it after the captain and mate—I came home in the <hi rend="italic">Oneida</hi> with the captain, mate, and some of the crew—the steward and I met Webb the night before we came from Pernambuco—he asked us to have a glass of beer—I said, "If you please"—he took us into a beer-shop, and asked me if I was able to make the boatswain drunk the next day, so as to make him unable to go with us in the <hi rend="italic">Oneida</hi>—I said, "I will try, but I have no money"—he then gave me two milreis to make the boatswain drunk—he said he wanted to make him drunk next day, because he did not want him in the mail boat, as he had too much to say—the boatswain is Thompson—I did not do what I could to make him drunk—I went into a public-house myself, and spent the money—Thompson did not get the benefit from it; I think he had a glass of rum before we started, but I do not know exactly—the boatswain came home in the same vessel as I did—after I came home I received a message from Lloyd's Salvage Association to go to them, and I went and told my story.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a ship and insurance broker at George Yard, Lombard Street, under the style of Smith, Simpson, and Co.—I have a partner, Mr. Simpson—I have known Holdsworth about six years altogether—I have known Berwick about a year later—I never knew Webb—I never saw him till the day before he was arrested—I knew Holdsworth and Berwick in business transactions—I had more than one transaction with them before this, acting together, jointly interested—I have frequently been in the habit of advancing money on ships in my business—I have done so on ships in which both Berwick and Holdsworth were inte<lb></lb>rested—we had advanced money to Berwick in connection with a ship, the <hi rend="italic">Jane Brown</hi>—that has been paid—in the beginning of 1866 I saw Holds<lb></lb>worth in reference to the purchase of a vessel—it was about the beginning of March—he said he had a friend who wished to purchase a ship—he did not mention the ship at that time—he said he had come to us as a broker, to divide commission; my partner then came in and he asked him what kind of ship it was—he said it was a very fine ship, it was well adapted for China, that she could sail exceedingly well, but that he could do nothing unless we relieved him of a mortgage which the ship had on it—he then informed us that the ship was already chartered at a high freight for Hong Kong, or Shanghae—we replied that was an impediment to the business—he said that should not make any difference to us, we should have our com<lb></lb>mission, provided we would only take the mortgage on the ship—we said, "Well, who is your friend who is intending to purchase her?"—he told us that he was a respectable man, named Thomas Ward, of the firm of Thomas Ward and Co.—we said, "What is the amount required?"—I did not know Thomas Ward and Co. myself—I then said that we would inquire about him—he said he would require of us about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—subsequently to that there were a number of interviews, which took place more with my partner than with me—Ward's name was mentioned by Holdsworth when we saw him again on the subject—we refused to take Ward—Holdsworth then said he knew some one we were acquainted with who was much better able and would become surety for Ward, and then he named Mr. Berwick—we replied, well, he had lost a ship not long ago, and we supposed he was in funds—he said, "Yes, he can pay over 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. immediately"—after two or three interviews a verbal arrangement was made that we were to receive 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, that we should receive a bill drawn by Mr. Holman, of Topsham, the manager of an insurance club there, for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we were also to receive two-thirds of the freight and to stand as mortgagees for from 3500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the ship and freight—it was merely a verbal guarantee, but it was confirmed by the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being brought to us—we would not deal in the matter unless we had the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701280092"></xptr>
               <p>arranged that the mortgage should be properly prepared—the owner of the ship, Thomas Ward, was to be the party to it—nobody else at that time, but subsequently Thomas Berwick joined in the mortgage on the freights and policies—after that I think there was not any fresh arrangement—there is always a great deal of pro and con before business of this kind is com<lb></lb>pleted—I think I have told you the substance of the arrangement—we were to advance from 3500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—Berwick became security at the time of the conversation about the value of the ship and the amount required—it was said that Berwick would come forward as security and would pay 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—before the business was quite completed we found that they had not enough money—bills were given to us for the repayment of the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was repaid by me to Holdsworth afterwards, on receiving these bills—I have bills in my hands representing 3764<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these bills are accepted by Berwick—upon receiving those bills we repaid the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which had been advanced to us in cash by Holdsworth, because they required money, in order that he might be enabled to fit the ship out—I presume that arrangement was with my partner at the time the money was advanced—these are bills drawn by Ward upon Berwick in our favour, deducting tho 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., there is 2764<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due on the bills—we held them as security—we asked for some other security, and we had some land in Liverpool assigned over to us—this is the mortgage on the ship, and here is also the other document, signed by Berwick—as the ship was to be mortgaged to us by Mr. Ward, Ward signed this for the purpose of carrying out that arrangement. (<hi rend="italic">The documents were put in and read: both were dated the 19th of March</hi>, 1866.) We had at that time 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash in our hands—we then agreed that we would accept drafts of Ward's for 3500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to secure which we had first of all the mortgage of the ship, and, secondly, this deed, by which Berwick binds himself to repay the 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we did not pay the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. all at once—we did not restore it on the 26th of June—we hardly knew what the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for—I rather think it was part of the original agreement that the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced was to be repaid—my partner can tell you—by the arrange<lb></lb>ment in March the bills for 3500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were to be aocepted—I have not the bills here—they passed out of my hands into Croshaw's, but they have been paid—probably my partner has got them. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Simpson.</hi> I have not got them—they are in our office—I suppose they have been paid.) The 3504<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was secured by mortgage of the ship and the guarantee of Berwick—I was aware of the fact that there was 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. freight, which had been paid for by drafts of Sir John Pirie and Co. to Sweet, and handed over by him to Croshaw in part payment—they never came to our hands—by the terms of the charter-party other drafts were to be given by Sir John Pirie, which we received—they amounted together to 2288<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that made up the whole of the freight payable under the charter-party on this side of the water until the coals arrived—these bills, amounting to 2288<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., were paid to our firm, and to that extent went in re<lb></lb>duction of our debt—we paid Mr. Croshaw the amount of his mortgage on the 30th of March—we paid 2884<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash—that cleared off all Mr. Croshaw's interest in the vessel as mortgagee—that amount was in addition to the acceptances—he also received 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that left the ship free so far as he was concerned—Mr. Sweet arranged to sell the ship for 6500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or something else, afterwards—the documents were handed to Holdsworth after the arrangement entered into between me and him—I have not myself since paid any money to Mr. Sweet—the drafts repre<lb></lb>senting</p>

               <p>the 2276<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. debt still owing to Sweet on the sale of the vessel were delivered to Holdsworth I believe—our clerk was sent with Holds<lb></lb>worth to Mr. Sweet's office—those drafts for 2276<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were paid—we re<lb></lb>ceived 2288<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from John Pirie—the balance owing to us, as nearly as I can understand it upon the whole transaction, is 3700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were fur<lb></lb>ther advances to make up the 3700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—further advances were asked for by Holdsworth after the original agreement was entered into, and it was arranged that an equitable mortgage should be given to us on land, I presume that was about the middle of May—I cannot produce the memorandum of agreement made on the 22nd of May, 1856, between Thomas Berwick of the one part, and Smith and Simpson of the other—I did not know that it would be required—I do not think it was produced at the Mansion House—it is at our solicitors' office, Messrs. Ellis, Parker, and Clark—we made further advances to Holdsworth later in the year in respect of the ship—I have got a mortgage deed here—I think the matter stands in this way, on the debit side: To our acceptance, due the 18th of September, 2276<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; same date, cash paid for fire insurance, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Donaldson and Son, notaries, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; Pirie, 691<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that does not mean a draft—that was paid to Croshaw, as part of the balance of the account—on the 22nd of May, to Thomas Ber<lb></lb>wick, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Holdsworth asked for that—that was part of the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a few days afterwards 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Thomas Berwick; then our charge for commission, five per cent, on 5623<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. freight, 284<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; commission on acceptances, 169<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and our account due this day, 428<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is a former account I presume, not on former transactions—I think they are payments for premiums principally, because the following is a premium for insurance, 535<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I remember now the 428<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was an insurance, in settling the transaction Pirie and Co. said that that ought to be paid; it was the amount of insurance on the advance of freight; and after some consideration we agreed that that should be done by an acceptance of ours—the 535<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the amount of premiums on the insurance of 8000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., their balance of interest up to that time, 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some petty expenses, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making 4669<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the credit side we received of Fraser and Co. 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 8th of May—that was brought to us by Holdsworth—then we credit the draft of Holman and Sons, which I spoke of previously, 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., less the discount, 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 662<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that leaves a balance of 3656<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that closes the account—the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. does not appear on either side of the account—our book-keeper superintended the keeping of those books—I did not look at them—Mr. Simpson did—there is Holdsworth's signature to this account in our books: "Settled and agreed on behalf of Thomas Berwick and Self, Lionel Holdsworth"—the account is headed, "Thomas Berwick, Esq., and owner,. of ship <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>, in account current with Smith, Simpson, and Co."—I think there is a memorandum at the bottom with reference to the 2288<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the amount of freight received from Pirie and Co.—it is not one of the items I have given, it appears separately on the account—that closed the account of money transactions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look again at your account, and see whether it is not now further reduced from 3700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by payment of those drafts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I see a further amount of cash paid to Croshaw of 2885<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is merely a memorandum—I did not think it necessary to read it—against that balance we still hold the equitable mortgage—the amount of insurance effected by our orders was 5500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with the exception</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701280094"></xptr>
               <p>of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was effected through Mr. Fraser—Mr. Lupton did the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for us—the policies are here, with the exception of the one done at Bristol, which our solicitor cannot lay his hands upon. (<hi rend="italic">The two produced were dated</hi> 11th <hi rend="italic">May</hi>, 1866, <hi rend="italic">in the Friend-in-Need, for</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 31<hi rend="italic">st May</hi>, 1866, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">a Lloyd's policy, on the ship Severn, valued at</hi> 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had known Mr. Holdsworth as a ship and insurance broker I presume? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—in his dealings with us in these matters he acted as broker only—in the conversa<lb></lb>tions about this vessel he asked if we could look out for a good <hi rend="italic">Coolie</hi> charter; that would be in the Chinese seas—she was consigned to our agents at Shanghae for sale—we were also instructed by him, if we failed in a <hi rend="italic">Coolie</hi> charter, to get a guano charter from the islands out in those seas; we were instructed to look out for whatever was profitable for the ship on the other side; a guano charter was certainly in contemplation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything said about authorising you, as mortgagees of the vessel, to sell her if you could at Shanghae, in case a good price could be obtained for her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We held a written authority for that purpose, not only in the mortgage, but a separate authority—the vessel was bought at a reasonable price; she had a very good freight; if sold in Shanghae she would have realised a large profit; we thought she would fetch at least 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there, from our experience of having sold other vessels there—Holdsworth has owned two ships, of which we were mortgagees—one was not sold in China, she went out to China for the purpose of sale, but she was caught in a cyclone and condemned at Hong Kong, after performing various voyages from China; the other was sold in London—we have no security whatever of any kind or nature of Mr. Holdsworth in connection with the <hi rend="italic">Severn</hi>—we looked at him only as the broker in the transaction—it was not at our request that he signed Berwick's account; it was done with our book-keeper; we did not know of it, either Mr. Simpson or myself—Mr. Crewe is our book-keeper; he will not be here, he has been for a long time in declining health, for two years past, and he has had an ague lately—he is so ill that he can hardly sit up in his bed—we received two sums of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Berwick—Holdsworth forwarded us 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash on the 20th of April—it is usual to insure over the value of the vessel; it is usually considered that we should insure double the value of a vessel to make ourselves safe—that is to secure ourselves against a variety of incidents—sometimes underwriters fail—in this case 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is gone in the Accidental Death Company—the principal reason is that of bottomry, which overrides our mortgage—we consider it necessary to over-insure to make ourselves safe as mortgagees; it is not the habit of owners to insure a vessel for double the amount.</p>

What led to that mortgage was, that the whole of the money was not forthcoming to pay up the mortgage to Croshaw—our advances were over the 2500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; we had to pay Croshaw 2884<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was a little more than we ex<lb></lb>pected, and Pirie's bills only realised between 2200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they amounted to 2288<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and realised about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less than that; the consequence was, we had to come under a larger advance than we ex<lb></lb>pected in the first instance; we were pressing Holdsworth for money to pay up the account due to Croshaw, and, as there was no money forth<lb></lb>coming, we got what security we could, and we took this—Holdsworth arranged with us that we were to have an equitable mortgage for security—he said he could give us that, when we were pressing him for money; he said, "Well, there is 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to Berwick from Holman (that is the Topsham man); I have no doubt I can get that made over to you"—then he mentioned this land; until he mentioned it we did not know of it—we paid Croshaw on the 14th of May, and we got this mortgage on the 22nd of May—we did not get the whole of the 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., we got a bill for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with a discount off, 662<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not see Berwick at all with reference to this transaction, it was all managed by Holdsworth.</p>

               <p>we wanted to negotiate them—Holdsworth brought the bills to us—they were not accepted then; they were brought by Holdsworth, he said he would get them drawn by Ward, and accepted by Berwick, if we would make up our account—the body of the bills is in Holdsworth's writing—they are drawn by Ward and accepted by Berwick—those bills, amounting together to 3774<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., represent the amount of our account, as we had made it out up to the date of the bills, in addition to interest for six months—an account was made out for the purpose of ascertaining the amount between us and Holdsworth; I have it in this book—on the 25th of June the amount owing to us was 3656<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash—we added six months' interest on the bills—this account does not go later, it is made up as you find, the interest account to the 13th of September, which was the day our bills were due, and it is credited and debited to that date—on the 28th of December the amount due was the amount of the bills, 3700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—in cash on the 25th of June, 36505<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing—on the 28th of December the bills for 3764<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were due, and 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was added for interest upon them—the bills correctly represent the amount due to us on the 28th of December—it is now more than 3700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the 25th of June it was less—these bills have been negotiated, and have never been paid—this is my endorsement upon them—Berwick has found no money for the purpose of taking up these bills—the insurances for 5500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were effected, not on the freight, on the ship—all those transactions were managed by Holdsworth—I saw him several times on the matter—I never saw him at his office—I never was in his office—he always came to us—I do not know Dean—I never heard of him, and never saw him, not in any capacity—I did not know that such a man existed.</p>

Allsopp agreed to purchase as by the contract, which I then marked A.—I did not give it to Cozens, or produce it at that time—I did not show him a contract at the first interview, when I made the statement to him—I did not know then that he was a detective—the second statement was not to the same effect—at the second statement Cozens produced the contract I had made with Smith for the fire arms—I beg to explain; the first statement was made in ignorance of who Mr. Cozens was, and Mr. Griffiths, and I did not tell them the correct way of it, not knowing who they were; but the second statement, after I knew who Cozens was, I spoke everything as it happened—the first statement was erroneous, a falsehood; and afterwards I told them the second statement, the truth—I did not tell him I had never seen the invoice, but believed the signature, "A. Smith," to be in Smith's writing; I told him I had never seen the invoice produced to me—I will not say whether I told him or not that I believed it to be Smith's writing—I do not think I told Cozen's at the first statement that I had seen Smith write letters—he did not produce the invoice and allude to it till the I second interview—I did not on the second interview tell him I had seen Smith write letters, I forget whether I did at the first—I do not think I told him I had seen him write letters once or twice in my office—I told I him I had some of his writing at present in my office—I said that be<lb></lb>cause I did not know who Cozens ivas—I said that I had never seen I Smith before he called on me last April, and that I did not know where he resided, or where the articles were stored—I never saw the arms, but I stated to Cozens that I did—I told Cozens that in the spring of 1865 I had a small vessel put into Milford Haven in distress—it ended in Captain Taylor being recommended to me as the captain of my vessel—I do not remember telling Cozens that the transaction of the arms with regard to Smith was the only one I had with him—I said at the first inter<lb></lb>view that Smith appeared to me to be between forty and fifty years of age, about five feet seven, rather short, and speaking with a mixed Irish I and American accent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And that he had a pale long face, with lightish hair and whiskers, and was shaved under the chin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought Mr. Cozens was asking me improper questions and I told him anything that came into my mind—I have not been doing that to-day—I am not in the habit of doing it—I thought he was very impertinent in doing it, and did not know who he was—I told him I thought Smith had been dealing in fire arms with the Confederate States, as he gave me to understand he had large quantities in addition to those which he had sold to Allsopp—not a word of that was true as regards Smith.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I observe that when you forwarded this to London you said, "Dear Sir, I send contract as arranged; Mr. Smith says he will send over the cases in a few days:" is that true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that is my writing—the con<lb></lb>tents of it are true, that I could do no better for him and that I would send off the cases in a few days—that was according to my instructions—it is</p>

               <p>not true that I had bargained with Smith and that he told me he would send them off, but those were my instructions—I did not sign Smith's name to any document that went down to the railway—I did not sign it to a shipping order: I swear that—I was formerly a ship master and afterwards a ship chandler—I have not been successful in business this last fifteen years—I have failed and have been bankrupt—a question was not put to me in one of my examinations at the Bankruptcy Court about my signature to a certain bill of exchange—I never denied my signature—the light first dawned on me that Cozens was a detective, at the second interview I had with him—he did not say that I was deceiving him—he did not say, "I have found you out;" nothing of the sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mind, he is coming, be careful what you are about; did not he say that he had found you out, and that you had told him a parcel of lies? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember his saying so; I am almost sure he did not—I do not remember his giving me a short time to make up my mind whether I would tell the truth; I say that he did not say so to me—I do not re<lb></lb>member his saying that if I did not tell the truth by the following Monday it would go hard with me, and I should not know the last of it till the end of my days; he did not say anything to that effect—I came up to London after that and sought an interview with Mr. Holdsworth—I told him I had been waited on by two persons about some salt—I did not tell him I was sorry I had implicated him about some salt—I never told him I thought of destroying myself—I did not tell him before I went back that I seriously thought of destroying myself—I had nothing to fear in the matter—I may have asked him to give me some money—I did not ask him for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had had transactions with him in business and the balance was in my favour—I asked him for some money and got 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sent me—I did not tell him that I had been spoken to by Cozens, who had insured my freedom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell him that Cozens or some person had said to you that not only would you have your freedom insured, but your claim admitted on the Friend-in-Need Insurance Company for the <hi rend="italic">St. George</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not about my freedom—nothing was said about the <hi rend="italic">St. George</hi> that I re<lb></lb>member—Cozens said nothing whatever to me about my claim on the Friend-in-Need for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the <hi rend="italic">St. George</hi> being satisfied.</p>

I went to No. 6, King Street, the office Holdsworth had occupied, or part of an office—I went there two or three times to look for him in the early part of October—the first time I went into the office there was a large number of papers there on the wall and hanging about the desk—when I went on a subsequent occasion they were removed, and I found fragments of papers burnt in the grats.</p>

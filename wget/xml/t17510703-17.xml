            . The prisoner offered to pawn this cup with me on the 29th of May; he told different stories about who he work'd with, so I stop'd it. He went about his business, and we heard no more of it till the 21st of June, when he came and demanded it, but my master would not deliver it. He said he was a watchman in St. James's parish, and lodg'd at a butcher's shop, but could not tell the name of the butcher. I being acquainted with an officer of the parish, went and found out the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I had a cart run over me, and after I had spent all my money and dispos'd of my cloaths, I went into St. Thomas's hospital. When I got better, I borrowed some money of one of the church wardens, and unhappily meeting with a man who ask'd me to buy this cup, and demanding 12 s. for it, I offer'd him half a guinea: I bought it for that and a full pot of beer. If I had stole it, do you think I would have told my name and where I lived?</p>

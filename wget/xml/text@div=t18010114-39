             sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness: My husband went out at ten at night, on the 6th of January; the watch then hung at the fire-side up stairs, in my house; I saw the watch there at nine o'clock, or between nine and ten; the next morning, when the prisoner came in to ask what was o'clock, I told her to look at the watch; she went away, and I did not miss it till after my husband came home; there had been nobody else in the room till my husband came home, and then he missed it; I was wasting.</p>
               <p>Q. In the bed-room? - A. Yes; I saw her look at the watch; she stayed in the room about a quarter of an hour; my husband thought I had got the watch, and did not say any thing about it till the afternoon, when I asked him what it was o'clock; and he said, I had got the watch; then I said, she must have got it; I went up stairs to her apartment, and she was gone out; then my husband went to enquire after her; she came home at night, and my husband asked her if she had got it, and she said, no, and in about an hour after, she denied it, he sent for the officer, and they found the duplicate of the watch about her.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the public office, Hatton-garden: On the 7th of January, I was sent for to search the prisoner, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; I took her up into her own room and searched her in the presence of Mrs. Gorman; the first thing I found upon her was two seven-shilling pieces in her shoe, sixpence, one halfpenny, and a farthing, and this pocket-book, with four duplicates, which was in her hair, under her cap; after that, I found the duplicate of the watch inside the lining of her stays, in the bosom; the next morning I went to a pawnbroker's in the Borough, and gave them notice to attend on the Saturday; the 7th was Wednesday; I received the watch from the pawnbroker, (produces it); the pawnbroker said the watch was pawned by a man, and as he could not identify the prisoner, he did not come.</p>
               <p>Gorman. I can swear to this as being the watch that was hanging up at my fire-side; the maker's name is Davison; when I used it, there was a bit of red ribbon to it, which it has not now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The watch was taken more out of frolic than theft; my landlady and I were very intimate, and after they made a piece of work about it, I made away with it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a painter and glazier, and live at No. 22, King-street, Old Kent-road; my brother, John Marmon, keeps the house; it is in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. On the 20th of Nov., about half-past eleven o'clock at night, on going to bed, I missed my watch, which I had left on the bed-post in the morning—I am certain I fastened the room-door when I quitted it—my sister attends to the room to make the bed—the prisoner lodged in the same house—when I entered my room, to got to bed, I found the door open—it fastens with a spring lock—I lost 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver from the drawer—there were five half-crowns—I had seen it when I went to bed on the 19th—I messed it before I missed the watch; the money and the watch were gone at the same time—the prisoner went away, I did not see her again till she was at the Police-station on the 16th of Dec.</p>

                  </hi> My husband keeps the house No. 22, King-street. The prisoner came to lodge with us on the 19th of Sept. last, and left on the 20th of Nov., the same day as the watch was missed, but before the loss was discovered—I passed her on the stairs between eight and nine that morning—I had occasion to go up to the room, and found the door open—I came out of the room, and fastened the door on the spring latch, and about twelve o'clock I found it open again—there must be great pressure used to get the door open, unless a key is applied to it—when I first went into the room I missed the watch from the bed-post, but took no notice, as he sometimes took it with him—I did not see the prisoner again till the 16th of Dec.</p>

                  </hi>. I rent the shop part of a house in Mark-lane—the house belongs to Mr. Henry William Nitton and his partner, Mr. Parker—Mr. Nitton's housekeeper lives in the house—I can go from the shop to the whole of the house without going out of doors—on Wednesday, 18th June, at a little before 6 o'clock, I was in my shop, which is a jeweller's and watch maker's—Mr. Jackson a neighbour of mine, came in that after<lb></lb>noon—he drew my attention to something—in consequence of that I looked to the shop window—I was close to the window—I observed two men looking in—I observed them both particularly—I observed one of then had a peculiar cast in his month as he seemed to be speaking to the other man—he had a hat on, I did not take notice of that—Mr. Jackson remained about four or five minutes afterwards—the two men walked away from the window after they had noticed some goods at the window—I lost sight of them—a lady and gentleman came in directly after Mr. Jackson went away—in eight or ten minutes afterwards two men came in—to the best of my belief the prisoner was one, and there was another—they wen the two men whom I had previously observed at the window—they were together—I was behind the counter—one said he wished to be shown some shirt studs in the window, pointing to a particular part—I believe it was the prisoner who asked for them—in order to get them to show, I was obliged to come round the counter to open the glass case which inclosed the window and goods—directly I opened the case I was seized round the throat and attempted to be strangled—I should say I was seized by both hands—after a deal of struggling I struck the man, and he let me go—I could not say in what part I struck him—no doubt it was in the face, because his hat was knocked off—I had rings on my right hand, with which I struck him—I looked afterwards, and my rings were smothered with blood, and there was a little piece of flesh—I thought at first I was hurt myself, but I was not hurt in the hand—the man let go, and I got from him—the other man had been stripping the window of the goods, and was making off out of the door—I pursued him, and with assistance he was taken into custody, and the property he had with him was recovered—having seen him taken I went back to my shop—I think I had been absent about a minute and a half—there was nobody in my shop—I stayed till the policeman came—I did not go after the prisoner, he was gone—all the property that Stephens had was recovered—I missed other property, to the</p>

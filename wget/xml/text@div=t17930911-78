               <p>I am a single woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in any business now? - I am an unfortunate woman; I live in <placeName id="t17930911-78-crimeloc429">Pye-street, Westminster</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17930911-78-crimeloc429" type="placeName" value="Pye-street, Westminster"></interp>

               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner before this? - I knew him so far as this, that he was a <rs id="t17930911-78-deflabel430" type="occupation">plaisterer</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you carry him home? - No, I did not carry him home.</p>
               <p>Q. You agreed to go home together? - Yes. And I put off my pockets, and put them between the sacking and the bed; in my right hand pocket there were two half crowns, in my left hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110132"></xptr>pocket there was a shilling. I went to bed, and about half after three o'clock he got out of bed, he went to bed with me, I heard him get up, and I heard him going out of the door, Thomas, said I, where are you going? no, says he, I am not going, only going backward; I thought to myself I am very afraid of your going backward, and I went to feel for my pockets, and I missed my pockets from under the place where I had put them, and before he got down stairs I went down stairs after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the pockets gone out of the room? - They were not, I missed them from the place where I put them; I followed him down stairs and I would not let him go out of doors till I asked him for my money; he said he had not the money, he had not a farthing about him, he said he never saw the money; hearing a dispute my landlady got up she struck a light and she opened the door, and hearing of that, she said, have not you got it in your shoes, and he opened his waistcoat, and there was nothing; I would not let him out, and the two patroles came to the door, I went up stairs to search my bed, in the mean time he let down his apron and they found the money; I did not see the patroles do that.</p>
               <p>Q. After you missed it how soon did you see your money? - In about an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the two half crowns, and shilling? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose hands? - In the patrole's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that money to be your's? - I don't know it for a certainty; I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when he denied having the money what did you say to it? - He said, I have money about me to be sure, and I took it, and hid it for fear she should rob me when I was gone to bed; and he said to the watchman, I insist on having it again, for it is my own money.</p>
               <p>Q. The patrole proves the taking of the money from him? - Yes.</p>

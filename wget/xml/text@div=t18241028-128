I was a little in liquor - a few words occurred between me and another man, who struck me - I gave charge of him and he of me. I had 23 s. about me when I was taken to the watch-house - there were three half-crowns; the rest were shillings and sixpences - it was Saturday night; and when I had been in the lock-up-house half an hour, I asked the watch-house keeper if he would take a guinea for my bail - he said he would not take any money, but would let me have a bed, for which I was to pay 1 s. 6 d. when he showed me the bed-room I gave him 2 s - he said he would go down and get change; I had got 6 d. and gave it to him - he gave me 1 s. back again - I went to bed, and awoke about five o'clock - I went to my purse and it was quite empty - I found the two prisoners in my bed-room - I did not charge them with taking the money, till I made enquiries of the watch-house keeper - they were searched in my presence, and had each of them 8 s. 6 d. about him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was on a Saturday night, and you had been to the pay-table, and had a little liquor - A. Yes - I was not drunk nor sober; I went very fast asleep in bed, and did not awake until five o'clock in the morning. The prisoners were not in the room when I went to bed; but I found them there in the morning - they had got locked up - I asked the watch-house keeper's wife whether I had left my money below or not - one of them is a hackney-coachman, and he was taken to the watch-house with his day's earnings as well as I with mine.</p>

            . I am the watch-house keeper. Morgan and the other man were brought in, charged by each other. Morgan was in liquor but not very drunk - he had a quantity of silver in his possession, and he offered to deposit to the amount of a guinea for his bail - the room he slept in was through my own bed-room. I saw him turn out his silver when he gave me the sixpence, I gave him back a 1 s. - he went to bed about twelve o'clock. The prisoners came in about a quarter past one o'clock, for furiously driving, and knocking a gentleman down - they wanted a bed; I said I could let them have half a bed, and they might accommodate each other - they then went into the room where the prosecutor was, and I locked them in. I did not hear of the loss of the money until about one o'clock, when my wife told me of it; the prosecutor had not then accused any person of it. The prisoners were charged with it about three o'clock, and denied it - when the prosecutor came out of his bed-room they came down with him; there were four or five other persons there; I was present when the prisoners were searched - there was 8 s. 6 d. found on each of them; one of them had two half-crowns, and the other shillings and sixpences.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your wife is not here - A. No. I am constantly at the watch-house; the constable of the night takes down the charges - I am his deputy.</p>

            . I was the constable of the night. I saw the prosecutor brought in with another man; they appeared to me to be both drunk; when he had been there an hour he said he would send for bail; I said</p>
               <p>"I dare say they are in bed" - he then offered a guinea for his bail; I said I could not take it - he then pulled out some money, and asked for a bed - I cannot say how much he had; I did not hear of the robbery till three or four o'clock in the afternoon. I think there were six males and three females in charge that night; they were in separate places, and did not mix at all. I went down and searched the two prisoners - I found 8 s. 6 d. on each of them; one of them had two half-crowns.</p>
               <p>EVANS'S Defence. The prosecutor about the middle of the day said he had left some money with the wife of the watch-house keeper; she said it was all safe if he had; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>BERRY'S Defence. He had but half a bed, and I went into the room where the prosecutor was in bed, drunk and asleep; he said the next day that he had left his money with the watch-house keeper; I had taken a sovereign of my master, and it cannot be wondered at that I had 8 s. 6 d.</p>

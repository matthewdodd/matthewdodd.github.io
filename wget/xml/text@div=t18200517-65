I marked the note the moment he went away; I had no other 10 l. note in the house - (looks at one) - this is it.

            . I am clerk to T. F. Dollman, who is a hatter, and lives in St. James's-street. On the 5th of February, about a quarter past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and said he wished to see a hat. I showed him one, and after trying it on, he said he would have another; when he tried that on, he desired me to make out a bill of the two. I went to the desk and made out a bill without a name, and presented it to him, with a receipt; he gave me a 10 l. note; I then asked his name; he said Captain 
               <persName id="t18200517-65-person684">Close</persName>
            , and the name was then put on the bill. I asked where I should send the hats; he said to Craven-street, Strand. I asked the number; he said</p>
               <p>"it is the first house you come to on the left hand after you get into the wide part of the street." He gave me a 10 l. Bank note; I took it to the counting-house and wrote Close in front, with my name and the date - (looks at one) - this is it; it has</p>
               <p>"Close, 5-2-20, C. W. B." written on it. I knew there was a Captain 
               <persName id="t18200517-65-person685">Close</persName>
            , and immediately called on Mr. Dollman, who was in the parlour, and desired him to give me change for a 10 l. note; and while he was walking towards the prisoner, I said,</p>

            . I keep a hatter's-shop in New Bond-street. About eight o'clock on the evening of the 9th of February, the prisoner came and bought two hats, which came to 2 l. 19 s. He gave me a 10 l. note; I marked it - (looks at one) - this is it. I marked it before Mr. Freeman, at Bow-street, the following day. He gave me the name of</p>

               <p>Q. Did you mix it with any other note before you marked it - A. No; I laid it on the desk on a 10 l. note, and compared it, which was signed by the same name,</p>
               <p>"Kelsal;" my suspicions arose. In three quarters of an hour I sent the hats according to his direction, and the person who went with them brought them back, saying, there was no such person there. Somebody else afterwards called for them; I delivered them to that person, then let him go, and followed him; he first took them to Richardson's coffee-house; I told him it was Joy's. He then took them to Joy's. We found, by the waiter, he had desired them to be taken in, if they were brought there. I have no doubt of the prisoner's person. I left the note in my money-chest, and kept the key; nobody has access to it but myself; I have no doubt but the note is the same.</p>

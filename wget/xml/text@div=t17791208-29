When I was going to bed I perceived I had lost wearing apparel out of my room to the amount of 10 l. I had put them some time before into baskets to sell. I had seen them there the same day. The baskets were left. They were taken out of the one-pair-of-stairs room. The one-pair-of-stair's window was opened, and the shutter forced in and split through the middle, so that there was room enough for a man to get in; that window is about twelve feet from the ground. My drawers were broke open. The prisoners were all in my house drinking almost all day, till ten o'clock at night. Wiley, Woodmore, and Mulvey, had been at my house once or twice before. I knew them, but did not know the others.</p>
               <p>Are you sure Fetter and Steward were in their company? - Yes; they were there before I was up in the morning, and staid till ten at night; Mulvey and Fetter went out first about ten o'clock; they left Wiley and Woodmore behind.</p>
               <p>What became of Steward? - I do not know any thing of him. I cannot say whether he was in the house or not. Wiley and Woodmore staid half an hour after Mulvey and Fetter; then they went away. When I missed the things the prisoners were all gone. I fastened the doors after they went away, but had not been in the room from whence the things were taken all the evensing.</p>

               <p>I know Mulvey, Woodmore, Wiley, and Fetter. I went to Mr. Farley's about half past nine o'clock to have a pint of beer; they were all there then. I staid till a quarter past ten.

I went out twice; the first time to make water; at that time I saw Fetter at the window, and the others on the opposite side of the way; when I came back again into the house (I did not stay above five minutes) the prisoners had all gone out just before me; I staid behind; Wiley said I should go home with him, but did not bid me stay for him. Fetter, when he was looking out of the window, said, are they up? Wiley said, d - n your eyes! no. Fetter chucked the things out of the window; Wiley and Woodmore took them up; this was not till after the second time, when I went out to go home that this happened.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said the first time you went out? - No; Fetter stood looking out of the window, and the others stood on the other side of the way. It was a dark night. When I went first to the house three of them were sitting on the bench at the door. Fetter was one of the three.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the prosecutor, when you went in again, that you saw Fetter in at the window? - No; Wiley said, if the old man comes out, d - n my eyes! I will knock him on the head. I thought my life as sweet as any body's.</p>
               <p>Did he say that when you went out to make water? - No; when I went out to go home; (my uncle and aunt live about three or four hundred yards off) I ran home and told them, but they did not take any notice of it that night. I was afraid to stir out again that night. I knew Wiley and Woodmore before, but I did not know Fetter and Mulvey's name. In the morning my uncle sent for the constable, and I and the constable went down to the prosecutor's house.</p>

Kilby and I went away together, and Wiley and Woodmore followed us out; Wiley said Kilby should not go home, he should go along with him, that was just as they came out of the house; Kilby said he would go home.</p>
               <p>While Kilby and you were there how often did Kilby go out? - Once, to make water, that was about five minutes, or a little better, before we went away.</p>
               <p>Who were in the house when he went out to make water? - I believe both

             and Woodmore.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself and tell me whether you are sure they were both in the house then? - I believe Wiley had gone out just before; Woodmore was in the house, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see Mulvey and Fetter in the house at all? - No, we went out and Wiley and Woodmore followed close after us, and said if we spoke a word they would kill us. Fetter looked out at the window and said are they up? Wiley answered no, d - n your eyes! then Mr. Farley or somebody in the house shut the door; then I saw Fetter throw the things out of the window, and Mulvey picked them up; Wiley staggered,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080038"></xptr>stooped, and said he had picked up a prize, and then we went to Jack Kilby's aunt's.</p>
               <p>You did not go back to tell the man his house was robbed? - No, we were afraid to go back; we stood opposite his aunt's door, and thought we heard somebody whistle, presently after we saw three men come up Mount Pleasant, one had a bundle, whether it was them or no, I do not know.</p>
               <p>How long did you stand opposite his aunt's door? - About ten minutes; there was nobody at it; I went home, and left Kilby standing there; the next day I was along with Kilby about eight o'clock; he had told his uncle and his uncle had sent up to Mr. Kippen; about one o'clock we saw Woodmore at Mount Pleasant, he said he wanted to speak to us, and wanted us to go to the dust-hill, Wiley was there.</p>

               <p>On the 16th of November I met two men in Crawford's Passage with two bundles.</p>
               <p>Is that the passage from Mr. Farley's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who were they? - Mulvey and Fetter. I saw them by the light of the lamp; I believe it was them, but I cannot swear it. From what I could see of them by the light of the lamp I think it was them, they both had bundles. When I came opposite Mr. Farley's window I picked up something white, Wiley laid hold of it, and cried halves, and took it from me; it was something like a clout, but what it was I cannot tell, that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Mulvey. At the justice's she said she knew no more of me than the child unborn; that she could not tell them from Adam.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On a Wednesday, I think it was the 17th of November, I was sent for before I was out of bed by Mr. Hilliard, who is Kilby's uncle; I got up directly and went to Mr. Hilliard's, and then went to Mr. Farley; on being informed he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080039"></xptr>robbed, I went up stairs to see how it had been done. I saw the glass of the casement was broke, and the inside shutter split a great length. While I was there the two lads came in to acquaint Farley about the matter, and in consequence of what they told me I got two brother officers and went after them; we took Fetter and Mulvey; we searched them, but found nothing upon them. I searched Fetter's lodgings, but did not find any thing; Mulvey refused to tell us where he lodged. In the evening I went into the Cock and Hoop at Holborn Bars, and found Wiley and Woodmore there by accident; I tied them together, and put them in a coach; I searched them but found nothing upon them; I could not find their lodging.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Roodle, who lives in Nelson-square, Blackfriars-road. We take bread from the prosecutor; I paid the prisoner 6s. on the <rs id="t18290716-45-cd259" type="crimeDate">20th of June</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you known him before? A. Yes, by his bringing bread - this is the bill which he wrote "Paid" on: I am sure I paid him- he knew that I kept the bill.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had you asked him about this money before he went? A. I was not aware he had received it - he was to account every day; I had booked his bread, but I had not asked him for the money - I made a regular rule with him that he was to pay me; I never allowed my wife to receive money for me; she has received money in my absence - she says she has not received this.</p>

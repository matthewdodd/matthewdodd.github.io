I a ma cabinet maker—I followed Smith into the house when she was brought back, and saw the florin bent—when she left I followed her up Bear Street, and saw the prisoner Rogers about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Tipple's, looking across the road towards Smith—they both went along on opposite sides of the street—Smith then crossed over to him, and they both went down Wells Street—I lost sight of them, but saw them afterwards turning down St. Thomas's Place—I lost sight of them again, and saw them again standing in Lime Grove, talking, and I fancy something passed from one to the other—they came up Lime Grove and passed a van, where I told Rogers to stop, as somebody wanted to speak to him—he turned to run away—I caught hold of him, and he began punching me, and kept doing so till a policeman came—I then took Smith, and told her she had been passing a bad florin to Mr. Tipple—I struggled with Rogers between the van and the pavement.</p>

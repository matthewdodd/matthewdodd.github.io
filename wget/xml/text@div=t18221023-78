I followed, and tried to stop him - but he got from me. I followed and seized him by Kingsland-road, about seven houses from where I first saw him. Just as I took him he put his hand into his pocket, and whipped the spoon out over a wall, and said,</p>
               <p>"What are you taking hold of me for, I have got nothing" - I said,</p>
               <p>"No, you have thrown it out of your pocket." He said he did not take the spoon, but another boy had; I took him to Davis's, the King's Head, public-house, and left him there.</p>

             - we keep a public-house in the Kingsland-road. The prisoner was in the tap-room about quarter past one o'clock, with others - they staid about ten minutes, and in consequence of what was said, I looked, and missed a spoon of the table - I ran in pursuit of the prisoner, who had left the house just before. I saw him running, and pursued him calling Stop thief!</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many were in the house - A. I cannot say. Some were much older than him. I think one went out with him. The alarm was given the moment he went out.</p>

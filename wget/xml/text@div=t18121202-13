            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Broughton. On the 9th of November, between one and two o'clock, the two prisoners came into the shop, and asked to look at some worsted stockings, which were shewn them. They said, they were too small; they asked to look at a size larger. One of the prisoner went to the further end of the counter, and took up some black veils.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which - A. Foster, I believe. The gloves were laying under the veils, which I had put out of my hands about five minutes before the prisoner came in. After the prisoners went out of the shop a gentleman came in for gloves. I looked for these gloves. I could not find them. I had my suspicions then, as no other person had been at that end of the counter.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 9th of November I was sent for at Mr. Stiles, a linen draper, in Bishopsgate-street. He gave me charge of the two prisoners, for having robbed him of oambric. That was about two o'clock. I searched the prisoners, but found nothing on their persons. There were at that time two large bundles standing on the counter. I told the prisoners, they must go with me. They said, the must take their bundles. They each of them took a bundle. I asked them, whose bundles they were. They said, they were their own bundles. I asked them, what was in them. They said, they were some clothes that they had brought from home; they were going to carry to a friend in the Borough. I told them, I would take care of the bundles, and I took them into custody. At that moment Sapwell, the officer, came up. I desired him to take the bundles. We then proceeded, in company with the prisoners, to the Compter. When we returned we found the gloves and the stockings in the bundle. Sapwell has had the bundles ever since. Mr. Stiles's is opposite of Mr. Broughton's.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SAPWELL. I produce the bundles. I went, on the 9th, to Mr. Broughton's to ask him whether he had lost any gloves and stockings. The stockings and gloves were all in one bundle.</p>

            What else was there - A. A number of other articles, cargo; no clothes. I received the bundles of Mr. Stiles shopman. They have never been out of my custody.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The gloves and stockings are my property. I had every reason to believe the stockings are mine. The gloves being in paper, I know they are mine by mark on the paper.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in John-street, Regent-street, Lambeth—the pri<lb></lb>soners lodged in my house eighteen months—they are man and wife. On Saturday, the 9th of June, I missed the articles stated, which are worth at least 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I kept the greatest part of them in my bed-room, in a drawer and box—the silk dress, shawl, and some books, were in a chest of drawers, not in my bed-room—the prisoners had no access to my bed-room—it was not kept locked—they were living in the house, at the time I missed the things, but I had no suspicion of them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I took the prisoners into custody on Sun<lb></lb>day, the 10th—I searched their room, and found this flannel, calico, spoons, bit of silk, a window-blind, a pair of braces, some duplicates, ear-rings, and a silver spoon—the female prisoner was present at the time I found them—she said some of them were hers—not all—not the spoons—I understood her the flannel was hers, the braces, one of the towels, and this cap—these duplicates I found on the table in this little pocket-book—I do not know whose pocket-book it is—I did not ask—Mrs. Theeuf was then gone to the station, and the male prisoner had not come home.</p>

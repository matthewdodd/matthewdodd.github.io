On the 29th of January, about eight o'clock at night, I bolted my back door, fastened the window, went out, and double-locked the front door. I returned about a quarter before nine - on putting the key into the door it opened - I found Clark coming down stairs from my bedroom; I knew him before - he lived a few doors from me. I went into the parlour, found the drawers broken open, all my clothes taken out and put on the table - they were locked. I left a bunch of keys in one of the drawers, but one was broken open, as the key would not open it. Clark ran out, and was brought back soon after. I am sure he was the person. The other two were secured in my back yard by the officer - they all three lived in the neighbourhood with their parents. Pritchard lived next door, his mother worked for me, and he used to clean my knives - he knew the house. The articles stated in the indictment were on the table, except the spoon, which I have not found; it was in the tea-chest.</p>

            . I am constable of Stepney. I was fetched to the house, and found Clark there - somebody had brought him back. I went into the back yard, and found the kitchen window open, and a table under the window with footmarks on it - it was a dirty night. I took Clark to the watch-house, with the property. When I returned Catling brought the other prisoners to me. I found two knives in Wright's pocket; they were talking to each other when their friends were at the watch-house. They were neither threatened or promised, Wright said to Pritchard,</p>
               <p>"You broke the tea-chest open with this knife." Pritchard said,</p>
               <p>"No, it was not with that, it was with the other." I heard them say they took the tea-chest to Webb-square, broke it open as they went, and took the spoon out; that the man looked at it, said it was only brass, and threw it behind the grate; he would not buy the tea-chest.</p>

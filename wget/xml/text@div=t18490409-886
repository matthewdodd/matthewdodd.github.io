                  </hi>. I am shopman to a grocer, at 42, King-street, Snow-hill. On Tuesday morning, 27th Feb., between eight and nine o'clock, I was at the shop-door, and saw the prisoner coming down King-street, with another man, driving some beasts—just as the beasts got to the corner of Fox and Knot-court, the deceased and another man or two were standing at the corner of the court—the man who was with the prisoner called out to the deceased, as he was about to cross the front of the beasts, and told him to stop—the hallooing frightened one of the beasts, and it ran away, when it again joined the remainder, and was about to enter the court—the deceased ran in front of the beasts, and turned them back again, and I had great trouble to keep them out of my master's window and door—the prisoner called out to the deceased, and said, "What did you run across the beasts for, and turn them back?"—the deceased said, "Why did not you call to me?"—the prison said, "I did; besides, have you hot eyes to see?"—the man who was with the prisoner said, "I should like to cut you across the a—with a stick"—the prisoner then said, "I should like to <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> your bead for you"—deceased said, "You can't do it; I should like to catch you at it"—the prisoner said to him again, "I will <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> your b----y head for you if you do not go away"—the prisoner had a stick in his right hand, which he changed into his left, and raised his hand and arm, as if to hit the deceased; but he did not strike him—he turned away about half a dozen yards, towards the court—the deceased called after him, "You had better do it; it will take a better man than you to do it"—the prisoner then turned round again, and hit him in the face with his fist—the deceased returned several blows; they doted in each other's arms, and fell both together; they then got up, and the prisoner was stooping down, picking up his cap, which fell while they were struggling, and the deceased hit him some blows upwards, about the face and head—the prisoner then got into an upright position again, and was putting his cap on, and I have no doubt would have gone away without taking further notice of it, but the deceased went and struck him several more blows, about the face and head, before he was aware of it—they closed in each other's</p>

               <p>arms again, and fell down together; the deceased fell undermost, with the back of his head on the stones, and that cut his head—the prisoner then went away, and did not take any further notice—a man assisted up the deceased, and he rather hesitated to go to a doctor; he did afterwards go—I saw him pass our shop the same evening, and look in—I went out to him, and he asked roe if I knew where the man lived with whom he had been fighting in the morning—I told him I did not, but that he worked somewhere down the yard—he did not seem to be very bad; he had been at work all day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pewterer. On Tuesday morning, 27tb Feb., I was coming down Snow-hill, about a quarter, or twenty minutes before nipe. I saw the prisoner and the deceased quarrelling by Fox and Kuot-court—I beard the prisoner say to the deceased that he would jfcnock hit b----head off—I turned to look for a policeman, and when I turned back again the prisoner had walked away three or four steps from deceased—he then returned and said, "If you say that again I will knock your b----head off"—I did not bear the deceased say anything to him—I cannot say whether he did or not—I then saw the prisoner change his stick from his right to his left hand—he then struck the deceased on his head or face—the deceased returned the blows—a regular fight then took place between them, they fell together, the deceased undermost—they got up and fought again—they bad three or four rounds—they then closed again, and fell with the deceased undermost—bis head struck on the pavement stones, and the blood flowed—J piotai the prisoner off the deceased, and told him he ought to be ashamed to act in such a manner—he walked away, and said nothing—I picked up the de<lb></lb>ceased, and took him to Mr. Munday the surgeon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and I live in Finsbury-circus—I attended the deceased on the 2d March, at his own home—he was in a state of consi<lb></lb>derable stupor, and complained of great pain over the head and neck, and at the back of his head there was a cut about three-quarters of an inch long, with a plaister on it, bearing the St. Bartholomew's Hospital mark—I took the plaister from it, and found it had apparently healed—I ordered him leeches, and he was relieved towards night—on the Sunday following erysipelas of a very severe character came on—he continued to get worse until the Wednes<lb></lb>day morning, when he died—the cause of the erysipelas admits of a reason<lb></lb>able doubt—it may have come on from the leech bitea or been the result of the wound—to form an opinion of the cause of death I think we should have a statement of the facts, his state of living, and the amount of drink he took—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination next day, and found a considerable amount of extravasation about the neck and brain—the brain was consider<lb></lb>ably congested, but there was no fracture of the skull.</p>

               <p>I have known the prisoner two months, within the course of that time I have frequently observed him at an early hour with fat on his head; I saw him of this night come out of the Cross Keys meuse yard, which adjoins to the workshop of the prosecutor; I suspected him, that place not being a thoroughfare; it was about four o'clock in the morning, there was another man with him, they had bundles on their heads; they ran off, I attempted to stop them; not being able to do that, I pursued them and called to another watchman to stop them, upon which the prisoner threw the bundle off his head; I pursued the prisoner immediately and never lost sight of him; I apprehended him; I afterwards gave notice to the prosecutor that the man was in custody, because I suspected the fat we found belonged to him, as his workshop adjoined.</p>

               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether I did not surrender voluntarily? - No, he attempted to make his escape; he did not surrender voluntarily.</p>

I am a watchmaker, and live in Jubilee-place, Commercial-road East, in the parish of Stepney; I rent the house, and live there; I keep a show of watches and jewellery in the front parlour window. On the 12th of July I left home between twelve and one o'clock in the day—I returned in about twenty minutes, or a quarter of an hour, and missed a watch from the parlour-window, which was under my care to repair—a pane of glass was broken and a piece taken out—there was space sufficient for two hands to be introduced—this is the watch.</p>

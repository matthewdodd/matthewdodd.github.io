I advis'd them not to fall out, but to agree and be Friends; And I was in hopes they would have taken that advice, for the Prisoner Jones was going away, but Bullock another of the Soldiers, came up to the Baker, and said, Sirrah you are a Scoundrel, and he shall thrash you, and so the Baker and Newsham, fell to fighting. The Baker was too hard for Newsham, which the Soldiers perceiving, one of them help'd up Newsham when he was down. The Deceas'd standing by said, that that was not fair play, upon which the Prisoner Jones, knock'd him down, and then struck at me, which my Son seeing be Collar'd Jones, and in strugling they tumbled one another down the side of and the Deceas'd went after them. Most of the Soldier's Arms, and some of their Cloths, lay on a heap together; The Prisoner Peircy went to that heap. and took out a Sword or a Bayonet. I am not certain which, and ran down the Hill after the rest.</p>

I detected him in the room where I deposited them, about three o'clock Myself and an officer was concealed in the parlour. At about ten minutes past three in the morning, the prisoner came into the room. We detected him as soon as he came into the room, before he took any thing; the officer took him in custody. About ten o'clock, the same day, the officer searched his premises, and found three papers of copper; two five-shilling papers of halfpence, and one five-shilling paper of penny-pieces, and one paper with a few halfpence in it; there might be forty. I did not count them. I could not swear to the money. I have every reason to believe they are mine, by the papers. The officer has the papers.</p>

            . I was employed to detect some person that the prosecutor thought robbed him. I sat up in his room on Thursday morning the 31st of May; about three o'clock, the prisoner came into his room where the closet was. While the prisoner was going to the closet where the money was, I rushed out of another close to it, and took him into custody. On Friday night I marked the money. On searching the prisoner's house I found three papers with them halfpence of my marking in his custody. I found these halfpence, two five-shillingsworth, and another paper with forty halfpence in it. These are the several halfpence that I marked S M upon the back of the papers. On Tuesday I took the prisoner into custody; on Friday I marked them all S M. Mr. Lee saw me mark them, and Mrs. Lee, I believe. I marked the penny-pieces as well as the halfpence.</p>
               <p>COURT, to Prosecutor. Had you ever paid away these papers marked by Miller - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. You told my lord that your wife paid the prisoner on Saturday night; of course, how she paid him you are not aware - A. No.</p>

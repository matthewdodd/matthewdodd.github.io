It was found by Howard, a parish constable; Sir Edward brought him with him, I saw him find it, I have got the seal; I searched the drawer in the first instance, I could find no seal, I had shut the drawer and left it. Sir Edward requested the drawer to be searched again.</p>

               <p>Court. There is no bales of cloth mentioned in the indictment - A. It was mentioned in the warrant.

               <p>Q. You were not at Sion-hall on the 2d of August - A. The house was three months in repair, and at this time there was only a servant man and maid there.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there a servant maid there on the 2d of August - A. There was; I wish to be correct, I am not vindicative against the prisoner, by no means, whether she was in the house I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not tell us your motive, nobody has imputed it to you - A. She had the care of the house, but whether she was there about two o'clock I cannot say; the maid servant came there about June and had the care of the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You were not there on the 2d of August - A.

               <p>Q. And he was concerned with you in the woollen cloth trade when you lost this seal - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose before you lost the seal there was a dispute between him and you on money concerns - A. Not a shilling due to him, he was to obtain the goods and sell them under my approbation to the amount of my acceptance.</p>
               <p>Q. These acceptances are all paid are they not - A. No. They are not; I have offered to pay for the amount of the cloths that were in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take out the search warrant for the woollen goods and the other articles on the 4th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. The woollen goods is not in your indictment - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the woollen goods - A. Fifteen hundred pound.</p>
               <p>Q. And in the indictment you put in the seal, value thirty shillings, and you do not put in the woollen goods of fifteen hundred pound. The clothiers have not been paid, have they - A. No, they are not; they have claimed the goods.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take a constable to the police office instead of making your complaint in a regular way - A. Because I understood I could take him in custody for felony, accordingly I went for a search warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think that you could not go to Hatton-garden office and obtain a warrant without taking a constable; why did not you go to Marlborough-street office, that was nearer to you. Upon your oath were not you standing close by Wood, the officer, at the time that he searched the drawer in which the seal was found - A. I know he searched a drawer, I do not know whether that is the drawer or no.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no distinction of rank and birth here, those who shuffle in answering will be committed. Were not you standing close by the drawer at the time that Wood searched the drawer - A. I was standing in the middle of the room while the drawer was searched all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath were not you standing close by Wood at the time he searched the drawer - A. I am satisfied I was in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. I will give you no permission to prevaricate, there is a plain question, I expect a plain answer. At the time Wood was searching the drawer for the seal, and when the seal was afterwards found were not you close by him - A. I know I stood in the room, upon my life, I do not know that I stood by the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a plain question, and if you expect to be believed you must give a plain answer. Upon your oath were not you close by the officer, Wood, at the time he was searching the drawer - A. I believe I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how dare you to say that you did not know upon your oath, after the officer had searched that drawer and had not found any thing, were you close by the drawers still - A. Yes, I was, but he was between me and the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had the seal in your possession you had the power to put it in, you were near enough to put it in - A. Yes, if I was the base villain to do that.</p>

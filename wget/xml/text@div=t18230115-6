On the 7th of December, I went out about eight o'clock in the morning, to Poland-street. Mrs. M'Lean came there to me between six and seven o'clock in the evening, and said somebody had broken into the parlour. I returned home - I unlocked the parlour door where I lodge, and found it bolted inside. A man got in at the window, and unbolted it. I found two child's frocks on the sofa bedstead - I had left them in the drawers a day or two before, and had not moved them. Some of the drawers were partly open; I had left them shut. Nobody but me lodged there. I left the window shut and the blinds also, in the morning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You were much alarmed - A. Rather so. I took some things out of the drawers, and mixed them with those on the sofa; but I saw the frocks there before that. The man who got in at the window is not here. The frocks belong to a lady, who I had them from to make others like them.</p>

            . Pashley lives at my father's house, whose Christian name is James. On the 7th of December, a little past six o'clock, I was going out, and as I shut the parlour door I observed the window and blinds wide open. I knocked at the door, and then saw the prisoner getting out of the window - I am certain of him; he jumped down from the rails and ran off. There was no light but from the lamps. I could not see his face, but I kept within a yard of him all the way, and never lost sight of him till I caught him about a hundred yards off, at the corner of Archer-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you an opportunity of observing his face - A. No. I knocked at the door and called out mother before I saw him come out; my face was towards the window - nobody was between me and him. He jumped off the window railing and ran off - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150006"></xptr>caught hold of him myself. He always said that I was mistaken, that he was not the person; but I am certain of him.</p>

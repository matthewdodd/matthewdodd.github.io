                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Paddington Cottages. I came, on the 18th of November, after seven o'clock in the evening, from the Bank in an omnibus, and got out at the Wheatsheaf public-house, in the Edgeware-road—I was going to Church-street, to cross Paddington-green—the prisoner overtook me, and tapped me on the shoulder—I asked what he wanted—he offered to strike me, but did not hurt me in the least—he shifted his fist up, but did not throw his arm out much—I tried to get away from him—he did not lay hold of me, but snatched hold of my veil, and before part of it from my bonnet—be put it into his pocket, and went off—I</p>

               <p>called the policeman—he took most of it—he left very little remaining—I gave an alarm—he still remained on the green, and did not try to get away—I lost sight of him till after I got on the green—he was stopped by a person—I called, "Police," that was all—I am quite sure he is the man—I do not think he intended to rob me—I think he was in a state of drunkenness—he said something to me, I do not know what, for I was very much frightened—and he said something at the time he took the veil, but I do not know what—I thought him drunk, but I was not certain of it till I got to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman—I was against the Wheat-sheaf, at the corner of Church-street. A gentleman came by, and said a lady was robbed on Paddington-green—I went there, and saw the prose<lb></lb>cutrix, and a gentleman standing on the green with the prisoner—she said she was robbed of her veil, and the prisoner was the man—I took him to the station-house—he pulled off his coat and hat, and shook it on the ground—he said he knew nothing about it—I found nothing on him—he had plenty of opportunity of getting rid of the veil—another constable searched his coat, and found it in his coat-pocket on the ground—he seemed very drunk, and would not give any account of it—he said nothing at all about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was passing along Paddington-green, and heard a lady cry out, "I am robbed!" in a faint voice. I immediately went across toward where the cry proceeded, and found a man running in that direction—I told the man, if he did not stop I would knock him down—I said, "What have you done?"—he said, "I have not robbed any body"—it turned out to be the prisoner—he tried to secrete himself behind one of the trees, but in a manner like a drunken man—he seemed intoxicated—the lady came up, and said she had been robbed—soon after, the police-man came up, and took the man into custody; and when he got towards the lady, she said, "That is the man; he has got the veil in his pocket"—it was found in his pocket at the station-house.</p>

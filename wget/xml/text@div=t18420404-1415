                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, and live in Dover-place West, Kent-road. The prisoner occasionally lodged with me—sometime ago a customer of mine left a pencil-case in my shop, which I put on my sitting-room mantel-piece—I missed it—I said nothing to the prisoner about it—I never gave it to him, or authorized him to take it—this now produced is it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whose pencil-case was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It belonged to a gentleman who left it at my shop—I do not know his name—I have some idea who he is, but am not positive—I think it is Mr. John Hearn's, who came to me on business—he is the only person I can suspect of having brought it—several others had been in the shop the same evening—he lives at No. 19, Trinity-street—I did not write to ask him whether he had left it—I did not think of that—I thought the next time he called I might show it to him—I missed it on the 11th of February, about three days after I had found it, which was about three months ago—as it was missing, it was no use applying to Mr. Hearn—it was found in Feb<lb></lb>ruary—I never sent to him, because it was missing, and if I had it not to produce how could I ask him if it was his?—he has called at my house many times since—I did not tell him I had found a pencil-case, which I thought was his, because it was missing, and I could not produce it—I have never told him up to this moment—I gave the prisoner into custody last Thursday night—I have not seen Mr. Hearn since the pencil-case has been recovered—a letter would reach him certainly—I gave the prisoner in charge first, on suspicion of stealing a coat and umbrella—the coat was the first charge—the coat alone, without the umbrella—he was discharged</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184204040262"></xptr>
               <p>by the inspector at the station on that charge, without being taken before a Magistrate—that was on Thursday night—some duplicates were produced on that occasion—I do not know how many—I heard some of them read out at the station—there was nothing to prevent my hearing them all read, but I did not pay attention at the time—I could not, because the prisoner was begging and praying of me at the time to withdraw the charge—the inspector did not read them out very loud—I did not hear the du<lb></lb>plicate for this pencil-case read out that night—I gave the prisoner into custody again, about six o'clock next rooming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, between the Thursday night when he was discharged and six o'clock next morning, pay a visit to his father? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, at five in the morning—I went to tell him I intended to give the prisoner a second time into custody, and that he pleaded very much for me not to proceed with the case, and said he should very likely be transported, or lose his situation—the inspector and the policeman heard the prisoner say that to me in the station—after that the prisoner greatly insulted me—I told his father that, and that there were a great many duplicates in his posses<lb></lb>sion, that I could find a clue, not only to the coat, but also to other things I had missed, and that I had given him in charge again—I had not done so then—that was all that occurred with the father—I swear that—I did not ask him to give me a bill for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. not then—the father called me aside at Union Hall that day after I had given the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody a second time—the charge was then for stealing the coat and umbrella—the same coat with which I had charged him the night before—I had consented to withdraw the charge the night before, thinking I might find it by going round to the pawnbrokers—I withdrew it for the present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the same inspector take the second charge after hav<lb></lb>ing discharged him before for the same article? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know his name.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And the same constable took him up, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was then taken before a Magistrate—he was not about to be discharged from that when I preferred the present charge—the Magistrate was not about to discharge him, that I know of—I swear that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he was not about to be discharged from stealing the coat and um<lb></lb>brella, why have you not indicted him for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The charge was made for the pencil-case, after going round to the pawnbrokers to see if the umbrella belonged to me—he was not indicted for the coat and umbrella, because they were not clearly proved—I saw the duplicate of a pencil-case—I thought it to be mine—I went to the pawnbroker's and examined it, and claimed it, at least as the one that was left at my house—it was not when the Magistrate was about to dismiss the charge about the coat and umbrella, that I preferred this charge—I swear that—I produced the pawnbroker's man to prove that the prisoner had pawned it—the pawn-broker said it was the pencil-case that was brought, but he could not swear to the prisoner as the person that pawned it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner upon that, immediately say, "I have nothing to deny, it was me that pawned it—that man (meaning yourself) sold it to me?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He acknowledged pawning it—he did so voluntarily, and he immediately said to me, "You stole it"—he said he bought it of me for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the only reason for my not mentioning the pencil-case to Mr. Hearn, was, because it was lost, and I could not then show it him—I do not know why I have not brought him here to identify it—I asked the</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 223.) I took the prisoner into custody on a charge of stealing a coat and umbrella—that charge was dismissed—he was charged again at six o'clock next morning, on suspi<lb></lb>cion that it might lead to some other missing property, which had been pledged—the property was not named at that time—no property was named in the second charge—he had a quantity of duplicates in his pos<lb></lb>session, among which was one for a pencil-case, pledged for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was not named at the time I took him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been a policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Eighteen months—the first charge was the coat and umbrella—I am sure the umbrella was named in the first charge—I cannot be mistaken in that—he was set at liberty from that by the inspector—Mr. Newsome gave him in charge the second time, at six o'clock next morning, on suspicion of stealing some more property, not named—he was given in charge on suspicion of felony—that was what Mr. Newsome said—I did not ask what felony—he said he would tell the inspector when he got to the station—I took him to the station—I did not then know what he was charged with—I am positive the umbrella was named in the charge on Thursday night—it was not from the addition of the umbrella to the coat, that he was taken on Friday morning—the inspector is not here—he was only the acting in<lb></lb>spector on duty—it was Sergeant Logan—he read over the duplicates in the station on Thursday night—I looked at them, and saw them in his hand—I did not hear him read them out, not to take any notice—I counted them over, and there was thirteen, after the inspector gave them into my hand—I did not read them—he read them out loud—he read them to satisfy himself—he read them over to Mr. Newsome, I believe, and among them was the coat and umbrella—I believe he read them over to Mr. New<lb></lb>some that he might attend, and claim anything named in them, which belonged to him—I did not pay particular attention to them—I cannot say that Mr. Newsome heard every one more than I did—Mr. Newsome and I were standing outside, and the inspector was inside—I cannot say that he read them to Mr. Newsome.</p>

               <p>Newsome—that was on the Thursday night—Mr. Newsome first made the charge about the pencil-case when I took the prisoner to the station the second time—among the duplicates was one for a pencil-case, which Mr. Newsome supposed might be his property, and we went to the pawn-brokers and found it—I believe that duplicate had remained among the rest all night—I have no doubt of it—I was at the office when the pawn-broker's assistant was examined—he could not swear to the prisoner—the prisoner said, "There shall be no difficulty in the case, I pawned the pencil-case," and he said in Mr. Newsome's presence that he had bought it of him for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

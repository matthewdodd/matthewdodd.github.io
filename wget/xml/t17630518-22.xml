I gave him two half crowns, and asked him if that would satisfy him. He said, d - n you, I must have more. I said, I believe'd I had a little more, and gave him about 7 or 8 s. more. The other was risling the lady all the while, she gave him her purse, in which was about 5 l. As soon as they had done I thought I heard a coach behind us, they ran away as fast as they could.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the other person employed about?</p>
               <p>Martin. He held the horse's head all the while.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Martin. I do not, neither can I describe the dress; this I know, the same man that presented the pistol to me rifled me, they were all on foot, that man was about the size of the prisoner, one was pretty lusty. I went to Mr. Fielding, and gave information. A pawnbroker had given information of a watch he had got; I went with the Justice's clerk and the constable to that pawnbroker's, it proved to be mine; he went with us to the man that pledg'd it, one

He was carried before Justice Fielding, there he said he did go out in the night, and two more lads with him, but was not perfect in their names, and that they committed this robbery; this was in my hearing, but I believe he knew me no more than I knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him to perswade him to confess?</p>
               <p>Martin. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Johnson. I am a publican in St. Giles's and live at the Black Horse in Dyer-street. The prisoner at the bar delivered this watch to me to go and pawn it for him on the 13th of April, at night about 10 o'clock, he had used my house before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any company with him that night?</p>
               <p>Johnson. No, he was alone, he lodged in the next street to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I believe he had a blue jacket on. I went the next morning and pawned it to Mr. Hull, in my own name; they came to me and told me I must produce the man I had the watch of. I went and found the prisoner in a skittle-ground in St. Giles's, I told him my business, and delivered him to the officers.</p>

I am an engineer and live at No. 9, Newill Street, Com<lb></lb>mercial Road—on the 2nd September I was in the Commercial Road about 7.30 p.m., not quite sober—I had a coat on my arm—there was a crowd; I was struck on the right side of the head and punched in the side and knocked down—I got up and was knocked down again—a man named Atkinson said "Look after your watch"—when I got up there was about 3 inches of guard left, and the watch was gone—the prisoner is the man who struggled with me—a crowd got round, and when a policeman came I gave him into custody.</p>

I live at 62, Dixon Street, Limehouse, and am a miller—I was at the corner of Salmon's Lane, in the Commercial Road, on this night—I saw a crowd and the prosecutor and prisoner—I saw the prisoner knock the prosecutor's hat off—the prosecutor said "Go about jour business"—the prosecutor had a coat which he swung round as if to avoid being struck—the prisoner pulled the coat from his arm and knocked him down—the prosecutor got up, they struggled, and both fell—I advised the prisoner to go away—he said "What has it to do with you?" and then got in front of the prosecutor again and knocked him down and fell on him and hit him with his right hand and kicked him with his left foot—I said "Mind your watch, I believe he is after your watch"—they got up; I saw the chain hanging—a female called out "You scamp you have got his watch"—the prisoner ran after her and said "I'll smash your brains in if you talk to me in that manner"—he came back after his cap—a constable came up, I gave information of what had occurred, and the prisoner was taken into custody—I did not see anyone else meddle with the prosecutor; I saw the whole affair—I did not see the prosecutor push against the prisoner or assault anyone—he was walking on the pave<lb></lb>ment as if he had had a glass—he then had a chain; I saw it.</p>

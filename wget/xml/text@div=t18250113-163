I saw them safe that morning, at en o'clock - I fastened the door, and left all the things stated in the indictment safe; there was a bolt on the inside of the door. When I came on Monday morning, about seven o'clock, the door was closed as I had left it, but the articles were gone. The two prisoners had been there on Saturday, to purchase shavings. I saw my tools on the Saturday following at Hatton-garden.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the two prisoners about a quarter past five o'clock on Sunday night, in Tottenham Court-road, crossing into Russell-street; Pritchard had a basket - I went, and asked what he had there; he hesitated for a time, and at last said,</p>
               <p>"I have got tools - I am a carpenter." I said I thought Sunday night was an odd time to go to a job. Pritchard pulled out a rule from his pocket, and said,</p>
               <p>"Now will you believe me?" I secured them. Smith said he had been taking a walk round Camden-town, and met accidentally with Pritchard.</p>

I told them, but they never looked after the man.</p>

Yes, on the 30th of November, I saw him about a quarter before six, he came into my shop as I was standing at the further end, he looked round, when he had done so he went out and stood at one of my windows a minute, he returned again and laid hold of a pelisse, he gave it a severe pull, it did not come down the first pull, he instantaneously gave it another hard pull, it came down then, and he ran out of the shop with it.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave the alarm? - A. My servant pursued him; I called out Stop thief; he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards went to Bow-street that night? - A. I did.</p>

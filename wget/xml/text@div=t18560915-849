                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old; I live at No. 4, Seymour-street, Euston-square street, Euston-square. On 30th Aug., near 2 o'clock, I was in Holborn, and saw the prisoner—he asked me if I knew the London and Westminster Bank—I said, "Yes "—there is a branch in Holborn—he gave me this piece of paper—I was to get a book, and he would give me a shilling if I got it—I was to bring the book to him—I went to the bank—I had some</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the cashiers of the London and Westminster branch Bank in Holborn. On 30th Aug. this note was given to me by the last witness—it struck me that it was not Mr. Wright's usual writing—he was taken to the manager, who gave him this green book—I did not see it given to him—this note is signed, "J. Wright"—we have no customer of that name—we have a customer of the name of J. L. Wright—this is certainly not his writing; it is something similar to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter at the bank, 214, Holborn. On 30th Aug. I saw this green book given to the lad Grammar—I was directed to follow him—I did so, and I saw him give the book to the prisoner, in Holborn—I then went up to the prisoner, and asked him if he had sent the boy for the book—he said, "Yes"—I immediately took the book out of his hands, and said, "The manager wishes to speak to you"—he made no observation, but walked back with me about fifty yards; he then made a sudden stop, and turned round as if to go—I laid hold of him by the arm—a constable came up, and I gave him into custody—I had not put my hand on him before that.</p>

               <p>and, in the next place, I was not aware that it was a forgery; a gentleman in the street gave it me, and when I was with the porter I stopped to turn round to look for the gentleman I had received the note of, as I found I had to go to the bank; I made no attempt to run away; I was not aware that had done anything wrong.</p>

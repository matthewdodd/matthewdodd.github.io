                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Through an Interpreter</hi>). I live at 20, Newman-street, Oxford-street, and am a merchant—I know the prisoner—on 9th January I saw him in Holborn, at the post-office, Soutnarapton-street; he asked me something in English which I said I did not understand—then he said, "Oh you are a German, I am very glad to see a German; I am only three days back from Australia, I am looking out for a banker, in order to change some Austrian bank notes"—he then said it was somewhat too early for that, and as he intended to go to the British Museum, he asked me whether I would go there with him—we did not go there—I know now that we were only about three hundred paces from the British Museum—he said he would take me there, and we started—he accosted several persons on the way, and as he told me afterwards, asked them the way to the British Museum in English—we went on for some time and I then proposed to go to a public-house and have a glass of beer—we had then been walking about an hour, we went into a public-house; another man met us, and the prisoner spoke to him, he spoke all in English—the prisoner then said to me, that the other man was going the same way as we, and we were to follow him—we all three went on—on the way the prisoner told me that this gentleman was from the country, that he had inherited a large fortune, and was about to go on the continent—the Englishman then said he was very sorry not to be able to understand us as we were talking German; he then said it was too late to go to the British Museum, and invited us to take a glass of wine; we then went to a house, I don't know where it was; the Englishman asked for a bottle of port wine, and after that was emptied, he invited the prisoner to drink another bottle with him—(all that I say now about this I only know from what the prisoner told me afterwards, because they were always talking English—) the prisoner said he would not accept it, he would rather play for it—another bottle was ordered, and the prisoner and the English<lb></lb>man played for it, they played with a little book that the prisoner had shown me on the way, to show me bow cheap he had bought it, it opened with ribbons on both sides, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one like it; the prisoner put on one side a gold piece and on the other side a piece of silver, and made the Englishman guess—they took each three pieces of paper or wood as counters, and whoever lost these three, lost the bottle—the Englishman lost the bottle and was very glad of it—they had to guess in which leaf of the book it was, the money was put inside the book; the prisoner placed the book on the table, and after the Englishman had guessed, he opened it, and whoever guessed right, won—I took no part in it at all then, they talked together in English, and then the prisoner invited me to play also—I had my gold snuff<lb></lb>box on the table, and the prisoner told me to stake it against their money, I did so, and a little while after the prisoner told me I had lost it, that was done with the same book—he made the Englishman guess again and told me I had lost—he then took it up from the table; nothing else was done there—all three of us left the place and went to another place, from there we went to a third place; I think we went in a cab—I don't know the name of the street—I believe the landlord is here—we went to a public-house, they took me there to a parlour, and began a new game—I said I had not so much money with me—at this time I had only had some coffee to drink besides the wine—the prisoner proposed a new game, and in<lb></lb>vited me to stake something against them—I had a gold brooch with a pearl and rubies, and I staked it, together with some money, against some bank notes and gold and the prisoner's watch—I put down my brooch, four ducats,</p>

               <p>three five thaler notes, and some sovereigns; I don't know exactly how many, two or three sovereigns—the prisoner then tied the whole of that in my yellow silk handkerchief, the whole stakes on each side—the prisoner made the Englishman guess with the same book, and he lost two chalks—then they talked together a great deal, and the prisoner said the Englishman did not like to guess again with the book, and told me to place either a piece of gold or silver whichever he gave me under a hat, and then the Englishman would guess—I did so, and the Englishman guessed three times, and then the prisoner said the Englishman had won—the handkerchief containing the stakes laid on the table, and the prisoner then told me to follow him out into the street for a moment; he told me he would go home in a cab to fetch some more money which he had at home, and come back again in half an hour—he begged me to remain there and to converse with the Englishman as well as I could in the meanwhile—I then came back into the house; I found the Englishman gone and the handker<lb></lb>chief too—I immediately went back into the street and I saw the prisoner running as fast as he could—I ran after him but could not catch him, it was dark—I went back to the public-house and the landlord there sent me with somebody to the police-station—I did not see anything more then of the prisoner or my property which I had lost—about eight weeks ago I saw the prisoner and Englishman again in Silver-street, Soho; the prisoner was iu a shop and the Englishman about five steps from it—as soon as the Englishman saw me, he turned and off he went—I ran after him, but another person came just into my way and kept me back—when I came back to the shop, of course the other man was gone—I could not see a policeman, I was obliged to let him go—I did not see the prisoner again till I saw him at the police-court at Bow-street—I am sure the prisoner is the man who went with me to these places—the value of the property I lost is about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd.</p>

               <p>don't know, quite powerless, quite incapable of having my own will—I did not ask for a cab myself after we left the first place—I think we went in a cab—the next place we went to, was a coffee-house—I did not say I would have my revenge out of the Englishman, and invite him to come and play with me—I don't know that I drank anything at the coffee-house; after the prisoner had gone and when I came back with the policeman, then in order to quiet my hot blood and excitement, I drank some soda-water—I was in such a state I don't know how to express it, but I would have given them anything they asked for—I had a watch after all this bad occurred; I went home with it—I had two rings also—I did not lose either—the prisoner had a very large gold watch with a large gold chain—I think these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are part of things which he placed on stake against mine; they were placed in the handkerchief—I can't swear that that is the same watch, but it is exactly like it, and the chain also; I believe them to be the same—as soon as I saw the book at the police-court, I recognised it imme<lb></lb>diately—I was three times at Westminster and once at Bow-street—I have not been asked to compound this with the prisoner—I don't know what this paper is—I know a person named Clare; I did not authorize him to go and settle the matter for me—I got a pawn ticket from him, but no money, this is the ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I stood at the top of the street while Clare went into some house which was said to be the prisoner's—he did not go in at my request—I have not seen Clare here—he did not bring anything out of the house—I have been to the prisoner's house to see his wife on this matter—Clare came to me and brought me that ticket, and he told me that the prisoner's wife had asked him to come there again, and if I wished I could go with him; a friend of mine who interpreted between me and Clare told me to go, because Clare believed that the prisoner's wife wanted to settle the matter amicably, which I should certainly have liked very much, if I could have got my things back again—the brooch and snuff-box were not the property of my employers at Berlin; I did not tell the prisoner that—they are mine—I did not tell the prisoner that I had not paid for them—I have got the ticket back—I don't know what became of Clare—I saw him last night in Oxford-street in a public-house—when I went with Clare, and we left the prisoner's house, he went back afterwards alone.</p>

I saw him come across the way to the building during the time the men were gone to their beer; he came up the step of the door; I saw him come out. I ran down stairs after him, I asked him what business he had there, he said he come to the painter to get a bit of colour; I asked him what painter he knew, he said no particular one; I pulled his coat of one side, I saw this saw. I took him in charge and took the saw from him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He said I stole a gallon of turpentine; he followed me out of the house after that.</p>
               <p>Q. He says he took this saw from you - A. Yes. - I am sixty one years of age and never was in such a perdicament in my life.</p>

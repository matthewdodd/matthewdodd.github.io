               <p>Prisoner's Council. You say, this was about twelve at noon day? - Yes.</p>

               <p>When did you first give any alarm? - As soon as I could, Mr. Maylor was in the parlour, and he let me out.</p>
               <p>You say, they asked you for money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you give them? - A little bag containing thirty-eight guineas and a half.</p>

               <p>Did you apply this money ever to any other uses? - No, no other uses.</p>
               <p>Where did you get the money? - I had the money at the bank.</p>
               <p>You reckon that you was answerable to Mr. Maylor for that money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there any prize money due to them then? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Court. A man may steal his own property; if there had been prize money due to them, and they had demanded it with a pistol, I should have considered it as a robbery.</p>

               <p>Tried by the London Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>
               <p>After the verdict the prisoner said, My Lord, I have a favor to beg, that this paper may be read in Court, I hope you will be pleased to look in it, and remember you have a Judge in Heaven; there it will all be forgiven; I never was before any gentlemen before, I have served my King and country.</p>

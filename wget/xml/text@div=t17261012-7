             thus depos'd. Between 5 and 6 on Monday Morning, a couple of Men coming by my Door, said that there was a Woman lay dead in a Ditch in <placeName id="t17261012-7-crimeloc33">Farthing Fields at Stepney</placeName>

I ran thither and took her up, and laid her upon the Bank, she was not quite Cold, her Throat was cut about two Inches in length, but not to the Windpipe. The Wound did not seem to be an accidental Scratch, but done with a sharp Instrument.</p>
               <p>- Mathews thus depos'd. The Prisoner and the Deceas'd lodged together in my House in King Street Stepney. On the Sunday Morning before the Murder, the Deceas'd came down Stairs crying, and said, that her Husband had not come home all Night, but was got along with another Woman in Gravel Lane, and she knew not what to do. I advis'd her to get a Warrant and take him up, she said, that she did not care to do that, because it would expose him too much, but she'd go and see if the could find him. She went about 9 a Clock, and return'd about ten, and said, that she had found him a Bed with the Other Woman, who got up and beat her. The Prisoner in about an hour after, came to an Ale-house next door to me, and sent for the Deceas'd, she went, and I could hear her cry, and talk to him, but could not distinguish the words. Then the came home with her, and at Noon she fetch'd in some rost Pork for Dinner. I left them together, and went out. I return'd about 9 at Night and went to Bed. The Prisoner was not then within, but between Ten and Eleven, he came and knockt at the Door, and call'd out Sarah! Sarah! He having made a disturbance with her before, I did not care to let him in, and at last the got up, and let him in herself. I did not hear him go out again, but between 2 and 3 I was awaked with another knocking at the Door. The Deceas'd open'd her Window, and the Person at the Door ask'd if the Sailor was within, for the Prisoner had been a <rs id="t17261012-7-deflabel34" type="occupation">Sailor</rs>

The Deceas'd answered no, he was been gone out about an Hour; I got up about six, and found the Key under the Street Door; I open'd it, and looking out, saw the Prisoner coming towards me. O Mr. Matthews says he, My poor Sarah is kill'd, she lies in Farthing Fields with her Throat Cut. - But see was none of my Wife.</p>

             thus depos'd. The Prisoner and I lay on the same Floor in the Garret. On Sunday Morning she said, she could bear her Husbands usage no longer, she must go see for him, for he should keep no Woman under her Nose. She went and came back crying, with her Face (well'd, and her Headcloths torn. I went to the House says she, and knocks at the Door, but no body would open it. The Bed stood near the Window, and so I put my Hand though a broken pane of Glass, and pull'd the Curtain aside, and saw them a Bed together. Then I told them if they would not let me in, I'd fetch a Constable, upon which, the bold Baggage got up and open'd the Door, and as soon as I come in, she flew in my Face as if she'd 'a' scratch'd my Eyes out, but my Husband got out of Bed and parted us. A little before Noon the Prisoner sent for her to the next Door Ale-house, and from thence came home with her, and went out again after Dinner. He knockt at the Door about a 11 at Night, and she desir'd me not to let him in, for she was resolved never to Bed with him any more, but he continuing to knock and call, she let him in herself. When he came up, he asked her why she let him stand to long at the Door, and said something to her about what he'd do to the other Woman, which I believe the Deceas'd was pleas'd with, for I heard her Laugh, after which they went quietly to Bed together. A man call'd at the Door about 3 in the morning, and she look'd out of the Window and said, he had been gone an Hour, but whether he was then gone, or she only deny'd him to keep him within I am not certain, but I did not hear her go to Bed again. About 4 she open'd her Garret Door, and went down as I suppose with the Chamber Pot, and I think I heard no body else go out; She soon came up again in a sort of a hurry, and set the Pot upon the Stair-head, and went down a second time, and shut the Door after her.</p>

             the Daughter of the Deceas'd thus depos'd. About 8 a Clock on Monday Morning, the Prisoner came to me at my Mistress's and told me my Mother was very bad, and desired to Speak with me, I asked when she was taken ill, and he answer'd About one in the Morning. Our work was in hast, and my Mistress did not care to let me go, except there was a great occasion, and says I, Is my Mother dangerously Ill? What ails her? To which he made no answer, but by and by all on a sudden he said, It signifies nothing to hide it any longer, - She's dead, she has Cut her own Throat, and lies in Farthing Fields. Then my Mistress let me go with him, and by the way he talk'd if he fear'd that some People would think hard of him, about my Mothers Death, and I said, if there was any danger, he had better go out of the way, No says he, that will look as if I was Guilty, but if I stay, it with took as if I was Innocent. In Church Lane we met a Creature that ask'd him to drink, I told her, he could not go with her then, and the swore he should, upon which he promis'd to meet her at a House in King-street in about 2 hours; Then, says she. There is a Woman murder'd, - I know it, says he, and this is her Daughter, meaning me, and so they parted. I ask'd him who that Woman was, and he said it was his Daughter; As we went forward, several call'd after us, and said, That's the Old Rogue that murder'd his Wife, and so at last he was apprehended in Rateliffe High-way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thomas the Surgeon thus depos'd. The Wound in the Deceas'd Throat was very slight, it was about 2 Inches long, and just penetrated the Skin, without dividing any of the large Vessels. One side of her Head appear'd to be tumify'd which I take to be the cause of her Death, for I found no water in her Stomach, which there would have been if she had been Drowned, or had breathed under water.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made his Defence. The Deceas'd was not my Wife, I parted from her about Midnight, and took my Shovel in my Hand, for at 2 a Clock I was to heave Ballast a-broad a Ship, I went directly to

I thought it was hardly worth while to rise so soon for an Eight-penny Jobb, and so I lay still till between 5 and 6 in the Morning, and then I got up, and went over the Fields. I saw the Deceas'd lying dead, and several People looking at her, I did not much wonder at it, because she had attempted to cut her Throat before.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner could not produce Betty Thomas to prove, that he was with her when the Deceas'd was kill'd, but he call'd - Butcher, who depos'd, that about 3 Months ago, he heard the Deceas'd say, that she had a good mind to cut her own Throat, because her Husband (the Prisoner) was Jealous of her.

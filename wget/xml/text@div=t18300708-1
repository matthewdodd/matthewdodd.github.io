            . In February last I was in the House of Correction, Cold Bath-fields - about the 17th or 18th of that month, I was in the same yard with the two prisoners; I had known Nash for some time - he said he knew of a good job, and asked if I had a mind to be in it; I asked what it was - he said the poor's boxes at St. Bartholomew's-hospital were closed all the year round, and if I had a mind, when my time was out, we would go and crack them, and take the money out that was in them; we had some further conversation in the course of the day, and he asked what time I went out - I said about the 12th of May: he said that would not do, it was too late, for the treasurer or steward went round about that time, and took the money out; but he said that was no matter, as there was another place we could do, and that was old Wilby's offices - he said he knew there was always plenty of blunt in those offices; they are in the hospital: he said we must get in early in the evening, before the gates were shut, and slow ourselves away in a cellar, where they were in the habit of putting old beds or bedsteads; I said I could say nothing at all about it, as such jobs were quite out of my line, and I would rather not have any thing to do with it; I got out on Wednesday, the 12th of May, and on the Saturday following I saw Nash in Smithfield - he asked if I had thought any more about the hospital; I said No: he said he should like to give them another turn - he renewed the conversation, and I said I did not like to give a chance away of being found in the hospital at night; he said there was a chance we could do in the day time, the steward's office; he said he knew Mr. Wix was in the habit of receiving 70l. or 80l. every Friday morning, to pay the sisters and nurses, and the different tradespeople, and putting it into his desk or drawer, and then leaving his office to go round to ring a bell at each of the three wings in the hospital - he said he himself had received money frequently of the steward, and he knew where the desk was and while he went round we should have plenty of time to go and do the robbery - he said, "Do the robbery;" I said if I was in it I would not go in and do it myself - he said he did not require that, as he had a person who would do it; I told him I would be in it on that understanding - he said he had got a person who would do it, and he and I were to look out the while - I saw him again on the Sunday morning, but nothing particular transpirted. We met there again on Monday morning; Hurley and another man were with him - I had known Hurley about three months previous to my going to prison; they were in deep conversation that Monday morning - Hurley said he had not time to stop then, but he would meet us at ten o'clock the next morning at the same place, or if he failed to meet us we were to go to the White Lion, in Rosemary-lane, and he would wait there for us in the afternoon, but did not say at what particular hour - Nash and I met there, but Hurley did not come; we went to the White Lion in the afternoon - Hurley and the other man were there; we had some conversation by the pump in Leman-street about this same robbery- I saw Herdsfield on the Thursday morning following, and gave him information that the robbery was intended to take place, but the time was not then settled; all I did afterwards was by direction of him or the gentleman; he told me to go and tell the gentlemen of the hospital - I went and saw Mr. Wilby and Mr. Wix; they told me to call in again in the course of the day - I called, and saw the treasurer and some other gentlemen: the officer was then present and some other gentlemen - I told them the robbery was intended to take place; I acted by their direction - I after that continued to meet the prisoners; I saw Nash. Horley, and the other man on the following Tuesday - we had another long talk by the pump in Leman-street, and it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080004"></xptr>then agreed that the steward's office should be robbed on the following Friday, in the day time, and when the noise occasioned by that was quiet we were to rob the Renter's office in the night, and then make our escape through a window; it was arranged that on Friday morning Hurley and the other man were to commit the robbery, and Nash and I were to look out - I saw Nash again on Thursday evening, in Smithfield; he said he had seen Hurley, and that Hurley's partner had got taken, and was sent to the House of Correction for three months, for something he had been doing, and we must do the robbery our three selves -Hurley told me he wished Nash would call him in the morning; Nash said he had bad shoes, and wished me to call him - I told him I would go down; I went the next morning, and called Hurley at half-past six o'clock - that was on the Friday morning; Hurley came down, and asked what time it was - I told him, and he said it was too soon, and I had better stop and have some breakfast; I said No, we would get to Smithfield and see Nash - Hurley went up stairs again, and when he came down we went to Smithfield, but Nash was not there; we staid there some time, and then Hurley proposed we should go back to Rosemary-lane - Hurley went to a Jew's, and borrowed a crow-bar: I was present; we then started a second time for Smithfield - I missed Hurley in Rosemary-lane: I went on to Smithfield by myself, and Nash was there, sitting on the rails of the sheep pens - he asked me where Hurley was; I said I had missed him: in a short time Hurley came through the hospital, with a cigar in his mouth - it was then half-past nine o'clock; we all three went to the Queen's Head and French Horn in Duke-street, Smithfield - an altercation there took place between me and Nash as to the stations we were to take, to look out - Nash wanted to look towards the square of the hospital, and I towards Smithfield; Hurley jumped up, and said,"D - n it, I will do it myself;" we went on to Smithfield, and missed Hurley all on a sudden - Nash and I walked on to the middle gate of the hospital; the clock was striking ten, and I saw Mr. Wix go from his office towards the square, as if he had just left his office - I waited some short time, and not seeing Hurley I went towards the steward's office to see if I could see anything of him; I met him coming running down the steps from the steward's office, with his left hand on his hip - he said, "Come along, I have done it;" he ran out of the hospital - Nash and I followed him across Smithfield into Long-lane, and through a court into Cloth-fair; Hurley there put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out a note, with some sovereigns and silver rolled up in it - we then walked into Aldersgate-street, on our way towards Old-street, to a public-house we had agreed to go to, to share what we had got from the hospital; I told Hurley he had better give me a shilling, and I would get a pint of ale, and see if any person was following us - he took out the same note with the money in it, and gave me a shilling from it; I said that that I might go back and tell the officer - I went into a public-house, and saw the two prisoners running on; I then went and told Herdsfield, his brother, and another officer - they desired me to go on to Old-street; when I got there the publican told me there had been some one there for me, and left a message for me to go down to their place - I went with the three officers to Hurley's house; they told me to go in, and they would follow me in a minute or so - I went to Hurley's, in a court in Rosemary-lane; I went into a room, and found Hurley, Nash, and a woman Hurley lived with - Nash had a pale red money bag in his hand, holding it over a candle, and he gave it to the woman to take down stairs to destroy it; she went down, and Nash said they had sold a 5l. note for 4l., and two pieces of coin for a shilling; Hurley was just beginning to share out the money, when the officers came up and took us. I was examined on this charge before the Alderman - he demanded sureties for my appearance, but I thought I would rather be in prison.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.What! rather be in prison? A. I thought I had better be there - the conversation was in February; we were all in the yard of the prison - there might be ninety persons or more there; I do not know that any other prisoner heard us - I think they did not; Nash and I were walking up and down the yard by our two selves - though there were so many prisoners there were plenty of opportunities of speaking; Hurley was somewhere about the yard- I never knew he was to do any thing in the robbery till I saw him in Smithfield; I had been committed to the House of Correction under the Vagrant Act; I was never committed under the Vagrant Act before - this robbery was not in my line; I am in a general line - I am a gardener by profession, but I have left that four or five years; I have never been a carter, or a farmer's servant, or a butcher - I wear a frock because it suits me; I have been in the habit of supplying the faculty with subjects, in other words a resurrectionist - I have been employed these five years in that way; I live with my mother - she does not support me; we had credit at a chandler's shop - I have been in trouble four or five times within the last ten years; I got into trouble first when I was seventeen - I shall be twenty-seven next month; I do not know whether I have been twice five times in trouble - I say five at a risk; I have been to sea - I did not see any large hand-bills about me; there never were such - I went to sea in 1825 or 1826, and returned the following year; I went as poulterer on board an Indiaman - I did not go a second voyage, because I did not like it; I then returned to the other trade - I did not like this job, but I did join for the purpose of giving the hospital information; I thought of seeing the officer first -I first determined to tell the hospital people when Nash was importuning me in Smithfield, but before that I had said I would join in it if I did not go in; I told Herdsfield of it -I had known him before, but I never had any thing to do with him; I believe he is a friend of mine, the same as he is of every other man - he knew what I was; he told me to make the hospital people acquainted with it - he did not know it was to be on Friday; I saw the hospital people twice - they told me to look in again, and the second time Herdsfield was with them; I saw him two or three times afterwards - I told him I had informed the people of the hospital of it; he did know from my information that the robbery was to take place on Friday -Nash sat on the rails at the time, and I went on towards the steward's office, and met Hurley coming down the steps; I knew where Nash was waiting - we had missed 
               <persName id="t18300708-1-person119">Hurley</persName>
             all on the sudden, and the first I saw of him after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080005"></xptr>wards was when he was coming down the steps; I cannot tell whether any one but myself saw him - upon my oath I did not go in myself and take the money; that is as true as all I have said to-day - Crawley is the landlord of the Queen's Head; he is not here, nor the Jew who lent the crow-bar, that I know of; I have not seen him since - I know the house he went into; I do not know the name of the street - I have been at Winchester; I was in trouble there in 1824 or 1825 - that was for "exhumation;" I was in six months for that, and four months for the fine - my occupation has been providing subjects for the faculty, and one year I went to sea; I have been the last three months in prison.</p>
               <p>Nash. What he has said is all false.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Are not people usually safer in prison than out of it? A. Yes, if they give information, and I have been threatened; when the first communication was made to me there were ninety persons in the yard - there was not much opportunity of speaking but at meals; I have never been in trouble for felony, but several times for obtaining dead bodies - once for obtaining money under false pretences, and as a vagrant, being found in the burial ground at Pentonville.</p>

            . I am a marshalsman. I had a communication from the last witness about the 20th or 21st of May - he spoke to me, and I said I had nothing to do with it till he saw the gentlemen belonging to the hospital; it was a voluntary thing on his part in what he said.</p>

In consequence of some information that Herdsfield gave me. I saw Sheering on the 20th of May - he made a communication to me of a robbery which was likely to happen; I do not think I saw him again on the same subject, but I saw him twice on the 20th of May, and the second time Herdsfield was present - we heard what Sheering had to say, and then sent for Herdsfield, but I was not present long then, I merely went into the room; it was my custom to pay the sisters and nurses on Fridays, and on Friday, the 28th of May, I left my office locked or latched - the fastening of the latch was broken off, and I lost the money I had left there; I had taken very particular notice what money I left behind me, expecting that something was to happen - I left 17l. 4s., a half-france, and a canvas bag; there were two 5l. Bank of England notes, Nos. 38,011 and 38,012 - 3l. 2s. 6d. in silver, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences, three sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns; there was a George II. shilling, a George III. sixpence, and a half franc of 1818, which I had from Mr. Wilby, the renter; when I came back the latch of the door was forced, the door was forced, the drawer was broken, and the bag and money gone - Nash had been in the hospital, and knew the place very well indeed; he was there to assist in carrying coals - the two Herdsfields were placed in the hospital, but I do not know exactly where; I did not go any where in search of the prisoners - I have seen a half-franc very similar to the one I left in my office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you seen Herdsfield on he day of the robbery, before the robbery? A.No, I did not - I swear I had not; there are a great many servants employed there - I locked my drawer myself, and closed the door; my office communicates internally with the renter's house, but the outer door was broken - no one was present to see me deposit the money there; I had not shown the money to the officer before I put it there - I marked the shilling and sixpence I have spoken of; I did not think of apprising any officer that I expected a robbery would be committed - I do not know whether any of the gentlemen who directed the proceedings of the officers are here to-day; I was not there when the robbery was committed - I did not keep in view to see the robbery; I could have done so if I had chosen -I had not left the building; I was not present at the time of the alarm of the robbery - I returned in ten minutes, and saw the officers.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q.Where did you see the officers? A. By the renter's office door, in the yard; I told them the door was broken - I do not know that there is a place from which persons could have seen that door, and they themselves have been concealed, except in a little closet in my own office: I know Mr. Wilby, our treasurer, and our legal adviser were present when I went with Herdsfield; Mr. Wilby was steward before me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is the nature of the communication between your office and the hospital? A. It is with the receivers house - I cannot say whether that communication was fastened that morning; I certainly did not fasten that door myself.</p>

             attended, and his brother I believe. On the morning of the 28th of May I delivered some money to Mr. Wix, as I did every Friday: I delivered to him that day 18l., and a half-franc of 1818 - there were two 5l. notes, and the rest in cash: I took the numbers of the notes - they were 38011, and 38012, both dated March 20, 1830, and the rest was in gold and silver; I took the date of the half-franc - it was a half-franc of Napoleon; I have seen it since - I believe it to be the same: it was marked "Napoleon Empereur," and on the reverse "Demi franc Republique Francois;" there is a communication between the steward's office and my house; I am in the habit of going through it frequently - it goes into the hall; I cannot say whether it had been opened that morning or not - the officers were placed in the passage leading to my office: I was there - no one could go through my house to Mr. Wix's office without their seeing them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You took very great care to make a note of these particular coins, that the whole proceeding should be well managed? A. Yes - I remained there to see the thieves taken, if they had the boldness to come; I did not see them taken - I did not place myself any where to see them: I left the officers to do their duty - I did not tell the officers it was to take place at twelve o'clock; I understood it was to be at ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080006"></xptr>- he might say from ten to twelve o'clock, but I understood it was to be at ten - I have seen Sheering, but I do not know that I could speak positively to his person; the entry was made at the door of the steward's office - I do not know where the key of that door was; I do not know whether Mr. Wix was stationed there - there is a latch-lock and a key-hole - I really do not know whether I could hear the movements of any person in that office by putting my ear to that key-hole; I never tried it - if I were in my room, and men were to come into that office, I think I should hear them; the hall of my house is on the other side of that office - there is a door communicating with it; if I were at that door, and a man was to break open the other door I think I might hear it, but a man might open the latch without my hearing him - I cannot tell whether I might hear him; it is a very large room - if I were listening I might.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you see the door of this office? A. No; the pier of the arcade was between us, but I heard it hang too - I had no opportunity of seeing the party who came from that place.</p>
               <p>CHARLES HERSDFIELD re-examined. I was in this witness' room on this Friday morning, with my brother; I could not see the door of the steward's room, nor hear the breaking in - I saw Sheering three or four or five minutes after ten o'clock - he had informed me before that the robbery would take place about ten; I and my brother went with him, in consequence of what he said, to a public-house in Old-street, to apprhend the two prisoners at the bar, but we did not find them - we then went to Mill-yard, Rosemary-lane; Sheering was with us; he went up stairs to where the two prisoners were - my brother went up first, and I went up in about a minute; when I went up I saw Hurley sitting near a deal table, I believe, smoking a cigar - there were some sovereigns and some silver on the table; my brother had got hold of him - he said to me, "You take him, and I will take up the money;" I found nothing on him - I cannot say what money was on the table; my brother took it - I believe nothing was said to either of the prisoners, in my hearing; Nash was there - I did not take him: it was a small room - there was a bit of a bedstead there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You were placed in the room to notice what was going on? A. Yes - I supposed I should be able to notice it, but I could not see who went in: I think the name of the people at the public-house in Old-street is Parsley - I will not be certain; I believe it was on the 20th or 22nd that Sheering first told me of this - he was not in custody at the time; I was coming through the archway, and met him - I have seen him about here; he came to me, and said, "There is going to be a robbery;" I said, "You had better see the gentlemen;" when we went to the place where the prisoners were found, Sheering went up first - he turned into the door, and when I went up stairs he was in the room; I and my brother did not go in first, because we wanted to ascertain whether they had had sufficient time to get there- if they had not been there we should have waited; we should not have been able to have got a strange man to have gone up - they would say, "I am not an officer;" I did not think they had time to get there as we had a coach.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you find any crow-bar? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Perhaps you would not have been where you were if you had chosen your place? A.No; we sent Sheering up first - we could not, with any hope of success, have gone up first; we should have had the place all in an uproar - if they had not been there they would never have come there; if they had not been there Sheering was to have come down directly.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HERDSFIELD. On the 28th of May I was stationed with my brother in St. Bartholomew's-hospital - I did not see Mr. Wix go out of the door of his office, but I saw him go from that way; I went to Old-street with my brother and Roe - we did not find them there; I then went on to Mill-yard, into a room on the second floor - I saw the two prisoners and Sheering; Hurley was sitting with his left arm on a table, and on the table was this money, which I here produce - it has been in my possession ever since; here is a French coin, which had been shown to me in the morning, before; there was a candle on the table, but it was not burning - while I was stationed in the hospital I saw Hurley come from Bartholomew-square to go towards the door of the office; in two or three minutes he came from towards the door, going into Smithfield, and I saw him put his left hand to the side of his pocket - I saw no more of him till I saw him in the room; the money found there is three sovereigns, one half-sovereign, nine half-crowns, twenty-three shillings, seven sixpences, one half-fram, and 3d. in copper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You had heard of this intended robbery? A. Yes - I swear I saw Hurley: his name had not been mentioned to me by my informant, nor by any one - my brother did not tell it me: when I saw him pass near the steward's office I did not take him, because I expected more to be there - I said, "I think that is one of them."</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. That is a public place? A. Yes -I could not have seized him instantly: I had to go round several yards.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You have stated you said you thought that was the man? A. I said so to Mr. Wix - I followed him within five minutes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you keep your eyes upon him? A. No: I saw no more of him till I saw him in Mill-yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you go up first or your brother? A. I did, with Roe - Sheering was in the room.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you know Hurley again when you saw him in Mill-yard? A. I did.</p>

            . I joined the two officers in pursuit of these prisoners - I was applied to here, at the Old Bailey Session, a little after ten o'clock; I did not go into any house in Old-street-road - I believe Sheering went; I went on to Rosemary-lane, and to a court - I do not know the name of it; I went up into the room after Sheering -I saw the two prisoners and Sheering - it was a middling sized room; there was a bed in it, and a table - as I went in the table was on the left-hand side of the room: Hurley was sitting on the left-hand side of the table, with his elbow on the table, and Nash was on the opposite side - Sheering was on the bed; I took Nash - I did not take notice of any thing that was said to him: this money was on the table.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Sheering went up first? A. Yes.</p>

            . I know Nash. I remember seeing him on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080007"></xptr>the 27th of May, at the end of White Lion-street, Rosemary-lane; there were two men with him, and to the best of my belief Hurley was one, but I am not quite positive; I heard Nash say "The time to do the job is between nine and ten o'clock in the morning;" I did not pay any attention to their further conversation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.They were strangers to you? A. Yes, with the exception of Nash - I cannot swear to the other men, but I think Hurley was one.</p>
               <p>Nash. He swears false - he never saw me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you seen him? A. Yes, near my father's window, which is a whip-makers, in Smithfield, of a morning, and I knew his person.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GLYDE. I am a porter at St. Bartholomew's-hospital. I know Nash and Sheering; I remember the hospital being robbed on Friday morning - I saw Nash and Sheering that morning, between nine and ten o'clock, just outside the centre gate, leaning against the rails in Smithfield, and walking up and down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had you known Sheering before? A. I had known him by sight; I do not know that ever I drank with him - I will not swear it; it was reported he was a body-snatcher - I am not one.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q.How long have you been porter there? A.Between four and five years.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to MR. WIX. Q. Did you see how the door was broken? A. The fastening of the latch was forced off; I have it in my pocket - I do not know whether it was done with the foot being pressed against it, it might be.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Is it always fastened in that way? A. Sometimes I leave it open; this is the catch which was broken off - it was hanging so loosely that the least touch knocked it off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in East-street, Walworth; the prisoner was in my service, and left on the 19th of June. On the 20th of Oct. Eleanor Stewart came and told me something, which caused me to go to No. 2, Union-row—I there-found a book, pepper-castor, salt-cellar, and" knife of mine—they were given up to me by Eleanor Stewart—I then went with Baker to No. 8, Union-row, found the prisoner, and gave her into custody—these are the articles—they were safe in my house while the prisoner was with me.</p>

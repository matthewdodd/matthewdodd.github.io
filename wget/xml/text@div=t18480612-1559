                  </hi>. I live in Leman-street, Goodman's-fields. Early in April I was introduced by my brother to the prisoner, at the London Coffee-house—he said he had a large estate in India, and another in Cornwall, andwas going to Plymouth to receive a legacy—in consequence of what he toldme I allowed him to live at my house, and provided him with clothes, linen, a gold watch and chain—one morning be went away, intending to take pos<lb></lb>sessionof his estate—I went with him to the railway station—when Ireturned I missed from a drawer, which was broken open, a <hi rend="italic">chali</hi> dress, abracelet, and some satin.</p>

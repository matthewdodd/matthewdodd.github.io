               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you taken a fancy to pigeons? A. Ten or eleven years: I did not know he was going to steal them - it was dark; I know the prisoner is the man - he had a blue coat on.</p>

            . I had two pigeons in my shop - Poplin was there, talking to me; my back was turned towards the place where these pigeons were - I heard a scuffle; I ran to the door, saw the pen door open, and missed two pigeons, one a blue dragon, and the other a mealy tumbler - I have seen the prisoner at my shop many times; I believe he was there every day in the week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to have a pint of beer, and I felt rather sick - a man rushed by me, and hit me on the shoulder; I heard Stop thief! called and ran after him - some person said, "He has let something fly."</p>

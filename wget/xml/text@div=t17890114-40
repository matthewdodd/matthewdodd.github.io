On the 15th of December last, I worked at one Mr. Morgan's, at Shadwell; I saw two men before me; they parted and let me go between them; one of them, the prisoner, seized me by the collar, and said, d - n your eyes, you b - r, what have you got; I told him nothing material, only a few halfpence in my jacket pocket; I desired them not to use me ill. The prisoner held my back up against the pales, and put his finger into my handkerchief that was tied round my neck, and twisted it round, and almost throttled me, while the other searched my pockets; they took three-pence halfpenny, and a farthing out of my jacket pocket, and a clasp knife; the prisoner took the handkerchief off my neck, after the other had done searching my pockets, and then left me for about half a dozen yards; and the other came back to me, and would have given me my handkerchief, if this prisoner would have let him; but the prisoner said, d - n your eyes, you b - r, sherry, get off with you. I immediately went across the fields into the direct road to Shadwell, to go back again to Shadwell, to give information to the Shadwell officers. Going along, I crossed the fields into the new road, and got into Ratcliffe Highway, and there I met the prisoner and the other man coming along; I passed them on purpose to get the first I could meet with to assist me; and I met two men, and asked their assistance, and they said they would; I immediately jumped in between the men, and took one in one hand, and one in the other, but nobody assisted me, and I was obliged to let one go; and the prisoner I took to the office myself. He was searched, and nothing was found upon him. It was about five o'clock, as nigh as I can guess, when I met them; and this might be about ten minutes after, not more. I ran as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>How far might it be from the place where you was robbed, to the place in Ratcliffe Highway, where you took the two men? - About a quarter of a mile; but then they went a round about way to it: I crossed the fields.</p>
               <p>What part of Stepney-fields; was it? - About one hundred yards off one side of the halfway-house.</p>
               <p>And you think it is about a quarter of a mile from Ratcliffe Highway? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At five o'clock, the 15th of December, I suppose it was dark? - Yes, it was duskish.</p>
               <p>Why the night was set in; is that footpath lighted? - No, no lights.</p>
               <p>Both the men strangers to you? - I never saw them before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough for you to distinguish their dress? - Yes. That man had a blue jacket, a silk handkerchief round his neck, check cotton shirt, white trowsers; the prisoner had a round hat.</p>
               <p>That is the common dress in the seafaring line, and amongst workmen who work on the sea-side? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140054"></xptr>When you met him in Ratcliffe Highway, did you hear him speak? - No, I did not. I am positive he is the same man; I knew them by their dress; and the other had a handkerchief swinging in his hand, which I did suppose to be mine.</p>
               <p>What, when you met them in Ratcliffe Highway? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish the colour of the handkerchief? - No, I could not.</p>
               <p>You came immediately from work? - Yes; I had not stopped any where.</p>
               <p>Quite sober? - As sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Could you observe, at the time you left them in Stepney-fields, which way they went? - Yes; I saw them go towards Shadwell; they went a round-about way to it: I went across the fields. I was afraid to follow them in the path-way.</p>
               <p>Would the way that they took lead them into Ratcliffe Highway? - Yes; it was the direct road to it.</p>
               <p>Did you come from Mile-end down Ratcliffe Highway, or the other way? - I came into Ratcliffe Highway from Tower-hill way, by the way of the New-road; and then I went down the New-road, and I met them.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, you will recollect, that the man's life depends a great deal on your testimony; in the dark, and the dress a common one, and nothing found on the man; are you quite positive he is the man? - Quite positive that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. All you knew him by was his dress? - By his dress, and his face.</p>
               <p>You never saw the men before, neither of them? - Never, to my knowledge.</p>

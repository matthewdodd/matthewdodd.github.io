               <p>- WOOD sworn.</p>
               <p>I went on board with the prisoner. I asked him what he had to sell; he said cordage, stay-sail , and other things; he went down, and brought up this coil of rope and this stay-sail, and put them into the boat. I said if he would go on shore and leave them at an house I named, I would pay for them. I asked him the price; he said three guineas; he put them into the boat , went on shore with them, and carried himself the cordage to Mrs. Holbourne's. When I got him there I secured him.</p>

               <p>Mr. Layton. When he was before the justice he owned they were my property, and were taken out of the ship.</p>

               <p>I did not put them into the boat to go on shore with them. I came from Sunderland , and have no friends here. I have served on board a man of war. I was discharged from the man of war for having fits, but that was by the protection of the doctor for a little money I gave him. I was discharged from the Dunkirk at the beginning of last year.</p>

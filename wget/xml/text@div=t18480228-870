                  </hi> I am a partner in the house of Rankin and Vickerman. The prisoner was our clerk in Dec., 1846—on the receipt of money, it was his duty to enter it in the cash receipt-book, and pay it into the banker's—the book is here—on 16th Dec., 1846, here is no entry of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nor since—this receipt is the prisoner's writing.</p>

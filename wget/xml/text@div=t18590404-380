                  </hi>. I am the wife of Adeodata da Silva Lima, residing at Richmond-road, Hackney—on 18th February, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, I was at Hackney—I had a gold watch and chain—I wore the chain outside my shawl, and the watch was in the pocket of my dress in front—the prisoner came up to me and asked me the direction to Hack<lb></lb>ney-downs—I stopped and raised my hand to point in the direction that I thought the downs lay in—in doing so I raised my shawl, and as I put down my hand I touched something—I immediately grasped my chain, which fell loose, and I said to him, "You have taken my watch"—I don't think he made me any answer; he went off quickly—a well-dressed young man passed, and I said to him, "Stop that lad, he has taken my watch"—he did not attempt to do so, but looked at me and passed on—at the same moment a man apparently drunk staggered towards me from the street—I went on quickly after the prisoner—I met a man with a basket—I said to him, "That lad has taken my watch"—I pointed out the prisoner to the man—he was at that time running very quickly up the Darnley-road—the man went after him—he laid down his basket and I stood there—he went after him as quickly as he could—they went out of my sight in a few minutes—the prisoner turned the first corner to the light—a boy seemed to join in the chase—I could only see the three persons on the road; it is a lonely road—the prisoner was brought back to me and I identified him—I have not found my watch—the chain was not taken; that was perfect.</p>

               <p>on 18th February, between 4 and 5 in the afternoon, I was in the Darnley-road, Hackney—I heard the cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running—I ran after him—I afterwards saw him in the custody of Mr. Hagan's servant; he appeared to be out of breath—I saw him turn the corner of the Darnley-road, and he hid behind some bricks—I afterwards saw him in custody.</p>

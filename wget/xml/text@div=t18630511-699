                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 6, Queen-street, Ratcliff—about 12 o'clock on 20th April, I was in the Commercial-road—I had a pair of new trousers and a pilot-coat in a bundle in my hand—I saw the prisoner coming before me, and some parties behind him—he came and hit me right in the face, and snatched the trousers from me—the blow staggered me; it did not knock me down—two men then came up and gave me a blow, and knocked me down, and one said to the other, "Kill the b—"—the blow knocked three of my teeth out—they only kicked me once; that was in the mouth—I hallooed, "Murder!" and they then ran away—I was afterwards taken to the police-station, and shown the trousers—I have never seen the coat since.</p>

On the night of 20th April, about 12 o'clock, I was passing along Went worth-street, Commercial-road, and heard cries of "Murder!" and "Police I"—I saw three men running from the direction where the prosecutor was on the ground—I made chase after them and caught the prisoner—I said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "Only a pair of trousers belonging to my mate"—I said, "You must come back and let me see who your mate is"—he was carrying them in front of him, under his coat, loose—I took him back to the corner of George-street, where the prosecutor was, bleeding from the mouth—the prisoner said, "I did take the trousers, but I merely took them an a joke"—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Russell-row, Locks-fields. On Tuesday, the 11th of Oct., as I was coming up the Walworth-rood, about a quarter past one o'clock at night, going home, some parties came behind me, and gave me a push on the neck, which threw me down—as soon as I was down, Trent's hands were in my right hand trowsers' pocket, and across my breast—I cried out, "Keep your hands out of my pocket"—I had scarcely spoken the words before a policeman came up, and made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at Trent, who instantly ran away—the policeman pursued him, sprang his rattle, and he was stopped by a constable by the Elephant and Castle—I found that I had lost my pocket-book, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and two sovereigns—the note was in the pocket-book, in my breast pocket, and the sovereigns in my right hand trowsers' pocket—I had felt the book safe about two minutes before—I only saw Trent—it happened dose by a gas-light.</p>

CHARNOCK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has anything of this kind hap<lb></lb>pened to you before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have been robbed three times, some years ago—I was the worse for liquor, but was perfectly capable of taking care of myself—I had been out in the day on business, and had refreshment at two places—the last place was the Alfred's Head—I had not been there more than a quarter of an hour—I had felt my pocket-book safe two minutes before this occurred, by putting my hand outside my coat pocket, and about three minutes before that I doubled down the top part of the paper, because It was too long for the depth of the pocket, to keep it out of sight—I had four sove<lb></lb>reigns in my left hand pocket, which were not taken—I did not fall down from being tipsy—I was pushed down from behind—I saw no one but Treat—he was not assisting to raise me up in consequence of the helpless state I was in—I swear he did not try to raise me up at all—I had been to the Alfred's Head with a man who sells mahogany—there might be some women there—I did not see any girls of the town—I was not treating or drinking with any—I saw the prisoners searched—nothing was found on them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable P</hi> 95.) On the 11th of Oct. I was on duty in the Walworth-road, coming out of Union-court, leading into the main road, and saw the prosecutor and prisoners pass along nearly in a line together—King stepped into Union-court—I asked what he did there—he said, "I have not done anything"—about a minute afterwards I heard a fall on the pavement just outside the court—I stepped out, and saw the prosecu<lb></lb>tor lying on the pavement, and Trent leaning over him, with his left hand over his breast, and his right hand was drawing from his right-hand trowsers' pocket—the prosecutor said, "You have robbed me of my pocket-book and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—I made a reach at Trent, and also at the female prisoner, who was standing about a yard from the prosecutor—Trent started off—I followed him, crying, "Stop thief," and sprang my rattle—he was stopped by a police<lb></lb>man</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184310230202"></xptr>
               <p>of the L division, without my losing sight of him, at the corner of St. George's-road, by the Elephant and Castle, about 100 yards from where he started—I did not see what became of Mallabone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not see the commencement of this transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the prosecutor was lying about two yards from the entrance of the court—when I first saw King he was in the court—I was coming out of the court when King turned in—I did not see King do anything—he was not five yards from the prosecutor—I went into the road on hearing the prosecu<lb></lb>tor fall down—he was in liquor—Trent was not laying hold of him to raise him up.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 117.) About one o'clock in the morning I saw the prosecutor pass by, and the three prisoners walking and talking together, about three or four yards behind him—I lost sight of them for about ten minutes—I afterwards heard a rattle, and saw Trent run<lb></lb>ning from the Walworth-road towards St. George's-road, and Jennings after him—I slopped him, and took him into custody—I took Mallabone between eleven and twelve next day, and King between two and three in the afternoon—I searched them all, but found nothing on either of them.</p>

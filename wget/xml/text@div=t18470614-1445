                  </hi>. I am an undertaker, and live in Kirby-street, Hatton-garden—it is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn—I have a shop, and sleep there. On the 11th of June I had six cloaks and five hat-bands in a bag in my counting-house—they were safe at a quarter-past eleven o'clock in the morning—I then went out—I returned about a quarter past twelve, and found the prisoner in my shop—my foreman had stopped him coming out of the counting-house with the bag in his hand—these clocks and scarfs are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Trotter. A little after eleven o'clock, on the 11th of May, I left the shop for a few minutes—I returned, and saw the prisoner crossing the shop from the counting-house with the bag—he saw me, and dropped it—I let it remain till Mr. Trotter and the po<lb></lb>liceman came—they took it up, and I contained these clocks and scarfs—it had been before in the counting-house, and had been removed from there to the shop.</p>

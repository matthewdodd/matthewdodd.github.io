                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Adams—we live in New-street, Borough-road. The prisoner was in my employ as a weekly servant—I left home on the 2nd of Dec. to go into the country, and left her in charge of my room—she could get at my drawer and boxes, which were in my room—they had no locks to them—I returned home on the 16th, and I missed all the articles stated, my children's frocks, all the bedding, and a pair of candlesticks, but I have since discovered one candlestick—I spoke to the prisoner about it—she denied every thing except the children's frocks, which she said she had pawned to support my infant—she had not been authorised by me to pledge any of these articles, and had no necessity to pawn the frocks—my husband supplied her with money—these are the articles—I can swear to them all.</p>

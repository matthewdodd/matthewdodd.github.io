               <p>I was coming from Hampstead the 12th of August, at two in the afternoon; in the middle of the fields that are between Hampstead and Kilburne Wells, a man demanded my money.</p>
               <p>Do you know who that man was? - Six days after that, they brought me these two prisoners at the Rotation Office; between that time that I was robbed and the day that I saw the prisoner, I saw a man that was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100012"></xptr>very much like the man on the right hand; I saw him in the field, and I thought it was, and if he had been brought to me the same as these, I should say the same of the other man, the same as I said of this; I know nothing of the other man.</p>
               <p>Which man was it that demanded your money? - The man to the right resembles the man, but I cannot swear positively to him.</p>
               <p>You know nothing of the other man? - Only there was another man in the field; but he had his back turned to me, and I never saw his face; when the man demanded my money, I told him that I had but very little money; he told me directly, I will not hurt you; I gave him half a crown, a shilling or two, and three or four sixpences; he did not threaten me; he dispelled all kind of fear, by assuring me that he would not hurt me.</p>
               <p>Had he any arms or any thing? - He had a stick with a knob, that I thought was like a mahogany chair, that appeared to me square, but he did not lift it up to me, he kept it in his hand; he said, but you have a watch; I said no; he did not search my pockets; he blest me; he said, God bless you, God bless you.</p>
               <p>How came you to give him your money? - Because I thought if I should make any resistance, perhaps the man would use me ill; there were people in the nex field, just by, loading hay; I told them that there were two footpads in the fields; they asked me have they robbed you; have they taken a great deal of money of you? and they said nothing more.</p>
               <p>How long was it afterwards before you saw him at the justices? - Six days; I was robbed the Tuesday, and on the Monday after I saw him at the justices.</p>
               <p>You cannot be certain of this being the man? - No; I should be very sorry to swear positively to him, because I have seen a man that is exactly like him; and if that man had been brought to me, I should have said to him the same as of this, my belief is only a suspicion.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the same man you saw in the fields? - They tell me the man was taken the day I was robbed.</p>
               <p>So then the man you suspected afterwards, could not be the man? - No; of the two there must be one innocent; and I could have said the same things I say of this of the other.</p>

               <p>I am a victualler; on the 20th of August about one, I went to Kilburn Wells, I was in the garden; when I had been there about an hour, Mrs. Errington came into the garden, and said to me and several others that were in the garden, Mr. Scott you can run very well, do run after these two footpads, they have robbed a gentleman within a field of the house, just now; I came up to the gentleman, which is this prosecutor, to speak to him; I asked him what sort of men they were; he told me they were two men in waggoners frocks, and had robbed him not many minutes before, but two fields off Mr. Errington's house; he said one was rather taller and thinner than the other, and the other was a shorter and broader set man; I went as fast as I could to the place where he said he was robbed; I saw nobody there; I leaped over the hedge to the field on the right hand side, and at some distance, it might be very near half a mile, I descried a man getting out of a ditch; I was in a valley, and it was the rise of the ground; he was in a smock frock as before described; I followed him as hard as I could; he went very near Primrose-Hill; he went to the right to Paddington; I took him just on this side Mr. Wellin's hay-ricks, I suppose it is three or four miles; when I had taken him I said, you must go with me, that was the prisoner, Thomas Cox.</p>

               <p>Scott. I said, you must go with me, you have just now robbed a gentleman; he said he had been at a field not far from Mr. Wellin's house; why, says I, my friend, I have ran you from Kilburn Wells; and a man helped me to take him to prison; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100013"></xptr>kept him in Mary-le-Bone watch-house; as we were going along, he said he did not rob the man.</p>
               <p>Did you promise him, did you tell him it would be better for him to confess? - I told him he might as well confess, for we should find out the other.</p>
               <p>You invited him to confess on purpose to get at the other and take him? - He said he lived at the Shakespeare's Head, Pimlico, and then Mr. Hobbs and me went to Pimlico, and waited an hour, and then the man came down in a smock frock to his lodging; we followed him into the house; we told him he must go with us, he immediately did so, and he immediately confessed the robbery, that he had robbed the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him that it would be better for him? - Not a word; I told him I had followed the other young man, who had confessed he was with him at Kilburn Wells, and who had told me where he lodged; upon hearing that, he cried immediately and said, I am the man, I will give you the money that I robbed the gentleman of; he put his hand into his pocket, and gave Mr. Hobbs a half crown piece, one shilling, and two sixpences; he said that was all the money he had robbed the gentleman of, except one sixpence that he had spent; he was taken before Sir

            ; upon those cases where the transaction never lasts long, one wishes, if possible, to have both positive and circumstantial evidence: with respect to the positive evidence, you hear how it stands, then from the circumstantial evidence, this gentleman was robbed, and he publickly made notorious that robbery. At some distance of time afterwards, Scott thinks fit to pursue; he saw the prisoner,

             lodged at the Shakespeare's-Head, Pimlico; they go there, and Edward is taken; and without any promise whatever, he confesses that he robbed the gentleman; now what gentleman does not appear; it must be some gentleman that was robbed, but the question is, whether it was Mr. Detreme, the present prosecutor; he says he was robbed of half a crown, a shilling, and three or four sixpences; the prisoner said, he would give the money he had taken, which is not the same; he gave half a crown, a shilling, one sixpence, and said, he had spent the other; in a case of this kind, you must see that the prisoner is convicted of the offence of which he was indicted; you are therefore to consider, whether on the whole, you will apply the whole of the confession to that gentleman; at the same time you will consider, that in the case of a highway robbery, there is a reward, that reward will belong to the witnesses, who by adding a very little to the confession may make the reward good. I mention not this to throw any imputation on the witnesses, but that you should consider again and again on the mere confessional evidence before you can convict the two men, when the prosecutor tells you very freely and honestly that he cannot swear to the men.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had said that I had given half a crown, a shilling, and three or four sixpences to the people that took them; that is a circumstance that they knew before; they did not learn it of the prisoners.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 16th of August I went to Mr. Sowerby's, a pawnbroker, in Chiswell-street, between four and five o'clock - I saw the prisoner in one of the boxes, and took him into custody; I found this dial in the shop; the prisoner said a person gave it him to pawn; I asked who was the person - he said he did not know his name, nor where he lived, but he should meet him somewhere he had no doubt; I took him to the office, and found where the clock was taken from.</p>

The prisoner came there on Saturday, the 16th of August, about four o'clock, and offered this dial to pawn; I asked him what he wanted for it, but I forget what he said - I recollected he had wanted to pawn a dial which had been stolen some time before, and asked him if this was a better one than the last - he said he never brought one before; I was certain he was the person; I spoke to my fellow-shopman - we fastened the door, and I got the officer.</p>

I took the prisoner, coming out of the East India Docks, on 13th Dec., at half-past five o'clock in the evening—I found this piece of copper concealed next his person, and held up by a strap—there was a vessel in the Dacks that had copper in it—the prisoner said he had this given to him in the water-closet.</p>

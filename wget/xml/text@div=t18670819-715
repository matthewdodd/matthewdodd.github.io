                  </hi> I am manager to Thomas Southey, wool broker, of 23, Coleman Street, City—the prisoner has been a clerk in the service for nearly twenty years—on or about 29th November the prisoner brought me this cheque for 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the words "Please pay cash" were not then upon it—I asked him what it was for, and it was represented to me as being a balance due to Mr. Foster in respect of an over remit<lb></lb>tance—Mr. Foster is one of our wool buyers at Bradford—upon that explanation I signed the cheque and gave it back—it was the prisoner's duty to take care that it went into Mr. Foster's hands—the words "Please pay cash" are in the prisoner's writing—I did not give him any authority to do that—he was joint cashier with another clerk named Hammond, who is Since dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he joint cashier, or was he in a subordinate position? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi>, For the last two years they were joint cashiers, Hammond had been longer in the service, and had a larger salary; that was the only distinction between them—I have stated that Hammond was the prisoner's superior, but I added words which were not taken down, "if a longer service and a larger salary constitute superiority—I don't know that the prisoner was in the habit of doing whatever Hammond desired him—it was in the ordinary course of business to bring me a cheque to sign—Hammond died about two months after this—the counterfoils are here,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186708190004"></xptr>
               <p>and the cash-book—the counterfoil of this cheque is in the prisoner's writ<lb></lb>ing—all these counterfoils except two are in the prisoner's writing—one of those for 35,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is in Hammond's writing, and another for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Mr. Southey's—the figures 269 on the counterfoil of the 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque are in Hammond's writing; that refers to the folio in the cash-book I should say—it is entered in the cash-book by Hammond and ticked off—it is a debt of 59<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Foster—the date is given correctly, the same day as the cheque was drawn—Hammond might direct the prisoner to fill up a cheque to get signed—since Hammond's death we have found certain irregularities in his accounts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police constable attached to the Post<lb></lb>office. The prisoner was employed there as a labourer, in the vaults, and to carry books to and from the Money Order-office—on 7th Feb. he was so employed, and I was on duty there, and, about half past 3 o'clock in the afternoon, saw him leave, with a bag containing something which looked very heavy—he went up Newgate-street—that is away from the Money Order-office, which is in Aldersgate-street—I followed him, stopped him in Newgate-street, and asked him what he had got—he said, "Some books"—I said, "What are you going to do with them?"—he said, "I am going to take them to the printer's; I am sent by Mr. Dobson"—I asked him to let me look at them—he did so, and they were books of this description (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were about twelve—I opened one of them, and he pointed out the difference between the two, and said he was going to take them to have a set printed from them—the covers were on them then, and the numbers on the backs—he</p>

               <p>said, "I would rather you would go back with me to Mr. Dobaon, or come to the printer's," so I let him go, and returned to the Poet-office, and saw Mr. Dobson—in consequence of what he told me, I went after the prisoner, and found him at the Fulham-bridge public-house, Brompton, about 8 or 9 o'clock, the same evening—I asked him where the books were which I had stopped him with in Newgate-street—he said, "I have got them at the vaults; if you will come back with me I will show you"—I searched him, and went with him to Aldersgate street, where I had arranged to meet the foreman of the labourers—I gave him half a pint of beer, and said, "Now come along with me, and show me where the books are"—he said, with an oath, "I will not go with you"—I said, "You said that you would go with me"—he said, "You have no business to ask me any questions about it; it is not your duty"—I took him to the station, and next day went round to several marine store shops, and ultimately to Mr. Taylor's, a marine store dealer, of No. 236, Upper Thames-street, near Blackfriars; and, from what he told me, I went to Mr. Lee's, a waste paper dealer, at Nog. 10 and 11, Trinity-lane, where Lee and Taylor pointed out a quantity of books to me, some of which I produce—one of them is similar to what I saw in the bag, and there were also some covers which had been taken off—I took possession of all—there was 1 ton 16 cwts. 2 qrs. of books, and 9 cwts. 1 qr. of covers—there were some hundreds of, books, but I did not count them.</p>

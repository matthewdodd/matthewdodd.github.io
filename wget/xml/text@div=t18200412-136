            . I am a grocer; and live in Drury-lane. On the 29th of January, in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and bought two ounces of tea and a pound of sugar; she tendered me a 1 l. note. I asked her where she lived? she said at No. 6, King-street, Drury-lane, and that her name was M'Bride. I suspected it was bad, and sent it out by Lee; he brought it back - I did not mark it. I then asked her who she took it of? she said of a gentleman, she did not know who. She said a woman of her description might take a note, and not know from whom. I said it was bad, and if she would leave it I would send it to the Bank on Monday, and if it was good or bad she should have it again. She said,</p>
               <p>"Very well," and left the house. I locked the note up in my desk by itself, and on Monday sent Lee with it to the Bank - he marked it in my presence before he took it away - (looking at it) - this is it. She did not call for it.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live in High Holborn. On Saturday night, the 5th of February, between seven and nine o'clock, the prisoner came and bought goods to the amount of 5 s. 2 d. - she tendered me a 1 l. note, I asked her where she had received it? she said she had just got it from a gentleman down Holborn. I asked her name and address, she said,</p>
               <p>"Elizabeth M'Bride, No. 13, King-street, Drury-lane" - (looks at one) - this is it. I told her I intended to send it to the Bank on Monday, as I thought it was forged.

            . I am shopman to Mr. Brown. I saw the prisoner in the shop. Mr. Brown's account is correct. The prisoner returned in about an hour and a half after, my master was then out. She said she came to pay for the goods; she had not sufficient money, but she would pay for what was cut off, and have the note back. I told her Mr. Brown had got the note, and if she called about twelve o'clock on Monday she might know about it - she said she would, but did not. I went on Tuesday to No. 13, King-street, but could not find her there. I met her in the street, and she returned with me to No. 13. She said she was in a hurry, but would call in the evening and pay for the goods. I believe she lived at No. 13.</p>
               <p>MR. GLOVER. The three notes are all forged in every respect, and appear to be impressed from the same plate.</p>

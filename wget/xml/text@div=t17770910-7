            , Esq; sworn.</p>
               <p>You are Deputy-governor of the London Assurance, I believe? - I am.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner, Mr. Harrison? - I do.</p>
               <p>He was an officer in that Company in the month of July last? - He was.</p>
               <p>What office did he bear? - He was the accomptant.</p>
               <p>I believe the Company have at all times kept a cash account with the Bank? - Yes, they have.</p>
               <p>In what manner was that account kept? - It belonged to both Charters, and was the mixed cash of both Charters, in the name of The London Assurance.</p>
               <p>Have you the book in which that account was kept? - I have it here (producing it) this is the book in which the account was kept between the joint Companies and the Bank of England.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the circumstance of a committee of the Company meeting any day in July last? - On Wednesday the ninth of July.</p>
               <p>Will you please to take the book into your hand, and explain in what manner the account is kept between the Company and the Bank of England? - The title of the book is, Debtor; the Bank of England with the London Assurance, Creditor; on the debtor's side, the clerk of the Bank, when any money is sent to him or bank-note, enters the date, and what it is, such as June 16th, bank-note; then he signs his name Clifford, and afterwards writes the sum; and if it is the sum of a hundred only, he puts a bar or dash before the figure in order to prevent a figure of a thousand being subjoined; when a thousand is put down the dash is not added: when we send for money, we send an order to the cashier of the Bank to write off so much from our bankbook; one of the confidential clerks of the office is sent by the accomptant with this book to write off, and upon producing it to the cashiers at the Bank, they give him the money, and write off the sum of money.</p>
               <p>JURY. It is not a common rule to make a bar to all the sums, I see here are some where there are no bars? - I imagine that is where there are bills of exchange.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prosecution. Where the line is not carried home to the sum in the last column, the sum is entered in a former column, as not received immediately at the time, as when bills are paid in that have some time to run.</p>
               <p>Who had that book in general in charge in the office? - The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner, from the nature of his office, from time to time money of the Companies in his hands? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the prisoner being called upon on the 9th of July last to produce the book? - Yes, at about 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>I believe it was a Wednesday? - Yes; to produce it to the committee of the treasury who were about to sit.</p>
               <p>Did he deliver in the book? - He had compared the book with the other cash-books in the court-room where we hold a committee of treasury, and it was left there ready for inspection.</p>
               <p>Did he attend the committee that day? - He was in the room, we waited for him to open the committee, but he disappeared, he did not come.</p>
               <p>When did you see any thing of him afterwards? - I saw him in the evening, I believe it was about six o'clock; I had been informed that he was at one Mr. Richardson's at Wapping; I went there in the evening, and there I found him.</p>
               <p>In what situation did you find him? - In great agitation of mind.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him the reason of your coming to him there? - I told him we had perceived three alterations in the bank-book, amounting to 7000 l. and I desired him to inform me if that was all his guilt with the Company; I was very uncasy in order to find out how far the Company might be injured; I assured him I would do every thing for him that could be done with consistency, if he would come back to the house of the Company, and I prevailed upon him to come back to the house of the Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100013"></xptr>For what? - In order that he might explain matters, and give us a true and just account of every thing: he did return with me and one of the persons that had been security for him, a Mr. Richardson.</p>
               <p>When he came back was the book adverted to? - The next morning it was: I desired the secretary and the book-keeper, who were in the house, to take care of him, not to suffer him to do any mischief to himself, and likewise not to suffer him to go; he continued all night in the office under the custody and care of these two officers.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. On the day that you saw him at Mr. Richardson's you went in company with Mr. Richardson's son there? - Mr. Richardson himself.</p>
               <p>You would therefore not have known where the prisoner was, had it not been for his friend Mr. Richardson, who came to the office to you? - I should not.</p>
               <p>When you came there you behaved very kindly to him, and gave him every assurance that you would do all that was in your power to have matters set to rights? - With propriety and consistency, these were my expressions.</p>
               <p>At that time I believe you yourself produced a bond? - I did, of Mr.

                  Angus

            .</p>
               <p>Did you or not write on the back of that bond an assignment of it to yourself? - No; I had consulted previously with our solicitor before I went to Mr. Richardson, and he advised me to get Mr. Harrison to assign the bond to me the first thing, and he did do that to me as deputy-governor.</p>
               <p>What was the amount of that bond? - 7550 l.</p>
               <p>Then that bond was assigned to you as a security for the Company? - I meant it should be, in order to recover as much as we could, by that bond, of the sum of 7550 l.</p>
               <p>In consequence of your having done that, and your assurances to him, he returned with you as his friend to the office? - He did.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prosecution. Can you give us an account of what this bond was from Mr. Mackey to the prisoner, what Mr. Harrison said about it? - Mr. Harrison said, that he had at several times lent money to 
               <persName id="t17770910-7-person127">
                  Angus

            ; that he began by small sums, and they increased afterwards to very large ones; that he had been used very ill by Mackey, who had promised faithfully to return the money, and kept him in the greatest distress, telling him he must stop payment if he did not let him have more money still; he told me he acquainted Mackey with the manner in which he could only raise these sums by alterations in the Bank book, and he should be obliged to do so again, if he lent him more money; he did demand more money of him, and it went to the amount, I suppose, of that bond; whether interest was included in it or not I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>This was the account that Mr. Harrison gave you of the nature of the bond from Mackey to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And then you procured an assignment of the bond to indemnify the Company as far as might be from the deficiency in Mr. Harrison's account? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. You have been intimately acquainted with Mr. Harrison, and a friend to him? - He has been in the office 19 years and an half; I have been acquainted with him as our officer, but in no other manner.</p>
               <p>He was at that time under no restraint, but in the house of his own friend? - No, certainly under no other restraint.</p>
               <p>And was conversing with you upon this subject as an acquaintance? - As the governor of the Company.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that you were sent by the Company to him that evening? - I mean that it was my duty, as the deputy governor of the London Assurance, to find him.</p>
               <p>Therefore what you did was of your own free will? - Entirely.</p>
               <p>You was not sent as a particular officer of the Company by the directors of it? - No.</p>
               <p>But going with the friend of Mr. Harrison, at whose house he was, to his Mr. Richardson's house? - When Mr. Richardson was there, we consulted with the other directors that were present, and they advised me to go.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prosecution. When you found Mr. Harrison at Wapping, and that passed between you which you have related, did you make him any promises of safety, or that he should not be prosecuted, or any thing of the sort? - Nothing like it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100014"></xptr>And you used no kind of threats? - No, I only said, you had better come to the London Assurance with me, I will do every thing in my power for you that is consistent with propriety; he was in such a state of mind I was afraid he would attempt to make away with himself.</p>
               <p>This was all you said to him by way of inducement? - To the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it upon your own mind; did you ever desire him to confess? - I did ask him if there was any thing more beside the 7000 l. that we had discovered in the Bank book.</p>
               <p>But did you use any other means than you have given an account of to prevail upon him to say what he did say? - No.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. There was no prosecution then set on foot, nor any threatened? - None at all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you think he would have returned with you to the office, provided he imagined he should have been prosecuted? - I imagined he did not apprehend then any more than I did that it was a capital offence, I believe he thought it a breach of trust only.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Did not you enquire of him the responsibility of Mackey to pay that bond when it became due? - I don't remember my doing it that evening, but I did afterwards; I believe he might tell me without my asking it, that it was a very good bond, it would be all well paid; I believe he might say that, indeed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Whether you took it that the prisoner understood by what passed between you and him that he should not be prosecuted for any fort of offence? - I should imagine he could never think that; I believe he imagined that I would be of service to him in what I could with propriety; but I believe he must imagine that the offence was so great that I could not palliate or screen him, or help him off.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. And you at that time conceived that in point of law this was no capital offence? - I mean not a forgery.</p>
               <p>You could have no reason for supposing that any prosecution would be commenced against him? - There are prosecutions for many offences that are not forgery; why not for a breach of trust?</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. If the Court have a difficulty about the confession, we don't press it.</p>
               <p>COURT. The prisoner should know the situation he is in at the time he makes a declaration that shall affect his life.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Then I will only ask you a general question, Can you inform the Court what deficiency there was in the prisoner's account with the Company of cash that ought to have been in his hands? - The whole deficiency.</p>
               <p>Yes, the whole deficiency? - 7570 l. and upwards.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Which was the amount of that bond? - More than that in money and cash; but if other goods that belong to the prisoner, that are in our house, are to be supposed to be set off against the sum, it will not be quite so much; Mr. Mackey's bond is 7550 l.</p>
               <p>There is another bond, is there not, to the Company? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The corporation is now in possession of a bond from Mr. Mackey for the whole deficiency? - For the amount of his bond to Harrison, as we did not know what the consequence might be when we took Mr. Mackey and Harrison both up to Sir

               <p>What was the amount of the second bond? - 7581 l.</p>
               <p>When was that given? - We were advised by our solicitor that we should have a bond of Mackey directly to me, for we had Mackey's bond to Mr. Harrison assigned; it was thought proper to add the sum of 301. that would be the amount of the interest of that bond of 7550 l. to that, and that he should make his bond for 7581 l. that it might appear that the second bond was different from the sum of the first.</p>

               <p>Directed to Mr. George Hall, signed J. H. Wednesday 9th July 1777.</p>
               <p>"Dear Sir,</p>
               <p>"I am distressed beyond expression, having</p>
               <p>"forfeited every thing that is dear to me,</p>
               <p>"by an act of kindness to a friend who has</p>
               <p>"deceived me: inclosed is a state of my account</p>
               <p>"with the Company, which tortures</p>
               <p>"my soul whenever I think of it; I know</p>

               <p>"not see them any more; God Almighty</p>
               <p>"knows what will become of me, or where</p>
               <p>"I shall fly for succour; indeed Mr. Hall I</p>
               <p>"am one of the most miserable wretches living,</p>
               <p>"but I have betrayed my trust, for which</p>
               <p>"I never can forgive myself; when I parted</p>

               <p>"my own, and saw the distress of mind it</p>
               <p>"cost me when I did it: please to present my</p>
               <p>"humble duty to the gentlemen, tell them I</p>
               <p>"can meet any death after this sooner than I</p>
               <p>"can see them again, and am determined not</p>
               <p>"to survive the shame: I am, dear sir, a lost</p>
               <p>"unhappy being; I am so bewildered that I</p>

               <p>Mr. AUBERT. This is the account which I believe came inclosed, the secretary gave it me (producing a paper.)</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prosecution. This letter was brought immediately I presume to the committee? - About five or ten minutes after Mr. Harrison's disappearance, Mr. Hall brought it into the committee; a very little after that I went to the Bank in order to see how our balance stood there.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. This book was left open, so that all the clerks in the office had recourse to it? - Not all; it was in the accomptant's or treasurer's office, as it is called, when that office was opened, the press in which the book laid, behind the prisoner, was to be sure open, and the secretary might as well look at it as himself.</p>
               <p>Therefore it was not a book absolutely in his custody from the rest of the people in the office; but any body in the office that chose it might go and look at it? - No; the accomptant is always charged to keep things to himself about the Company's affairs. He has the care of the book. People might take it against his will from him, and the secretary might look at it; but it is none of his business.</p>
               <p>It lay there open to people's view? - If people chose to look at it forcibly they might; he alone had the care of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. And if he chose it nobody else could have looked at it? - No; unless a governor or director had ordered him to, produce it.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Was it his business to go backwards and forwards with this book to the Bank, or did he send it by other clerks? - He had the cash; he used in general to send a confidential clerk, the book-keeper, Mr. Austin, and deliver to him the Bank book.</p>

               <p>You know Mr. Harrison? - Very well.</p>
               <p>He was accomptant to the Company? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who produced the book on the 9th July, when the treasurers met? - Mr. Austin produced the book to Mr. Aubert.</p>
               <p>Who is Mr. Austin? - A clerk in the office.</p>
               <p>Did Austin produce it first, or was it produced by any body else to him? - He brought it from the Bank, and produced it to Mr. Aubert.</p>
               <p>Did any thing happen that made it necessary to send the book to the Bank? - Yes; the corporation had occasion for 4000 l. and Mr. Austin, the clerk, who generally went upon that business, took the book, and had the money wrote off at the Bank, and brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100016"></xptr> the book back again. In the time of Mr. Austin's going to the Bank Mr. Harrison decamped.</p>
               <p>How soon was it after Mr. Harrison decamped that you received a letter from him? - To the best of my recollection, six or seven or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Look at that letter; is that Mr. Harrison's hand-writing. (The witness inspects it.) - Yes, that it is.</p>
               <p>Was any thing inclosed in that letter? - He sent me the key of the office: there was an account inclosed in the letter.</p>
               <p>You know Mr. Harrison's hand-writing you say? - I do.</p>
               <p>You have been a long while familiar with Mr. Harrison's hand-writing? - I have been in the same office with him six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Take that book into your hand (the Bank book) look at the sum 3210 l. and tell the Court whether any part of that is the prisoner's writing. - To the best of my belief, there is.</p>
               <p>Which figure do you believe to be the handwriting of the prisoner? - The figure 3.</p>
               <p>Do you form that judgment upon your knowledge of his hand-writing? - I do.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do look at that again, and look upon the account delivered in by Harrison, in the second article in that account there is the sum of 336 l. look at those figures of three, and see if they are like that you have now mentioned? - I do; I think they are wrote by the same hand.</p>
               <p>Look at the figure 3 just immediately over that in the Bank book, and see if it is not more like that? - They seem all to be wrote by him.</p>
               <p>All four? - Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is the sum brought over? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that brought over by the accomptant, or by the clerks of the Bank? - By the accomptant.</p>
               <p>- AUSTIN sworn.</p>
               <p>You are a clerk to the London Assurance? - I am.</p>
               <p>Do you remember on the 9th July, when the Bank book was necessary to be shewn to the committee? - I was not present when the book was asked for.</p>
               <p>How did the Bank book come into your possession? - The prisoner at the bar delivered it to me with a write-off for 4000 l. which I went for.</p>
               <p>You were the clerk intrusted to carry this write off, with the Bank book, to the Bank of England? - I was.</p>

               <p>To what clerk of the Bank did you apply? - I believe to Mr. Clifford; he delivered the book back to me.</p>
               <p>Was any discovery made of any alteration in that book, either by you or the clerk of the Bank? - When the book was delivered back to me, I happened to turn over the blotting paper which was in the middle of the book, and I immediately observed that the money of the 16th of June, which I carried, 210 l. to the Bank, then stood 3210 l.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. You carried Bank notes for 210 l.? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prosecution. To whom did you pay this money? - Mr. Clifford.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Clifford make an entry of that? - I did not see him write it in the book, because the compter is above my head; he wrote them in, as I suppose, and gave me the book back again.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Clifford re-delivered the book was that sum entered? - Yes, 210 l. was entered in the book.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Clifford's name opposite to this sum in the Bank book? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at the book, and say whether you know Mr. Clifford's hand-writing. You remember when this book was re-delivered to you by the clerk of the Bank, whether there was any bar carried up to the figure? - To the best of my recollection there was to the figure 2.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with Mr. Harrison's mode of making figures? - Yes; I have been so these ten years.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to say, whether that 3, according to the best of your belief, is the figure of Mr. Harrison? - It is.</p>

               <p>Look at the entry of the article 1777, June the 16th. - I see it.</p>
               <p>What money did you receive that day on account of the London Assurance? - 210 l.</p>
               <p>And no more? - Not more.</p>
               <p>Did you make an entry corresponding with the receipt in that book? - I did.</p>
               <p>What was the entry you made? - The word June, the figures 16, the words Bank notes, and the word Clifford.</p>
               <p>Between the word Clifford and the last figures, which are 210, did you draw any thing, or leave a space? - I generally draw a bar line.</p>
               <p>Did you draw a bar line there then? - I believe I did.</p>
               <p>Is that figure of 3 your writing? - It is not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect how the sum was paid that day? - It was brought to me by Mr. Austin, their book-keeper, in bank notes.</p>
               <p>When bank notes are brought in, do you enter, them as notes or cash? - As notes, expressing what they are; they are from that placed to the credit of the several accounts, and persons that keep cash with us are at liberty to take up either notes or money.</p>
               <p>And to the amount of those notes you consider the Bank as chargeable? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>When you have made the entry of 210 l. or any other sum, do you deliver the book over to any other person, to have a further entry made? - No; I return the book to the person that brings it: I returned that book, having made that entry, to Mr. Austin; and he saw it, and, I believe, was satisfied.</p>
               <p>There is an entry made in the Bank cashbook, I believe? - There is a box: Mr. Foster, who was at the second cash-book, came to the boxes, that is usual, and entered these notes to the account of the Governor and Company of the London Assurance; he placed them to the credit of their account.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you make up the page of your account, who carries it over, you or the person with whom you keep the account? - It is never carried over by us, we never settle the books.</p>
               <p>Is the carrying it over your hand-writing, or the clerks of the Bank? - I cannot positively say whose it is; some gentlemen choose to do that themselves, if not the clerks at the Bank do it.</p>
               <p>COURT to Mr. AUSTIN. I observe in the beginning of the page the words brought over, and then a very large sum opposite it, whose hand-writing is that? - Both the words brought over, the date, and the sum is Mr. Harrison's hand-writing.</p>

               <p>When Mr. Harrison went from the office, I believe, he left 2000 l. in his desk? - About 1900 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. RANDALL sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known Mr. Harrison about five years; he always bore an exceeding good character; he has had a great many money affairs on the part of my family; he always discharged his trust with the greatest fidelity to my entire satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prosecution. There is no occasion to examine to Mr. Harrison's character, his having been employed nineteen years and an half in such an office of trust as this, shews very plainly that he had a good character.</p>

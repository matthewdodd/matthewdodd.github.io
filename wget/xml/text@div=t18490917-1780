                  </hi>. I am a stationer, of Fenchurch-street. On 5th September I was too late for the quarter-past ten o'clock train at London Bridge, and walked back to Gracechurch-street to get the half-past ten Peckham omnibus—I saw the prisoner and he showed me one—he took hold of my arm in a hurry, in case I should lose it—I had my watch and chain safe at the station, and did not miss them till I had been in the omnibus a minute and the police-man came to me—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I do not know that I had—I had walked over London Bridge in thirteen minutes—I had taken more than I ought—I was in Gracechurch-street two minutes, or a little more—I am not conscious that I fell down—I am certain that I did not try to get into several Omnibusses, and they did not like me on account of the condition I was in—I had never seen the prisoner before—I did not see my watch from the time I was at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter. On the evening of 5th September I was at Half-moon-passage, Gracechurch-street, and saw the prisoner with two of his fingers in Mr. Harwood's waistcoat pocket—when he saw me he took them out—I was on the other side of the way—he walked with the prosecutor arm-in-arm, and said, "There is your omnibus"—I came across and met him and saw his fingers in Mr. Harwood's pocket again—he then bid him" good night" and ran away into Ship-court—I showed him to a policeman.</p>

I was on duty and saw Wil<lb></lb>braham and the prisoner running very fast—I ran after the prisoner, took him, and on the way to the station I found this watch in his hand—previous to taking him I had heard something drop on the ground—I came back, and a by-stander had found this chain.</p>

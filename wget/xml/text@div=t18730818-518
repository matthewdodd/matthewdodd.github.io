                  </hi>. I live at 7, Princes Street, Haggerstone, and am a labourer in the service of the St. Katherine's Dock Company—on 19th June I was at work on the fifth floor of "D "warehouse with two other men, Orange and Brown—the prisoner was delivery foreman—about 2 o'clock he took me down to "D "warehouse, on the second floor—he took me through "H" room into "F" room—he took me in the corner, and told me to load up four small parcels standing against the wall—I put them on to the truck, and Orange and Brown trucked them into "H" room—I afterwards went into "H" room—they were bales of hide pieces—I saw the prisoner standing at the loophole—there was a van beneath—I did not see the four bales taken off the truck—I was told to load up some more bales—I did not see the bales afterwards—I then had further instructions from the prisoner to load up some more bales, but whether bales of hide or bales of gunny I am not certain—<hi rend="italic">the</hi> truck-man took them to the loophole—the prisoner ordered me to go into "F" room again, and load up some more bales from the corne; they were hide pieces—Orange and Brown trucked them to the loophole—the prisoner then told me to load up some more bales, which were gunny this time—they were standing opposite the loophole—the prisoner then told me to load up some more bales, and I went up into "F" room and loaded up one or two more bales of hide pieces—the prisoner did not then say anything to me about a small bale—I loaded up some more bales of gunny after that—he then told Orange to load up a small bale which stood behind a box in "H" room—it was then loaded up, trucked to the loophole, and lowered to Mr. Maynard, who stood at that time in the van—all the gunny that I loaded came from the "F" room to the loophole, and all the hide pieces, with the exception of the small bale I have spoken of, came from the corner of "F" room—the distance from the "H" loophole to the corner in "F" room I should say is thirty yards<lb></lb>after we had finished the delivery the prisoner told me to go up again to the fifth floor, where I saw him again soon after—he called me on one side as soon as I entered the door, and said to me "Round tree"—I said "Yes Sir"—he said "I think Mr. Nicholas has found out about some hide pieces being in the van, if he should say anything to you about it would you say that you have made a mistake. I can easily get you out of it, or make it all right with you; I can easily get you out of it by saying it was my mis<lb></lb>take in not telling you where they were"—I said "All right, Sir"—he said "Will you tell Orange and Brown the same?—I walked towards the men, who were at work, and he followed me and walked up to them—I said "You can tell them yourself'—he then told them similar to what he told me—I then went to work again on the fifth floor—I soon after saw Mr. Nicholas, the warehouse keeper, and the prisoner together—Mr. Nicholas said to me "Do you know what you are doing?"and I said "Loading up some bales of gunny I believe, Sir"—he said "Are you sure of that?"—I said "Yes, Sir"—he said "Will you give me your name and address, please?"—I said "Yes, Sir," and he took it down—then he took me across the yard, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180125"></xptr>
               <p>said "Do you think that these are boles of gunny?"—I said "Well, I am sure I don't know, Sir, for I never see any of them packed; I have not worked here very long. I know they are all packed on the second floor; they might be hide pieces and gunny together for what I know"—after that I was sent up to my work—the bales that he showed me were those that I had just been loading; they were not in the van but in the yard—I was called down again after that to see Mr. Nicholas; Mr. Cox was there, and the prisoner was present—Mr. Cox, I believe, is the superinten<lb></lb>dent—Mr. Nicholas said "Here is the young man that loaded them up"—Cox then asked me where I loaded them from, and I told him—he said "What made you go into that room?"—I said "Knowing there were some small bales there; Mr. Maynard called out for a small sized bale, I suppose to make the load up or make them lie right, or something, and I went in there because they would be small"—then I took him up stairs and showed him where I loaded them from—when the bales were being loaded up I saw that they were hide pieces, but I told that lie to Mr. Nicholas and Mr. Cox to get the prisoner out of trouble as I thought—the following morning I told the exact story as it really happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told a lie—I have been in the employ of the St. Katharine's Docks Company since the 9th January, this last time—I am an off man, paid off every night—I am merely a labourer, and have been off sometimes during that period—I told the lie, thinking that by getting the prisoner out of trouble, I should stand a better chance of work, as my work rests with the foreman—I may have used the word "parcels" to-day and before the Magistrate for "bales"—they were like the other bales—both the prisoner and the truck-man told me to load up more bales—it is impossible sometimes to tell who gives a particular order, for there is a great deal of hurry in loading these things, and we have to do it very quickly—there are perhaps 50 or 60 bales of gunny or hide in each room at a time, and sometimes three or four jobs going on at once—the prisoner was not giving directions for three or four different jobs at the same time on the same floor—he was doing at least two jobs at the same time—he told Orange once, in my presence, to go and load up some more bales of hide pieces, and I believe I said that before the Magistrate—there might be three or four men working together, and the foreman might tell one man to tell another to do so and so—I had not the least idea there was anything wrong—I had no occasion to think so—mistakes might occur, but I never knew of such a mistake as that—the whole thing present to my mind was that he had 'made a mistake, and that it would be settled in a short time—what I told Mr. Nicholas, that I had never seen any bales packed, was quite true—hides smell very bad—there is no such smell about gunny—if packed side by side, the gunny might partake of the bad smell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When the delivery foreman is delivering, he ought to be at the loophole—they were all one delivery—some were from "H" room—he never left the loophole—I did not know the difference between hide and gunny, and acted as I did to screen the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Charles Round tree—about 2 o'clock that afternoon the prisoner came up on the fifth floor, where we were, and took us down on the second floor to the "H" room first, and into the "F" room afterwards—! was ordered to get a truck and load up those bales or bags of hides against the wall—I believe the prisoner and a lot of us went into the "F" room, and he pjinted out the bags there, and I trucked some up to the loophole—when I got to the loophole the prisoner was there to receive them—they were then put iuto the van underneath—there were other bales near the loophole bales of gunny—after some bales were put into the van, I was ordered to load up in "H" with gunny, and I took the gunny to the loophole—to the best of my recollection I was told to go into "F" room, and load up a single bale or bag, which I took to the loophole—then I returned to "H" room and trucked a small bale or bag of hide which stood behind a box in the corner of the room—the prisoner, I believe, was in the van, standing in the dock or hollow place, and other bales of gunny were trucked and put into the van afterwards, and when the loading was finished we returned to our usual work—I have no idea how long the loading lasted—I saw the prisoner after we returned to the fifth floor—he said something to Roundtree and then oame to me and said, "If Nick says anything to you," meaning Mr. Nicholas, "about the hide, say you know nothing about it"—I said "All right"</p>
               <p>

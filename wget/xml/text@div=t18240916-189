There is a room above, where I sleep. I was at the stables about half past nine o'clock, on the 14th of July, and missed this property from my room. I had seen it safe between twelve and one: I had left the stables between eight and nine o'clock that night, and locked the door, and the room door; I had the keys in my pocket. The window shutter and the bed-room window were left open; the window below was shut. It was rather dark when I returned, it being a tempestuous night. I might distinguish a man's features without a light. No locks were broken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. The property might be taken any time between twelve and nine o'clock. - A. If they had broken in. I left the window open when I went out; it was then light. The coat cost 10 l. I had worn it a year. The stable has no connexion with master's dwelling house. My sleeping in the stables is not considered as part of my wages.</p>

We took him to the watch-house, and next morning he expressed a wish to see the coachman, who had seen him the night before, and told him, it would be best for him to say how he had disposed of the clothes. The prisoner afterwards took us to No. 9, Monmouth-street, where I found a box-coat, and a pair of breeches and drawers. he volunteered to go with us to point out the shop where the clothes were.

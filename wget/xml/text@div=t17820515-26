               <p>I am thirteen years old. As I was carrying the clothes home, I stopped some time to look at a little horse; the prisoner came up, and said I had been loitering upon my business, and snatched the clothes out of my hand; I said he must return me the woollen bag. I apprehended he was the clerk of the gentleman to whom the clothes were to be delivered. He returned me the clothes and bag, and then I went on towards the gentleman's house; but, before I got there, he came up again to me, and snatched the clothes out of my hand, and was going away with them; I cried Stop thief! upon which the prisoner returned me the clothes, but made off down Thames-street, through an alley, to the Three Tuns, a public-house. I delivered the clothes at the gentleman's, and informed the servant what had happened; they pursued the prisoner to this public-house, where he was apprehended; he was carried before a magistrate, who committed him.</p>

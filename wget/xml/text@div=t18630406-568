                  </hi>. I reside at Charlton, Kent—about 4 o'clock on the afternoon of 4th March, I was standing on the city side of London-bridge—I had a watch in my waistcoat pocket—there was a very great crowd—I felt something at my pocket, saw a hand on my chain, and missed my watch—I immediately turned, laid hold of the prisoner, and charged him with taking my watch—he was the nearest person to me—I do not think any other person had the opportunity of taking it—I called out "Police!"—a policeman immediately came up, and I gave the prisoner in charge—the key</p>

               <p>of my watch, and also the key of a note book were lying at the prisoner's feet—he said, "I have not got your watch."</p>

               <p>RICHARD HOOPER (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 383). I was on duty on London<lb></lb>bridge, almost close to the prosecutor—I heard him accuse the prisoner of taking his watch, and I immediately went towards him, and took him into custody—I saw the bow of the watch and the keys at his feet; another constable picked them up, and handed them to me—I searched the prisoner on the spot, and also at the station—I found on him two sixpences, and six-pence in copper, but no watch—I asked his address, he would not give any.</p>

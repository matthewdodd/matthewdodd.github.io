On 4th Jan., about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was in High Street, Poplar, and saw the prisoners and another man and woman opposite the Coopers' Arms, at the corner of Robin Hood Lane—James took something in a paper out of his pocket, gave something out of it to the men, and the two men went across the road into the Coopers' Arms, and called for some gin—I just looked inside the door, and told the barman something—I saw the two men at the bar; they paid with a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I cannot say which laid it down—I did not see it tried or returned to them—they went out, and went across the road to a little beer shop, Taylor's, and the women stood in the road—I went in directly they came out—I found a policeman towards Poplar, and he followed them with me to Shore and Brill's clothes shop—one of the men went in there, and the prisoners were over the road—the man came out, kept on the same side, and walked a little further up—Vernon went towards Commodore Court, and the other man walked towards High Street—I lost sight of the women—Iafterwards saw James coming down to Vernon, but she did not join him, as a constable seized hold of her.</p>

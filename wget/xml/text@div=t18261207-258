On the 14th of November, about ten minutes to seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner was leaving work - I searched him at the entrance of the passage, and found in his hat, which he had over his shoulder, a quantity of leaf-tobacco; it was three parts full- there were about 3lbs. of it - I gave information, and he was taken in charge - he had been there three months - I know nothing against him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it not your habit to search all the boys? A. Yes; he did not tell me he had picked it up, intending to place it on a cask; it had a handkerchief over it - he must have took the handkerchief out to have his hat searched - he knew that - I saw no basin or plate in his hand.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it your usual way to rub them down? A. Yes; and then they pull off their hats.</p>

            , my under-gardener, came to town, and, in consequence of what he informed me, the prisoner was taken up; I had him before Mr. Alderman Townshend at Tottenham. He was accused of having sold hay unknown to me, which I conceive is a theft. The alderman summoned those people who had bought it; they appeared before him: before they appeared, the prisoner desired the book might be sent for, in which he said he had kept an account of all the hay that ever had been delivered; this is the book (producing it). The book, in the articles of charge to the different persons, totally differs from the account they give of the hay received. I never gave him liberty to sell hay to any person but Mr. Newton, a stage-coachman, who was to take any quantity I could spare; and a gentleman who lived within two doors of me, who begged I would let him have a few trusses, which I did: I always settled accounts with them myself, and he never had permission to sell hay to any body.</p>
               <p>Where was your hay kept? - It was stacked very near a barn, close to the high road.</p>
               <p>Had he any particular charge of it more than the other servants? - He used to have the keys; but, upon this Field coming into my service, it appeared he had given Field the keys of the barn: it was from the circumstance of the keys being ordered to be taken from the under servant, thinking it most proper, that this was discovered.</p>
               <p>In what manner was the charge committed to him? - He had only the general care of the things that were there; he and the woman who passed for his wife, but I have just now discovered is not: she was my servant.</p>
               <p>Has he not bought straw and hay for you? - When I have given him money and orders for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Has he not sold hay for you? - Never, but, by my express permission, to Mr. Newton and Mr. Medina: he has delivered hay by my express permission.</p>

               <p>I worked as under-gardener to Mr. Tulk. After I had been there some time, I was ordered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300059"></xptr> by Woodward to carry a truss of hay to one Holmsley. He said it was by my master's orders. It is above three months ago: I carried it. After that, I was ordered by the prisoner to deliver hay to the servant of Mrs. Webb, who came for it. I delivered twelve trusses at different times: and I afterwards carried five more trusses to Holmsley, at different times, by the prisoner's orders.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any money for this hay? - No. After that, the prisoner said the hay began to get short; his master made a noise, and he must sell no more. I bound a load myself, and left it in the barn; and out of that load I missed seven trusses, five of which went in one day. I missed the trusses in three or four days, or a week, after I had bound them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He had the key of the barn in his pocket: I do not know how they could go out, except by himself: he was as likely as any body to take them.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was the key of the barn? - In the door.</p>
               <p>Did it stay there always? - I left it in the door, while I went to give my horses some hay.</p>
               <p>Then when you left the key in the door, any body might have gone in? - That I cannot say. Two trusses went when I had the key in my pocket: about ten weeks ago, there were three trusses more: the servant of Mrs. Holmsley came, and said she must have them. I said, I had no orders for her to have any. I delivered these on Friday morning. On Saturday I told the prisoner, I had delivered two trusses of hay to Mrs. Holmsley: he said, they were to have two trusses more, and that would make their complement: that was about two months ago. I did not know but that it was my master's orders, till I spoke of it to my master, and he told me the contrary.</p>
               <p>(Upon his cross examination, he said that the prisoner and he had had some words; that the prisoner called him a thief, and said he was robbing and defrauding his master; that upon this, he went to his master, and asked him if he had robbed him of any thing; and told him that he had delivered bay to people by Woodward's orders.)</p>

               <p>I keep a couple of cows, at Stoke Newington, in the neighbourhood of Mr. Tulk. I bought some hay of the prisoner. He came by Mr. Tulk's orders, as he told me. The last I bought of him was twenty trusses. I paid him for six, and owed him for fourteen; it was delivered me, all of it, I believe, by Mr. Field; but I can't be certain: I spoke to Woodward for it, knowing him to be a steward to the farm; and Woodward sent his man over with it.</p>
               <p>Who did you understand you was to pay for the other fourteen trusses? - Mr. Woodwood; and that he was to pay his master: it was delivered to me as Mr. Tulk's hay.</p>
               <p>Did he ever desire you to keep this matter secret from his master? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tulk. If your Lordship will please to ask her, if she did not say, before alderman Townshend, she paid him money at different times. - I paid for more than that, but not for this year's hay.</p>

               <p>I keep a public-house in Stoke Newington. I bought a little poney about Michaelmas last. I asked Mr. Woodward to let me have some hay: he said he had hay of his master's to sell; I could take no more at a time than two or three trusses. I don't know how much I had of him; he said he kept an account. I believe it was field delivered it; I bargained with Woodward for it. About the beginning of March, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300060"></xptr> told me Mr. Tulk had forbid him from selling any more; and I had no more of him.</p>
               <p>Was it known in the neighbourhood that he managed for Mr. Tulk? - It was understood so.</p>
               <p>Was it delivered publicly and openly in the town where Mr. Tulk lived, and by Mr. Tulk's own servant? - Yes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was at my house: I was going to buy some hay that came along the road: he asked me if I was going to buy some hay; I said, yes: he said, I believe my master has some to sell; in the course of two or three days, I will let you know. In two or three days after, he told me his master gave him leave to sell one load, which contained thirty-six trusses; he sent it in; that was, I think, December the 4th. I told him, when it was sent in, if he would enquire what the market price was, I would pay him that; but I have not paid him for it yet.</p>
               <p>Whose hay did you buy it as? - Mr. Tulk's: I considered myself as debtor to Mr. Tulk for it; if Mr. Tulk had asked me for the money, I should have paid him.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner desire you not to pay any body but him for it? - A little after Christmas, he delivered a bill to me in Mr. Tulk's name. I asked if I should pay him: he said, No; but, if Mr. Tulk called, I should pay him.</p>
               <p>Did he ever press you for the payment before? - No; from that time I left word with my wife at home, that if Mr. Tulk came, she should pay the money, or if Woodward came, to pay him, and take a receipt from him for the use of his master; and he never asked me for the money from that time to this. Mr. Tulk has that bill now, which he delivered me four months ago.</p>
               <p>Did you offer to pay Woodward? - Yes; but he said, when his master came, I should pay him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Tulk. Will your Lordship please to ask him, whether there was not a dispute about the weight, which was the cause of its not being paid for then? - I took hold of a truss, and said it was rather light. A man with me took hold of another, and weighed them: five or six were under weight; some were over. Then I sent for the man that bound it up: he came down, and there with a pair of steel-yards weighed it; some was under, some over: we put one on one side, and the other on the other; so every body might see it.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Tulk. How often did you settle with the prisoner? - Generally weekly; if not, it was his own fault.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect when you settled the last account with him? - It was up, I believe, to a week or a fortnight before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Was any credit given, in any of these accounts, for hay sold? - I am sure there was not, nor any money accounted for, though he received money several times of Mrs. Holmesly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>
               <p>(He called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

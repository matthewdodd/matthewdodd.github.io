               <p>I took the tea board from the prisoner in the presence of the prosecutor, I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The tea board was in the shop when I went out, and when I returned it was taken out of its place.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner's Counsel. What part of the shop was that tea board in? - The middle of the shop, I have sold several of them, it was the only one left.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner ask you the price of the tea board? - No.</p>

               <p>I went in with intent to buy this tea board for an acquaintance in the country, who sent me a guinea to buy a tea board and a set of china, I went into the shop and laid hold of the tea board and brought it to the door, they laid hold of me and pulled and hauled me about to that degree as if I was a dog.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What hour was it that you lost this tea board? - I believe it was about two.</p>
               <p>Was this woman in her senses? - She was sometimes in liquor, but I never took her to be in her right senses since she buried her son.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

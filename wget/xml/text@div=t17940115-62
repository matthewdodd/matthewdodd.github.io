               <p>I am a shepherd to Hawkes, the Prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the 2d of January number your sheep? - I did, and found the number all right. On Friday morning I visited them as usual, and I missed one, I came down and acquainted our man of it, he was coming to town and he told our master.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time on Friday morning did you miss it? - About eight o'clock. I found the place afterwards where it was killed, about one hundred yards off as near as I can guess. I found the skin in an adjoining field.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other part of the carcase attached to the skin then? - Yes, there is a deal left on, a good deal about the hinder part towards the tail.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of it? - There were pieces in several places, master can deseribe it better than I can, I have no doubt of it being the weather sheep I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any part of a carcase which you presumed to be part of the carcase of the sheep? - Yes, I see part fitted on at the justice's, and it all fitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of that part of the carcase which you saw at the justice's being part of the sheep which your master lost? - It all fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in the size of this sheep? - It was a very large sat sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean to say by its sitting? did you find that these parts that were behind in the skin were missing in the carcase? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what parts were left behind in the skin that were wanting in the carcase? - Master can tell better than I can. When they were all compared, the joints sitted as near as could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in the skinning of the sheep? - Yes, it was cut off along with the skin.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman of Clerkenwell, I apprehended the prisoner on the 2d of January, about five minutes before ten, he had a heavy load on his head, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150164"></xptr>thought it was stolen goods. I pursued him till I came to Clerkenwell Green, when I came to Clerkenwell Green, he went a cross the Green, and I got up to him and asked him what he had got? he said he had some suet coming to a tallow chandler in Cow Cross. He had a bag.</p>
               <p>Q. What past then? - He then went on crossing the Green, I had not been satisfied with him, I felt the bag and I felt what was in the bag, and I knew it was not suet; then in crossing the Green he crossed from me, I told him I would shew him the right way to Cow Cross, if he was going to Cow Cross. He was still going to cross, I told him he should not cross there, I would bring him to the watch-house; when I told him that, he throws down the bag, and then I pursues him, and catches him, and brings him into the watch-house, and examined what he had. I went for the superintendant Richard Rolse, and he came, and he examined what was in the bag, we examined the bag together, and he had got the two hind quarters, and the two shoulders, and the sat of the sheep.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner delivered into your custody on Thursday night, the 2d of January? - When I was sent for on Thursday night, the 2d of January, I was eating my supper, when I saw him I said to him, what are you here again? knowing him to be in custody for some beasts before; says he, it is only dogs meat. it is carrion; says he, coming along Highgate, I saw a man killing a sheep in a ditch, and I asked him for the fat and these pieces, and he gave them to me, he was somebody's servant near there; says I, it is very odd to me that this man should give his malter's property away, I then searched the sack on the bench of the watch-house; the first time I put my hand in I pulled out a shoulder; says I, North, do you call this dogs meat? I call it very good meat. I then put my hand into the sack again, and pulled out the hind quarter, two legs and two lions, very heavy, very fat and good mutton, quite warm; at that time I put my hand into the sack again, and pulled out another shoulder cut more fuller from the head to the breast; then I found fat, about two stone, there a bouts, pulled out in a rough manner. I then went and searched the prisoner, I found a heart rather warm in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the whole appear to be lately killed? - Yes, for it was still warm. I searching his right hand waistcoat pocket, I found this knife with the blood and tallow on it, as it is now. I have taken care of it from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the blade wet? - It was. In his left hand breeches pocket I found there three keys, one of them is a padlock key, they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Court. You had seen this man before? did he live in your neighbourhood? - He told me he lived in Chick-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it what you called butchered in the ordinary way? - It was butchered and slayed exceeding bad, the moment I saw the two bind quarters taken out of the bag, I knew it would lead to a discovery, being in the trade myself some years back; the skin was ruddled across the back and loins, a large quantity of the sat was left on the back part to the skin, where it is on the skin now; when we came to put the two bind quarters in the skin, it exactly tallied; not only that, but the fore part of one of the shoulders he had notjointed property, the other he had; one hind quarter he jointed properly, the other he had not, so that I can swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you perceive by the skin that they were not jointed properly? - I could, by what was left on the skin.</p>

            From the whole of these singular circumstances, had you the least doubt, or have you still, of the part that you saw at the justice's being your property? - I am clearly certain they were the part of that sheep, not only that, but the fore part he cut all the fat off, and left it on the skin; I have had the skin delivered back again from the police office, and it has been in my possession ever since; it was given me by Murphy.</p>

             near Highgate, whom I was acquainted with as a sheep drover, and knew him to be esteemed a very honest man, he was bringing some sheep to town and one of them dropped down dead with a disorder called the rutter; he stopped to skin it, and I waited with him, and offered him five shillings for the fat and some of the flesh, which I intended to boil for the dogs that always go with the waggon, which he agreed to, and with my pocket knife I cut off the legs and shoulders, which was fit for nothing else but dogs meat, and put it into the sack I had, and left the rest of the carcase there, and he took the skin with him; I came towards Clerkenwell, where I was taken into custody on a suspicion that it might be fat belonging to a person that produced a sheep skin; and Bushel being at this time gone to bring some sheep from Lincolnshire, I cannot have him to prove the circumstance above mentioned; however I humbly beg leave to submit it to your lordship whether it is probable if the sheep was stolen, I should leave the rest of the sheep behind, much less the skin which is valuable. I wish further to know how the prosecutor can say that it belongs to a sheep of his; to your lordship I appeal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150166"></xptr>and I humbly beg your interposition for an injured, innocent man.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing them at any time on the night of Wednesday the 9th of November? - A. Yes; one of them, the short man in black, he answered to the name of Deputy; at that time, as Bickham and I were going our rounds, we saw Denn in Pipe-makers-alley, Cow-cross: it is a very dark alley, and no lamp; I heard somebody whisper in the alley, we went up, and found two men standing at the door where they lodged, I believe; I asked them what they were, and what they were standing there for; Dunn made reply, what was it to us; I told them I was a patrol, and must insist on knowing what business they had there at that late hour; he appeared not willing to satisfy us from some impertinent answers, I cannot say what they were; I looked down, and in his right-hand I saw the blade of a knife shine, and I catched hold of his arm, and said, what have you got in your hand, a knife; he said, no; and he snatched his arm away from me; by that time, the man of the house where he lodged came down and opened the door, he drew himself into the door backwards, and dropped the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he drop the knife in the alley, or within the door? - A. On the mat at the bottom of the stairs; I called the watchman up, he brought his lanthorn, and I looked for the knife.</p>

Blower; I found the knife, and picked it up, and said to Dunn, is this your knife; and he said, yes; and I said to him, what intent could you have in having this knife drawn in your hand at this time of night; and he said he had it cutting his finger nails with.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a knife was it? - A. I believe, a buckshorn handle, about seven inches long; my partner, Beckham, and I took him to the watch-house.</p>

No, the opposite; I saw a number of them at the watch-house door, striking, as though they were striking over the hatch at somebody within; there was some night carts at the end of the alley, they prevented me seeing so much as I should.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see a watchman at the end of Peter-street? - A. After they were gone I did; I went up to the end of Peter-street, and saw a watchman, he was standing, and was held up by one man; he appeared to me to have had a blow on the head with a stick, which, apparently to me, had drove in the skull.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who that watchman was? - A. Larcher; when I came up, he was just getting up from a blow, they knocked him down again several times; when they went away he had several wounds in his head, I was the first person that laid hold of him to take him up.</p>

               <p>Q. That is close to the watch-house? - A. Yes, within one door of it; Mr. Brewes took and slammed to the watch-house door.</p>

             the bolt, the three men ran up to the watch-house door, there were two short ones and a tall one; the tall man had got a stick in his hand, and he struck it against the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he strike it? - A. As hard as he could, twice, and he pushed his elbow against it, and it came open; Mr. Brewer had hold of the end of the door, he stood at the corner of the door that flew open.</p>

               <p>Q. You said he had hold of the door? - A. When it was open, he was at the corner of the door, one of the persons struck him on the head with a stick twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect sufficiently to know whether it was the tall person, or one of the short ones that struck him? - A. The tall one, the other two kept pushing him on the side with their fists, they kept crying, O damn him, he is backwards, they had got in when they struck Brewer twice.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did they strike him before they got into the watch-house? - A. They were going in at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them, or see them doing any thing to the deceased besides what you have described? - A. No; they came back again, after they were in the watch-house, to the door; one of them said, have you given him a good one, yes, blast him, said they, we have given him a good one, blast him, we have ripped him up; then, they said, we will give a good cheer.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. My Lord, we beg she may be asked, if there was a knife in one of their hands? - A. I could not see that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How far was this window where you saw this, from the watch-house? - A. About as far as I am from my Lord.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You said they did something after they had said they ripped him up? - A. They said they would give a good cheer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they give a good cheer? - A. Yes; they pulled their hats off and gave a cheer; then they went away, and Brewer came to the step of the door, and was wiping his face with his handkerchief, the blood ran down from his head, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see any more persons than three? - A. I saw a great many after they were out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there more than three in the watch-house? - A. No, I saw no more than three.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they coming on the other side of the way? - A. They were coming up the middle of the road.</p>

Some persons took me into my house, they said I should be killed in a few minutes; after I heard the street still, I said, I must go out to see what they had done, I returned from my own door and went to the watch-house; when I came there, I saw Mr. Brewer standing in blood.</p>
               <p>Q. He was bleeding? - A. Yes; the blood was trickling down; before I had time to speak to him, I saw a great many people come up the street, coming to the watch-house; I heard them say,"damn his eyes, we will have him out."</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the man you laid hold of? - A. No; with that I heard a blow in the watch-house, but saw nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. What coat had the man on you laid hold of? - A. I don't know; some of my friends came and took me into my own house again; after that, I heard a great bustle in the street, but did not go out till the street became quite still; then I opened the door, and met Mr. Brewer coming into my house, he came in all over blood, running down him, and said, they have almost killed me; he came in, and I sent for the doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Brewer after this? - A. I went to the hospital on Friday morning a little after seven, or about seven, I saw him fitting up in bed; I asked him how he did; he told me he was very bad; I asked him if he should know any of them-</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How long did he live after this? - A. He died on Saturday evening about half after nine-My Lord, I beg to mention to your Lordship, that on the Friday, the first day of my examination, I was so alarmed, and frightened, when I was at Hatton-garden, I saw the prisoner Arnold at the bar, and would not own to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did not you own to? - A. At the first examination on Friday, I did not own to the prisoner Arnold.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you own to him? - A. I am a poor widow woman, and obliged to go out early in a morning to get my bread, and am up late at night in the shop by myself; I was afraid of my own life, for fear any of the party should come and injure me.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the reason you did not own to Arnold? - A. That is the whole truth why I did not own to Arnold on the first examination.</p>

               <p>Q. At the second examination, the story you told was a very different story to what you told at the first? - A. Arnold said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sworn the first time, when you said Arnold was not the man? - A. I believe I was, I don't know; I was so alarmed when the Justice asked me if Arnold was the man, I told him not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us you knew Arnold's person very well, by his passing backwards and forwards? - A. Certainly I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined twice the same day? - A. Only once; the next day after the affair happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined the day after this took place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you said you did not know that Arnold was the man? - A. Not to my knowledge, I was so much alarmed.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it known there was to be a reward the next day after the affair happened? - A. No; I told all the secret before I knew there was any reward.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you were examined the second time, was it not known that there was a reward published? - A. On the Jury, in the hospital, I told all the story.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you were examined the second time there was a reward published; had you heard that there was any reward? - A. I had heard that there was a reward by the bills that were stuck up in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was it? - A. I don't know, I never paid any attention to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw it in the bills up in the street? - A. No, only what people said; I am no scholar to read it.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You knew at the time it was him, but you were so frightened you declared it was not him? - </p>
               <p>Court. Q. I understand you to say, that you knew it was him, but was so alarmed for fear of the people he was connected with, that you were afraid to say it was him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say this man was dressed in a light coloured coat? - A. I took no notice of his dress, I did not say that.</p>

               <p>Q. The next day, you have told us the reason why you did not own to him; before the Coroner's Jury did you say the same you have said now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them the same reason for not owning him before the Justice you have given now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true that you did know him then, and that what you have now said is the truth? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Leach. I am superintendant belonging to the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the Thursday evening? - A. Yes; perfectly well; I saw nothing of the riot; first of all when I was going round the corner of Peter-street, about twenty minutes before eleven, I went from the corner of Peter-street to the first lamp, the corner of Sharp's alley, I heard the mob coming down; one of them said, the first bloody scout you meet, cut his bloody throat; I returned from there, and came back to the corner of Peter-street; they came down two by two; I look upon it there were about five or six and twenty of them; as I stood at the corner, one of them said, there is that bloody Ingelfield, cut his bloody throat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of any person in particular? - A. No; nor can I swear to any person; I stood on the other side, one of them came over, he had a knife in his hand five or six inches long.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the colour of the coat of the person? - A. A blue coat, and to the best of my knowledge, metal buttons.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour were the metal buttons? - A. I believe they were yellow or white, I believe yellow, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else? - A. He came up to me with a knife in his left hand, and cut me under the chin.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know the person that cut you under the chin? - A. No; I was cut there, and he cut my coat in the side; after they got down Peter-street, about as far as the Bull's head, I sprung the rattle; they then all turned back upon me as fast as they could.</p>

            Presented what to his body? - A. The knife; I then said, take the knife out of that man's hand, he has cut the man; the expression was then made use of, you bugger, I will cut you.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made use of the expression? - A. I cannot pretend to say, I believe it was from Dunn's mouth; with that they went by me, and kept down Peter-street, by Bull-head-court; Ingelfield, our watchman, sprung the rattle; on springing the rattle, they returned with sticks; I observed, with Ryan, Deputy, Williams, and Osling, they particularly had sticks, they returned to this person who sprang the rattle, and I heard them say, give it him, give it him; I heard Orme's voice particularly; they beat the watchman, there was a boy under the shelter of a window, stooping down, he said, for God's sake, don't kill him, they beat him some time; they returned from beating him, and came down Peter-street, I followed them to Saffron-hill, there is a turn-stile, where they turned up; turning up, there was a gentleman in black, Dunn made an attempt at him with his knife, his hand went so to him, (describing him as putting his hand out towards his body,) he drew back; I did not know he had any hurt, I said, Williams, why don't you take the knife out of that man's hand, he has cut that man.</p>
               <p>Q. You meant the gentleman? - A. Yes; I said, what is the use of cutting people that don't meddle with you, Williams called out, who is that mentions my name; I said, why don't you take the knife out of that man's hand, with that Williams turned round to strike me, they proceeded then to Hatton-Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Arnold? - A. Before me, on my side, they were in the road way; I heard Ryan say, this is the roller stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what he meant? - A. Yes, he held it up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by the roller stick? - A. The patrole's stick; they proceeded to the corner of Hatton-Garden, Holborn, with Williams, Berry, and another person unknown to me, went down Holborn; Deputy Ryan, Orme, and Toddy Osling went up the hill; I saw Arnold running across the way, he said, why don't you go home, Sam; I said, I don't thank you for your caution, never fear me; they parted then, as I tell you, in threes and fours.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Arnold go? - A. He went up Holborn, that is all I know.</p>

The wounds were dressed; I found him with some inflammation about the wounds, and some fever; in the course of the afternoon the inflammation and fever increased; on the following morning, Saturday, the inflammation was so much increased, his head so much swoln, and all the symptoms so much aggravated, that I thought it necessary to consult with the other surgeons on the case: we held a consultation, but the symptoms continued to increase throughout the day, and in the evening he expired.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you consult the other surgeons? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt the wounds so inflicted, as you describe, were the cause of his death? - A. Not any.</p>
               <p>Q. One of the wounds you say was upon the top of the head, what was the depth of that wound? - A. Through the skull.</p>
               <p>Q. The second wound on the left side of the face, what was the extent of that wound? - A. It penetrated the bone throughout its whole extent.</p>
               <p>Q. The third wound, below the right shoulder blade, what was the depth of that? - A. About three inches, and one inch in width.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it the unfortunate man died? - A. About nine in the evening; the body was opened on Sunday morning; the wounds were attended with a great inflammation; that inflammation was attended with a fever, that destroyed the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether, from the situation this man was in, from his wounds and the fever, he had not a knowledge of his approaching dissolution, when you were with him? - A. I had no conversation with him; I conceive he was sensible of his approaching dissolution.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he perfectly sensible? - A. At the time I first saw him, he was perfectly sensible.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Whether you thought it impossible for him to recover? - A. It was too early to form an opinion when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have been asked by the Gentlemen of the Jury, whether you thought he could recover; as the fever increased and the symptoms increased, could you form a judgment of it? - A. We despaired of his life on the Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WILLY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a patrol in the parish of St. Sepulchre's.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not present on the Thursday night? - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Brewer afterwards? - A. I went on Friday morning to see him in Bartholomew's Hospital; going along I saw the prisoner Arnold going across Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. What time? - A. I believe a few minutes before ten in the morning; I saw him in the broad part between the penns and the Hospital in Smithfield, with a drover's stick and a dog; knowing the man, I said, Arnold, you played pretty tricks last night in Cow-cross; says he, I was not there; I said, I heard you were there, and he was all of a tremble at the time; well, says he, but I went away at ten o'clock; says I, I am glad to hear you did, and I left him; I went to Mr. Brewer, and the other people in the Hospital, and enquired of Mr. Brewer if he could tell who did it.</p>
               <p>Q. You enquired after his health, what did he say to you? - A. He said he was a dead man, and he wished for God's sake I and every one else would apprehend the people, to do justice to himself and the country; I asked him if he knew who it was; he said, there was a man that was brought into the watch-house the over-night, that drew a knife to some of the officers, and was brought into the watch-house, and he said he was let loose the overnight; he said he was one, he believed; he believed him to be one that cut him, and that bad fellow, that drover, that cutting man, he believed him to be one too that cut him; he did not positively say they did do it, but he believed it; I said, is it

            ? yes, he said, that was his name, and begged of me to apprehend him, which I did; accordingly I went and got some assistance, and took him out of Smithfield about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Arnold? - A. He used to drove on Mondays and Fridays; when we apprehended him, I desired him to put his dog away, or I would cut him down, which he did, and his stick; when we apprehended him he had blood on one side of his face; how that came, I cannot tell; I had not power to search him, the number of drovers about him was so great, it was dangerous.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Brewer afterwards? - A. I saw him several times after; I told him I had got him, and he seemed very well pleased that I had got him; I took some others, but none of the three prisoners but Arnold; he said they rushed into the watch-house upon him, several of them.</p>

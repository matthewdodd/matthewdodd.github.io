We were robbed of these things either on Saturday night or Sunday night; the prisoner came in where we were at work, and said he had found a parcel of tools, and he believed them to be ours: we went with him to Battle bridge Wells, and then to a public-house; there we were told he wanted half a gallon of beer on them, and they would not let him have it; there we found our tools.</p>

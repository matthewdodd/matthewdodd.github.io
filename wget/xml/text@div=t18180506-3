I was at the corner of Devonshire-street, and saw the two prisoners running together as from the prosecutor's house - They were pointed out to me. I pursued, and saw Smith throw off his great-coat, he attempted to escape - I took him in Portland-street; I never lost sight of him. Freek ran down another street; I saw him in custody ten minutes after - I am sure he is the man. He was brought back by the crowd.</p>

            . I am a spring-maker. I was standing in Henry-street, Old-street-road, about a quarter of a mile from the cow-yard, and saw the prisoner and three more young lads coming from across some ruins in a direction from the cow-yard, they stopped against the corner of a stable which I knew had been robbed. I went over the way to see if they had any thing; they retreated when I went towards them. I got over the pailing after them, and the shovel and spade were thrown down by one of them, all four ran away. I overtook the prisoner, and asked how he came by them? he said, he had not stolen them, but the boys had, and he was going with them to White-cross-street to sell them. Doe's name was on them.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met these boys as I was going to work, they said they would come with me; I turned aside for something, they followed me. The man said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got?" they then threw them down, and ran away.</p>

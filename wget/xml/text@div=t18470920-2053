                  </hi> I am shopman to John Cramp, a butcher, of High-street, Whitechapel. On the 27th of Aug. this note produce was presented to me at my master's shop—I do not know who by—the articles required were not given—Mr. Sockett was a customer of my master's.</p>

                  </hi> I keep the Cranbrook dairy, Aldgate, and deal with Mr. Cramp. The prisoner was in my employ about six months—I believe this paper to be his writing—he was not in my employ on the 27th of Aug., he had left, I should say, five months before—I had given him no authority to write this order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Where did you see me write? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I employed you to make a list of the men's walks for me—I saw you copy it up stair in the office—there was no one in the room when you were writing—you were in my employ that week as an odd ma—I have had frequent opportunities of seeing you write—I have seen the receipts to several bills which you received six months ago, and did not account for—they have been returned to me—I have seen you write quite sufficient to know that this is your writing—you acknowledged the receipts on the bills to be your writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was the prisoner employed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> First as a carrier, and afterwards as an odd man—he would have writing to do as a carrier—we send out the bills to the customers—the man are allowed to receive them—I did not see the bills made out by him before they went to the customers—his duty was not to write anything which came under my cognizance while he</p>

               <p>was carrier, all his writing would go to the customers—when I changed his employment, he had to look after the men as a sort of spy, to see that they did their duty, and to take a list of their walks—he had perhaps fifty or sixty names to write down on each beat—he continued a week in that capacity, and then was employed to deliver milk and butter—that would require no writing, unless he received money on our account—I have had such an opportunity of seeing his writing, as warrants me in my belief that this is his.</p>

                  </hi> I superintend Mr. Sockett's business. I knew the prisoner when he was in his employ—I have seen him write frequently, so as to recollect the character of his writing, and believe this order to be his.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When did you see me write? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw you write a letter—you did not let me look at it, but I was close to the table while you were writing—I cannot tell what it contained.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever see him write anything else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing but letters—they were not written for his employers—I did not look over him, so as to see what he wrote, but was close enough to discover the style of his writing—I saw the head of the letter, "3, Mitre-square," where I lived—I never saw him write on any other occasion.</p>

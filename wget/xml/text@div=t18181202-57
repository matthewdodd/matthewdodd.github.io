            . I am a watchman. I was in Swallow-street, calling ten o'clock, heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running in the middle of the street, I ran across, and took him - he attempted to get away, but could not. The prosecutor came up, and said he was the man who had robbed him of his seals and key - he was not above five or six yards behind the prisoner, when I took him. I found nothing on him. The prisoner said he had struck him, but did not take his seals.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did he own that he had struck him - A. Both at the watch-house, and at the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from Knights-bridge, as I came through the court, there were several men together - I passed them. They were quarrelling, and I returned to see what was the matter; the prosecutor seized me and charged me with the robbery, I pushed him away, and said it was false, went away, and the watchman took me.</p>

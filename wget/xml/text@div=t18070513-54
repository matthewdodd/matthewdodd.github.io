Yes; my son lived in the house at the time the watch was lost; it was in the month of March, sometime about noon; I saw the watch again on the 12th of April, at the police office, Whitechapel.

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street office. On the 16th of March I was sent for to Mr. Windsor's, a pawnbroker in Whitechapel; they said they had stopped a woman for offering to pledge a metal watch for a gold watch; they suspected she had stole it; they delivered the watch and the prisoner to me. I asked the prisoner whose watch it was, she said it was her husband's, she was going to pledge it, to make money to pay a quarter's rent; she said her husband worked for Mr. Liptrap, I found he had worked there five years ago; she then said her husband lived over the water, and worked at a brewhouse there. She was sent to prison, and was brought up for examination; and in consequence of what the husband had said, she said then that her father gave it her before he died; she had had it for twenty years; she once pledged it in Oxford-street, that her husband knew nothing of it. She was discharged because no owner could be found. I kept the watch. When the prosecutor called on the 12th of April, I shewed the father the watch, he claimed the watch as his son's watch; the son saw it on the next day before the magistrate, and claimed it. I went over the water the same day, and took her in custody.</p>

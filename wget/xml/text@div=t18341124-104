                  </hi>. I am a bookseller and stationer, and live in Old Cavendish-street. The prisoner, Charles Sharp, was in my employ as errand-boy for about eight weeks—I have seen his brother, Thomas, before I had given Charles notice to quit my service on the Saturday previous to Monday, the 27th of October—he was to quit on the Saturday following—on the morning of Tuesday, the 28th, the officer called and asked if I had been robbed—I said I had missed money at times—I looked into my cash-box and missed a £5 note—I gave the officer the number of it from my book—I went to Mr. Compton's afterwards—Sharp had asked leave to go home earlier than usual on the Monday night, as his father was going to buy him some clothes—I allowed him to go about eight o'clock—he had no access to my box—it was always inside a desk in the shop, which desk was always locked—I or my wife kept the key—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a note</hi>)this is the note I missed.</p>

The prisoner Joiner came to me on Monday, the 27th, between six and seven o'clock—he lives at Miss Spalding's, just opposite me, in Wigmore-street—he brought this note, and asked if I would give his ladies change for a £5 note, which I immediately did—the principal part in half-sovereigns, and some in half-crowns.</p>

                  </hi>. I deal in horses, at 122, Westminster Bridge Road—I have stabling there—on the 14th July I used the articles in question—they were safe up to 10 o'clock at night—there was a roan horse, a saddle, four brushes, two sets of clothing, two pairs of reins, and other things—I was told something, and fetched the horse and bridle back at 5 in the afternoon—a man named Baker had been previously employed by me—I have not seen him since—this apron cost about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is now worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this saddle cost six guineas; it was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when it was stolen; it is not worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now—the reins were worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the sponges 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the bridles 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the four brushes 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, the rugs about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the two other sets of horse clothing 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never knew such things to be sold in public-houses.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer E</hi>). I heard of Mr. Hatch's loss in July, and on 17th September, I went with Copping to the prisoner's lodging, 18, Euston Street—he was not there—two of them had the second floor back and front—I found this gig apron there, which I took to the</p>

               <p>Euaton station, and showed it to the prisoner, who was a job porter there—I said "I have been round to your lodging, and this was found in your room, and I am told it belongs to you"—he said "Yes; it does, I bought it and two or three horse cloths, and saddles and bridles, at the Jubilee public-house, seven or eight weeks ago, I gave 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them in front of the bar, early in the morning"—I said "We must detain it, as we believe it is stolen"—he said that he had sold the other things to a man at a shop near Oxford Street—I kept the apron—I saw the prisoner again on November 15th, at the Euston Station, and said that I had made inquiries, and the apron had been stolen from Mr. Hatch's, in Westminster Bridge Road, on 15th July, and a horse cloth also, and I should take him for being concerned, with another man not in custody, in breaking and entering the premises, and stealing the articles—I said "I believe that morning when you bought them, you left them in the cloak-room at Euston"—he said "I did not"—I said "I have every reason to believe you did, for the porter on duty told me so"—he said he had not; I said "You must come with me, and we will see the porter"—we went to Somer's Town, and saw Charles Amos, who was on duty at the cloak room, on 15th July—I said "You told me that Butcher left some horse cloths and reins in the cloak-room, on 15th July"—he said "Yes;"—I said to Butoher "You hear that?"—he said "Yes; I did leave them there"—I told him I should take him to Southwark, and asked if he would take me to the shop in Oxford Street; he said that he would not—before going ia before the Magistrate, he said that if Mr. Hatch would not charge him, he would say where the things were—I said "You told me Oxford Street"—he said "I sent some to my father, and some I sent to a man named Oldham, in Devonshire Road; I sold him the saddle also"—he said that he had sent the rugs to his father at some place in Essex.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went to the place where he lived to find some property stolen from the railway, that had nothing to do with this charge—the man living in the same house was not suspected of having had anything to do with this robbery—I took away the gig apron and a good many more things: coats, waistcoats, scarves, two shirts, a carpet bag, a black bag, and I think an umbrella, also a silver watch and chain—I had no claim upon any of those things, but we were in search of wearing apparel—I did not charge him with stealing any of those things; and they have all been offered back to him, with the exception of the watch and chain—he refused to take them unless the whole were given up to him—he did not get them all back till the day he was given in custody, but he might have had them—I believe there was a list written down in Superintendent Ecoles' room of what he might have back—those things were taken from him eight weeks before he was given in charge—he was constantly at work—he was kept on because we had not found any owner for the clothes—I did not charge him with stealing any of the articles till 15th November—I did not put a lot of questions to him—I asked him if he could account for the ring—I did not ask him where he got the scarves from—if I did not ask him where he got the whole of the articles, Eccles or the inspector did, and he told us where he got them all—he said that he borrowed some money of the policeman to pay for them, but he did not mention Amos—he did not tell me he took a receipt for them, or say so in my presence—he did not tell me that he borrowed a pen and ink of Amos, for that man to write a receipt—when I took him to the superintendent he turned out all the things in his pocket</p>

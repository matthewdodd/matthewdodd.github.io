            ; the prisoner was not here to be tried at the time his companion stood charged with this offence at that bar, and who was found guilty; the prisoner had then escaped from justice: the facts to bring this charge home to the prisoner are shortly these; a Mr. Linton, on the 8th of July, about two in the morning, returning to his own home, was met in New-street by two persons, who came up to him and robbed him of his money, and observing his watch chain, they came back and asked him for his watch, he not willing to part with it, they snatched it from him, and at the time of the struggle one of the persons struck a knife in his side, which was the cause of his death; one of the watchmen came up, but he could only say he was robbed and murdered, they took him to Mr. Jarvis, a surgeon in the neighbourhood, and he soon after expired; Dixon was apprehended the same morning at his own house, in company with one Smith, the one was sitting in a chair, the other was laying on a bed, when the officers of justice came there, they found the clothes of this man remarkably bloody, and they found bloody water in the room as if they had been washing blood out of something; Smith said he had been in company with this man over night, that the prisoner and Morgan had been at a public-house till about nine or ten in the evening of tha t day, that they went out together and parted, he went to another public-house, the Pilgrim, where he fell asleep at one o'clock, and when he waked, between three and four, the prisoner came to this house, it was clear therefore that the prisoner had been out the greatest part of that night; when he was committed Morgan came to see him, and some conversation happening in the gaol, the Governor of Tothill-fields<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200077"></xptr> Bridewel desired a man of the name of Davis to attend to the conversation, something passed which ocasioned suspicion in his mind that Morgan was also concerned, the prisoner being in gaol, and Morgan was detained; but by some means or other the prisoner broke out of gaol and escaped justice: the evidence I shall have to lay before you, will be first of all, the death of Mr. Linton, that he was murdered in the street on the 8th of July; that the prisoner was in company with Morgan at that time, and the conversation that passed in the prison between the man that has been executed and the prisoner; and from these circumstances you will be to judge whether or no this man is, or is not, guilty of that robbery and murder. I need not tell you Gentlemen, that it is not necessary under this indictment to prove that the prisoner was the very hand that committed the offence; because in point of law if they were in company committing an unlawful act, he must answer for it as well as the man that gave the wound: if therefore you are convinced that they were in company together acting in that robbery and that he was present, it will become your duty, however painful it may be, to pronounce the prisoner guilty of this charge.</p>

               <p>Mr. Burdett. Do you recollect being in company with the prisoner on the 7th of July? - I do at the Queen's-head, in Vine-street.</p>
               <p>At what time? - On Wednesday between the hours of eleven and twelve, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay with him? - Till between two and three in the afternoon, on Wednesday, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Who else was in company? - Three or four other persons, I do not know some of their names, there were two persons of the name of Smith.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Do you know Morgan? - I have seen him.</p>
               <p>Was he there? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - About three, the conversation of the company turned upon a sight at Tothill-fields, we went then in company to the sight.</p>
               <p>How long had you been at the Queen's-head in Vine-street? - From about eleven I think it was, Morgan was not there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood. After you had been at the sight, where did you come to then? - To the same house.</p>
               <p>What time might it be then? - To the best of my recollection between nine and ten; there was the same company, the prisoner at the bar, the Smiths, Dixon went out and Morgan with him, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>What time did they go out? - About ten it might be, I cannot particularly mention the time.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay at the Queen's-head? - We returned from Tothill-fields about nine, went to the Queen's-head, and staid till ten, or a quarter after; Morgan was there, sitting in the box where I was; I believe he staid there till about half after ten.</p>
               <p>Where did you go then? - We went to the Bell, I cannot tell the sign, in Chancery-lane, it is nearly opposite Rolls-buildings.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay there? - Till about half after eleven, I know the landlord was shutting up, and the landlord desired we would depart the house.</p>
               <p>Was Morgan in company with you? - I know Dixon and Smith were in company, but for certain I cannot tell whether Morgan was or not; we went up to the top of Chancery-lane: Mr. Smith, who is a match-maker, and lived in my neighbourhood, he says, Jack, we will not part with dry lips, says I, I have no money; we were at a loss for a moment to know what house to go to; we went to the Pilgrim, then it was about a quarter or twenty minutes after twelve by the dial, the watchman was going twelve as we were going up Holborn.</p>
               <p>Who went into the Pilgrim with you? - The prisoner and the Smiths, and another person whose name I do not know; there were five of us; Morgan was a t the Pilgrim, I believe there were six, there was another person.</p>
               <p>What did you do at the Pilgrim? - We sat there, and drank and smoked.</p>
               <p>Did all the company stay? - To the best of my remembrance they did.</p>
               <p>Court. Till what time? - It was about twenty minutes after twelve when we went in, and to the best of my recollection we staid there till about a quarter after three; I did not recollect any one of the persons in the company being absent five or ten minutes together, for reasons I can tell the Court.</p>
               <p>Did all the company stay all that time that came in with you? - To the best of my recollection they did.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was Dixon there all the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you awake all the time? - Yes; there was a Smith in company, who is a very jocose man, and he had a rope's-end, and if any person attempted to go to sleep, he would hit them with that end; that was Smith the match-maker, I believe his name is William.</p>
               <p>As to your own part, you did not sleep? - Not much at a time, I might nod, but for this man I never slept above four or five minutes at a time; he never slept: we came out of that house together.</p>
               <p>Who was in company when you left the house? - There was Dixon in company, Morgan, and the two Smiths, myself, and another person.</p>
               <p>Where did you go? - We went and took a walk, and then went to the Queen's-head, and knocked the people up.</p>
               <p>Who was with you when you went to the Queen's-head? - The same people to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Morgan go with you to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200084"></xptr> Chancery-lane, or did he come in afterwards? - I do not recollect his being at the house in Chancery-lane, but I recollect his being at the Pilgrim.</p>
               <p>About what time do you recollect he came into the Pilgrim? - I recollect his being there at half after twelve.</p>
               <p>Then you did not miss Morgan for any length of time after half past twelve? - He was there, to the best of my knowledge, after half past twelve.</p>
               <p>This you give as a reason why you could not sleep for above five minutes at a time, this humour of Smith's? - It was general, and when one had got a stripe, he would tell of another, so that nobody could sleep.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What are you? - I served my time to a stationer.</p>
               <p>You knew the two Smiths very well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You knew Dixon and Morgan? - I never saw them before that night, nobody knew where to find me in company but the Smiths; I work for my brother, and have for several years past.</p>
               <p>You have had the misfortune to have been in custody? - I was taken up on suspicion, I was going up Tottenham-court-road, and some persons laid hold of me, for what reason I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Shall I tell you what it was for? - If you please.</p>
               <p>For a footpad robbery, am not I right? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Now this man you do not at all recollect his being with you at the Bell? - It is a house opposite the Rolls-buildings, I cannot tell the sign.</p>
               <p>Did you meet him in the way to the pilgrim? - To my knowledge I did not, I saw him there.</p>
               <p>How came he there? - It is a night-house, any person may go in and come away when they like.</p>
               <p>Where was you during the last session? - What time of the month, I do not recollect what time it was.</p>
               <p>During the time Morgan was tried? - I heard of that.</p>
               <p>How came you then not to come and give this evidence? - I was not subpoened, I am now, if I had been subpoened I should have come, I heard the murder was committed between the hours of one and two.</p>
               <p>And yet you say he was in company from half an hour past twelve till past three? - To the best of my recollection he was, I cannot say why I did not come on Morgan's trial, it so happened I did not.</p>
               <p>You are as sure of Dixon as of Morgan? - I speak impartially as much for one as the other, I am not quite so clear that he was in my company, Dixon sat next to me; Morgan did not, to the best of my recollection and belief they were both there.</p>

               <p>You are sure they were in company together before that, and went to the sight and all that? - Morgan did not go to the sight with me, Morgan came in at ten at night.</p>

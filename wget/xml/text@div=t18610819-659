                  </hi>. I was formerly a police-inspector, and am now in the service of the Mint—I received information which induced me to go with sergeant Leather to Hazlewood-place, in July last—we found the front door open and the parlour door ajar—I opened it, went in, and saw a man and the prisoner sitting at a table—there was a dog in the room—the prisoner put her left hand in one of the pockets of this apron (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which she had on—she had some difficulty in getting her hand out—she took out something which appeared to be a rag—sergeant Leather attempted to seize her, but the dog snapped at him, and he pulled his hand back—the prisoner then moved a board which was temporarily placed on the floor, put her hand down a hole and dropped a rag down—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be the rag—the man pushed a table between sergeant Leather and the woman to prevent him taking her, but he took her—I went down into the cellar and on the top of some dust I found this rag containing these three counterfeit florins separately wrapped in paper, precisely under the hole—I re-entered the room, held the rag in my hand, and the prisoner said, "I</p>

I accompanied Brannan, and saw the prisoner sitting at a table—she put her hand under her apron and took something from a pocket under it—I tried to seize her, but the dog flew at me and I drew my hand back—I saw her shove a board on one side on the floor which concealed a hole, and throw a rag down the hole—I took her in custody—Brannan left me there and came back with the rag—while he was in the cellar, she said to the man, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, you have got nothing to fear, I will clear you"—when Brannan showed the parcel, the prisoner said, "So help me God, I did not throw them down!".</p>

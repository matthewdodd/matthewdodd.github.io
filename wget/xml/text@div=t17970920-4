             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. - I keep a hosier's shop, No. 81, East-Smithfield: On the 20th of June, my son brought me a five pounds note; I called in at Mr. Roebuck's, and shewed him the note.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the note? - A. I gave the note to Mr. Roebuck, and then came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you gave it to Mr. Roebuck, did you notice what the note was? - A. It was for five pounds, drawn from Bristol, directed to the Cashiers of the Bank of England; I observed the number particularly, it was No. 800; it is made payable to Robert Wilkinson, or bearer.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went home, did you see the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; that is the man; I asked him where he had the note; I told him I had been informed there were a number of bad notes of that description; he told me had taken it on board a ship he believed, of a mate; I asked him what goods he wanted, he told me, two pair of stockings for himself, and two or three pair for a woman; I told him there was a friend of mine gone to the Bank, to know if it was a good one, and when he returned, I would give him the difference in change; he said, no, he could not wait, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200006"></xptr>must be going, and seemed very much agitated; I said, wait a few minutes, my friend will return back presently, and we may as well settle it at once, and take your change with you; he said,no, he must be moving, he could not stop; I then asked him if he wanted any other goods; he said, no; says I, do you went a silk handkerchief; says he, I want one, but I do not see a good one; I desired my daughter to pull one down that was a good one, he liked the handkerchief, and put the stockings in the handkerchief, and tied them up, and ran out of the shop quite in haste; he would not give me leave to tie them up in a paper; I forgot to state one part of the conversation; I asked him what his name was, when he was in such a hurry, and would not stop till Mr. Rocbuck returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Roebuck was the friend that you sent to the Bank? - A. Yes; I asked him his name, and he said, Richard Barber; I asked him what ship he belonged to; he said, the Mary, of Yarmouth; I asked him when he would return for his change; he desired me to be sure to have it ready, and he would come at six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where the Mary, of Yarmouth, then lay? - A. Yes; he said she lay at Wapping old stairs; after Mr. Roebuck returned, I went down to Wapping Old Stairs, and enquired amongst the watermen, but could not hear of any such ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner after that, till you saw him before my Lord-Mayor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might that be after he was at your shop? - A. It might be about three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to ask him what ship he belonged to? - A. He was in a sailor's habit, I thought he was a mate, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q.When Mr. Roebuck returned, did he return you the same note? - A. Yes; out of his hand into mine, in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had it ever since? - A. No; I delivered it to Mr.

               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiry after such a person? - A. Yes, through, the medium of the letter carriers; but could not hear of any body of that name.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to Bristol to enquire after a person of the name B. Phillips? - A. Yes; I examined as many of the parish books as I could get at in the short time I was there, and there was no such name; I enquired at the office of the Town-Clerk, where the rates are returned; I enenquired at some of the inns, and I enquired at the Post-Office, where I saw all the letter-carriers together, but could not hear of any such name; in one of the parish books there appeared to be a person of the name of Betty Phillips, whether her name was Betty or Elizabeth, they could not tell; the best account I could get of her was, that she kept an old clothes shop; I went to the street where she lived, but could not find any such person there; I enquired at two or three other clothes shops, but could not hear of her; I also examined the Directory, but found no such name there.</p>

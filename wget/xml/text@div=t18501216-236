                  </hi>. I am clerk at the Waterworks, Westboorne-grove, in the parish of Paddington, and lived in the house there. On 30th Nov., about one o'clock in the morning, I spoke to the prisoner in the Edgware-road, and we went home to my house together, and staid there all night—we got up next morning, about a quarter to seven, and the prisoner left about seven—shortly after that I missed my watch, with a silk guard attached to it, which had hung in the room we slept in—I saw it there five or six minutes before she left—this(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is it—it is worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had given her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 104). I took the prisoner on 7th Dec., at the Portman Arms—I said, "Your name is Jane Martin?"—she said, "No it is not, it is Lauderdale"—I told her I wanted her, on suspicion of stealing a watch at the West London Waterworks—she said, "If you go home you will find I have been at home three months"—I brought her out of the house, and she then said, "He should have paid me, and I should not have taken the watch"—I told her to be cautious, as I should have to tell the Magistrate what she said—she said she had pledged it at Mr. Boyce's for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and had torn up the ticket—I took her to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> He had no money, and gave me the watch to pledge, and I was to meet him at a quarter to nine, in the Edgware-road and return it him; I went, and waited for him: he never came; when I heard I was going to be taken, I tore up the ticket; he has done this to get the watch back for nothing.</p>

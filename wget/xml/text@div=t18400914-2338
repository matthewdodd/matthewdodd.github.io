                  </hi>. I am foreman to John Bird, a watchmaker, in St. John-street, Clerkenwell. On the 7th or 8th of April I received a letter, purporting to come from the prisoner, in consequence of which I sent a written answer—MR. Bird was at that time out of town—he returned on the 8th of April—on Thursday, the 9th, I went to the prisoner's house, in Spencer-street, Clerkenwell, between ten and eleven o'clock, and took with me half-a-dozen gold watches—he selected two, and said he wanted them for a customer, he would show them to him, and give me an answer in the afternoon—I cannot be positive whether he said the time, but I think he said about two o'clock—he did not return an answer that afternoon—I called that evening, but did not see him—the day alter he called at the counting-house and saw Mr. Bird, and asked permission to keep them till Monday—he said the customer had seen them, but as they were for his wife he wished her to see them, and he was to return them on Monday, at two o'clock—he said they were in the country—on the Monday afternoon I called, and did not see him—he was denied—I called twice, and the third time I called they said he was not at home—I said I would see Mrs. Evered, then the prisoner came, and asked me to walk up stairs—I went up with him, and asked him if he had got the watches—he said no, but he would write by the mail, and send it in a parcel, it being too late to send a letter—on the Tuesday the watches were applied for again—MR. Bird called on him once or twice, but did not see him, but left a message with his wife, and that produced a note—MR. Bird and myself both went on the 15th, but we have never got them back.</p>

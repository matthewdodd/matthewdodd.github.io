                  </hi> I am a seaman—on 24th Nov. I was in Fraser's beer-shop, in the highway, with Kingston and another man—I was a little in liquor—I knew what I was doing—I left the house with the other two men, and the prisoner Coffee—she kept by me all the way to Morgan's, in Elbow-lane—she had her arm round me and dragged me along—somebody walked behind me—when we got to Morgan's, she hauled my cap in—I was obliged to go in for it and she slammed the door—the others did not go in—I went into a room—Coffee and me sat on a bed—I could not get away from her—I did not go to bed with her—a policeman came in in five or ten minutes, and asked me if I had my watch—I put my hand in my pocket, the guard was there, but the watch was gone—it was a silk guard—I cannot say whe<lb></lb>therit was broken or cut—I am sure I had the watch when I left Fraser's, as I looked at it inside the door—it was half-past eight—I never saw it again till I saw it at the pawnbroker's.</p>

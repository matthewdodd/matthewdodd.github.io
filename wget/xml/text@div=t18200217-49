On the 21st of January, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner, I suppose, secreted himself in the workshop till the men were gone, and then forced his way into the dwelling-house by forcing a door open, which goes with a spring latch - it was forced with a screw-driver, there are the marks of it on the door. I know nothing of it, except that the property is mine.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Sadd. At night, when the men left work, I locked up the premises a few minutes after six o'clock; the prisoner was formerly a workman there, but not then - he was discharged about Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door between the shop and the house fast - A. Yes, my Lord; I shut it, and returned to the building between seven and eight o'clock that evening - I had occasion to go to the shop, and saw the counting-house door open, and the rushlight blown out, which I had left alight for Mr. Sadd, who was gone out to dinner. I went to the bottom of the stairs, and called out Master! twice, nobody answered. I went down stairs, got a light, and locked myself and another man in the building; went up stairs, across the workshop, through the counting-house to the street-door, and tried the street-door, which was fast. I had locked it in the afternoon, and given Mr. Sadd the key. On returning to go up stairs again, I discovered the prisoner in the passage, with a bundle, and his shoes in his hand. I asked him what he did there? immediately took hold of him, and said he should not go from me till I took him to a place of justice. I took him to the gates, and sent for Hawlks to assist me in taking him to the Compter. As he went along he threw a key away, a young man picked it up, and gave it to Hawlks; and as we crossed over to Giltspur-street he gave me another key. Hawlks took the bundle. It was between seven and eight o'clock at night - I fastened the doors at six.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you find the bundle on me - A. He stood alongside of it. Part was tied up, and part not tied - it was brought from up stairs into the passage.</p>

            . I am fellow-workman with Bynon - he sent to my lodgings for me. When I got out, I found he had got hold of the prisoner outside the shop-gates in Graystoke-place; he told me to go into the passage, and I should find a bundle; I went and saw it lying in the passage, partly tied up; I brought it out, went with him to Giltspur-street Compter. and delivered it to Brand there. I saw the prisoner lay a screw-driver on the table at the Compter, which I afterwards saw the officer try to the door, it seemed to fit the marks.</p>

            . I am a marshalsman. On the 21st of January, about eight o'clock at night, the prisoner was given into my charge with a bundle, containing the articles stated in the indictment - a screw-driver was given to me as coming from the prisoner. I then searched him, and found two small picklock keys, and a number of duplicates of other property. I then went to the premises, and found the door which goes out of the workshop into the dwelling-house had been forced by an instrument. I applied the screw-driver to the marks on the door-post, it appeared to correspond with them exactly. I went up stairs, and found that another door had been tried by the same instrument, but was not forced. The prisoner had given up two larger keys, which had been taken from some large locks in the counting-house; we tried them, and they fitted the locks in the counting-house. The two pieces of gingham were not in the bundle - I found them by the gate, apparently as if they had been dropped in coming out.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There are things in the bundle which were not there when I was at the Compter. I saw the door open, and went in, knowing the place; I stopped there sometime. The door was shut while I was in there. I went to the hall-door, intending to go out that way - two women, and other people, went in and out while I stopped.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business with my brother at 13, Goldsmith Street—the prisoner was in our employ as traveller and collector—on the 27th March Mr. Jeffs owed us 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not received that—Mr. Lead beater, of Chesham, is also a customer of ours—I have not re<lb></lb>ceived the money for which this receipt was given on the 6th December—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is what the prisoner ought to have entered all moneys received in, and the 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is not entered here—it was his duty to send remittances daily, if it was in the shape of notes or cheques—Mr. Leadbeater is entered in this book as having paid on the 17th March 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that may have been a portion of the 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we had a cus<lb></lb>tomer named Butcher, of High Wycombe, whom I applied to for an account, and he said it was paid—in consequence of that, I communicated with the prisoner—he returned to town, and I then accused him of having received Butcher's account, and asked him if there were any other debts in the same predicament—after being silent for a minute or two he changed colour, and said, "There are." I said, "Who are they?" and directed his attention to Jeffs's, and he said, "Yes, that is one"—I then said, "Henry, you had better make a plain breast of it, and tell me all"—after a little consideration he said, "If you will allow me to look through the ledgers I will"—I said, "You may look through the ledgers in my presence, but shall not remove them out of my sight"—he went through them, and made out this list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of sums not accounted for—it contains the three sums mentioned in the indictment—his duties were to solicit orders and receive accounts, and to remit the same to us every night or so, and at the end of his journey to come to me with a list of the amounts he had received, and to give me the balance after deducting the amount allowed him for expenses.</p>

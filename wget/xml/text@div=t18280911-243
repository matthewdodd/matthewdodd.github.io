On the 8th of July there were two hundred and fifty farthings, six sixpences, and three half-crowns, all in one drawer in a box in my room; I had seen them all right on the Sunday evening; I have seen sixty-two of the farthings since that - the prisoner said,"Don't hang me, and I will give you half a crown;" she says she is very sorry for it; she was recommended to me to nurse some children.</p>

On the Monday night the prisoner came to my master's shop in Somer's-town, and asked me to give her three halfpence for six farthings; I did so - and asked if she had any more; she said Yes, and then she brought one shilling's worth; she then came again, and asked me to give her one shilling for tenpence in halfpence and eight farthings; I did not ask how she came by them, but the next day I heard that Mrs. Dunn had lost them.</p>

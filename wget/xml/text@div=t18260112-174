            . I am a day labourer. On the 20th of December, I met Saunders about a quarter past five o'clock in the morning, in Isleworth town - not a quarter of a mile from Mrs. Flint's house; he was alone, and had something bulky under his arm, but I do not know what; I went on to the end of Mr. Ashby's wharf, and saw Barnham, who had nothing. I then went down the wharf, and found two legs of pork, and two chucks in Mr. Ashby's waggon, which stood in my wharf - I do not know how they came there; Saunders came to me about five o'clock, and asked if I wanted to buy a piece or two of meat; I said I had no money; he then went out of my stable; I afterwards saw him and Barnham pass the stable with some meat in their hands.</p>

            . I am chief constable of Isleworth. I heard of the robbery and went to Pine, to take his evidence, which I laid before the Magistrates, and got a warrant to apprehend Barnham - Saunders had been apprehended for an assault. I do not know what became of the meat - I did not get the information from Pine till three or four days afterwards.</p>

This declaration is the handwriting of James Christey—I know the defendant—he is a Custom-house agent—I believe James Christey is his brother—I cannot say whether he acts as his clerk—I believe they acted in conjunction, but I do not know—it is my duty to make out the blue books, which are for the purpose of en<lb></lb>abling the landing-waiter to examine the goods—I always copy outside the book the name of the ship, the master, and the place from whence the ship comes, and likewise copy inside the book the heading of the sight entry, with the marks of the cases—that is the practice—this heading is made in the usual course, in the writing of Mr. Mitchell, one of the clerks in the office—the book is then always sent back to the landing-waiter, for the examination of the goods—in April, 1842, the importer could take his goods to what quay he pleased, and not only then, but now also—the landing-waiters were stationed at the same quays for about a month—I was not present at the examination of these goods—the landing-waiter examines the goods with the entry in the blue</p>

               <p>book, and either the importer or his agent also attends to make an examina<lb></lb>tion and take an account of the goods—they keep an account against him—when the landing-waiter has made his entry in the blue book, it is returned to the Registrar's office in the evening—it is issued again to the landing-waiter, if he requires it—a perfect entry is the next document required.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Ought the perfect entry to correspond with the value of the goods in the blue book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on the assessment of the landing-waiter on the landing of the goods—the landing-waiter must agree with the merchant before the goods can be delivered out of the custody of the Crown—the per<lb></lb>fect entry ought to agree with assessment—this is the prisoner's sign<lb></lb>ature to the perfect entry—the body of it also appears in his handwriting—I believe it to be so—(<hi rend="italic">looking at three bills</hi>)—these are written so illegibly that I should not like to give my opinion as to the handwriting or the signature.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any practice with respect to the surveyor or any other officers of customs, on the valuation of good by the landing-waiter and importer, as to the payment of any larger sum of money, and taking the goods themselves for the Crown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The landing-waiter and importer must agree before the delivery of the goods—If goods are valued at a less value than the Crown thinks riht, it has the pre<lb></lb>emption, by its officers, of saying, "I will pay so much, and take the goods—in the event of the value not being approved by the landing-surveyor and landing-waiter, they are taken possessions of for the benefit of the Crown, adding 10 percent—this blue book shows the name of H. Jones as the landing-waiter on this occasion—I believe this book is in Jones's handwriting—it was deli<lb></lb>vered to him for his examination—he makes his entry, returns it to the Registrar; and if he demands it again before the goods are delivered, he receives it; if not, it remains with the Registrar, on his certifying the true examination of the goods—it is very common thing for persons importing goods to employ an agent. Who represents himself as the importer for the purpose of working the goods through the Custom-house it is the duty of the landing-surveyor to attend the examination—Mr. M'Vicar was the surveyor on this occasion—the Custom-house agent is not a servant paid by the Cus<lb></lb>toms—the Customs-house has nothing to do with him except his licence—he places an arbitrary value on the goods to be cleared the sufficiency of which is determined upon by the officers of the Crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said just now that the landing-surveyor ought to inspect the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is always presumed to do so—there are three landing-surveyors for the legal, quay department—they have to super<lb></lb>intend sometimes twenty landing-waiters, sometimes thirty, and sometimes forty—at times, when busy on the legal quay, there may be forty examining and landing goods by weight ten at a time be examining—I am not in that department myself, but I know the practice—in the assessment of goods for duty, the landing-surveyors are supposed to know the true value of the goods which they so assign for—I never was there myself—this is Jones's handwriting on the perfect entry, "Correct: H. Jones"—"Value approved: N. M.," are Mr. M'Vicar's initials.</p>

               <p>to the Registrar's office, or to the Queen's warehouse, if to addressed—upon application being made to the registrar, an order would be issued to the tide-waiter on board the vessel for the delivery of the packages—when landed, they would be put in charge of the officer at the quay or wharf, wherever it might be—the registrar's clerk makes out what is called a blue book, which has on the cover the name of the vessel, the captain, and the port; also, the date of the report, underneath the seal, where the landing surveyor signs his name, or close to it—the clerk in the registrar's office enters the particulars contained in the bill of sight in the blue book, and the name of the person who takes out the bill of sight, the marks and numbers of the packages, the date, and all the particulars—the blue book is then delivered to the landing-waiter for the examination of the goods—the examination is made by the landing-waiter and the importer, or his agent—they generally take an account at the same time as the landing-waiter, and thereupon proceed to the Long-room and perfect the entry, and either put a duty on the goods, or enter them to be warehoused—the goods are not always examined by the landing-surveyor—occasionally the landing-surveyor re-examines and ap<lb></lb>proves of the value of such goods as are subject to <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> duties—the value is sometimes ascertained by samples produced; and if not satisfied, the landing-surveyor's duty would be to proceed further—it is the practice that a value should be ascertained for such goods as pay <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> duties—clocks are goods of that description—the importer in the first instance, upon examining the goods, takes out a bill of sight, that he may ascertain what that real value is—he then enters the goods accordingly, and it would then be for the landing-surveyor, conjointly with the landing-waiter, to ascertain that that value is correct—there is sometimes a communication between the landing waiter and the importer at the time the goods are examined, and particularly with regard to clocks—there is generally a stated value of-4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for wooden clocks—it is not usual to enter any value in the blue book when a bill is taken out—the value is on the warrant, or perfect entry.</p>

                  </hi>. In April, 1842, I was a landing-surveyor, I am now re<lb></lb>tired—I see my initials on this perfect entry, sanctioning the value—clocks are admitted at a value as distinguished from a rated value—it is the duty of the landing-surveyor to examine those goods as far as his time renders prac<lb></lb>ticable—it is not his practice to empty all the cases and count all the articles—the value of clocks is a kind of compact value, generally 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a clock, and seeing they were Dutch clocks was quite sufficient—it is not the duty of the landing-surveyor to ascertain the number, but of the landing-waiter—he keeps a memorandum of the number, and I take it on his account—the value sometimes deviates, but it is generally 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for this description of goods.</p>

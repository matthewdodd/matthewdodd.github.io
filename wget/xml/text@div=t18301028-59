            . I am a Policeman. The prosecutrix applied to me, and said she had been robbed - we went to the prisoner's sister, and found where she lived; we went and found her at No. 6, Charterhouse-square - Mrs. Church said to her, "I have lost some things out of my lodging, and I suspect you have some of them;" she said No, and made quite a laugh of it - she said, "I should like to look into your box;" she said she should not let her without a Police-officer - I said I was one; we then found these things in her box, which the prosecutrix claimed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Are you single? A. I am a widow - I have not lent this umbrella to the prisoner; I lent her one at various times - I have given her permission to use what was proper and necessary for her; I left town in September, and returned three weeks last Monday - she was at liberty to use any thing but wearing-apparel; these things might by chance have been put in among hers.</p>

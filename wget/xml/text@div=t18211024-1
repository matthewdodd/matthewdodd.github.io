On a Thursday, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in the cellar when I came down - he came up to the ground floor, and then went up stairs, he had a little bundle under his arm, tied up in a handkerchief; I never saw him before. I said nothing to him, but went and told my mother that he was about the house all the morning, she was in the shop, which is over the way. My father was in the cellar, with Hall, getting up potatoes, he was not in the cellar when I saw the prisoner there, but when I went and called my mother. I came back to the house, went up stairs, and saw the prisoner in the front bed-room, on the first-floor, with the door a little open, I ran down and called Stop thief! he ran down after me. Hall ran up stairs, from the cellar, and caught him as he came down stairs, he was taken to the watch-house, by an officer, who was sent for. Scott searched him. He had gone out, and come in again, in the course of the morning.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Tedd. I saw the prisoner in the cellar, between ten and eleven o'clock, when I went down with my master, he said, "Good morning," to my master, and went up stairs. My master asked me who he was - I did not know him; about five or ten minutes after I heard Edward call out, I ran up and stopped the prisoner. I saw no bundle.

            . I am an officer. I went and took charge of him, at Tedd's, and took him to the watch-house. I searched him there, he said it was his first offence, and he hoped I would not collar him, and he would walk quietly with me, which he did. In his right hand breeches pocket, I found a bag with a half-sovereign, 15 s., and a small book, in it. I found a small medal on him, and in his coat pocket, I found a razor, two knives and two keys; he had a chisel in his hand. I took the chisel to the house, and applied it to the front bed-room door, there were marks on the door and door-post which it fitted, the lock was much shattered - the bolt appeared to have been forced back by the chisel; there were marks on a drawer in a chest in the room, which the chisel fitted. I did not examine the lock. A piece was broken out of the drawer.</p>

I can swear to the bag, bible, and medal, and the money is the right quantity - I put the half-sovereign in the bag that morning; there was also 15 s. there; the little bible and medal were in another bag, which I had seen in the drawer that morning.</p>

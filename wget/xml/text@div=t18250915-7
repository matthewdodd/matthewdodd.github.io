On the evening of the 4th of July I went to bed a little after ten o'clock - the watchman alarmed me a little before four; the prisoner was then in custody. I found the drawing-room window open, and the street door also. I missed this clock off the bracket on the stair-case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Do you let all the house out, or only part of it? A. In the height of the season I let it all out. I have another house elsewhere, in which my family reside. I had slept there for six weeks.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 13th of July, at a quarter past three o'clock in the morning, I was at the end of Portman-street and Portman-square - it was quite light. I observed two men coming out of Bryanstone-street; the prisoner was one of them, and had the clock in his hands; I let them pass, and perceived them hasten their pace - I followed, and came up to the other man, who called out, "Jack." The prisoner, who was forward carrying the clock, came back - I asked where they were going with that property; they said to the White Horse cellar, Piccadilly; I said I considered the property stolen, and they must go to the watch-house - the other man said he would not, and that he would fetch his master - he had some things, which he threw down, and walked away. I directly seized the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house. He said he met a man in Oxford-road, who asked him to carry the clock. When I had discovered where the robbery happened I asked how he could say he got it in Oxford-road - he denied saying so, and said something about the neighbouring streets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say Edgware-road? A. No, he did not mention the name of any street - the other man was about eight yards behind him - he set the clock down - I waited a quarter of an hour for the other man to come back.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Bryanstone-street - Atkins was in Portman-street; I heard a door palled to very loud in Bryanstone-street - it was near Mr. Lomax's, but I am not certain that it was his - I saw two men go shortly round the corner from that place, and turn to the left up Portman-street. I did not observe whether they had any thing, and cannot say whether the prisoner was one of them. I came to the bottom of the street, and a watchman made some inquiries - I gave him information, and found the prosecutor's drawing-room window over the street door, open - I think he could not have entered without a ladder.</p>
               <p>MR. LONAX. When I got up I found the parlour shutters fastened - I think they must have entered at the area gate in the evening and concealed themselves in the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in company with some young people till two o'clock in the morning, and on going home found the house closed; about three I met a man like a gentleman's servant in Bryanstone-street, carrying two umbrellas, a carpet bag, and other things - he asked me to carry the clock, saying he was going to meet his master at the White-horse-cellar.</p>

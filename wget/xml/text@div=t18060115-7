               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come to your service? - A. On the 31st day of July, 1804, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. In what situation was he employed by you? A. As a <rs id="t18060115-7-deflabel39" type="occupation">journeyman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18060115-7-defend126 t18060115-7-deflabel39"></join>.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any authority from you at any time during the time that he staid with you to sell any of your goods? - A. Never, not even my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you loose these articles in the indictment? - A. I did, with others; these articles are, the cobler and his wife, and the Egyptian mummy; I missed them about eleven months ago, when the prisoner was in my service; he left my service about the beginning of last November, I found the figures in Mr. Lee's house in Sloane-street; on the 3d of January, I found them by accident, the servant brought them down to me in mistake for something else; when I saw the cobler I knew it to be mine, I turned it up, I said is there not a fellow to it, the fellow to it was brought part of the way down stairs, I went into the dining-room, and there I saw the mummy in the corner of the room, standing up with a bust of Homer upon it. I looked to the mark and knew it to be mine; Mr. Lee was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before your servant went away, sold either of these in your shop, the cobler and his wife or the mummy? - A. Never to Mr. Lee or any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see Mr. Lee? - A. I did not see Mr. Lee till I got the warrant; on the same day the prisoner surrendered before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe to Mr. Lee the marks? A. I did before I took them out of the house; the mark is two crosses, I put the mark at the bottom of each about eleven months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this your own dwelling-house that you live in? - A. No, it is my own property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150008"></xptr>Q. You are in partnership with your father I understand? - A. Yes, but this is a business that I took up on my own account entirely, about a year and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this man your servant? - A. Yes, he came from Mr. Blore, I think he told me that Mr. Blore gave him twenty-eight shillings a week, I agreed to give him thirty; I agreed to give him task work, as he said he was rather low.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing due to him for wages? A. No, nor any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. He is your debtor? - A. I think he is, I have got an account of every farthing that I paid him, he generally over drew, he went away without paying me, in fact I told him I was disatisfied with his conduct; I suppose he owes me twenty pounds at least.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever make a demand of more than that of you; did he ever employ an attorney? - A. He did, for the sum of 196 l. 12 s. 6 d. after he had left my service.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make a public charge against him previous to his leaving you? - A. No, I depended too much upon the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had Mr. Lee dealt with you at any time for figures? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When was the demand made by the attorney for the prisoner? - A. About three weeks before this, after he had left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discharge him or he leave your service voluntarily? - A. I told him that I had missed a great quantity of figures, and then he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he made this demand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say that you had lost these things, and that you should prosecute for it? - A. Never.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. We understand you live in Sloane-street. These things that are now produced were found in your house? - A. Yes, I purchased them of Mazzoni. I purchased the cobler and his wife about nine months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Mazzoni before? - A. I knew him at Mr. Blore's, I had bought these things, he makes these sort of things. About nine months ago, as I was going home, I met Mazzoni, I mentioned to him that I had got a bust that I wanted bronzed, he made a reply, I have left Mr. Blore, but I will do it for you as well as any body; he did it and brought it home, I paid him for it, I asked him what I should give him for the two figures, describing them to him, I do not recollect what he asked me, I told him I would give him a guinea, he made a demur at the price, I said you may let it alone; I saw him at Mr. Hamilton's shop about three weeks before they were brought home, there was a large figure there, I went in and saw Mazzoni, I asked him about the figures.</p>
               <p>Q. What figures? - A. The cobler and his wife; he had agreed to my proposal, he brought them home in about three weeks after I saw him at Mr. Hamilton's shop, and I paid him, I think it was a guinea or twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Hamilton go with you to the the figures? - A. No. Mazzoni told me as soon as it was dry to take the bronze he would bring it me home.</p>
               <p>Court. Could Hamilton at the part of the shop that he was at hear that? - A. I cannot say, the shop is large, this was at the bottom of the shop, and Mr. Hamilton never moved.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the large mummy? - A. I had purchased a bust of Homer at a sale in Bond-street; I saw Mazzoni at the top of Sloane-street, I told him that I wanted a stand, describing the stand, I asked him what he would charge for it, he asked me twenty-nine or thirty shillings, I told him I would give a guinea; I called three or four different times at Mr. Hamilton's shop about it, and the servant called Mazzoni down; and once when I called on Mazzoni, Mr. Hamilton was in the shop, I walked down the shop with him and he shewed me the stand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation either about the cobler and his wife or the mummy with Mr. Hamilton? - A. No. I had been in the habit of employing his father near seventeen years to some considerable amount; I called at his father's yard one time about some business, Mr. Hamilton behaved extremely rude; I was always shy with Young Hamilton after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. The cobler and his wife was made for you by Mazzoni by an order which you gave? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards gave him an order for that mummy, which was made and brought home to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. While the mummy was making you went to the shop as you had done several times before; did Mr. Hamilton see you? - A. He must, Mazzoni was then in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you converse together in whispers? - A. By no means.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw this figure, and Mazzoni<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150009"></xptr>was telling you that it was not fit for bronzing, and when it was dry enough he told you he would bring it home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing in Mazzoni's conduct that appeared he was telling any thing secret without the knowledge of his master? - A. Certainly not; I considered him the principal in these things; I did not know that Hamilton was in that branch of business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon Hamilton as his master? - A. I did not; I looked upon it that he did it upon his own account.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Mazzoni was there Hamilton did not do any such things? - A. No, the shop was fitted out as a mason's with marble chimney pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Hamilton after the prisoner had been examined at Marlborough-street? - A. I asked him what could be his motive in taking these steps; he made a reply that he brought him in a bill above an hundred pounds; what could he do?</p>
               <p>Court. What employment did you suppose the prisoner at the bar had under Hamilton? - A. I looked upon him as making these figures for Mr. Hamilton, or any other person that should engage him.</p>
               <p>Q. Not as a servant? - A. I never looked upon him as a servant to Mr. Hamilton.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My first connection with Mr. Hamilton was through his coming to Mr. Blore; he told me repeatedly if I would leave him he would take me in partnership; I told him I would not leave Mr. Blore to work as journeyman at another place, but if I could be in partnership I would leave Mr. Blore; under that colour he took me. I knew Mr. Lee previous to my going to Mr. Hamilton, I had done some things for him; Mr. Lee met me one day in Sloane-street, he asked me to bronze a head for him; I told him then I did not live with Mr. Blore, I lived with Mr. Hamilton, but I could do it all the same; I went and fetched the head and bronzed it; in a little while after Mr. Lee said he should like a pair of figures, the cobler and his wife, I said I could make them; he said, have you got the moulds, I said Mr. Hamilton bought the moulds of Mr. Blore; I told Mr. Hamilton, and Mr. Hamilton told me to deal with him, for says he, he does not deal with me; I executed the work for him, in a little while after Mr. Lee ordered the mummy, for which I received the money, and Mr. Hamilton desired me to keep it; Mr. Hamilton gave me leave to make any cast that I wanted, for my own use, or what not.</p>
               <p>Court. (to prosecutor) Do you remember Mr. Lee coming to your shop when Mazzoni was there? - A. I cannot remember it; I have seen Mr. Lee stand and look at a large figure that I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection of his coming in the shop and going down the shop along with Mazzoni? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you do not recollect any conversation in the shop between them? - A. No, that I am certain of.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I was waiting for Mr. King to come round again; I had bid eleven-pence a pound for the pig; it was a dead pig, and while I was waiting I saw the prisoner come round, and take the pig off the hook, and put it on the boy's shoulder, then he crossed over to where I stood, at the hamper of meat that was unpacked, which was laying in the door way; the boy came on the right hand side of me, and the prisoner crossed over to the left; I saw him look after the boy, I thought he was going to call him back; it is customary to weigh them before they take them away; I found he did not call the boy back; I went and informed Mr. King that the boy had taken the pig away without weighing. I went after the prisoner; I asked him where the pig was that he had taken off the hook; he said, he had seen none. I said, I was certain he was the man that had taken the pig off the hook; you are a liar, said he, I have not been in Mr. King's door-way to day; I said, I was positive it was him. Mr. King came up, and gave charge of him; he was taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Mr. King. The prisoner never asked me the price of the pig; I had no conversation with him about the pig.</p>

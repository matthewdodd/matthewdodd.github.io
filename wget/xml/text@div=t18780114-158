                  </hi>. I keep the Black Horse, at 48, Ropemakers' Fields, Limehouse—on Sunday, 23rd December, I was disturbed by the dog making a noise about 3 in the morning—I looked about but saw nothing—about 6 the dog came up and alarmed me again, and I went down and found a back window, which opened into the public parlour, thrown up and the shutters open—I returned upstairs and slipped on my trousers and went down again, and as I was lighting the gas my wife saw</p>

               <p>the prisoner crouched behind the bar—I detained him—he did not appear to have been drinking to any excess; he might have taken a drop—I sent for a constable and gave him in charge—the window I found open I had fastened when I went to bed, and the house was quite secure—I found some cigars and tobacco moved from one side of the bar to the other, close to where I found the prisoner—I also found some lead gone from the back part of the premises.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K R</hi> 35). I was called to the Black Horse and found the prisoner there—he was given into my custody—I told him the charge—he said "All right"—he afterwards said he did not know how he got there—he appeared as if he had been drinking, but he knew what he was about—the back parlour window had been prised open by a crow<lb></lb>bar like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which I found against the window—it belongs to the landlord, and was usually kept in the yard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was at a "lead" in the house that night between 10 and 11—I had a drop to drink, and do not know whether I stopped in the house or not—as to the lead or cigars I know nothing about it.</p>

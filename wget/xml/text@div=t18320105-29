            . I am an officer of the Mansion-house. I went to the prisoner's lodging on the 12th of December; he came there with a cart, loaded with sacks, from the prosecutors' - I went up to his room, and under his bedstead found this tarpanling, which Mr. Orchard claims -I only found one there; the prisoner was not quite sober, but not insensible - I asked how he became possessed of it - he said he had received it from Messrs. Deacon and Orchard to put another breadth on it - Mr. Orchard afterwards saw and claimed it.</p>

            . I am a City-officer. I was present when Roe found the tarpauling - the prisoner had been drinking, but was certainly in his senses; we asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050033"></xptr>where he got it - he said Messrs. Deacon and Orchard gave it him to put another breadth on.</p>
               <p>MR. ORCHARD. This is our property - I never gave him orders to alter it; if it wanted altering it would be given to people in our house; we keep hands there on purpose - it is not the business of a sack-maker to do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it an entire tarpauling? A. Yes, except the lines - we sometimes send them out without lines; I can swear to the canvas, because it is made expressly for us - I cannot say our foreman did not send it out, but if he had he would have done wrong; it is the regular size, and does not want an additional breadth; it is finished, and if a larger one was wanted we should make one and not alter this.</p>

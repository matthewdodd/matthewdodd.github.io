(The boards produced in court.) They have been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>Mr. Remnant. These are the boards that were shewn to me next morning; I compared them with others I had in the lost, and they corresponded.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A man, in Mr. Remnant's yard, asked me to stop and help him out with them; the place is twenty feet high; it is impossible I should get them out without assistance; he desired I would take them to a public house at the corner; Kelly passed me, and said, what have you got here? I made no answer, knowing myself to be innocent; he asked if they were mahogany; I said, I believe they are: what is your name? I told him my name and where I lived, and then he took me to the watch-house; I made no resistance; and at the time he stopped me he was at the distance of a yard from me; and when he took me to the watch-house, I begged he would let my wife know, and gave him the same direction that I had given before, to let her know, not to be uneasy at my staying out all night, which he did; I have a wife and three children, and I don't know that she has another hour to go.</p>
               <p>Kelly. You told me you had a wife and three children, and begged I would let you go; I told him it would not answer the ends of justice, and I would not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Kelly. Q. Did I make any resistance? - A. No.</p>

            Had I not the boards upon me, and then called for a light; and while you was getting the light, when you had no hold of me, I made no resistance, knowing myself to be innocent? - A. I did not say you did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Remnant knows that it is impossible for me to have got them out without their being given to me.</p>
               <p>One of the jury. I know this wall, and I think it totally impossible for any man to get a plank out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Remnant. I am persuaded it was given out by somebody; it is a part of a system that has been carried on for a considerable time, and has been committed in the open day; the wall, I suppose, is fourteen or fifteen feet high, that is the utmost; they must have been given out by somebody on the premisses.</p>
               <p>Jury to Kelly. Q. Did you go round to the timber yard to know if there was any body in the premisses? - A. I sent, and the porter was suspected, who absconded the next morning.</p>
               <p>Jury to Remnant. Q. Did the porter go without his wages? - A. Yes, but he sent for them next day.</p>

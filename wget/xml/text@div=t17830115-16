               <p>Is that below the warehouse, or above? It is above.</p>
               <p>Is the hall on the same side on the warehouse? - The hall is joining to the warehouse, sand I was in the hall myself.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. Are they not all Germans in your masters house, but the prisoner at the bar? - All but the prisoner, and one more.</p>
               <p>Had not you a quarrel with the prisoner as well as Sherman? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Can you explain the situation of the warehouses yourself? - They are two different buildings, under distinct roofs; the sugar house, where the goods are deposited, is a compleat building of itself; the lump room is up one pair of stairs, the mill warehouse, is a building that adjoins; underneath the mill warehouse, there is a cellar where the mens necessary is: there was a lump of fine sugar in the bag, weighing about 25 lb. it was our sugar: I questioned the prisoner about it, and he denied knowing any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Court. You would have done better after you had this hint, if you had waited to see whether the man carried this lump away.</p>

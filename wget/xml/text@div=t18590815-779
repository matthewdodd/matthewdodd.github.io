I carry on business in Newgate-street, as a manufac<lb></lb>turer of food for cattle—the prisoner called on me on 3d January; he was a stranger to me—he stated that he came from the Royal Agricultural Society; that they were going to present Mr. Alderman Mechi with a testimonial in the shape of a piece of plate, and he asked for my subscrip<lb></lb>tion—believing that statement to be correct I ordered my clerk, Mr. Higgate, to pay him a guinea—he produced to me a bundle of parchment, and asked me to sign my name there, and I did so—he told me it would be advertised in the course of a few days—I see every newspaper in England, but I never saw it advertised.</p>

I am in the employ of Mr. Thorley; I remember the defendant calling in the early part of this year—he asked if Mr. Thorley was at home; I said he was not yet come to business; I asked him if he would call again, and I asked the nature of his business; he said "I am come from the Royal Agricultural Society of England with a view to obtain a subscrip<lb></lb>tion for a piece of plate, which the members of the Royal Agricultural So<lb></lb>ciety are about to present to Mr. Alderman Mechi for the very valuable services which that gentleman has rendered to the agricultural community at large"—I asked him if he would call again; he said he would, and he did the same day—he saw Mr. Thorley—I saw the parties in the office, but I was attending to my own business—I could not hear what they said—Mr. Thorley desired mo to hand him a guinea, which I did—I put a sovereign and a shilling on the counter—I could not swear that the defendant took it up—I never saw it again—I did not take it up—Mr. Thorley did not—it disappeared, and to the best of my belief the prisoner took it.</p>

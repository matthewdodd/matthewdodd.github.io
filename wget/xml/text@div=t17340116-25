I cry'd out. He knock'd me down (I believe it was with his Fist) cut my Hand in three places, and tore off my Mob (and some of my Hair with it), and leaving me on the Ground, ran away. I got up frighted and went to my Husband, and told him how I had been served by a lusty Man in a Dray-man's Apron; for I saw him plainly, by the Light in a Chandler's almost opposite to me, and a Lamp that was hard by. My Husband and some of the Company with him, pursued the Prisoner, and brought him back to the Coach and Horses, and I saw my Mob then in his Bosom, next to his Shirt, a Neighbour took it out, and here it is.

She said don't be frighted but I am almost kill'd by a Rogue that has pull'd my Cap off. - I call'd Mr. Baker, and he and others ran out and brought the Prisoner back.

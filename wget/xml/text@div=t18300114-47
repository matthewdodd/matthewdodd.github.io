            . I am a hatter. I lost a hat, cap, and a hat-brush on the 6th of January; the prisoner was in my employ, at my shop in <placeName id="t18300114-47-crimeloc268">Chiswell-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear that he has not bought that hat? A. Yes; he did buy a hat of me, but that was stamped at the bottom - the one he bought was not found; I have stopped part of his wages in consequence of his losing with me when tossing up; he has not lost to the amount of 10s. a week, but perhaps 1s. -I have tossed with him for beer and gin and water; I have not thrown gin over him when he would not drink it.</p>

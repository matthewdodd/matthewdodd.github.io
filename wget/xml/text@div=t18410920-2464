On the 16th of September, in the evening, I saw the prisoner, with a book in his band, outside the shop of Mr. William Pedder, a bookseller, opposite us—he read it for a few minutes, then took it away—I ran over and told Sanglier, and ran after the prisoner—he was stopped in Newcastle street—when I called "Stop thief," he put the book down at a public-house door in Holy well-street—I am quite sure he is the person—he went to the prosecutor's window three times—he came to my stall the second time, then went and took this book.</p>

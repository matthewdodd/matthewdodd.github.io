                  </hi>. I live at Hayes. On the evening of the 4th of March, between seven and eight o'clock, I heard a ring at my gate—it was not long after I had lighted my candle—I had no watch—it was quite dusk—I opened the door, and went out to the garden door in front of my house, and asked who it was—it is a close gate, so. that I could not see who was outside—the answer was, "A parcel"—I" said, "Where from?"—the answer was, "From the Angel inn"—there is an inn of that name at Hayes—I said, "By what coach?"—the answer was, "I don't know"—I said, "What, carry a parcel from the Angel, and</p>

               <p>not know the name of the coach?"—they at last gave me the name of Tollett's coach—I have heard there is such a coach there—I said "Very well, I will fetch a candle; and if I know the writing I will take the parcel but not else"—I got a light, and opened the gate, and saw Duffin—I just got a sight of him, and knew his voice—Taylor was with him-Duffin put his hand over my mouth, and said, "Your money"—I said, "For God's sake don't hurt me, I have shown you so much lenity; I will give you what I have"—Duffin said, "Now, let us have it"—one of them came near my pocket, and I said, "Don't touch me; upon my soul you shall have it"—Duffin put his hand on my face again, and scratched it, saying, "In your soul"—I said to myself, "God forbid"—Taylor then came towards my pocket, and I said to him, "Dare you touch me?" and put up my hand—I said, "I will give you my word and honour you • hall have it"—Taylor said, "Now, let us have it"—I said I had half a sovereign which I would not part with if I wanted bread, but as I had promised it them they should have it—it had been given to me by a very dear friend—Duffin said, "That is what we want"—Taylor had knocked the candle out of my hand directly I opened the gate—I did not know his name then, but I knew him by sight—I took my purse out of my pocket—I do not know exactly what was in it—I thought there was 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at first, but there was less—there was half a sovereign, two half-crowns, one shill<lb></lb>ing, and a sixpence—I gave that to Taylor—Duffin held me close, and if it had not been for a tree behind me I should have been thrown down—Duffin held his hand over my mouth, and said, "Don't halloo"—the money was in the purse I gave to them—I was not alarmed in the least, which is most surprising; I am very thankful to my Maker for the pre<lb></lb>servation of my life—I gave up the purse, as I considered my life was in danger.</p>

               <p>—I did not tell Fair I could not swear to them, but I told it to the other—he asked me not in a respectful way, but I forgive him—I will be respected—I said "Whoever comes before me I will be respected"—I told him I could not swear to them—I never would do so, only in a court of justice—I meant that I would not do it before a patrol—I said, "I cannot swear to them, how could I see them in the dark?"—I told the magistrate that I knew them by their voices—no, I did not—yes I did, before the magistrate—I was very ill, and sat up all night—but I did say it—I have often seen Duffin before, to my sorrow—I never could walk in my garden without great stones being thrown at me, particularly on a Sunday—I have heard Duffin speak before, or I could not know his voice—I have heard him speak when he came along with the gang—there is a gang in the neigh bourhood—I call them such when they behave in that manner—there are tome left yet—Taylor turned round to me that morning with great hard<lb></lb>oesi of heart, and said, "You never saw me before"—I turned round significantly and said, "I do not know that, "meaning that I had—I had seen him often before, along with the gang—I am told he lives at Ux<lb></lb>bridge—I thought at first there was 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the purse; but I gave Sophia, my little girl, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get what was necessary, and she brought me back 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a half-crown.</p>

On the evening of the first of March last, 1 was at the Carpenter's Arms beer shop at Hayes, near the prosecutrix's house, and about half-past five o'clock I saw both the prisoners there—a person named George Rolfe asked me to drink—I told him I did not want any, as the old lady had just given me a glass of brandy—on my saying that, Taylor said, "That would be a good place for a fellow to go up some night, to get a good lot of money "(meaning the prosecutrix's)—I said, "No, you are quite deceived there, for she is a lady who keeps no money by her, nor any property"—soon after that I went home—when I went out I asked what o'clock it was, and was told it was half-past five—I left the prisoners at the beer shop—I went to bed at nine o'clock—I was called up at half-past nine o'clock, and received information which induced me to look after the prisoners—I went to Uxbridge with Lander the horse-patrol, and found them in bed together about half past one o'clock in the morning—it is about two miles from Hayes—I searched Duffin's trowsers, but found nothing in them—Duffin caught up a hat which was under the bed and doubled it up close to him—Lander insisted on seeing what he had got in it, and a half-crown and sixpence were found in it.</p>

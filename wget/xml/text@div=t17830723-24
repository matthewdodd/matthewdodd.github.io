               <p>I was collector at the turnpike gate, at the time this affair happened, I saw the prisoner hit Cooper with the whip; he refused to pay his toll, I stopped his horse, and told him that he should pay his toll, he was going to strike me over the head with the whip, it was a hunting whip, he did not strike me; on hearing this contest between the prisoner and me, Cooper came out, and took the whip out of his hands, and threw it into the toll-house; then he dismounted his horse, I tried to stop him from going in, I hit him twice in the face, he pushed me, and I fetched blood of him.</p>
               <p>Was it the prisoner, or yourself that struck first? - I believe it was myself; I saw no more till after the whip was delivered; on the delivery of the whip, the deceased was turning from him to go to the house, and he hit him over the head with it, as he was going in at the doorway, I did not see or hear what passed between them to occasion this; the blow was on the top of the head, I saw only one blow; the deceased reeled against the door way, and said for God's sake, stop him, for I do not know whether I am not a dead man or no; I never saw them together after that time; I did not hear them speak together; the prisoner was stopped, Mr. Flowers, a surgeon, was sent for to dress the wound of the deceased, he came and saw him in the toll house, I believe he bled a little in the face.</p>

               <p>Some blows passed, you struck him, but he did not strike you? - I do not recollect that he did, Cooper took his whip from him.</p>
               <p>Do you remember his breaking his whip? - No, I never saw it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Before he seized the whip, had this man struck Cooper? - No.</p>
               <p>Then afterwards the whip was returned, and one blow was given? - Yes, he was taken before the Justice and discharged.</p>

               <p>I saw the prisoner strike Cooper, I have a lodging opposite the gate, I was up stairs and I heard a noise at the gate, I went down to see what was the matter, I saw the prisoner, his face was bloody; I said to him, you had better go about your business, you must pay the toll; he said they have a shilling of my money, I said then you must have your change; Cooper said here is his change, he brought out the change, and when he brought it out Cooper gave him a knock in the face; says I, why do you do that; says he, he struck me before; his whip was within doors, the prisoner said he would not have it; he gave it to him, he took it into his hand, as Cooper was going in doors again.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure you recollect this circumstance of the deceased being turned round when the blow was given? - I am very clear of it, it was directed to the side of his head, and he leaned against the door-post, he did not tumble down, I seized the prisoner and took him in doors; between the giving of the change, and the time of the blow on the head, I believe might be a minute and a half.</p>
               <p>Was any thing else done then going into the house? - No, he gave him the change, then he went back to fetch the whip, and gave it him, and he struck him over the head; he did not take the whip directly.</p>

               <p>On the 5th of June, in the afternoon, I was called to see the deceased, and I found he had received a wound on the left side of the head, about two inches in length,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230053"></xptr> which had not penetrated the scull; after having cleared it as was necessary, I perceived no symptom at that time that indicated any danger, but being taught that all wounds on the head are dangerous, and having from experience seen they are so; I was very particular as to my enquiries of his state of health, and I could not discover he had any of those symptoms which could indicate that any injury was done whatever, he had no sickness or giddiness, he never was stunned; I dressed his wound, and was in hopes every thing would go on well; but I think it was on the twelfth or thirteenth from the accident, that he complained of a stiffness in the joint of his jaw, he said, he believed it might proceed from a cold; the next day the stiffness increased, and his jaw was locked, and he had other symptoms of a locked jaw; he lived till the 16th: In order that there might be no possibility of being mistaken, I opened a portion of the scalp, in order to examine the bone, and there was no injury whatever, therefore we continued to treat him in the usual way that we do locked jaws, but he expired on the sixteenth: On the seventeeth, I opened the head, and there was no injury apparent.</p>
               <p>What occasioned his death? - I suppose he died of the locked jaw, which locked jaw I conceive might have proceeded from the wound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Might it have proceeded from any other cause?</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any other apparent cause? - He was perfectly well in health.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Was he a hard drinking man? - I enquired, but they said not, he was very tractable.</p>

               <p>I am a magistrate, the deceased was before me after the assault, it apeared to me to be a quarrel between the people, and from the relation of Cooper, I found that the turnpike people were the agressors, Cooper struck him first, and I believe gave him one black eye, I do not recollect whether he struck him more than once.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the crime of murder is killing another with malice prepense; it is either express or implied; implied is often a question in law, and arises from the instrument, or the manner in which it is used; in general cases, where a person is killed by violent means, the author of these violent means, is at first sight deemed guilty of murder, and it lays on him to prove the circumstances attending the case, to extenuate the degree of guilt, and reduce it to a lesser offence; now if a man has been insulted himself, and receives any personal injury, and there is any reason to believe that the blow which was given, proceeded from sudden heat and violence, that reduces the crime from what the law calls murder, to the crime of manslaughter only; now from the evidence, it seems to be perfectly clear, that the unfortunate deceased got his death from the blow of the prisoner, for although a locked jaw was the immediate cause, yet that proceeded, as the surgeon says, from the wound; the next question therefore is, whether this blow was given in a sudden heat by the deceased, and on some personal injury he had received from him; as to that, there seems to be no contradiction at all in any part of the evidence, Perier tells you &amp;c. (here the learned Judge summed up the evidence on both sides, and then added) from the evidence on the prosecution it is clear, that the prisoner had been assaulted, not only by Perier, but by the deceased; the prisoner might be wrong, in making any difficulty in paying the toll, and perhaps they might be justified in taking something to pay the toll, but Perier gave the prisoner two violent blows, and at last the deceased gave him a blow, without any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230054"></xptr> cause or provocation whatever; the blow which the prisoner gave the deceased, was not given with such violence as to create any fracture on the scull, and the surgeon saw no circumstances of danger at all.</p>

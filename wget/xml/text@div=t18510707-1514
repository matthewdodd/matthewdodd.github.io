                  </hi>. The prisoner is my husband. I have been married to him four years, and have been separated three years—at the end of June I was living in Queen—street, Poplar—the prisoner came to my room, where I was with my sister and a little girl—after some conversation, I desired him several times to leave, and he would not; and I took the poker, and hit him with it twice on the crown of the hat—I struck him a third time, and his hat fell off, and I put it outside the window—I caught hold of him to get him out, and he caught hold of me, and laid roe on the end of my bed—I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and saw him change countenance—I managed to get up, and was going out of the room—I turned, and saw a knife in his hand—I called out to my sister, and she caught hold of him behind by both the shoulders, and held him—I just came before him to see what sort of a knife it was; he used some beastly language to me, made a dart to me, and hit me—I put my apron up to the wound, and ran down<lb></lb>stairs, and the blood came about the place as I went along—I have been under the doctor since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the last witness's sister. I was in this room with a little girl when the prisoner came—the man Grace Lamb now lives with, was there also—the prisoner told him to go, and he went—after some conversa<lb></lb>tion, Lamb told the prisoner to go away quietly; he would not go and she took the poker, and struck him twice; and the third time she struck him, his hat flew off; she put it out at the window, and told him to follow it, she did not want him, she could live by herself—after that she called out to me that he had a knife, and I went and took hold of his arms; my sister stooped to take the knife out of his hand; he made two darts at her with the knife, and at the second dart he cut her under the right—ear—a great deal of blood flowed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Montague—place, Poplar. I went to see the prosecutrix, and found her bleeding profusely from a wound immediately below the right-ear, extending along the margin of the jaw,</p>

               <p>two inches and a half in length, and penetrating to the bone—from the end of that wound, there was another down the neck, between the skin and muscles of the neck, four inches in depth—they were very dangerous—she was ten days under my care, and had a most miraculous escape—they must have been done by a table—knife or some instrument of that kind—a razor could not have caused them.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in a written defence, stated that his wife, who had been in London two years, sent for him from Ireland; he came, and found her living with another man, who died, and she then went to live with Tobin; on this day she used the expressions to him before mentioned, and in the struggle he saw her take a knife from the shelf and she made a stab at him; that he got it from her, and gave her a cut with it more than he expected</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and am the landlady of this house. On this day I heard a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in the house, and saw Tobin go out at the street—door—I went to the room, and found the prosecutrix with a poker, hitting the prisoner—I took the poker out of her hand, and she took up an old knife from the sideboard; I took it from her, and was in the room twenty minutes, and I left on account of the bad language used by the prosecutrix; after that the hat was thrown out of the window—I ran down, and saw the prosecutrix, who said, "I am done for;" and I saw the prisoner struggling with the prosecutrix's sister—he then ran out.</p>

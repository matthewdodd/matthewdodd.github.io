               <p>when he left I opened the parcel and found it contained vermin destroyer—I went to the door and saw him cross to the right, and the same old man crossed over from the left—they spoke together, and then the prisoner came back to my shop for the parcel—I gave it to him and he left—I followed him and brought him back—I told him I had been swindled—he said that he had had enough trouble to get 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had been swindled by the old man coming and giving me an order for the vermin powder—I did not charge him then at all—that was all that passed—he did not say anything when I charged him with having sent the old man—when the old man came in he said he had an order for the insect powder, and we must have it ready by 4 o'clock—he ordered two dozen 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., four dozen 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and four dozen 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he liked to encourage young beginners—after I said I had been swindled the prisoner went away—the old gentleman did not come again—when he came the second time I offered him all the powder I had in stock, the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packets for a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was the second time he came, and before I saw them together in the street—at that time I suspected that it was worthless—I tried the powder on bugs, but it did not kill any of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oilman, at 1, Spring Gardens, Stepney—on Saturday, 3rd May, the prisoner came to my place and asked me if I wanted anything in the haberdashery way—I told him I did not at present, but I thought I might do a little in that way after a while—he said he should be by that way again on Monday, and he would call in—he called on the Mon<lb></lb>day, and as I was out of carpenters' common lead pencils, I took a few of him and paid for them—he said he had not a price list with him, but he was going to another customer and would call in about an hour and bring a price list of the articles that he dealt in—after he had gone away and left his pencils an old gentleman came in—he was rather tall, with a long beard, and about fifty-five or sixty years old—he asked me if I had any carpenters' pencils, and I told him that I had—he had been in about three times before and took one or two carpenters' pencils then—the price is Id each—on this occasion he gave me this order for goods, amounting to about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would call in about an hour's time for the goods, and he went out—about half an hour afterwards the prisoner came in and I said "You have got back," and he said "Yes"—he said his customer had not a price list then, but he would send one by post the next day—I then asked him if he had any of the coloured crayons and leads as stated on the order—I showed him the order—he said he had, and I took enough to supply that order—he had all that I wanted with him, the coloured crayons and the leads, too—he did not give me any invoice—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the goods—I took those things in consequence of the old man having previously ordered them—I showed all the things to Mr. Kent, who is an experienced gentleman—the old man never came for the things he had ordered—I spoke to the police the same night; Monday, the 5th—I spoke to Mr. Kent last Wednesday.</p>

My husband is Henry Hobbs, we live at 1, Harper Street, New Kent Road—on 25th November last, the prisoner came to our shop—an old man had been in before that, about 9.30 or 10 o'clock in the morning—he was about sixty years of age, with rather a dark face, sun freckled—the prisoner came in about half an hour after the old man had gone away—he said "Do you deal in stationery?"—I said "Yes, I shall do so, I only opened on Saturday last"—he said "Is there anything I can serve you with?"—I said "Not this morning, I really don't know what I want at present, if you have any carpenters' pencils, I will take some of you," and I bought a dozen, and he went away—he asked me if I would allow him to leave me a list of his prices as he would call back, and I said "Certainly"—the old man had asked for some carpenters' pencils—the old man came back about half an hour after the prisoner had gone, he gave me this order and went away—after he had gone, the prisoner came back, about 11 o'clock, and said "I am very sorry I could not get you a list of the prices, but I will send you one in an envelope"—I said "I am very glad you have returned, for I have a very nice order for you; have you any pencils like that with you" and I gave him a pattern which had been left by the old man—I also showed him a pattern of the leads—he said "I have exactly the same"—I said "What are they?"—he said "4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen the pencils, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per box the leads"—I did not show him the list then, that the old gentleman had left—I bought two dozen pencils of him and paid him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, and he went away—the old man returned at 12 o'clock, and said "Will you allow me to</p>

               <p>look at your order, as I wish for more"—he ordered some more by word of mouth, and went away—the prisoner came back about twenty minutes after<lb></lb>wards, I said "I am very glad you have returned, because I want some more of the same goods to complete the whole of the order"—I completed the order for the old man and paid the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether, including the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not show the prisoner the order, but I told him what the old man had given the order for—the old man came in again for a penny nutmeg, he said he had his little granddaughter very ill and she was ordered a little wine and nutmeg—he said "Have you completed my order, I am in a great hurry"—I said "Yes,"—he said "I will call again about 3 o'clock"—when I found he did not come, I told Mr. Potter, and showed him the things—I have not tried to sell them because I was told they were valueless—I saw the prisoner the same night, going into the Brewer's Arms, Bermondsey New Road—I followed him in, he went out at the side door, I went out by another door and caught him by the shoulder and he ran away—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

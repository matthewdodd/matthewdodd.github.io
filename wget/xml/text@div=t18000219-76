I recollected, after I had seen the prisoner, that she had been in the house three or four days before, but I did not suspect her.</p>
               <p>The CONSTABLE sworn. - On the 29th of January, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I had information that there was a pot-stealer gone to No. 6, in White's-alley, and that they were then in the act of melting pots down; I went and knocked at the door, which was opened by a woman; as soon as they heard my voice, the woman of the house came, and while I was making the nature of my business known to her, the prisoner was making her escape by me, out of the house, with those two quart pots, and the two pint pots, tied up in her apron; I stopped her, and took her into custody; they were not melting any thing down; this pot I took out of the privy; I took all the woman up; I searched the house, and found this iron ladle, which I suppose is for melting the pots down in; it was like an old iron shop, which, I think, is only to deceive people.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you take them from me? - A. Upon my oath, I took the two quart pots, and two pint pots, from you, tied up in this apron. (The pots produced, and deposed to).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked them up in Castle-street, in that blue apron; there were two quarts, and two pints, in that blue apron; I was going to this Mrs. Wild's that she should read them for me, because I cannot read or write; and then I was going to take them to the landlord's house; I did not know what was in the bundle as there is a just God in heaven.</p>

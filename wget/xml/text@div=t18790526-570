                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 672). On 3rd May I saw the prisoners in conversation in Lower Thames Street, by the dry arch—I was in plain clothes on the footway, and I saw them enter the Steam Packet public-house—I saw this basket standing on the footway, and the smaller one by the side (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went up to the larger basket and looked in and saw some whiting in it—I then went to the top of the bridge and watched, them for a few minutes—I then saw Petty was in charge of one of Spiers and Pond's covered vans, and Wink then went up and touched the handle of the basket to pull it up close, as it was open a little distance—he then went towards Billingsgate Market, leaving the basket behind—he was absent about 30 minutes; he had nothing with him, and returned with nothing—he stood on the pathway looking up and down the street—Petty then got out of the van, holding something wrapped in paper under his apron by both hands, and stood over the basket and dropped the parcel in—Wink was about four yards from the basket—I told another officer to follow me down the steps—I lost sight of the prisoners for about a minute, and when I went to the steps Wink was standing over the basket apparently taking something from the paper and placing it down at the bottom of the basket—Petty was standing close by—I went up and told them I was a police officer, and wished to know what was in the paper he had put in the basket—they made no reply—I looked in the basket and found it contained four pairs of soles and five pairs under the paper—I told Petty I should take him in custody for stealing the soles—he replied "All right, Sir"—I told. Wink I should take him in custody for receiving the soles well knowing them to be stolen.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 49, Packington Street, Islington, and was at this time manager at Messrs. Spiers and Pond's fish depot—I went to market in the morning and bought 120 pairs of soles at one market—I missed two pairs—I bought another lot—Petty was in charge of the van—I counted the second lot, about five dozen, and they were all right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GILL</hi>. Both lots went into the van—the 120 pairs were what we call middle sized, not large soles—they cost 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pair—the people in the market counted them in the van about an hour after the prisoners were taken—the Van was still standing in the street—there are often mistakes to the extent of two or three or four soles in the counting in in the market—I said at the police-court that on counting the soles I was three short—I gave evidence on the remand—I said that Petty had been with us four years, and his conduct during that time had been very good—Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a brewer, of Teddington—on 30th November I saw an advertisement in the "Daily Telegraph," and between 1 and 2 o'clock on that afternoon I went with my partner to the place indicated, the Old Catherine Wheel stables, where we saw the prisoner and were shown a horse which the prisoner said was for sale and he walked it up and down the yard—he said that it belonged to his master, Mr. Shaw, of Walthamston, who had no further use for it, and he was authorised to sell it; that it was a hunter and was sound, and just the sort of horse which would suit a dog cart or to ride—the price was 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked for a trial; he said "Yes, you can have a trial if you like"—I went away to Long Acre and bought a dog cart, and returned to the Old Catherine Wheel about 9 o'clock, and asked the prisoner if I could have the horse; he said "Yes"—I said that I had no harness; he said that he would lend me some, but he should have to go to Walthamstow for it by train—I saw him start in a pony cart; he was away an hour and a quarter and brought the harness back—while the horse was being harnessed he called me on one side and said that as I was a complete stranger to him and he to me he could not allow me to take away a valuable horse like that without having the value left—I said "I will let you have the money, but I must" have an</p>

               <p>agreement signed for the horse for three days"—I then drew up this agree<lb></lb>ment; he signed it and I gave him a cheque—ray partner said that I had better cross it, but the prisoner said that something would have to come out of it to pay the livery stables, but that he would not cash it till the expiration of the three days; I said "That will do just as well"—on a corner of the agreement I put "Harness to be returned" and my initials—I drove the horse to Hampstead, and my partner went with me as far as Westminster Bridge—I noticed that the horse was going a little stiff bat thought it was on account of his being in the stable five months and being fed with soft food—I drove to Hampstead and put him up and next morning I drove him to Brixton—when 1 got over Westminster Bridge he was very lame, and my friend took the reins and said that I had better take the horse to a farrier—I pulled up at a telegraph office and stopped the cheque and also telegraphed to the prisoner—I took the horse to Mr. Balls, a veterinary surgeon, and left him there, as he was too lame to go any further—it was about 9.30 when I telegraphed to the Newington branch of the London and County Bank—I went to the Old Catherine Wheel between 11 and 12 o'clock, but did not find the prisoner—I went again about 3 o'clock but could not get any information about him—I employed a detective, Wright, who apprehended him, and on Monday the 6th, I gave him in custody at a public-house in Bishopsgate Street—he said that he could not understand the horse going lame, as he had sold him four months before to a clergyman for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the horse was a roarer, and if I had got on his back then I should have found that he was a roarer, but he thought he had got all right again—I am accustomed to horses in my business and on the road occasionally—I attended the police-court next day and the case was remanded for a few days—the prisoner came to me two days after wards and said that he was very sorry for what had taken place, that he did not wish the case to go any further as he was a poor man and could not afford to be prosecuted, and would I arrange it—I said "If you pay me the money I paid for the horse and my solicitor's expenses I will arrange it;" not knowing that it was not in my power to do so—he gave me 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for expenses, and I gave him this written order to Mr. Balls to release the horse—he asked me to give him a letter saying that I would not prosecute further, and I did so—I did not appear on the remand, and I was afterwards summonsed and the prisoner was committed—this is the cheque I gave him, it came back through my bankers, paid—I would not have parted with it if I had not believed the representations the prisoner made—I gave it to him because he said that his master would not trust the horse to me unless he got the 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believed that he was coachman to Mr. Shaw, and that had something to do with my parting with the cheque—I had bought about seven horses before this one—I do not hunt—I do not think that a hunter doing very well for a dog cart was a little incongruous—he said that his master had no work for him and kept him five months on soft food—he attempted to trot the horse, but the yard was so rough that he walked him, and I thought that the three days' trial would do as well as seeing him trotted—I did not go to the Catherine Wheel on the Saturday morning—he said "I have something to draw from the cheque so make it an open cheque"—he did not say that it was for the horses keep.</p>

On Monday evening, December 4th, I went with Mr. Conron to the Duke's Head, Norton Folgate, and saw the prisoner there—Mr. Conron gave him into my custody, and he asked me if I had a warrant for his arrest—I said "No," and he said that he should not go—I told him he was in custody and would have to go with me to the station-house—he said "What are the false pretences?"—I said "Repre<lb></lb>senting yourself to be coachman to Mr. Shaw, of Walthamstow"—he said "I did not say it"—I then took him to the station, and he was charged and said that he thought the horse had got well and was going on all right—he also said that he had previously sold it to a clergyman for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on Friday, 8th December, I went to Walthamstow, and endeavoured to find Mr. Shaw, I made inquiries at the police-station, the post-office, and several public-houses and shops, and also referred to directories, and I have been, a second time and made further inquiries, but can find no such person.</p>

I am a clerk in the London and County Bank, Newington Butts Branch—Conron and Stringer have an account there—the prisoner presented this cheque on 1st December, about 9.15 a.m., and it was paid in notes and gold—the bank opened at 9 o'clock—we shortly afterwards received a telegram from the prosecutor, but it was too late. George Balls. I am a veterinary surgeon at Brixton—on 1st December, this horse was brought there; I examined it, it was very lame in the off fore leg, and after he had stopped a few minutes he was so lame that he could not be removed and remained at ray place—it looked like recent lameness it was so bad—I thought he had picked up a nail, but I afterwards formed the opinion that it was chronic—it was a very useful animal in other respects, and a good looking horse—it had not got over the lameness when I delivered it up in consequence of this letter, but it was much better.</p>

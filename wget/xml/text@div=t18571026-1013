I live at Little Missenden, in Buckinghamshire, and am a fruit dealer; when I come to London I am at a stand in Covent Garden Market On 17th Sept., about half past 7 o'clock in the morning, I was there, and the prisoner Sergeant came first, about half past 7 o'clock—I served him with a flat of blackberries for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave me a half crown, and said he would fetch a basket and bring the other 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he went away, and did</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in Covent Garden Market I was there on the morning of 17th Sept I saw both the prisoners; I saw Milne first, about half past 7 or a quarter to 8 o'clock—I saw him buy half a flat of sloes of Mr. Dennis; he paid him a half, crown—I was near enough to see it, and it was bad—I did not see Sergeant at that time; I saw the prisoners both together afterwards—after Milne had bought the sloes he went across the line—I did not see him join Sergeant—I saw Sergeant come back from the crossing where Milne went down—the first purchase was of the sloes by Milne, and when he left I saw Sergeant come across and buy the flat of blackberries—I saw him pay for them with a half crown—I noticed the half crown, and it was bad—after Sergeant had bought the blackberries, he went away across the road towards Milne—I did not take notice whether they went close together—I went and told the beadle.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

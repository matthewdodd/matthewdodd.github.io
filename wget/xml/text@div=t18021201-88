               <p>GEORGE STOKELEY sworn. - I went out of the accompting-house as the prisoner went in; I had just put down half-a-guinea, and a seven-shillingpiece on the desk; I knew the half-guinea again, and described the marks on it before it was found, but I cannot swear to it; I have no doubt it is the same, it was an old half-guinea, bent down in a particular way on one side, not in the common way. (The constable produced a half-guinea found on the prisoner.)</p>

Lyons desired me to keep the other out of doors, which I did, he asked me which had the gold watch about him; I shewed him. After he had looked over the gold watch, then Gore produced the pinchbeck watch; I sat in one box, they in another; Lyons offered six guineas for them both: they said no, they would have five guineas for the gold one, and a guinea and a half for the pinchbeck; he said, he would give them no more than six guineas; he put the watches in his pocket, and said, if they would go home with him, he would give them the money. He gave me sixpence to pay for two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177207150008"></xptr> pints of beer, and bid me stay till they came back; I staid a quarter of an hour, but they did not come back.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the post chaise going into the country?</p>
               <p>Gore. No, coming to town; we came straight to town through the fields. The next night we sold the watch to one Lyons, a Jew, in Sweet Apple Court I think; it is in Bishopsgate street. We spoke to this man; he was going through the street, and he met Lyons. We went to a street on the other side Bishopsgate street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any words pass between the gentleman and you, when you robbed him?</p>
               <p>Gore. Yes; I asked the gentleman if he had any more money: he said, no, he had been paying money in the country, and had no more; then I said we would search him; he pulled down the flap of his breeches, and said, Search gentlemen where you please. We just put a hand on the flap, and said it was no matter; we supposed he had no more.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you get for this watch?</p>
               <p>Gore. Five guineas; Lyons gave us five guineas for it; we sold him a pinchbeck watch with a gold dial plate at the same time, for which he gave us a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. from Dempsey. Did you ever see me speak to that man.</p>
               <p>Gore. Yes; Devine had the watch, Dempsey was in company, and stood at the door whilst Devine and I went into the house; he went afterwards with us to Lyons's lodging, and stood at the door; Lyons's whore went out to change a 20 l. note, as she said, and Dempster followed her.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Glover. You did not mention any conversation that passed at the time you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Mr. Glover. No; I confined myself merely to the fact, that I might not lead the accomplice; I have never yet mentioned the conversation; it was nearly the same as the accomplice has related; one of them did ask for my pocket book, which I gave him; I told him it contained nothing but old letters; one opened it; said he, Sir, will you tell us where we may send it to you to-morrow morning; I said that was unnecessary, for it contained nothing but old letters, upon which he returned it to me.</p>

             and Devine, were altogether at a public house, in Drury Lane; I went there to ask Devine to come home to work; Dempsey took out a snuff box, emptied the snuff, and gave it me to pawn, and I pawned it for 6 d. at Mrs. Rochford's.</p>

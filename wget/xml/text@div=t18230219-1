On Sunday evening, the 22d of December, about half-past five o'clock, I left my house in the care of Kenaley, who was my errand boy, and had been a year and a half in my service. I desired him to make himself a comfortable fire in the parlour behind the shop, and gave him some books to read.

            , who had the care of my horse was with him. I went out for the purpose of attending chapel, but called at my brother's - I was sent for about nine o'clock, and found my daughter Elizabeth in tears. I found the inner door of the second parlour open; the lock was picked. I went to the drawers where I kept part of my money, and missed upwards of twenty sovereigns, some silver, and Bank notes - there was a 5 l. and a 10 l., and others, and two cheques, one for 30 l., and the other 18 l. There were marks of two chisels on the drawer, and in the other part of the drawer, I found the key of my iron chest, which I took to the chest, and found it locked. Some clothes which I had left on the top of it were thrown into the middle of the room, and upon opening it, I found there was not a farthing left. I lost above a hundred sovereigns, a 100 l. Bank note, a 80 l. Bank post bill, and from one to two hundred crown pieces. My suspicions fell on Kenaley. I had a very sharp dog in the house - no stranger could enter without his barking; the same dog was with me when Strong lived there, and if it was here it would run at him now I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Kenaley was accused himself - A. Yes. I have lodgers; the same people lodge with me now. I kept the keys of the iron chest in the drawer - I do not think Kenaley knew that; he had no access to that parlour. I have recovered none of my notes.</p>

            . In December last I lived with the prosecutor - I had been in his service nearly two years before, and came back to him the Monday before the robbery. In that week, I met the prisoner at the Lamb and Flag, public-house, kept by Mr. Evenden, in James-street, Manchester-square; it was on the Friday evening - he asked if I had gone back; I said I had; he said that was all right, and if he came on Sunday would I let him in - I said I did not know whether it would be my turn to stop at home on the Sunday or not; he said I could stop if I liked, and if I did would I let him in; I refused and went away. I saw him again on the Saturday night, at the same place - he said if he and Bob came the next night, would I let them in, (I had seen Bob in his company before, but did not know his name); I said there would be no way for them to come in - he said Chandler would watch the man out of the stable, meaning Griffiths my fellow servant, who took care of the horse. I agreed to do it - Bob was present at both the conversations on Friday and Saturday. Strong said he thought my master had a great deal of money in the house, and that fishmongering was a good trade. I went home to tea, and afterwards returned to the public-house, but saw no more of them. Chandler was not present at these conversations. I saw them again about five o'clock on Sunday evening, at the Lamb and Flag. On the Saturday evening, Strong also said Chandler would watch my master out to chapel - he always went on Sunday nights, and did so when Strong was there. When I went on the Sunday, they asked me if I was going home to tea, I said I was, and would return - I returned in about an hour, and found Strong there alone; he asked if I was going back to the shop, I said, Yes - we then came out, and he asked if my master was at the shop, I said he was not. He said Chandler and Bob were in James-street. He told me to tell the man to go and clean the horse directly, I said I would. It was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190004"></xptr>agreed that when the man was gone, I was to stop at the door, and should see him at the corner opposite, I said I would. He said when the man was gone they would come in. I went to the shop; Griffiths was there - he said he would go and do his horse up, and then go home; I said, very well - he went, and I went to the door, and saw them at the opposite corner; Strong and Bob came over - I did not see Chandler; they had some keys; I do not know what they did with them. I remained at the door while they went in. They had a chisel, which would not do - Bob went and got another; they were in the house about ten minutes. I was not at the door all the time - I went into the room and saw them opening the drawer; they said they would go and fetch another chisel - they did not make much noise. I had not seen the dog after returning from tea. As they went out, I asked them how much they had got; they said about 300 l., and said I must know nothing about it. No appointment was made for me to meet them about it. I never learnt from the prisoner what became of it. Griffiths came back from the stable in about half an hour - I was sitting in the outer parlour; he came in and did not stop two minutes, and then left, but before he went, I left him in the house while I took some oysters into Manchester-square - I was gone about twenty minutes, and on returning found a girl talking to him at the door, and when she went away, he asked me who she was, I told him; he said she had been standing there for five minutes. I said I knew her by seeing her walk by the shop. He went away in about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prosecutor took you out of a charity school I believe - A. Yes. I was examined twice before I charged the prisoner with the robbery. I said at the first examination that I had been out with oysters, and did not know whether the robbery was done during that time or not. I have been in the House of Correction ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said that you was sorry you had accused the prisoner for he had no hand in it, but Bob was the person who broke the place open - A. No. I do not know one Barry. I was in the room when they said they must fetch another chisel. I told the Magistrate about another chisel being sent for.</p>

I did not see Kenaley that evening - there were twenty or thirty people there. I know the prisoner well; he is a slater, and worked for Mr. West, and was regularly paid at our house. I saw him there again about six o'clock on Sunday evening, and Kenaley was there too, warming his hands in the same room, but I did not see them talking together - I only went into the room once, and cannot say whether they went out together; I think Kenaley was only there a few minutes.

He took them, and I waited till he came back - I sat down by the fire, and heard a knock at the door, I went to look, but saw nobody; the knock was repeated, I went and saw a young woman standing at the corner, about two yards from me, but not talking to me.

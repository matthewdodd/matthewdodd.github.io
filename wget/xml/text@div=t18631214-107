                  </hi>. I am the secretary of the Journeymen Mill<lb></lb>wrights' Trade and Friendly Society—the trustees are Joseph Roger Matthews, William Chamberlain, Henry Bournes, and Robert Williams—their meetings are held at the Swan Tavern, Fish-street—hill—I know the prisoner—he is a member of the society—that appears from the entry-book—I have it here—I have received money from him as a member—the objects of the society are to establish a fund for men out of employment, a superannuation, and money at the death of members and their wives—this is a copy of the rules, certified by Mr. Tidd Pratt—there is no sick-fund; men out of work are allowed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the first thirteen weeks, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the remaining thirty-nine weeks—the prisoner came to me, on the 11th October last, with other members called "<hi rend="italic">free members</hi>"—a free member is one not in arrears, and so entitled to receive out-of-work money; it is called <hi rend="italic">tramp</hi> money—he attended with the other members who were out of work, and claimed the usual allowance—when it came to his turn the question was put to him, "Are you <hi rend="italic">on</hi>?"—that is, on the funds of the society—he replied, "Yes," and I paid him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was for the week ending October 11th—I did not say anything as to what it was for—the regular question is to ask the member if he is on, when he attends at the pay-table—that means, is he on the funds of the society? is he out of work?—I had made a payment to the prisoner the week previous—the same question was put then—we make no other inquiry; if fifty men were to come and say they were on, I should pay them all—there are only thirty-seven free members, and the prisoner was one—I have known him as a member for ten or a dozen years, but I believe he has been a member altogether twenty-seven years—I have, on other occasions, paid him similar sums of money—he came again the week following 11th October—I asked him if he was on—he said, "Yes," and I paid him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these entries are made by me at the time of payment—he came again on 28th February—I asked him the same question again—he said, "Yes," and he was paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he came again on the 14th March, and claimed for two weeks—I again asked him if he was on, and he said, "Yes, for two weeks"—I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that occasion—other members besides free members do at times come, but I do not pay them unless they are on—I find out the difference by putting that question to them—their word is sufficient; there is no rule empowering us to make any inquiry—I have been secretary to the society two years and a half—I knew the defendant to be a free member—I should not have paid him these sums if he had not stated that he was on the funds.</p>

               <p>the defendant has paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a year, and funeral moneys besides—I do not get any receipt or acknowledgement when I pay these moneys—no member ever gives his signature on receiving money—a committee man who sits with me also makes an entry—there were two in this case, Thomas Symonds and Benjamin Baxter, and they are here—they have not been examined before—Mr. Symonds was present on 11th and 18th October, and Mr. Baxter on 28th February and 14th March—they enter the amount in the committee-man's book—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a check-book against me—on 14th March I seem to have made the entry in the committee-man's book—I first received information about this at the latter part of July—I bad a letter—the defendant continued to be a paying member of the society, and is still so—his last subscription was received this day week—these criminal proceed<lb></lb>ings were commenced against him more than three weeks or a month ago—he was summoned before a committee of the society in reference to this matter; he attended—the information I received emanated from a person named Case.</p>

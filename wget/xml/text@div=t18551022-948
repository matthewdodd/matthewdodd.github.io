I was on Tower-hill, on 16th Oct.—I saw the prisoner there—there were twenty or thirty persons round a menagerie, and the prisoner went behind a young man, and took a hand<lb></lb>kerchief out of his pocket with his left hand—I went up and took him—I told him I was an officer—I took the handkerchief and took the prisoner, but I had been laid up and was not strong—I gave him to Denny—I went to look for the young man who lost the handkerchief, and he was gone.</p>

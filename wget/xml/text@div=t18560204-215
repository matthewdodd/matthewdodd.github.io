                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Small, a cheesemonger, of No. 94, Aldersgate-street. On Friday morning, 18th Jan., about half past 7 o'clock, I was in the parlour at the back of the shop, and saw the prisoner taking a ham from the window inside the shop—he went out of the shop and turned to the right—I ran out, called "Stop thief!" saw him <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> the ham down, and run off; a man picked it up, and gave it to me—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

On 18th Jan., about half past 7 o'clock in the morning, in consequence of information, I went to No. 3, Little Arthur-street, Goswell-street, which is four or five minutes' walk from the prosecutor's shop, and found the prisoner in bed with two females, in the first floor front room—he lodged there—I found his boots by the bedside, put my hand into them, and found them warm, as if they had been lately taken off, and they were fresh dirtied.</p>

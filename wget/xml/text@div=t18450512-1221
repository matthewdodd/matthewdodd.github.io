                  </hi>. I live in Salisbury-crescent, Walworth. On the 30th of April, about ten or eleven o'clock at night, I was in the Dover-road, on my way home—the prisoner addressed me, and asked me to give her a glass of ale—in order to get rid of her I consented, as I had been annoyed on similar occasions—she wished me to go to a public-house which I did not like the appearance of—I said I would give it her at another house—we crossed the road for that purpose, and she was leading me a way I did not like, and wished to get away—I turned and saw two men who were following us, the prisoner being close to me, and speaking vociferously tome—one of the men then passed very close, and thrust the prisoner against me—the men then went off, one one way, and the other the other—immediately after I said, "I must go," and the prisoner let go of my arm—I put my hand to feel for my purse and watch, and I missed my purse which contained three sovereigns and some silver, which I had seen safe about two hours before.</p>

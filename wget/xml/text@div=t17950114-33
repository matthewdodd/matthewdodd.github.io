               <p>Q. When was this you went? - The 9th of December, the first day I went to that house, I went there with a friend who went there to recommend me.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to confine your evidence to the 10th, the next day? - I went on the 10th day again, the same person went with me as before; and him and I were nearly two hours in a back room in that house, one Simon's house, who keeps the Black Lion, in Petticoat-lane. We asked the servant whether Jacobs was there or Lazarus? they neither of them were in that house at that time; he came in afterwards and asked what was wanting.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did that? - Phinehas Jacobs; he came in and opened the door, and knew the person that was with me, that recommended me, and asked what was wanting? he knew him, he had purchased before that; he then went out with him to the back door and had some conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go with him? - I did not go out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What past after that? How long did they continue together? - I look upon it about ten minutes. Then Lazarus came in and told me there were eighteen shillings for my half guinea; I asked him if that was all his master could afford for half a guinea? and he said yes. I understood by the appearance that Jacobs was his master.</p>

               <p>Q. They were both in the house at this time? - Yes, both in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. It was Jacobs and your friend that went together, and conversed at the back door? - Yes, Jacobs and my friend. I beg your pardon, gentlemen, I am wrong in the sum, that day I had twenty-four shillings for the half guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that question of his master's not affoding any more, was not on the 10th? - It was not, it was on the 9th; on the 10th I had twenty-four.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day was it your enquired for the prisoner, and they were not there at the Black Lion, and soon after Phinehas Jacobs came and and asked what was wanted? - Equally the 9th and 10th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Lazarus give you the twenty-four the 10th? - Lazarus gave me the four and twenty that day, twenty-four shillings for half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him half a guinea? - I gave him a guinea, I had never an half guinea, he went to the bar and got change, and returned me half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Jacobs again that day? - I saw Jacobs at that very time. I asked if any of these shillings were to turn bad, whether he would change them? he said, bring them back, that either he or Lazarus would give other shillings for them at any time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with that money you got? - Immediately after I received it, I took it to Esq. Colquohoun and shewed it to him.</p>

               <p>Q. What was found on them? - Ten Shillings found on Lazarus to the best of my knowledge, and I think there was one bad shilling found on Jacobs and a bad sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they bad or good found on Lazarus? - Bad; the officers has got that money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Let us understand a little. You went them to this Black Lion public house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. By the desire of the magistrate? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask for these two persons? - My friend that was with me asked for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Your friend went with Jacobs to the back door? - They did.</p>
               <p>Q. The twenty-four that Lazarus gave you, was at the time that Jacobs was talking to your friend? - Yes, at the time that they were conversing.</p>
               <p>Q.At that very time the transaction took place of Lazarus giving you twenty-four for half a guinea? - Lazarus was dispatched by Jacobs.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't tell us about dispatch. Did it not pass during the time of the conversation? - It did, they were in conversation the whole of the time.</p>

               <p>Q. How many times have you had the good fortune to be employed in prosecutions of this sort? - Once before.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the last session? - The session before last.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been employed to apprehend different offenderd? - That is not what I am sworn to.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been employed by the Mint to apprehend different offenders? - Once before, Esq. Colquohoun ordered me.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us ask whether any thing past between you and Lazarus, before he gave you the twenty-four shillings? - No, there had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him before that time? - No otherwise than this, when he came into the room he said here is this for you for half a guinea. I did not speak to Lazarus that day at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you have the goodness to tell us what line of life you are in? - I am a bricklayer by trade.</p>
               <p>Q. You do business for yourself? - I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have you always gone by the name that you now have? - I have, upon my oath.</p>

               <p>Q. You can give me a plain answer, on your oath? - Upon my oath I never went by any other name than that I go by now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. You have been asked whether at the time Lazarus gave you that money, that Jacobs and your friend were not conversing together? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were they to you? - About as near as that gentleman is to me</p>
               <p>Q. In the same room? - There was a door come out into a passage, and they stood at the left hand side of that door way, and I was in the room</p>

               <p>Q. You apprehended these prisoners along with Harper? - I did; I apprehended Lazarus and searched him, and on him I found eight bad shillings and four sixpences, all done up in a parcel, I have kept it ever since. (Produced.)</p>

               <p>I had warrants to go and apprehend each of the prisoners; in company with the other officers on Saturday, the 13th of December, we went into the house and shut the door; I said to Pinnicad is the men here; he pointed them out and we took them; I see Mr. Ferris search Lazarus and find ten shillings have money, and three or four penny worth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had a good deal of experience of had money, look at that money, and tell us whether it is bad or good? (the twenty four shillings shown him) - They are bad; the ten-shillings shewn him) they are bad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp submitted to the court that the act of parliament upon which this indictment was forward expressed it to be counterfeiting milled money and this money had not been so proved.</p>
               <p>The court observed there was a case before the judges of that sort not yet decided.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp likewise submitted that this was not a case to go to the jury on the part of Jacobs, because he had not put off the money, but Lazarus alone.</p>
               <p>The court observed that was a fact for the jury to determine, how far he was concerned in the transaction.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Jacobs called two witnesses and the prisoner Lazarus one, who gave them good characters.</p>

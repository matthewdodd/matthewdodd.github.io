                  </hi>. I am a watch-tool maker, and live in Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell. On the morning of the 16th of Dec. I was in my shop—I saw the top of the prisoner's hat behind the counter, by the desk—the prisoner went out—I looked out, and saw him, with something under his arm—I went round the counter, and missed the vice—I called to my son, went after the prisoner, and took him, about ten or twelve yards from the door, with the vice on his shoulder—I told my son to go and fetch the street-keeper—the prisoner went down on his knees, and begged I would not prosecute him—I told him I should, it was not the first or second time he had been there on that errand—this is my vice—it was within a yard of the door—I had seen it there on the previous afternoon.</p>

            . I live in Peterstreet, Westminster. On the 5th of November, about eleven o'clock at night, I had been out with a master I work for, and coming along near <placeName id="t17481207-78-crimeloc368">Somerset-House</placeName>

               <p>Q. Where were the rest of the women?</p>
               <p>Fry. They were all standing together. She that kissed me was the Prisoner at the bar. She then desired I would give her a pint of beer; so I had her to the fighting Smallwood's house, and as she was entering the house Mrs. Smallwood pushed her out of doors, and said, why do you bring this creature here, for she will pick your pocket? She was immediately gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the Prisoner at the bar took your money?</p>
               <p>Fry. There was none but she near me, and I felt her hand down to my breeches; but I did not then think of my money. And please you, my Lord, I lost a great deal more, but I put it to but five shillings.</p>

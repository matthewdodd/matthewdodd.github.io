            . I am a policeman, when I was coming off duty, at six o'clock in the morning, Mr. Kew was in Tavistock-place; he called to me, and desired me to go and take the prisoner into custody for robbing him - I went, and took hold of him, but the moment he saw Kew he said, "I was forced to do it; for I should have been taken for debt if I had not done it" - Kew said "How could you rob me when I took you to learn your business, and allowed you 7s. a week?" - he said,"I was obliged to do it, to pay some debts" - Kew said,"If you can give me an account of what you have done with the money I will not prosecute you" - he said, "I owed the chandler's shop 4s." - Kew said, "Have you paid it?" - he said, "No" - Kew said, "What have you done with the money?" - he said, "I made it last me as long as I could" - I said, "Do you deny the charge?" - he said, "No."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 22d of May, my uncle told me he would turn me away, and threatened to beat me, and therefore I left him on Saturday night; he has threatened a great many times to beat me.</p>

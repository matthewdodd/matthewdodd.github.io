                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoe maker, of 8, Dockhead, Bermondsey—I have a branch shop in Brunswick-terrace, Lower-road, Rotherhithe, which the prisoner managed—he went there at the latter end of last August—he had 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and apartments for his wife and family—he had a book for every week's account—he was to enter everybody's account separately in that book, and send it to me every week; then I would go there on the Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, to take the money, after he had deducted his own wages and paid the boy—I saw by what he had entered in the book that so much stock was gone—there was a ledger as well—I never looked at the ledger, unless I saw something entered in this book to call my attention to it—from information I received, I went to my shop at Rotherhithe on Wednesday, 30th December, at half-past 2 in the afternoon—the prisoner was not there—I saw there had been a fire in the cellar—the money he took was kept in a desk, locked up—the prisoner had the key for that purpose—the fire was on a top shelf in the cellar, nine inches from the ceiling, underneath where the desk and the books were—the fire had burnt through the ceiling and just scorched the floor—I went away, and came back again in the evening of the same day, and the prisoner had come back—I asked him where he had been—he said, "I have been out; I am <hi rend="italic">that</hi> miserable, I can't stop in the house any longer"—he left the boy there and his wife—I stopped there till the shop was shut up in the evening—I told him he had not got anything to make him miserable that I knew of—he did not tell me what it arose from—when the shop was closed I asked him for the amount he had sent me up in the book, the balance of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the week's account, and also the money he had taken for the last three days, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which was entered on a slate—that showed altogether an amount of 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was after deducting his weekly wages—he said he would get the money—he went to the desk, and came back and said he could not find the key—I said, "We had better break the desk open, then"—he said, "It is a pity to break the desk open, you had better come to-morrow"—the boy was there at the time—I got a hammer to break open the desk—while I was breaking it open I said, "Here it comes, Henderson, here it comes"—I turned round to speak to him and he had slipped out of the shop into the passage—the street door was wide open—I called to his wife, but he was not to be found, he had gone</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402290075"></xptr>
               <p>—I then called in a policeman—the desk was broken open, and the policeman and my lad found 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there—I did not take it out—I next saw the prisoner on 29th January at Stepney—I said to him, "Henderson, how came you to abscond in such a manner?"—he said, "I was trying to make it up"—he was taken to the station-house—there is no entry in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the receipt of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from a Mrs. Crutch on 16th Decamber—there is no entry between 16th December and 26th December, when the books were made up—there is no entry of 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> paid by Mrs. Crutch at the same time—the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is entered in the ledger as paid—the prisoner knew that my practice was not to look at the ledger, unless I saw the entry in this book—I have not received any of this money since from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> If you refer to one of those books, on 9th, in your ledger, you will find two entries; you stated that for five weeks you had not seen the ledger, is it not the practice when you give credit to put the names of the persons in the ledger, and not the amount? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is nothing to call my attention to the ledger since 9th December, and what then called my attention was two items on credit, one to Mr. Harris, and one to Mr. Granville—I have not seen the ledger since that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then supposing the prisoner sold any goods on credit, his duty would be to enter the name of the customer here, and not the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and that would at once inform me that it was in the ledger; seeing the name and not the amount I should go to the ledger, to see what the account was—my complaint is, that Mrs. Crutch's name was not put down in this book—there were accounts from time to time which made it necessary for me to look at the ledger—Mrs. Crutch's account, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> appears in the ledger to have been paid, and I say that under that date, December 16th, it should appear as paid in this book, otherwise I should not know it.</p>

                  </hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> With regard to Mrs. Crutch's account I admit having the money, but it was paid on the Saturday-night, which is a busy time, and she paid it with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and having that to change, I may possibly have passed it over. I had no intention of defrauding the prosecutor in any way. It came to his knowledge that I had been offered a business which was to let in the neighbourhood of his own shop, and he was rather annoyed at it For the last three months it had been his practice to come down on the Thursday, and if he had done so on this occasion he would have had the money. I sent the boy for a screw-driver, gave Mr. Lenton the keys, said I would go through the accounts with him the next morning, and went out. If he had come on the Thursday I should have been prepared to have met him as I have always done. <hi rend="smallCaps">

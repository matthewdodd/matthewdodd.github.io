               <p>I live with Mr. Kirkby, I missed this camblet on the 23d of August, between four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100118"></xptr> and five in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop under pretence of buying a camblet gown, and after looking at a great many they bought a gown and lining; I was at another part of the shop, another shopman served them; whilst he was putting it up, I observed Holland go out before the gown was put up, I suspected she had got something, and I immediately went out and followed her, and took from her this piece of camblet, six yards and a half, which she had concealed under her apron; I can swear to its being Mr. Kirkby's property, it is the only piece we had of the colour standing in the window: I heard the prisoners converse together, they came in together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Holland. Did not I leave my camblet that I bought, on the compter, instead of that I took away? - She left the other person to bring the gown away.</p>

               <p>A relation came home from sea, and gave me a half-a-guinea to go and buy a gown immediately, and as I laid that out, he said, he would give me a trifle more; and I asked

               <p>While I was waiting for the change this body was brought back: I scrupled the sixpence and he had never another, and he gave me halfpence, and I looked them over, then they brought her back.</p>

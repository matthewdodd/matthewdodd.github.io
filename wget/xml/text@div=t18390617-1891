                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate woman, and live in Red Lion-yard, Holborn. On the 7th of June I was at the Sun public house, at the corner of Broad-court, Long Acre, about half-past five o'clock in the morning—I had been out all night, and was a little the worse for liquor, but I knew perfectly well what I was about—I had one glass of rum and cold water at the bar—the prisoner came in while I was counting the change which the landlady gave me out of a sovereign—I put the change into a dark brown purse, and put it in the left side of my bosom—I sat down, and the prisoner forced some conversation to me—I told him I did not wish to have any conversation with him, but if he wanted a glass of any thing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170112"></xptr>
               <p>I would give it him—I saw he was in liquor—I had seen him several times in two public-houses down Bow-street—the prisoner took my purse out of my bosom, and ran out of the house into Broad-court—the policeman was coming by, and took it out of his hand—he had taken it against my will—I stood with him, and was trying to take it out of his hand when the police-man came up.</p>

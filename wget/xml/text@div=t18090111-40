               <p>Q. Do you live in the house where the shop is - A. No; I have a house in William street, Brunswick square.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the inhabitant of the house where the shop is - A. I am the occupier; the prisoner belonged to the lodgers in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose the money mentioned in the indictment - A. I did; it was either on the night of the 8th of November, or on the morning of the 9th, I lost it from my till in the shop; I left my shop about seven or eight in the evening; the shop has two doors, one door to the parlour, and one door into the passage: I locked the door that communicates with the parlour, and put a chair to the other door that leads into the passage, so that nobody could go inside without forcing the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. How many lodgers have you in the house - A. Mr. Bugby and his mother; the prisoner was their <rs id="t18090111-40-deflabel240" type="occupation">servant</rs>

About five o'clock on the morning of the 9th of November I came to the shop, I entered the shop by the parlour door; I found it locked; when I came to the next door I found that the chair had been removed. On the parlour door I found that the box of the lock, the screws, had been drawn to enable them to open the door without unlocking it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then a person had got in that way - A. Yes. I found the lock of the till had been picked, as I supposed; I left it locked; upon examining the till I found that half a guinea that was marked was gone, three shillings in silver, all marked, were gone, seven penny pieces, and two halfpence were gone. About eight o'clock the prisoner came down; I fetched the officer; at seven o'clock the prisoner came into my bakehouse to get a light, and then she went into her own kitchen. Wood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110040"></xptr>the officer, at that time was in the area, I told him she was gone into the kitchen; he went into the kitchen after her, he searched her, he produced half a guinea; I believed she gave up the silver. I saw the mark on the half guinea that I had put on it the over night. He searched her box up stairs and found the copper pieces that I had lost; all the money I had marked the over night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce any key - A. Yes, one that opened my till, and the other opened my tea caddy; I had lost them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon this being discovered what did the prisoner say - A. She said it was the first time, and she hoped I would forgive her; I told her it was not the first time. I told the officer to take her away.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On the 9th of November I went to Mr. Jennings' house; the prisoner came down about eight o'clock; I followed her into the kitchen, told her what Mr. Jennings suspected her of, and said I must search her; upon searching her I found half a guinea, marked with a cross on the head side; I shewed it to Mr. Jennings, he recollected it; I found three shillings on her, all marked with a cross; I found the key of her box upon her person; I searched her box; I found five penny pieces marked with a 2, and two halfpence marked with a figure of 6; Mr. Jennings claimed them all. In her box I found two keys that Mr. Jennings claimed - one the key of his till, and the other the key of his tea caddy. The prisoner went down upon her knees, and begged for mercy very hard, she said she had done it last night, it was the first time. - Through a mistake last session I put the money into my pocket; the marks are worn out.</p>
               <p>Q. That it is very incautious conduct - A. It is, my lord; I can assure you it was not done wilfully.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow—I have known Mr. Miller and the prisoner, his wife, seven years—they have four children—I was living in the same house with them previous to November—and on 1st November, between six and seven o'clock, I was getting up, and the prisoner came to the door of my bedroom and said that Mr. Miller was coming home to his breakfast—I had had no quarrel with her—I went into the kitchen and</p>

               <p>was making the fire in a stooping position, putting wood on, when I received a dreadful blow on my head—I did not know that any one was in the kitchen—I sat down on a chair, took my hand away from my head, and said, "Oh, look at the blood"—the prisoner was then at the table, she came before me and cut me across the throat, and said, "What is that, Mrs. Cattermole?" I said, "Oh murder!"—she then cut me on the other side—I went to get the kitchen door open but found it was fastened—she pulled my hair and said, "You don't go alive"—she turned round to get the broom, and I got to the street door and found the chain up—she tore my hair—I got out of the house into the street, and was taken to a surgeon's and from there to the hospital—my hand was also wounded when I put it up to save my throat—I considered the prisoner very odd at times.</p>

I live at 40, Newington Causeway—I have known Mrs. Miller eight years—I attended her in her first confine<lb></lb>ment, and in four confinements by myself or my assistants, and also for miscarriages—she has been off and on, well or ill, in a state utterly beyond self-control.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the frequency of having children and the frequency of miscarriages—I do not mean self-control from passion—in connection with confinements and miscarriages there is a tendency to destroy even their own children—I have known a woman throw her infant to the other side of the room—I mean that the prisoner has been out of her mind—I have'called her husband's attention to it, and told him it was not safe for her to be at liberty—she is, I believe, pregnant now—I had seen her a few months before 1st November—I have advised the father and the husband that she should be immured somewhere, as she is not safe for herself or others.</p>

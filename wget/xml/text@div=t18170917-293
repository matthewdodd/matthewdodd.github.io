            . I am Mr. Hart's bailiff. Child told me he had lost the pollard. I saw one of the sacks at Kingston Bridewell, when the prisoner was in custody, and knew it to be Mr. Hart's. The prisoner kept a cornchandler's shop at Hampton-wick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. We lost some pigs and fowls-Harding was taken up for stealing them. When we send sacks to the mill they are returned. I never knew of their being changed.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HARDING. I am a labourer. At the end of January, (about the 27th or 28th), the prisoner told me he wanted some barley-meal for his pigs, and he thought there was some to be got down at old Fowler's (Mr. Hart's bailiff), and asked me to go down with him the next morning - I agreed to go at two o'clock; I got up at two o'clock and went to his house; I threw some stuff up at his win<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170081"></xptr>dow to awake him. We went to Mr. Hart's farm-it was three o'clock, by Kingston clock. He said we must see about going in. I went through the yard, and over a gate into another yard; he opened the door, which was on the latch; we went in, and found two sacks, we thought it was barley-meal - We took it, and made the best of our way to his house; when we got near it, we thought we heard people about, took it back, and left it at my house at Kingston-bridge. I struck a light, and found it was pollard - He went home, to lay down for an hour or two, and about six o'clock he brought one of his own sacks to put it in, and said he would fetch it at breakfast-time - He took the other sack with him. At dinner-time he fetched the pollard, and gave me 3s. for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. When was you taken up - A. The beginning of May, about some pigs; I then told every thing. I gave evidence against another man at Clerkenwell the other day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not turn evidence at Sussex - A. No. I never was in trouble about any deals.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever threaten to prosecute people if they did not give you money - A. No, I was in trouble about some cheeses. I expect to get out of custody for my evidence here.</p>

            . I am the keeper of Kingston Bridewell. I received information from Harding after he was taken up, and went to the prisoner's house at Hamptonwick for some sacks. I found one in a shed there with Mr. Hart's name on it. There were several more there, but this one was by itself.</p>

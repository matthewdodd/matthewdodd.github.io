The prisoner was in my employ - about the 13th or 14th of April, I found my stable door open, and the gate forced, and about three or four days afterwards I missed a saddle, which I had seen safe about the 11th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you miss your saddle as soon as you found your stable door open? A. Some little time afterwards; and I heard, about three weeks afterwards, that one was offered in the neighbourhood for sale - the prisoner lived in Crawford-street, Manchester-square - I had no quarrel with him.</p>

            . I live in George-street, Clarendon-square. I attended the examination of the prisoner - when he was discharged and the saddle given up, and I took it because I had paid for the advertisement, to reimburse myself: I took it home and put it in my back kitchen, where it remained till Limbrick, and Mr. Wright, took it away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long did you keep it? A. I think from Friday till Monday. I have known the prisoner for twelve years - he is a doctor.</p>

There was a large concourse of people. I was in the crowd. The constable (Johnson) told me that the prisoner had picked my pocket of my handkerchief, and had given it to Williams. I felt in my pocket, and found my handkerchief was gone.</p>
               <p>- JOHNSON. I am an officer. On the 14th of April I was in the Exchange, I saw the prisoner Williams close to the prosecutor. I saw him go away very quickly from the prosecutor, apparently to me, as if he had picked his pocket of his handkerchief. He went a few yards, and stood with Brown; he gave 
               <persName id="t18130602-83-person790">Brown</persName>
             a handkerchief, which I suspected was the handkerchief he had taken from Mr. Jenner's pocket. Brown put in his pocket, but left a good bit of the handkerchief hanging out of his pocket. I took Mr. Jenner, and asked him if that was the handkerchief that he had lost. He said, it looked very much like his handkerchief. I took them both in custody. Brown put the handkerchief down. This is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my handkerchief. I should not like to swear to it. It was just such a handkerchief as this; I cannot swear</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I asked Williams to lend me an handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Williams's Defence. The handkerchief is my own property, I assure you.</p>

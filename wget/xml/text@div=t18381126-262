                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 81.) On the evening of the 20th of November I was on duty in Tower-street, Blackfriars. I saw the prisoner in company with a young girl—I followed them to Union-street, Borough—I then went up to the prisoner, and took bold of both his hands—I called my brother constable, who took hold of Him by the throat—I saw six bad shillings fall from his mouth—I picked up five, and Brooks took up the other one—I looked at them at the light, and they were all bad.</p>

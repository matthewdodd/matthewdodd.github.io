               <p>When she saw me I was coming past the door; I gave half a guinea for the gown, I took the constable to the shop where I bought it, and he did not choose to take the woman up, and she denied selling the gown, because they had been there before, and told her it was a stolen gown.</p>
               <p>Court. Who made the gown?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The gown was made in the country many years ago, I have had it fifteen years, I am sure it was mine.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. How came you to buy a gown without cuffs? - There were no cuffs.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did she take the constable to the house in Monmouth-street? - I did not go with them, the constable said she could not find the place; I do not know the constable's name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My witnesses were here to day.</p>

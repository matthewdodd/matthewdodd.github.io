               <p>Q.Did any body come in with him? A.

I ran out towards the side door to go out of the way; it is a good long barrack - I then saw Antonio with a sharp instrument in his hand: he ran after me - I stumbled, and fell down by the step of the door, as I went to run up stairs, and while I was down Antonio was sticking me with the knife - he gave me a rip in my side; Collins then came, and took away the knife -Mr. Betson, the surgeon, saw me the same night.</p>

I saw Antonio in our room on Monday evening, about half-past ten o'clock, looking for something; I asked what he was looking for - he made no answer; I saw him take a razor off the shelf - he broke the handle off, took the blade in his hand, and went out of the room; there was a light in the room - in about ten minutes I heard a noise in the room George slept in; I went to see what was the matter, and when I entered the room I saw Antonio strike George twice; whether he struck with the razor or not then, I cannot say - they had a scuffle, and the candle went out: Caetano was in the room, but I did not see him do any thing - when the light went out George went out of the room into the yard; both the prisoners followed him - Antonio turned into the room again; he went out again, and I saw George run away from him - I then went into the yard; George was running away from him, singing out, "Knife! knife!" Antonio ran after him, and George fell by the Lascars' door; I saw Antonio make a plunge at him - I went there, collared him, and took from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200014"></xptr>his hand the blade of the razor; I delivered it to George the next morning.</p>

               <p>Antonio's Defence.

               <p>Caetano's Defence. I only came in to bid him farewell, because I was going away; I only went on a visit- this man came in, and they said, "How came you to come in, in such a rough way?" he said because he liked it; the prosecutor then jumped out of bed - I went to part them; I did not know that he had any knife in his hand - I only took him away to keep him back; I do not know the laws of this country at all.</p>

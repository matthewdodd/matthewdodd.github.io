I did not come on that business, I have got a wife at home I was going to, but you have decoyed me into this dismal place; she directly stamped with her foot, and called for some gin; the room-door was never shut; I told her I should drink no gin, and was going away; I got as near the door as I could, then the two young men came into the room.</p>
               <p>Which two? - The two outside ones, Granger and Collins.</p>
               <p>Those two men came into the room? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What is the little woman's name? - She acknowledged to the name of Smith the next day at the Justice's; while they had hold of my arms, knowing I had the notes, in this pocket, I leaned back as well as I could, to prevent them from taking them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270054"></xptr>out; she pushed to that pocket, and took them out; they were in my breeches pocket; she dropped a letter and a bill of parcels on the floor, and then ran out of the room.</p>

               <p>Did they take any thing besides the notes? - Yes, they took my cash; two of them had their hands in my pockets, Collins and the little woman; they took two half guineas, six shillings and some halfpence; then I recovered myself a little, they wanted to get away; I laid hold of one man with the one hand, and of the other with the other hand, and said, they had robbed me of forty or fifty pounds, and I would lose my life before I would let them go.</p>
               <p>What did Jones do? - She pulled my handkerchief off my neck, while they had hold of me.</p>

               <p>Who did you lay hold of? - Collins and Granger.</p>
               <p>Did any body else come in before you laid hold of them? - Yes, Messenger came in, and picked up part of the writings which the little woman had dropped.</p>
               <p>When did she run out? - As soon as she had taken the notes out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Before you laid hold of Collins and Granger? - Yes, Messenger came in before I laid hold of Collins and Granger, and picked up some of the papers, and went out again; Smith came in again while I had hold of them, and she scratched my hand, and kicked my legs; that they bled in several places; I could not put them out of the way because I had fast hold of the men; then Messenger came back and laid hold of me by the coat, in order to pull me to the top of the stairs; while he was doing this, and the other kicking me, Collins got out of my hand, and ran out of that room; the woman who belonged to the house, whom I had never seen, hearing the noise, called the watch, and the watch was coming in at the door of the house, as Collins got out of my hand; he came up stairs, and soon after another man, Stack; I gave him charge of Jones, and Smith, and Granger, and told him there was a young man just gone down stairs; I was afraid he was gone out; he said nobody had gone by him; the woman belonging to the house said she was sure he was not gone by, and she would search the next room; she took the candle in her hand, and looked into the lower closet, and said, here he is; I looked into the place, and said, you must come out young man; as soon as I laid hold of him, he tried to throw me down; but I was too strong for him; I said to the watchman, search his mouth; I saw he had something in it, I thought he had my notes; he put out two shillings and an halfpenny, and said, blast you take it; I assisted in taking them to the watch-house; they were searched at the watch-house, but none of the notes found.</p>
               <p>What was found upon them? - There was nothing found upon them there, that I could swear to; they had given the notes to another girl to take care of.</p>
               <p>There were those five people in the room at one time or another, Jones, Granger, Collins, Smith, and Messenger? - Yes.</p>

               <p>No more? - No more.</p>
               <p>Messenger was not taken that night? - No; the next day when I went before the Justice, I said there was an old man; they would not fully commit the others till he was taken; I took a neighbour with me down to the house, and asked the woman the name of the old man; she said it was Messenger, and while I was there he came in; that is the man; as soon as he came in I know him again, though it was candlelight when I saw him before; I said you are the man I want, I was looking for you, you must go with me; he said, blast your eyes, I will cut your bloody melt out; I told him it was no use to struggle, he should go with me; he then went readily, and shewed me the nighest way to the watch-house; the constable searched and found a handkerchief of mine upon him, and a duplicate in his pocket; I went with the officer to the pawnbroker's, Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270055"></xptr>Woodins, the corner of King's-street, Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Was any thing else found? - An old handkerchief of mine in his pocket, the duplicates were tied up in.</p>

               <p>Was there any body in Jones's room? - No, I went to the window and called the watch, the watch then came; I said to Smith, where is the fellow that was in white here? she said there was no one; I looked, and found him in the cupboard, and said to him, come out of that; I said, when Collins came out of the cupboard, I said you have something in your mouth, is it paper? he said no, this is what I have got in my mouth; the watchman came, and as they were going down stairs, I said here is some paper in the room; the watchman came with me into Jones's room; there were a great many papers; I picked up a 5 l. draught, the gentleman said was payable the next day; I gave it to one of the watchmen.</p>
               <p>Now mind that you speak the whole truth, for you will get into a scrape if you do not; the first you heard of it was Jones coming down stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not you before that call the watch, and then go up stairs to see what was the matter? - No, not till

               <p>Where was Messenger before? - Below stairs, fetching water for me.</p>

               <p>To Whitehouse. I understood you that Jones and Smith and Granger were never out of the room till the watchman came? - Jones got my handkerchief off and went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270056"></xptr>out with it; they were in the room when the watchman came.</p>
               <p>Did Jones go out of the room after she took the handkerchief? - Yes, with the handkerchief in her hand, and came in again afterwards, but I think she had not time to get down stairs; both the women had been out of the room and came in again, they left me with these men.</p>
               <p>Was Jones in the room or out of the room when you laid hold of Collins and Granger? - She had just gone out as I laid hold of them.</p>
               <p>After you laid hold of Collins and Granger, how soon did Jones come in? - I suppose she was not half a minute away; Messenger had been in the room and taken the papers.</p>
               <p>Was that before Jones ran out? - Messenger came in before she had taken the handkerchief off and been out of the room, and picked up these papers.</p>
               <p>Messenger came back a second time? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Did Granger ever get away from you? - He never was away.</p>
               <p>He never went down stairs? - Not before the watchman came in.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then Mrs. Murphy don't say true in that? - No.</p>
               <p>Collins got out of your hands? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But not Granger? - No.</p>
               <p>Who came up with the woman of the house? - I don't recollect any body coming with her, without it was the watchman, I believe they came together.</p>
               <p>The woman of the house did not come up with Jones and Granger? - No.</p>
               <p>Was Jones in the room again before the watch was called? - Yes, when the watch came up they were in the room together.</p>
               <p>Did Messenger get down before the watchman was called? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>When Messenger laid hold of you to pull you down stairs, how came he to quit you? - He could not get me to the stairs, I turned to lay hold of him, and he let me go and ran down.</p>
               <p>That was at the time Collins got from you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the watchman and the woman of the house came up, Smith, Collins, and Granger, were with you in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was the room in which you had been robbed? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman in Cross-lane; about 12 o'clock I heard the alarm of watch cried out, my box is within 10 yards of Murphy's door, where I heard the alarm; I came to the door and a woman opened it.</p>
               <p>Who was that woman? - I cannot tell; Mrs. Murphy told me there was a robbery committed above stairs; she was going up stairs before, and told me to make haste up; up I went; Collins was coming out, and I stopped him.</p>
               <p>Where was he? - He was coming at the head of the stairs in order to make off; I said nobody should go out till I knew what had happened; I brought him into the room where the prosecutor and the rest of the company was.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am; he was just come out of the door at the head of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Then it is not true that he was hid in the closet? - I had not seen him in the closet.</p>
               <p>Be as particular as you can; you were alarmed with a noise at Murphy's house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You went there, and some woman opened the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You followed Mrs. Murphy up stairs? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you meet any body before you went into the room at all? - Yes, I met Collins coming out of the door before I went into the room; I told him no person should go out till I knew what had happened, and took him into the room; I found there

               <p>I searched the lodgings; by the fireplace in the room where the prosecutor was robbed, I found pieces of two notes (producing them) one piece fits that note; about two o'clock or after, I was sent for by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>To Whitehouse. What notes had you in your pocket that night? - Six Birmingham and one Woolverhampton, and one 5 l. note; I lost them all.</p>
               <p>Had you any account of the dates and numbers of these notes of your own making? - No, I afterwards got the best account I could.</p>
               <p>Who were they made payable to? - Them at the Old Bank were made payable to Story.</p>
               <p>To Meacham. About two or after you was sent for by the prosecutor? - Yes, he said he had another man in custody; I went to the watch-house, found Messenger and searched him; I found an old ragged handkerchief in his pocket, and in the corner of it were tied up three duplicates; one of which was an handkerchief pawned by Messenger that day for two shillings, at the corner of King-street, Drury-lane; by this duplicate I found the handkerchief at Mr. Woodin's; the old handkerchief I forgot, and left at home this afternoon.</p>

               <p>Is that your duplicate? - Yes; I cannot say whether it was Messenger that pledged the handkerchief; the person who received it is since dead; I saw Messenger in the shop that morning; here is the counterpart of the duplicate, which was fixed to the property.</p>
               <p>(The handkerchief was produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>JONES's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>A stranger gave me a shilling, and I took it; and as I was sitting by my own fireside, I heard him say he was robbed; Granger and I went down to Mrs. Murphy, and told I her.</p>

               <p>SMITH's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was sitting by my own fire-side, Jones came up with the gentleman, and asked for a light; we gave her the light; she called Bevington in, and she came out again with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270059"></xptr>some papers, and said they were bank notes; I said I would have nothing to do with them; she said if I would not have something to do with them, she would swear her soul as black as a new shoe against me, and bid me not be afraid to have to do with a robbery.</p>
               <p>GRANGER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming by the place where the robbery was committed; hearing a noise I went up stairs to see what was the matter; the gentleman said he was robbed, and I ran down stairs and told Mrs. Murphy, and desired her to come up, and I went up with her.</p>

               <p>MESSENGER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On the 16th of January, between eleven and twelve at night, the water came in; Mrs. Murphy asked me to fill her water-tub; when I was done she asked me to set down; somebody said the gentleman was robbed, and Mrs. Murphy went up stairs, and desired me to come up; there was a man in Smith's room; I never went up stairs till I went up with Mrs. Murphy; I never was near Whitehouse, I never spoke to him, and never was up stairs but that once; the next morning as I was coming home with a lighted candle; coming down Newtoner's-street, I found the handkerchief, and picked it up and pawned it.</p>

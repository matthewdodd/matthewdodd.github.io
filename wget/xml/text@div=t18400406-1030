                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 112.) On the 13th of March I watched the house of Mrs. Phillips, Southampton-buildings, Chancery-lane, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner Sarah Knight come out of the house with a basket, she came towards me—I stopped her, and asked what she had got—she told me coals which she had been buying—I looked into the basket, and saw a flat iron, and asked where she got that—she said she had borrowed it—I took her back to Mrs. Phillips, and she ran up stairs to Mrs. Phillips, who was in bed at the time—she came down, and then I saw Sarah in the passage with Mrs. Phillips, when they were all three together the prisoners implored for-giveness—Elizabeth asked Mrs. Phillips to look over it, as it was the first offence—Sarah also said, "It is the first time we Have done any thing"—I am quite sure they both begged forgiveness.</p>

She had a basket, and I asked what she was going to do with it; she said to buy coals; and I told her she could take a few.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and Jive at No. 6, Southampton-buildings. The prisoner, Elizabeth Knight, was my servant—Sarah occa<lb></lb>sionlly washed for me, but not recently. On Friday morning, the 13th of March, Sarah ran into my bed-room, and said she had been borrowing a few coals of <hi rend="italic">Betsy,</hi> and the policeman had stopped her—she said she had borrowed an iron also, and implored my forgiveness—I told her she had been robbing me for a considerable time, and she must now take the con<lb></lb>sequences—I followed her into the passage, found the policeman there,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth Knight.</hi> I went to borrow an iron, and not to steal coals; my sister was not up; I lit the kitchen fire, and cleaned a pair of boots; and about eight o'clock she got up.

                  </hi>. I am a bank manager, 1, Lombard Street, City—on 23rd August, at half-past 8 o'clock, I was going along Cheapside—when opposite Bow Church, at the corner of Honey Lane, the prisoner came up to me, snatched my watch and chain, and ran down Honey Lane Passage—I ran after him, shouting "Stop thief!" he outran me and I lost sight of him; I came up to him in Basinghall Street, and charged him—he said "You can't swear to me; I have not got your watch"—I have not the slightest doubt he is the man—I only saw him for a moment—I noticed his height and figure; quite enough to identify him.</p>

I am a licensed victualler, of 4, Castle Court, Lawrence Lane—on the evening of 23rd August, about half-past eight o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Honey Lane Market, talking to a friend, and heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—the prisoner ran past, followed by some persons—I joined in the chase, along with three or four more, until I found him in custody in Basinghall Street—I lost sight of him for a minute or two as he turned the corner of Lawreuce Lane, but I was within half a dozen yards of him, and took up the view of the same man afterwards—there was no <hi rend="italic">row</hi> or fight going on, it was all perfectly quiet—there was not a soul about.</p>

I am a butcher, and live at Mr. Bannister's, 21, Newgate Street—I saw the prisoner in Lawrence Lane, running towards me; there was a cry of "Stop thief!"—he said "Don't stop me, it is only a fight"—I said "It is something more than that"—I threw down my tray and ran after him, and overtook him in Basinghall Street—it was rather dark.</p>

I stood against the tap-room door about a quarter of an hour; I then went out, and one of the young women (who was convicted last Session) followed me - she came up to me, and put her hand into my pocket - the prisoner came up to me in a few minutes, and stood quite close to me: I did not feel my watch go, but I missed it very soon. I pursued the prisoner, and overtook her; before I took her I had seen her extend her hand towards the other; I told her I thought she had taken my watch: I turned round to look for the other, but she had run away - I then gave charge of the prisoner, and as we were coming up Long-acre we met the other, and had her taken into custody - the prisoner was discharged after a second examination.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When she was taken did you not say you was not certain whether she was the woman? A. No, I did not. I was not in liquor.</p>

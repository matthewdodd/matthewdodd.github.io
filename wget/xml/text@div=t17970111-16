             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Pring; I saw captain Waring's saddle on the Saturday that it was taken out on the Sunday, it was upon the wooden horse in the stable, it had stirrups, stirrup leathers, and girths to it, and a saddle-cloth, that was Saturday the 17th of December, I missed it on the Sunday, the next day; I was coming home promiscuously to dinner, between one and two o'clock, and met this man with a saddle upon his back; I called to him, and asked him where he was going with that saddle; he replied, to captain Waring's; I asked him what business he had with that saddle, he being rather confused said, he was going to get two shillings upon it, to pay a person that he owed seven shillings to, and he had but five shillings, and he wanted to make two shillings of this saddle to make it up; upon which I requested the saddle back again, and he readily delivered it into my hands, begging that I would not say any thing to my master concerning it; I replied, I could not forbear telling my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this man before? - A. He lived fellow-servant with me eight months in the same yard, and was discharged that morning; I act as head ostler.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear positively to this saddle? - A. Yes; I am sure it was captain Waring's, I had it always under my care; it was there between three and four months, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any particular marks about it? - A. No further than in the common way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his name upon it? - A. No; there is the sadler's name upon it; and I will swear that to be his saddle.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you speak to the value of this saddle; do you think it is worth thirty-nine shillings? - A. To the best of my knowledge it is.</p>
               <p>Q. The leathers are valued at two shillings, the stirrups at two shillings, and the girths at two shillings; do you think they all worth six shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your master liable to make good the saddles<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110034"></xptr>left by gentlemen? - A. Yes; he has suffered a great deal upon the same occasion before.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Pring.) Do you make yourself liable for saddles and their furniture? - A. Yes; I have been liable for a great many, and for this.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Holland.) What did you do with the saddle? - A. I have it here; it has been in my care ever since. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Sunday morning I was discharged, and I went up to pay one of the men four shillings that I owed him, and I met a gentleman that rode the horse several times while it was at Mr. Pring's, and he asked me if captain Waring's horse was sold; I told him that it was; he asked if the saddle and bridle were there, and I said, yes; and he asked if any man would take the saddle to Bartholomew-close for him, and he would give him half-a-crown; I said I would; and I met the ostler, and he desired me to take it back.</p>

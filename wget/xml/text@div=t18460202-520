A little before ten o'clock on the night of the 9th of Jan., I saw the prisoners in Marylebone-lane—I sup<lb></lb>pose three quarters of a mile from Mr. Rogers'—there was another person with them who is not in custody—I watched them, and saw them go under a public-house window—Wells had the tobacco under his arm—I saw him in the act of opening the bags and showing the other two what was inside—I took Wells—I asked him what he had got—he said tobacco which he had brought from his master, Mr. Rogers, and he was going to take it to No. 25, East-street—I said I would go with him—he said, very well, he was not afraid, it was all right—he went there and asked for a person named Bond—a female came to the door and said her husband was not at home—she appeared very much confused—I asked if she knew anything about the tobacco—she said she knew nothing of it—I said to Wells, "I shall take you to the station"—we had not gone far from the door before he said, "For God's sake don't do</p>

               <p>that, take the tobacco, let me go home to my friends; I know I have done wrong"—I said it was no use talking like that, he must go to the station—I took him there, and he said he would tell me where the other one lived—I went and found Oliver in bed, at No. 10, Clarence-gardens—he said he knew nothing of it, he had been in bed ever since half-past nine o'clock—it was about twenty minutes before ten o'clock when I saw them together.</p>

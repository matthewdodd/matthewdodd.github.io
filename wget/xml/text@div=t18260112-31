            . I am an officer of Bow-street, and know the prisoner. I remember his being brought to Hatton-garden on the day Hunt came to town, charged with stealing some watches; he was afterwards committed to Newgate. I was not here when he was tried, but know him to be the man who was examined at Hatton-garden, on this charge, and he gave his name as Abraham Davis.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HALL re-examined. I took the prisoner into custody at his sister's lodgings, French-alley, in the parish of Christ-church, Spitalfields, Middlesex - he was up stairs, looking out of the window, not in confinement.</p>

            . I am a turnkey of Newgate. and have been so seven years. I was here in September 1819. I do not know the prisoner - we have different departments, and at that time I belonged to the cells, and had nothing to do with the prisoners who were not tried. I did not know Abraham Davis at all. Cole is not here to-day. The prisoner here handed in a written paper, as follows:</p>
               <p>The prisoner most humbly represents, that he was taken into custody by a Mr. Hall, and other officers, and conveyed to Bow-street, at which place he first became acquainted with the nature of the charge against him; and it is to be understood that no fresh charge was advanced against him. The prisoner most humbly submits that the former alleged prosecutor was applied to, who denied any knowledge of his person, and after being closely examined by several other persons, turnkeys of Newgate, Clerkenwell,&amp;c. and other officers of the police, they all declared they had no knowledge of your prisoner. - Davis, however, a discarded turnkey of Newgate, well known as being instrumental in obtaining convictions, basely attempted to swear against him; and whose deposition caused him to be committed, after undergoing no less than seven examinations. No witnesses appeared against your prisoner until the last examination, when they were brought forward at the instigation of Davis, having been promised reward, to be paid out of the 20l. he expects to receive from the county.</p>

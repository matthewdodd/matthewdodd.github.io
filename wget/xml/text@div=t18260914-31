On the 10th of June, about two o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop- one of my men came to attend to him; I had dealt with him before, but always for ready money; he had been a kind of warehouseman in the cutlery way - I dealt with him occasionally seven or eight years ago, but not since - it was always for ready money - I always deal for ready money. On the day in question he came about two o'clock - he had called about three months before with a petition, signed by several cutlers, and I gave him a shilling; I was surprised to see him come in on this day, but he said his father-in-law had taken a public-house for him at Hampstead, and had agreed to give him 1000l. - I knew his father-in-law was able to do so, and felt glad; he said he wanted a dozen small and a dozen large ivory-handled knives with forks and carvers, for a dinner he was going to have that day, on the opening of the house, which, he said was the Cock, at Hampstead; my man packed them up in the usual way - he knew my way of business; I told him repeatedly that he must pay for them when he had them; he made no objection to it; he always dealt with me for ready money. When the knives and forks were packed up he requested a bill; I ordered my man to make one; people often have bills, even if they deal for money; while the man was writing the bill he caught up the knives and forks off the counter, threw me down this forged bill, and ran away; he said it was a banker's acceptance for 19l. 10s. and was a security for me till tomorrow morning, at ten o'clock, when he would come for the bill, and pay the 5l. 2s. for the goods; he ran out with them, and I have not seen him since; he was apprehended this day month; one of my men met him in the street; I had tried all I could to find him before; I would not have parted with these goods to him, or any body, without ready money - I would not have taken this paper as a security; I should not have kept the bill but he ran away and left it behind - they were worth 5l. 2s. (The bill was here put in and read; it was dated London, the 2d of May, 1825,; drawn by G. S. Mappin on

            . I have been in Mr. Thomas' employ about two years.; I attend the shop, and work for him - I am his managing man - he deals for ready money only; he is very infirm, and when a customer comes, he calls me to assist him. On the 10th June the prisoner came to the shop, and wanted knives and forks to open his house with - he said he had company coming to dinner that day, and must make haste; I packed them up - he asked for a bill, and while I was writing it some more gentlemen came in; I was busy talking to them and making the bill out at the same time, at a little desk in the shop, and did not see him go out - but when I turned round to give him the bill, he was gone, and the knives also - master had this bill in his hand; he said he had taken the Cock, public-house, at Hampstead - I went there three or four hours after, and found there was no such a house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did Mr. Thomas say, "He has gone and left the bill?" A. I asked master what he had got, when I had done with the gentlemen, and asked if he had paid - master seemed confused and gave me this bill - I said I thought it was a forgery, as the hand-writing seemed all one; I went to the banker's to inquire - they did not know the party; master then sent me to Hampstead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not stand talking to him with them under my arm for half an hour? A. He was not in the shop a quarter of an hour altogether; I never said master took the bill as security for the knives; I did not hear his conversation with master, as I was busy with the gentlemen - it is a small shop; he might have left the shop ten minutes when I saw the bill; two gentlemen stood before me, I could not see him go out.</p>

            . I am in the first regiment of guards, but have worked for Mr. Thomas ten years, and am in his employ now when in town, and off duty. I was at Windsor when this occurred, but in August, Mr. Thomas told me if I could find Mappin, to take him; I was inquiring for him, and eight or nine weeks ago an account was sent to master, by a lawyer in Greek-street, and I found the prisoner there; I asked him to go with me to Mr. Thomas, he refused; I said, "Will you wait here while I fetch him?" he said he would; I went down to the door, having an officer there, but the prisoner was conveyed out of the house through some other door; I met him in about seven weeks after in the Seven-dials, and took him to Bow-street; I knew he used formerly to bring cutlery to master, which he was paid for directly - master always dealt for ready money; when I took him, I said, "What a foolish fellow you must be in sending this foolish lawyer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140025"></xptr>for money, master would be sure to find you;" he said,"I was in distress, and thought I should raise a trifle of money by it."</p>

            . I am an officer, and went with Smithhunter to Mr. Burnell's, in Greek-street, Soho, with a warrant against the prisoner for this offence - Thomas had given information at the office six or seven weeks ago. I waited outside the house, and sent Smithhunter up to see if he was there - he came down in a few minutes, beckoned to me, and said he was there; I went up and searched all over the place, but could not find him - there is a back door, which he must have gone out at; about three weeks ago Smithhunter brought him to the office.</p>
               <p>COURT to THOMAS. Q. Did he remain in the shop after he threw down the bill? A. Not a minute; he took up the knives with one hand, and threw it down with the other, saying, there was security sufficient till to-morrow morning, when he would bring 5l. 2s., and take back the bill, and out he ran.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you not in Horsemonger-lane? A. Yes, in 1810 - it was a conspiracy against me about an apprentice I had a dispute with, and he charged me with not giving him enough victuals, and indicted me for illtreating him - but plenty of people proved to the contrary, and I proved he had robbed me; I was never charged with felony.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I traded with Thomas when he lived at Stones-end; he owed our concern 12l. 6s. - I called for it, and he said he would pay us in a week; when I called, he had moved; I could not find him till I found him in Oxford-street; he always shuffled the account off; I have sold him odd things since, which he paid me for - I did this with intent to balance the old account with him, which has never been paid; I lost 10,000l. in the concern.</p>
               <p>Mr. THOMAS. I lived at Stones-end twenty years ago.</p>

            . I am an house-agent and collector of debts, and an accountant. I have known the prisoner three or four years, and last April I put him in charge of 500l. worth of furniture; he mentioned to me, when he returned, that Thomas owed him some money, and in July or August, (I do not know which) I sent him a letter, applying for money due to the firm, (as this man informed me) - and stated, if it was not paid, it would be put into a Marshalsea lawyer's hands; this charge was made in consequence of my writing the letter - after I wrote it, Mr. Thomas' attorney called on me, and said Thomas was not in his debt, but Mappin was in his; on the following morning, which was on the 20th of July, I called on Thomas; his attorney was present; I said, I was informed there was money owing him by Mappin; "Yes," he replied,"and if he don't call and pay me, I will get a warrant for him;" in consequence of this, I left Thomas' shop, and in a few days this soldier came, and soon after Mappin came to my door; I have only one room there, as a place of business, but do not live there; the soldier said, "Is your name Mappin;" he said, "Yes," he asked him to go to his master, he said, No - he then asked him to wait till he fetched him - Yes, said he; they both left the room, and what become of the prisoner I do not know; he could not be found when the officer came; it was agreed I should call next morning and meet Mr. Thomas, and I did so, in the presence of an officer; Wardropper said, "I acknowledge Mr. Thomas told me he had received a bill of exchange for goods we sold Mappin;" Thomas said, in answer, "No, I said no such thing, I only said I would let him have the goods till to-morrow morning at twelve o'clock, when he was to call and pay me;" I took down, in this book, what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. You took that book with you to put down what Thomas said? A. Yes; I did not keep a copy of the letter I wrote, and do not know the date of it; I cannot say when it was.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DUKE. I remember this witness being at Thomas'. Thomas said nothing about getting a warrant for if Mappin did not call and pay.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BURNELL. This witness was not present at the conversation.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DUKE. He told me he had never been to Thomas' before.</p>
               <p>Mr. THOMAS. I told Burnell nothing of the kind. I had the warrant before that, and wanted to find the man out; I received the letter long after the robbery; I do not owe him a farthing; this witness gave his direction, No. 6, Clerkenwell-close, and there is no such person there.</p>

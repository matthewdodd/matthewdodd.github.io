On the 7th of March I took him to a house in Kent-street, to measure for lead to re-place a gutter - he gave me the measure as fourteen feet by two feet. On the 9th I sent him to Mr. Humpleby's, in the Borough, for that quantity of lead - I received information when I came home in the evening; in consequence of which I would not set him at work next day. On the 11th I took him to Mr. Humpleby's, and from there we went to the house; I had the lead taken up and re-weighed - I do not know the weight.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Hatton, and was with Stallard when he laid the gutter down - he sent me down to make the fire up, and when I came up he was cutting some of the lead off; I said,</p>
               <p>"Did not master tell you to take the exact measure of the gutter?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes;" I said,</p>
               <p>"What will he say if he knows you have cut it off?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Master, has no occasion to know, unless you tell him." After that he cut off a strip of lead the whole length of the gutter; there was enough left to fit the gutter. He put the strip into his tool basket - there was about 22 lbs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate of the conversation about telling your master? A. Yes.</p>

On the evening of the 9th of March, when the prisoner returned from work, he delivered me the tools, and a small piece of new lead, and went up stairs; I went into the shop, kicked against his basket, and finding it very heavy I looked into it, and found a coil of new lead; it weighed about 20 lbs. He came down, and went out with the basket and lead.</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutor. On the 11th of March I was at Mr. Humpleby's, and heard the prosecutor ask the prisoner what had become of a coil of lead which had been seen in his basket - he declared that he had none whatever in his basket, and that he had not cut any off the width; I went with them to the house, and measured it - it was one foot nine inches, as near as I could measure; he said the deficiency was caused by his hammering it down to the shape. The prosecutor went for his cart, intending to have it taken up and weighed, and as soon as he was gone the prisoner went away; I could not detain him - I followed, and had him apprehended. The lead weighed 96 1/2 lbs.; it was 22 1/2 lbs. short.</p>

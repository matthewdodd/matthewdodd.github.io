               <p>Q. Did you send him to London with any hay? - A. I sent him to Smithfield market on the 3d of March; he had no commission to sell it at all, he was to take it to the salesman; when he returned, he said he sold the hay at Tottenham; he did not know the man's name he sold it to; I asked him where he unloaded, he said <placeName id="t18040411-76-crimeloc455">the Ship at Tottenham</placeName>

He gave me four pounds twelve shillings, and said I would not cheat you for the world, master; I found he had sold the hay to Mr. Needham, at Tottenham, for five pounds; I went and took him up the next day; he confessed the whole of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise him any thing? - A. I told him I would punish him; he said he would work it out.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You allow him the market shilling? - A. He took care to deduct that; I gave him sixpence to spend besides what they make, and his day's work.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the price of hay at that time? - A. It depends upon the quality; I was not at market on that day.</p>

In the shop there is but one drawer kept locked, in which I generally keep small valuable articles, and which had been wrenched from the bench; about this time they brought the prisoner to ask if I knew him; I found the watchman pushing up his face forcibly for me to see it; I called him inadvertently by a wrong name, but finding I knew him, he went down upon his knees, and begged I would forgive him; I would not hear him, but ordered them to carry him to the watch-house; he had been in my service five or six months, and had quitted it about a month or five weeks; he knew the house near as well as I did; I cannot swear positively he is the man that first passed me, but I believe he is; the boy, who slept there, will stare how the house was shut up; they must have got in at an aperture to the cellar, to which there is only a slap; we placed our confidence in a strong door at the top of the cellar stairs, which they had opened with a crow, of which I saw the marks; and the strong staples fixed in the wood were drawn out; that door gave them the power of the whole house; I searched the the prisoner's lodgings the next day, but found nothing of our's; his wife attended us, and shewed us every part of the rooms with the greatest readiness, and I believe knew nothing of the matter.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: About a quarter before one, a gentleman came to me with a drawn bayonet, and told me his house was broke open, and wished me to go along with him; we went up the court towards his cellar window, where there stood a lusty man in a light-coloured great coat; the gentleman stopped, and asked him where he had been; he said, up the court; he asked him what he had been doing; he said, it was nothing to him. Mr. Troughton desired him to stop, and was going to take hold of him, but he rushed from him, and struck him in the face; I made a blow at him, but missed him, and then I sprung my rattle; the prisoner is not the man who first came down the court; I pursued the first man, and as we went down to the gate, two other men came upon the back of us, but I did not see where they came from; they must have been in the court before us, as it is no thoroughfare; those men and Mr. Troughton had a sort of skirmish together by the gate, but they forced it open, and run away; I pursued them, and was told one of them had run up Wine-Office-court; we went up, and, after looking about some time, a gentleman got up, and looked over a gate into a garden or yard, and there was the prisoner stuck up in a corner close to the wall. I laid hold of him, but cannot say whether he is one of the three; I am sure he is not the first man; when we took him, he desired us to let him stop to look for one of his stockings that he had lost; I then observed he was without a shoe and stocking; I found one of his shoes in Wine-Office-court; we then took him to Mr. Troughton, who said, how came you to use me so? and the prisoner directly put his hands together, and asked for pardon, saying, he would never be guilty of the like again; then he was taken to the watch-house.</p>

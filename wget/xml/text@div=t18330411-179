I gave him a box of butter, which he carried to the salesman safe - he came back to the cart, and I gave him a flat of butter to take to the same place; I was in the cart at the time - I went to Mr. Fuller, the salesman, for our pitching money; I found the flat had not been delivered - I saw the prisoner coming down Rose-street, in custody, and afterwards saw the flat in Mr. Fuller's possession.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On Saturday morning, the 6th of March, at twenty minutes after six o'clock, I saw the prisoner going along Paternoster-row, with a flat of butter on his back - I asked where he was going to take it to; he said he was going to take it to a cart in St. Paul's church-yard - it was directed to Mr. Fuller, Newgate-market; I followed him towards St. Paul's church-yard - instead of going in there, he turned down Creed-lane; I then took him to Fuller's, who said it had not been delivered to him - I left it there, and took the prisoner to the Compter; and in Rose-street, we met the pro<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110098"></xptr>secutor, who said, "You stole the flat of butter;" he made no answer - It contained 40 lbs. of butter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that Slade had told him he could not pay him any thing for his trouble - in consequence of which he strayed into St. Paul's church-yard, intending shortly to return with the butter.</p>

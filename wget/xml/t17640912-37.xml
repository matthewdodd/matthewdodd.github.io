            . On the 5th of August, I and another person took a walk to Lambeth, it being Sunday: in returning home, my fellow-traveller was a little in liquor; I stopped to make water at the foot of Westminster Bridge; he went on, and I lost him: then I thought to take a coach home; the prisoner came to me and said, Pray, where do you want to go? I said, to Red-lion-street, Holborn: he said, I'll get a coach for you: I said, no; I could do that myself: then he said he would lay hold of my arm; I went with him till we came to <placeName id="t17640912-37-crimeloc211">King's-street, New Guildhall, Westminster</placeName>

               <p>Last Sunday five weeks. I was at Lambeth; coming over the bridge, a little after seven o'clock, I saw this gentleman walking; he could not walk of himself; a man that had hold of him let him go; he put his head on his elbow, and his elbow on the bridge; said he, may I put my hand to yours, till I get a coach? I said. there is no coach. I led him by the arm about sixty yards, to the corner of Bridge-street, at the china-shop; I went about a dozen yards from him; the man was falling, he could not stand: there came a chairman running up, (as they will, when they see a man in liquor). I said, you may as well have a chair, for the coaches are all gone: he put his hand in his pocket to pay the chairman; he was so eager, said he, soldier, I have lost my watch; I believe you have it: I said, no; you cannot say so; I have not been in your company but about sixty yards, and I have not drank with you; and fearing I should get into trouble with my officer, I ran away; I gave him a push on the breast, and ran cross the street: he called, Stop thief; I went into Peter-street; the mob gathered about me; I said, I would go with the constable: he was so drunk, he said the man ran away; but could make neither head nor tail of the story; he could not say any one thing in life to Justice Manley.</p>

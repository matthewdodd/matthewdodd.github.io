                  </hi>. I am a tin-smith and gas-fitter, and live at No. 1, Martin's-place, Kentish-town. The prisoner was in my employ for three days—yesterday morning, the 18th of Dec., about half-past eight o'clock, just before the prisoner was going out, I missed 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the parlour mantel-shelf—the prisoner returned, and went into the back workshop—I then marked a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, laid it on the counter, and put a book over it—I then ordered the prisoner to sweep out the shop and dust the counter,</p>

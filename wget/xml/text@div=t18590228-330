I live with my mother at 16, St. Ann-street—she keeps a general shop—I manage the business for her as she is a widow and an invalid—on Saturday night, 29th January, I closed the house all safe at half-past 12 o'clock, and went to bed—I came down at a quarter-past 7 in the morning, unlocked the parlour-door, and found the window-shutters a little open and unfastened—the socket of the bolt was off, and two squares were broken in the window—the till was on the floor, and the coppers were missing, sixpenny worth of coppers and two twopenny-pieces, which were there when I went to bed—I also missed this parcel of coffee, and this jar of tobacco (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are my mother's—the twopenny-pieces resembled these, but I did not take much notice of them—I (did not handle them to notice them—there was a mark upon them, but I do not know what it was.</p>

I am single, and live at 67, Orchard-street, West<lb></lb>minster—on Sunday morning, 14th January, I was in Orchard-street, going home, and saw three <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> go down Orchard-street—I spoke to one of them, and asked him for a match—he had a brown paper parcel on his right arm, the other man had nothing—it was about a quarter-past 4 o'clock—the prisoner is the man I spoke to—I had seen him several times before, standing outside the White Horse, but had never spoken to him—I was acquainted with his appearance—I spoke to a constable, and afterwards went to the station-house—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the parcel, I can swear to it—it was done up in the same way as this—it was moon-light i—this was just by New Square, which leads into Orchard-street—it was only seven or eight doors from Mrs. Linstead's shop.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, A</hi> 285). On Sunday morning, 30th January, I was on duty in Orchard-street, and about 3 o'clock saw the prisoner standing at the opposite corner to Mrs. Linstead's shop with the girl he cohabits with, and a number of others—I spoke to him, and he said, "All right, I am going off"—they all live in the neighbourhood, first in one lodging-house and then in another—about half-past 4 o'clock I saw him come out of New-square—they had put the gas out near Mrs. Linstead's shop—the lamp aver the square was the only one alight, and by that light I saw them come out of the square—the prisoner had this parcel under his left arm, or one like it, and the other man had the jar in his right hand—they either saw or heard me, for they went back—I found the door of No. 3 ajar, went in, and at the back of No. 2 I found these two parcels—he went by No. 3 in the front—No. 1, 2, and 3 adjoin, and form the rear of those houses—any person can escape from George-court over the washhouse—No. 8 was wide open—I turned my light on and saw foot-marks on the stairs—I went up to the top and found the prisoner up there, coiled up, pretending to be asleep; but I bad seen him with the parcel fire minutes previously—I asked him where his mate was, he said that he knew nothing of any mate—I told him that if I showed him the parcel and the jar that would enlighten him, and showed them to him—he said, "Oh, it is all foreign to me"—I have not found the other man, it was very wet, and I could not trace him—going to the station the prisoner had his hand in his pocket—I took hold of it and found in it these twopenny-pieces, four pence, and eight half-pence—No. 2 was fast back and front—the three back yards join—there is a closet at the other end which has small battens into the wall, where there are marks of persons getting over—I found the parcels at No. 2, and put them into No. 57, Orchard-street—left them in charge of the girl, and then went and found the prisoner at No. 8—the girl did not speak to me first, but another constable told me something who had seen her—I then sent her back to fetch him, and then left the parcels in her charge at No. 57, and left a constable with her in charge of the prisoner—the first house I went into after seeing the parcels was No. 8.</p>

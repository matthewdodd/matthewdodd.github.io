                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 221, New Kent Road—on the morning of 22nd August, I was called to Eliza Raven—her arm appeared to be burnt with gunpowder, from the elbow to the back of the hand—I should say that the marks were done by coarse gunpowder—I do not think it could have been caused by anything else—at first, it appeared that there might have been shot, but afterwards it appeared to be only coarse gunpowder—I examined the sister; she was injured just under her chin, and there were a few spots on her face, not burnt, but having the appearance of shot—I think it is possible that coarse gunpowder would inflict the injury—the girls were not seriously injured.</p>

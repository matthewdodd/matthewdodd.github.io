On the 28th of September a person, whom I believe to be the prisoner, came to the shop, represented herself to be a lady's maid, and said she had recommended them to me; she requested I would send bonnets for three persons.

She came up again, and said the housekeeper was there - She took them from me. I said I did not like to leave them without the money. She said she would go down and hear what they said. She came up again, and said, "You are to go and fetch the bill, and bring two mourning caps." I went back, and returned to the kitchen with the bill. They said they knew nothing about it; but that a woman had left some bonnets. I could neither get the bonnets nor money. I never saw the prisoner again till I saw her at the office.</p>
               <p>ANN ODELL. I am cook to Mr. Astley Cooper, who lives in Spring-gardens. The prisoner had no situation in my master's establishment, not was she sent out by any of the servants to buy any thing. A woman, whom I believe to be the prisoner, came to our house on the 5th of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and asked for a name that I did not know. She returned in a few minutes with some bonnets, and asked me if she might leave them until she returned from Finsbury-square. She said she came from Brompton. She left them. I went out, returned in a few minutes, and they were gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg for mercy.</p>

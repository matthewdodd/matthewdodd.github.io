                  </hi>. I am a grocer and postmaster, and live at 10, Murray Street, St. Pancras—on the night of 5th May last, about 11.30, I went to bed, after seeing that the place was thoroughly secured—about 2.50 in the morning, I was awoke by a noise in my bed room, and saw the prisoner standing close by my bedside—he remained perfectly still—I called out, "Who's there?" and sprang from the bed and seized hold of him—I struggled with him into a back room—he had a knife in his hand—it was too dark to see; but I felt it across my left hand—I was cut in several places on the hands, and had two scratches down the neck, and a cut on the cheek; they were quite skin wounds—I had several small cuts on the hand, one rather deep—I got the knife from him, and threw him down, and his head came on the hearthstone, and I took him by the hair, and hit his head on the hearthstone several times—he then turned on all fours, to try and get wind—I pulled him on his side, and gave him some blows in the wind and the side of the head—I used him roughly, and at last disabled him—I called "Murder!" as soon as I got the knife from him—I did not see the prisoner, till the policeman came up with a lantern; but I still held him in my hands—I afterwards found that two coats had been removed from the pegs in the hall, down stairs—the noise that awoke me was made by his removing a box of studs off my drawers—I examined the house, and found that an entry had been effected by pushing back the catch of the back kitchen window.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Exeter-street, Chelsea, and keep a beer shop. On 26th Oct., about half past 7 o'clock, I received a bad half crown from Williams, and gave it to the constable—my house is thirty or forty yards from Mr. Nightingale's. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>

                  </hi>. This crown, and these two half crowns, are counterfeit.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows</hi>): I was not in Knightsbridge at all on Wednesday evening, and when the boy came and asked me to go to his mistress I went with him, and she said it was not a good half crown; I said I would give her another half crown for it, and put down another half crown, and she said it was not me, and she would not take it; and I went back to the public house again where I was fetched from, and his master came to me in the public house, and I came out with him, and saw policeman 75 B, and told him to come with me; that made the second time, and I was called back, and they said again it was not me before the police constable, and then I went away; I had a Hack dress coat on that night; all the other things were the same as I now have on; the 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-piece I changed at Mr. Nightingale's I got <hi rend="italic">of</hi> my mother, and the reason I went there was to play a game with Thomas Lloyd, who lodges there.</p>

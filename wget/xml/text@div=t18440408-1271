                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter.</hi>) I live in Lower James-street, Golden-square—the prisoner has been in the habit of coming to me to beg for money—about a quarter before two o'clock on the 1st of April I had a gold watch, a chain, and key on the chimney-piece in the room—the prisoner came and begged for a pair of trowsers and a waistcoat—I went to my bed-room to fetch them, and left him is the parlour alone—I came back in about half a minute and found him close to the chimney—I gave him the trowsers and the waistcoat, and he went away—when I dressed I went to the chimney-piece and my watch was gone—there had been no one else there, and I saw the watch safe about five minutes before he came.</p>

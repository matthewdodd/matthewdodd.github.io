                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at No. 13, Chappie-street, May-fair. This happened on the 24th of January—I only know that I missed this beef, and then the prisoner was brought in—there are 43 1/2 lbs.—it was on the front board of the shop—it was in doors, but the shutters being down, it was exposed, though not outside.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a photographic artist and an actor, living at 32, Chapel-place, Grovsenor-place—I have known Mason for some years, and have acted with him once or twice—in November last I became acquainted with Hooper—I knew him by the name of Stuart—I became acquainted with Bradshaw, I think, in the beginning of this year; I knew him by the name of "Hamilton"—I became acquainted with Hooper by seeing him in a cafe' in Pimlico; Mason and I were there—during the present year the three prisoners and myself have been together once or twice—once at the Trevor-Music Hall, Knightsbridge, and once at the "Windsor Castle "Tavern, near the Victoria Station—we were there on Thursday, 26th or 27th March—Mason and myself were there, and I think the other two came in afterwards—Mason was playing at billiards, and I was scoring—while I was so doing both Bradshaw and Hooper came up to me—one of them spoke; I do not remember which it was, and mentioned that Mason had asked them to present a cheque for payment, at the Union Bank I think it was—I told them they had better not have anything to do with it—something to that effect; nothing else was said then—when Mason had finished playing at billiards they went out, and I followed them, and they went up Shaftesbury crescent—at that time I was walking with one of them, I do not know which, and Mason was walking with the other in advance—the three of them had some conversation about some cheques, and Mason produced some—I heard the conversation, but what it was I do not re<lb></lb>member—I won't be certain as to the number of cheques, but they were in blank, with the names signed—Mason said, but I am not certain whether it was then, or at a later time, that he had gone round to the Directors to get their signatures, as they hardly ever knew what the cheques were for; and then there was some conversation about their being filled in, and it was arranged that Hooper should fill it in—lie was asked, I believe, by one of them, and he consented—I do not remember what was said, or who said it—at that time the other cheques were burnt; they were passed round to see whose signature they thought the best—this was in the street, about the corner of Tothill-fields Prison, I should think it about half-past seven; there was a gas-lamp there—two, I think, of the cheques were burned at the gas-lamp—Mason climbed up the lamp—there was one or two left, I won't be certain—after this conversation we all four went to the door of 23, Gloucester-terrace, Vauxhall-road, which is a coffee-house—Hooper and Mason went in, and Bradshaw and I remained outside a few minutes, and Mason came out, and called us—we then went into the coffee-house, and joined Hooper—we all four had some coffee—Mason said Hooper was frightened to fill it in—I was asked to fill it in, and I refused; I am not certain which it was who asked me; it was Hooper or Mason, I am not certain—then Bradshaw sat down to the table, and had some coffee—there was a pen and ink there; so there was when I went in—I did not see Bradshaw writing, because I had my back to him most of the time—I saw a pen in his hand—I am not certain whether after that I saw the cheque or not; I might have seen it, but I do not think I did—Bradshaw said that as he had filled it in, be should not cash it—it had been arranged before that he should cash it—that was said before we went into the coffee-shop</p>

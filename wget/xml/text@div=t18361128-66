                  </hi>. I live in Pleasant-place, King's-cross, with my father. This buckle was given to me—the cape and cuffs belong to my mother—the prisoner was a servant in the family—she left my mother's service about the 1st of August—I had missed the buckle a month or two before from my drawer.</p>

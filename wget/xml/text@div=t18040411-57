As I was taking him towards the Police-office, I met one of the Police-officers, and I gave him in charge.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer in the Thames Police: On Monday, the 5th of March, in the forenoon, I had charge of the prisoner by the prosecutor at the top of Anchor and Hope-alley, in St. George's in the East; he was charged with stealing this pea-jacket; I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the jacket when you took him? - A. On the prosecutor's arms. (The jacket produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When he took me, he asked me where I was going with the jacket; I told him I was going to No. 101, Wapping, to get one made like it; I was going along Wapping-wall, and met this crimp and another man; I was going up to the India-house to go on board the Lady Burgess; the man gave me the jacket to carry, so I was going along, and this man came running after me, and said it was his jacket; I said, how can it be your jacket, when a man gave it me to carry? I said, come along, and I will prove it to you. So he took me along, and we met this man, and he carried me to the Police-office.</p>
               <p>Blaney. Before I took him to the Office, I took him back to the shop.</p>

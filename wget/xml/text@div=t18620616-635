               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Why? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Through your ill treatment; you threatened to run me through with a knife—I did not leave you to cohabit with another man, a carpenter, at that time—I was with him till last March—after I left him, I asked you for some money, and you said you would see me b—first—I did not intend to take money from you—you treated me very badly in Scotland; you kicked me in the chest, and I had to go to London to see a physician—I knew before I left, that your first wife was living—I did not bring these proceedings forward before, because I could not find her—I did not know that you were married at the time I married you; you told me you had lived with a woman, but she was dead—you came to me in the name of William Cooper, and said that you were a single man.</p>

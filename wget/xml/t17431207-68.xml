            . I appointed the Prisoner to come to me again at two o'Clock; the Moment he was gone I went to my Brother at the East India House, and acquainted him with it; he told me it must needs be a Forgery; when I came Home I sent for a Constable, and ordered my Man to be in the Way; soon after the Man knocked at the Door, I bid him come into the Parlour; said I, Do you come about the Bill of Exchange you brought in the Morning ? He said, Yes, Sir; said I, This Bill of Exchange is endorsed Blank, and it is usual for the Person who receives the Money to testify it to be the Hand of the last Endorser, and desired him to witness it, to prove that it was the Writing of

             ; when he had witnessed it, I told him I had a strong Suspicion that it was not a fair Thing, and insisted that he should go before Sir Edward Bellamy; Sir Edward interrogated him, who he was, what he was, and where he came from; then instead of saying he came from Mr. Laurent at Richmond, as he had told me, he said the Bill was given him by a Gentleman in the Street, who bid him carry it to my House, and bring the Money to him at Tom's Coffee-House, whether he meant Tom's Coffee-House in Cornhill, or any other Coffee-House, I cannot tell: This Contradiction put Sir Edward upon asking many other Questions; he asked him, whether he could produce any Body to his Character; he said, no Body knew him in the City; Sir Edward told him the Presumption was strong against him, and he must be obliged to commit him; then he fell down upon his Knees, begged very hard to be discharged, and desired to speak with me alone; then he told me, if I would intercede for him, he would confess all; I told him, as I was before a Magistrate, that I did not know whether my Intercession might prevail; he confessed the Whole to me, and afterwards to Sir Edward; I believed he repeated it six Times over - He confessed the counterfeiting the Bill of Exchange, the Letter of Advice, and the Letter from Mr.

               <p>Mr. Muylman . After he had confessed, he begged he might not be committed; but when he saw his Commitment was making out, he said, What a sad thing will this be for my Wife, who has not a Farthing in the World. I put my Hand in my Pocket, and gave him a piece of money (I speak it to show that by this I found he could write.) Sir, said he, I don't care what becomes of me ; I desire you would send this to my Wife. I desired he would give me a Direction where I should send it: He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174312070034"></xptr> took the Letter, and wrote upon the Back of it with a Pencil, as good a Hand as need to be wrote. I pressed him very strongly (as there was so great a Difference between the two Writings ) to let me know who was concerned with him; and I said I was informed there was somebody concerned with him; he said, he was the only Person who forged the Letters and the Bill; and he would not let other People suffer for the sake of his Life.</p>

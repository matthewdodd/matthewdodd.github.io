               <p>On Thursday the 24th of August I was robbed about a quarter after eight in the evening between the five and six mile stone on the <placeName id="t17860830-37-crimeloc206">Edgware-road</placeName>

               <p>Did any of them offer any violence to any of the parties in the coach? - No.</p>
               <p>It was then dusk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you light enough to know any of these persons? - Not positively; I think I could tell Batt's person very well; I think he was the man that first passed the coach; I took notice of his size and his air; I did not see his face, but as to his person I think I could be positive; the man on my side had a handkerchief over the lower part of his face, so that I cannot know him for certainty, and the other I did not see that was the other side of the coach.</p>
               <p>Was your watch ever found again? - Yes, the next day; a gentleman overtook us at Kilburn turnpike, that was Mr. Drake, the foreman of the grand jury; he asked us if we had been robbed; he took our description and went to Bow-street; and in consequence of that the watch was brought the Saturday morning; I did not see the watch till the next morning; it was then in the possession of Sayre; they sent to Mr. Robins and me, but we were both of us out; the three prisoners were then in custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Prisoner Batt's Counsel. If I understand you right, you know nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300082"></xptr> of Batt but by the size of his person? - No.</p>
               <p>Is not he a common size man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The person you suppose to be Batt, did not use any ill language? - No, he did not speak to us at all, and whether he had a pistol or not, I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Court. I need not trouble you to go through all the circumstances of the robbery, but do you know the persons of these men? - I cannot be positive to any one of them, but I believe the furthermost man; that is Woolford, is the man that was on my side; it was rather a cloudy night and rained; I had not sufficient sight of him to swear positively to his person; I lost about ten shillings, but I lost no watch; only a pocket book; that was not found; I lost nothing that had been found that is capable of being identified; I desired the man that had been in the coach some few minutes, to put up his pistol, which he did.</p>
               <p>Then there was no particular sort of incivility or violence? - No violence or oaths, he put his hands in our pockets.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. It was half past eight, and cloudy and dark at this time of the year? - Yes.</p>

            's, when I was there; I do not know the servant's name; he is not here.</p>
               <p>In consequence of that information what did you do? - Macmanus, myself, Sayre and Carpmeal went to the pawnbroker's in Holborn, and took these prisoners in custody.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - It was between ten and eleven on the Friday, we put them in a coach, and took them to Sir Sampson's; I cannot speak to the property that Sayre found; I searched Batt, and I found a silver watch; I searched White, and I found this metal watch upon him, and this purse and seal, and this ribbon.</p>
               <p>What watch is it, a gold watch, or a metal one? - It is a silver gilt one I think.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoners say any thing material on their examination? - Yes, Batt did.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He owned to the robbery.</p>
               <p>Was any promise made to them of favour, if they told the truth? - No, my Lord, none at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Batt. Yes, there was, my Lord, by the clerk.</p>
               <p>Was Lucas present? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Who was present? - Nobody but me and him; I was very much in liquor, I did not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Court to Lucas. Was this man in liquor when he was examined? - He did not appear to be in liquor; after he had been examined before Sir Sampson, and had confessed the robberies, he was alone with the clerk.</p>
               <p>Was he alone with the clerk before that? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Was what he confessed, reduced into writing? - Yes, it was, I witnessed it, and I believe I saw him sign it.</p>
               <p>Endeavour to recollect yourself, whether any thing was said by any person to induce him to make this confession? - No, Sir, there was not.</p>
               <p>The confession handed up to the Court.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at that, is that your handwriting? - Yes, it is; I saw the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178608300083"></xptr> and the magistrate sign it; it was made apparently to me without any condition.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt. Was you standing by Batt, close to him the whole time? - Yes, I was close to him all the time.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body speak to him during the time? - Upon my word I did not.</p>

               <p>Can you take upon yourself clearly to recollect that? - Yes; the watches do not belong to these people.</p>

               <p>Are you sure of that? - I am; and this duplicate was found in the waistcoat pocket of White; I believe it is a duplicate of a gown.</p>

               <p>On Friday last in the forenoon, there came information to Bow-street; I apprehended the prisoners, and searched the prisoner Woolford; I found upon him this watch, a metal watch, and tortoiseshell case; this purse, a dollar, a crooked shilling, and ten-pence all but a farthing; I did not search any of the other prisoners; we took Batt in a coach, and he shewed us the lodgings of White.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know from White, that that was his lodgings? - No, I believe the landlord is here that let him them; there we found his pistol, and these eight balls upon the top of the bed; nothing else that is mentioned in this indictment.</p>
               <p>Were you present at the whole of Batt's examination? - At part of it, not the whole.</p>

discovery? - I cannot say.</p>

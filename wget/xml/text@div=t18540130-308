                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner</hi>). I am a tailor—I have been com<lb></lb>mitted for safe custody as a witness, and now come out of the gaol of Newgate. On 12th Oct. last, I was living at the house of the prisoner, Mary Chapman, and had been lodging there about three months—I knew an old man named John Reader, who lodged in the upper part of that house—I know Mr. Pidcock, a solicitor, who has an office in Woolwich—I went there with the prisoners on 12th Oct., in the afternoon; I do not know at what time—Mrs. Chapman took a paper with her—we saw Mr. Pidcock, and the paper that Mrs. Chapman took was shown to him; he disapproved of it, and drew out another will—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the paper which Mr. Pidcock drew; I see my handwriting at the bottom of it—he gave it to Mrs. Chapman, and he marked in pencil where the witnesses were to sign their names and places of residence, and also a mark where, the now deceased man had to put his mark—we then left Mr. Pidcock's office—we went across the churchyard—it was very dark and wet, and we went into the tap room of the Mitre—a waiter was there when we went in, nobody else—he left the room, after bringing in half a pint of rum—Mrs. Chapman ordered that; it was drank, another half pint of rum was then called for, which was also drank—the waiter left us the room to our<lb></lb>selves—there was then nobody in the room but Mrs. Chapman, Higgins, and myself, and Mrs. Chapman's little son, who is about thirteen years old—I was warming myself at the fire, as it was cold and wet, when a pen and ink was brought into the tap room, but I did not see who brought it in, and Mrs. Chapman said to the prisoner, Higgins, "We may as well save a little time, as the evening is wet, the will has to go back again to night, we may as well mark our names and places of residence"—Higgins marked his name and place of residence, and I did so also—that is Higgins's name and address, which he wrote in my presence, and this is mine (<hi rend="italic">looking at the paper</hi>)—after I had signed my name, I went to the fire to dry and warm myself—the table was, I suppose, about three or four feet from the fire—we were all standing up at the time; Higgins's back was to me—I could not see what he was doing—Mrs. Chapman said, "As there is nobody here but ourselves, you may as well put a mark to it, and get it done at once"—she said that to Higgins—he made no answer—I did not actually see him put the mark, because I was at the fire, but he brought the paper over to the fire and dried it—my writing was thick, and wanted a little drying—I did not look to see whether a mark was there—I saw him with the pen in his hand; not after Mrs. Chapman said, "We may as well get it done at once," but previous to that; when he wrote his own name—I saw nothing done after she made that observation—I did not go to the table afterwards; I remained still at the fire drying myself—the last I saw of the paper it was with Higgins—we then went to the bar, and had a quartern of rum there, which Higgins and I drank; Mrs. Chapman drank none of it—she paid for it all—we then proceeded to Mrs. Chapman's house—we went up stairs into Reader's room, where he lay</p>

               <p>sick in bed; it was the back garret—he was in a very weakly state; speechless—the paper that was brought from the public house was placed before him, and a pen was put into his hand by Mrs. Chapman—I could not swear whether there was any ink in the pen or not; I did not see her put it into any ink bottle—she drew the pen across the paper and said, "There, now, he has made his mark, and you will tell no lies about it," she had Reader's hand in hers, and drew it across the paper; I then saw the cross that appears here—I did not observe whether it was wet or dry—I saw no blotting paper used, or any attempt to dry it at that time—Reader did not appear to be in a state to know anybody, or to know what he was doing—the paper was not read over at all at that time; that paper was never read over in his hearing—Reader died the next morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why is it you think he could not see it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If he could have seen he would have made his mark at the bottom—no one had hold of his arm when he dropped the pen—Higgins took hold of his wrist, to put the pen in his fist, and when he took his hand away his hand dropped—he was sitting up in the bed when the paper was read by Higgins—they lifted him up—he did not show any sign of understanding what was being done—when I say the paper moved through his fingers, I mean he moved it so (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—he held it in one hand—that is what I mean by saying he moved it as if he was reading it—he seemed to he looking at it—Higgins put the spectacles upon him—Reader put the will down, and then put up his hand and took the spectacles off, and laid them down—he then lifted up the will again, and seemed to fee looking at it, and reading it without spectacles—he kept it in his hand a little longer than he did at first when he had the spectacles, but he seemed to get in a weakly state, and would have creased the paper against his breast—the 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I have received from Mr. Ashcombe has been at different times—he was the very first person to whom I told this story—I afterwards told it to Mr. Pidcock—I went voluntarily—I was in Maidstone gaol two months for attempting to destroy myself—I was greatly troubled in my home; I got drunk on account of it, and while I was so, I got some poison, and was going to take it.</p>

               <p>from the representations of the parish surgeon—I saw Reader there in bed—he was perfectly unconscious—I saw Mrs. Chapman, and asked her to allow me to look at a savings bank book that she had—she refused to show it me—she told me that she had it in her possession—I am a director of the savings' bank—I told her, if she allowed me to see the book, I would take care that when the relatives came forward for the money they should have it—I said I should have Reader removed to the union house, that he might be taken proper care of—she said he was taken great care of there, and there was no occasion for it—I sent the beadle next day, to see if the man had recovered at all, with the intention of removing him—I afterwards discovered Reader's daughter, Mrs. Harris.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at Woolwich; I am surgeon to the parish of Woolwich, and to the union, I was desired by the parochial authorities to attend John Reader—I first saw him on 7th Oct. last—he was then in a comatose state—I attended him to the time of his death—he never rallied in my presence—I saw him every day—he never appeared to recognise me in any way, or to be conscious of anything that was going on around him—he never spoke—I saw him on the 12th, near upon 1 o'clock; he was then in a worse state, he was rapidly sinking—he showed no appearance of consciousness whatever—he had paralysis of the soft palate, what we term <hi rend="italic">stertor—stertor</hi> indicates difficult or loud breathing—it is a symptom of approaching death—it indicates pressure on the brain—I noticed his eyes; from the commencement the pupils were contracted—they did not dilate at all; they appeared in about the same state on the 12th—that indicated pressure on the optic nerve, and very great pressure on the brain—he died on the 13th—I saw him on the 13th during life; it must have been in the forenoon—he was still in the same state, sinking rapidly—I understand he died in the afternoon—I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the vessels of the brain were greatly congested—there was effusion, the lungs were congested, and charged with carbon,</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the producing cause of that which you call paralysis of the soft palate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The palate being supplied with nerves, and he having paralysis of those nerves, of course paralysis of the muscles is supplied by that—those nerves ramify across the palate generally—stertor is difficulty of breathing arising from the soft palate—we generally find when persons are ill that they are worse in the evening—he was sinking when I was there on the 12th—I think I looked in there on the 12th, about half past 12 or 1 o'clock, and I dare say I left a little after I; I cannot speak positively some cases a person may be deprived of speech, and yet</p>

I was living at Mrs. Chapman's at the time John Reader died—I saw him on the day before he died—I first saw him about 9 o'clock in the morning—he was insensible; he had his mouth turned light on one side, and he had no use of it whatever, and no recollection whatever—nobody was there then—I went and knelt down by his bedside, and touched him on the cheek with my fingers, and spoke to him, but he took no notice <hi rend="italic">whatsumever</hi>—nothing more passed while I was there, at 9 o'clock—I than came down stairs—after that I remember seeing a man named Huxford in the house—I think it was between 10 and 11 o'clock—after Huxford had come down, I went up into Reader's room—I found Mrs. Chapman there, the man Davis, and two other men with them—Fitzpatrick was there, and Higgins—when I went into the room, Mrs. Chapman said, to me, "John, he has signed the will"—I told her it was a He—they wanted to read the will to me, but I went right straight away to the man's bedside, knelt down, and touched him: the same as I did before—he had got no sense <hi rend="italic">whatsumever</hi>, no knowledge of any one—he took no notice spoke to him several times—Higgins was in the room at the time—he read the paper to me that was signed—I pointed</p>

I believe John Reader, who died at Woolwich, on 13th Oct., to be my uncle—my father's name is Robert Reuben Reader—on hearing of John Reader's death, I went down to Woolwich—I received the letter on 19th Oct., and went on the Sunday after—I went to the house he had occupied, and afterwards to Mrs. Chapman's—I there saw the prisoners—I said I expected to find my uncle lying in bed, but he was dead and buried—Mrs. Chapman said she had done everything for him that was requisite, and had been at a great expense and trouble, and my uncle had left everything to her—I did not ask anything about a will, she told me that my uncle had left a will leaving everything to her—I asked to see the will—she said she would produce the witnesses of the will, but she did not offer to show me the will—Higgins said, that everything was left to Mrs. Chapman—I said I was not interested for myself but I was for the children, and if they could not prove satisfactorily that they were entitled to the money, I should take proceedings against them—I then returned to town—between a fortnight and three weeks after that, Higgins came up to town, but previous to that I received a letter—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>), it came by post—I sent no answer to it, and on that Higgins came up—he saw my father, myself, and my wife together—the letter was pro<lb></lb>duced, and Higgins stated that he had written that letter by order of Mrs. Chapman—what passed was to the same purport as the letter—we said we could not answer it until we had an answer from my cousin—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>, "Woolwich, 7th Nov., 1853.

You will remember, I acquainted you of an elderly man and woman of middle age, coming to me, the latter representing herself as daughter of the deceased; I have further to acquaint you, that some-person or persons are striving to disinherit me of your late uncle's effects bequeathed to me prior to departing this life; whether you are acquainted with the proceedings</p>

Should you be acquainted with any steps that may have been taken with any of your relatives, you will greatly oblige me by favouring me with the required information, and should the same be done through the means of any of your family, I am ready to resign all further attempt or claims to the will and the bank book still in my possession; but should my antagonists be any of the parish authorities, I am determined to maintain my rights by retain<lb></lb>ing the above book, should it cost me every farthing through law, as they have been the means of endeavouring to persecute me, first in calling on a Coroners Inquest and having a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on your late uncle, and secondly, when they found your aged and infirm relative met with his death fairly, through an old pleurisy and a case of bronchitis, they, I have every reason to believe, are now striving to deprive me of your dear uncle's last will and testament. As I before stated, should it be any of the family striving to recover the same, I am content to resign all further claims, on the grounds that all my expenses are remitted to me You will do me a great favour by acknowledging this as early as possible, signifying your opinion; by so doing you will confer a great favour.

I am one of the Coroners for the county of Kent I held an inquest on the body of John Reader, on 15th Oct., at Woolwich—the prisoner, Mary Chapman, was the first witness examined—she did not tender herself; she was summoned there by my order—she was sworn—I took a note of what she stated (<hi rend="italic">reads:</hi> She said, "I knew the deceased by the name of John Reader—his age was about seventy-two years, a labourer—he had lodged at my house about the last four years—he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he was taken ill last Friday week, 7th Oct—I sent for the doctor, who attended him, until his death, daily—I did all the doctor ordered, and every attention was paid to the deceased—he died on Thursday last, 13th Oct, about 5 o'clock—he was sensible up to the time of his death, and knew me—he was able to sit up in bed at times; he did so the day before he died—he signed his will the day before his death—the will I have left with Mr. Pidcock, the solicitor—the deceased has no relations that I know of—he had some money to live on; he did not want—I refuse to tell the contents of the will; that is my business—he kept his bed from the day he was taken ill to the time of his death.'")—That state<lb></lb>ment was made in answer to questions put by me—I asked her what the contents of the will were, and she refused in those words, "I refuse to tell; that is my business"—I did not press it, because it was no part of my duty—it was in consequence of information conveyed to me, that I put the questions as to his being sensible—my object was to ascertain the cause of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not press the question about the will, because you did not think it was legitimate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had satisfied myself at that time from the medical man, of the cause of death—it was upon the sug<lb></lb>gestion of some unfair play that I held the inquest—the medical man could not ascertain the true cause of death, and a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination was made by my order, and then he stated that the party died from natural causes—the jury returned a verdict that he died from bronchitis, from natural causes—I do not know the prisoner at all.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The two wills were put in and read; both were dated</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">th Oct.</hi>, 1853, <hi rend="italic">and</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERT DALEY WALKER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you receive any money from Mrs. Chapman in payment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was after the churchwarden had seen the deceased; he told me that I had no right to attend him as a pauper—that was the day prior to his death; she gave me 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether; 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the day before he died, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. afterwards—the medicine I gave him was ten grains of jalap, and five of calomel.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you take the money if it was a pauper's case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I contract with the parish to find medicine for the paupers, and it would be a fraud on me if they took my medicines as paupers, and yet could afford to pay for them—I had informed myself that he had property at the time I received the money.</p>

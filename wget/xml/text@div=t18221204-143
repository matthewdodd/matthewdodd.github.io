I called there to see a person who resides there in the one pair. I stopped about ten minutes. Careless said she was out, but would be in in a moment. I stopped in Careless's room; Wood was with her; I was not there two minutes before she asked for something to drink; I went out and got some gin, asking Careless to take care of the bundle, telling her there was property in it. When I returned the bundle remained; they drank the liquor. I took up my bundle and left. There were three quantities of poplin in it, of eleven yards each. When I got out I found the bundle very loose, and upon examining it one dress out of the three was gone. I went back and charged them with it; they denied it. I fetched a constable, who found it in a room up stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are a hairdresser - A. I served my time to one. I deal in various articles. We had a quartern and a half of gin. I do not think I had seen Wood three times before. She did not tell me she had taken it. I had been there a short time before; I went to see Miss Roberts. I seldom went but I saw Wood. She did not say I owed her any money. Roberts came in just as I went out. I knew it was a brothel. There was a man at dinner there when I brought the constable.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prosecutor applied to me. I went to the house about six o'clock in the evening; he was quite sober, and said he had lost eleven yards of poplin. I found it between the bed and sacking in a back room on the first floor. Careless was down stairs in a back room. I saw no other woman there; the prisoners denied ever having seen him. Wood was there undressed.</p>

               <p>CARELESS'S Defence. I have a witness to prove Wood offered it to him for 5 s., which he owed her.</p>
               <p>- SMITHERS. I was dining at this house with two women; Wood and the prosecutor were in the front parlour. Wood said she had the property; that he owed her 20 s., and she would not return it till he paid her; he made no answer. She said he had owed it her fourteen days; he did not contradict her. She afterwards said he should have it for 5 s. I am a packer, and live at No. 29, Bell-alley, Coleman-street.</p>

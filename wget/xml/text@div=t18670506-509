                  </hi>. I live at 43, St. Martin's Lane, in the parish of St. Martin in the Fields, and am a watch and clock manufacturer—about a quarter to four on 9th March I left my shop in Mrs. Fox's care—about five o'clock I returned and found seven watches had been stolen from a case near the window—I supplied the numbers and the makers' names to Sergeant Ackrill—they were worth about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Skelton's housekeeper—I remember his going out about a quarter to four on 9th March—I was left in charge—shortly afterwards a cab drove up to the door, and the cabman asked me to send some oue out to speak to the person in the cab—being alone, I had to go myself; when I got to the cab door, a man asked me to send some one to No. 4, New Street, Spring Gardens, to see about a clock—I then turned round and saw two men, one in the doorway and the other</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186705060074"></xptr>
               <p>coming up the shop—the one at the door said, "How long will Mr. Skelton be before he is in?" and he gave a sort of grin—I seized hold of him and said, "You have got something"—he threw me to the back of the shop and ran away—I just had time to get up to see him turn down Hop Gar<lb></lb>dens—I saw his face distinctly—Sinkins is the man—about a quarter to leven a.m. on 2nd April I was fetched to the police-station—there were twelve or thirteen men, and from amongst them I picked out Sinkins—that was entirely by my own judgment, and without any assistance or aid from the police—I have no doubt whatever that Sinkins is the man I saw in the shop, and I believe Green to be the other—between eight and nine p.m. on 27th March I was taken to the police-station for the purpose of identifying some one—it was Green, but I could not identify him because he had disfigured himself—he squinted his eyes and bowed his legs—I saw him a week after at Bow Street, and then I believed he was the man that was in the shop.</p>

Q.</hi> The whole thing, I suppose, happened in a moment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I was alarmed—the glance I had of Sinkins was a short one, but it was quite sufficient to see it was him—I remember saying at Bow Street, "I had a short glance of the man in the doorway"—I believe he had a hat on, but I am not certain—I am not able to say whether he had a moustache or not, but he appeared to be clean-shaved—he had a sort of scarf round his neck—I did not see any moustache—I speak with certainty—I said at the police-court that I did not think he had any moustache, and that he was clean-shaved—I think the prisoner called some time before this robbery, and asked if something was gold, and whether I would buy it—I told him we did not buy such things—he was dressed almost like a navigator then—I did not say at the police-court that I could not identify Green, I said I could not be certain—I am more certain now that he is the man, because I have seen him often, and know his face a little better—I said at the police-court I could not be positive Green was the man, but I had not much doubt—I think I first identified Green the day after Sinkins was examined at Bow Street—it was on the first examination before the Magis<lb></lb>trate, when Green was standing in the dock, that I recognised him—previous to seeing him in the dock I had had an opportunity of recognising him in the yard—I think I said at the police-court that Sinkins was the man that threw me down, and I believed Green to be the man that was with him—I cannot say I clearly swore it before the Magistrate—I know Mr. Robson well—he is a neighbour—I remember seeing him at the police-station, and saying to him that I could not recognise Green, but that they all looked a guilty lot of people—I have not been in communication with the police since he has been committed for trial—I have spoken to a con<lb></lb>stable since—I dare say I have seen Constable Gordon five or six times since the robbery, but he has said very little to me about it—Mr. Robson was the first to come to my assistance, and he ran after the prisoners—I was taken to the jailor's room on one occasion to identify Green, and I said then I could not exactly identify him.</p>

               <p>March I saw three men opposite Mr. Skelton's shop, on the same side of the way—between that time and half-past four I saw two of them con<lb></lb>tinually in the neighbourhood of his shop—about half-past four I saw the same two running from the prosecutor's door—there was then a cab at the door—the prisoners are the men—I am perfectly sure of it—they went up St. Martin's Lane and turned up Hop Gardens—I did not run after them, as I did not know what had occurred—the cab at the door obstructed my view of what was passing—I believe I had seen the prisoners there a week previously, but I cannot speak with certainty to that—I gave a description of the prisoners to constable Gordon—about three weeks after the robbery I went to Bow Street—I cannot say whether it was 2nd April, but it was on a Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>

On the 20th of December, I lost six sheep skins out of an outhouse: I heard that Mr. Wright, at Chertsey in Surry, had bought such a quantity of skins: I went and saw some; they had been wet, and my maid was almost out; I believe they were mine, but I cannot swear to them; the prisoner worked with me at the time. Mr. Wright said he should know the man he bought them of if he was to see him; he came over to my house; I shewed him the prisoner; he said he would swear that was the man that brought them to him; I went and got a warrant and took him up, and he confessed that he was the man before we came before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Did you promise if he confessed he should not be punished? - No, he took me aside, and said open confession deserves open punishment; Master I am the man that took the skins; I hope you will not hurt me.</p>

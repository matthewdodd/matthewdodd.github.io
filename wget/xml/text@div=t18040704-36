            . The first that I saw, I discovered that the garden-gate had been broke open, and then the summer-house broke open, which I was surprised at, knowing I had the keys; my brother had discovered that the room was broke open before I did; I was on the premises from five in the morning till I went home to breakfast, about nine o'clock; the stables adjoin the house; I was in the stables till near seven; there were a number of men on the premises at work, and women too; we found a rug tucked in at one corner of the window, which looks to where my brother slept.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The two prisoners worked for me a week before the robbery was committed; they had worked for me, I cannot say how long; it might be two or three months; Needs came to me at Hackney, on the Saturday night, about an hour or two hours before the robbery was discovered, to ask if I would take him into my employ again on Monday; they had left me on the Saturday night before, under pretence of going into the country for two or three days; I told Needs I would give him an answer at my accompting-house, at Hoxton, that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Dorset with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you found out the robbery then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him about it? - A. Not more than to the rest of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew that you were aware of the robbery then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you give him? - A. I was in want of hands, but he being, as I then thought, a worthless character, I wished to consult my foreman, whether I should take him on or not; and after I found out the robbery, I forbid him to come.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your partner's name? - A. George Gregory; we found some baskets belonging to us at the Magistrates, and a tub.</p>

Yes; They both lodged at my house; they came upon the 17th of November; I had a shop and parlour to let; Dorset took the lodgings; he asked me what I charged a week for the shop and parlour; I said 4 s. 6 d. a week; Needs told me he was a poor man, and was just married; could not I take 4 s. I said if I did, I must have my money every week, and I agreed to take 4 s. Dorset paid me 1 s.

Dorset only; the shop did not very well answer; after he had been there a month or two, he told me he did not like to go to gardening again, for the wages were very low, and if they lost an hour, through rain or any thing of that sort, it was stopped; I recommended him to a Mr. Kinman, where I worked; he worked there some time, I cannot say how long, and one day coming home, as we lived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040045"></xptr>near together, we got into a conversation about servitude, and one thing or other, and he said he wished I had not let Mr. Needs lodge in the house; I asked him why, and he told me that the last place where they worked in they committed a robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where they worked? - A. I asked him where it was, and he told me it was at Mr. Grange's, at Hoxton; he then said, he had taken a pair of sheets and blankets, and some clothes; he said they took every thing there was, and he wished to get rid of Needs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what became of the things? - A. No; he said he let Needs have the water-tub that was in the yard, and the sheets, and he had not paid him for them, but he did not say that they were the sheets that they took.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do upon this? - A. One day I thought it was not right such people should lodge in my place; I thought my other lodgers were not safe, and I went to Mr. Grange and informed him of it; I saw 
               <persName id="t18040704-36-person409">

            , and he came down to my place, where Needs lodged; I went with the officers to Needs's sister-in-law, where they found a tub belonging to Mr. Grange.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? - A. At Mr. Lowe's, in Tash-court.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the sister-in-law's name? - A. Finney; I went with the officer to Needs's apartments, along with old Mr. Grange, to see if there was any property; there were several baskets found, but I do not know whether there were any of them their's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoners altogether? - A. Ever since the 17th of November last.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been extremely intimate? - A. No; only walking backwards and forwards; I do not think I ever drank with him above five or six times in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. You happened to be walking one day by chance, and he made this open confession? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time you had no intimacy at all with him, and he told you he had committed a robbery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that one day after that you thought it was right they should leave your house? - A. Sometime after.</p>
               <p>Q. Your principles of honesty and notions of it, were always the same? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, though he told you he had committed a robbery, it did not strike you till some time after that he was a man unfit to remain in your house; how long was it after? - A. After Dorset had left the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Dorset left the house voluntarily? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not desire him to go? - A. Yes, one day when he was taken up for an affray in Lincoln's inn fields; he said he did not think my lodgings would suit him, and I said I did not think they would.</p>
               <p>Q. You were always upon good terms with Dorset? - A. I never had a quarrel with either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not Dorset told you he thought you a very bad man, and he did not think it fit to stay in your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He never said you had done things for which you ought to be hanged? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this confession was it that you saw Mr. Grange? - A. I saw Mr. Grange at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was it that you saw White? - A. It might be five weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you went the next day to Bow-street, and gave information? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not think it right that they should be punished? - A. Yes, but Needs's wife lay very dangerously ill in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Dorset has left your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know there is such a thing as a reward of 40 l. upon conviction of a burglary? - A. I did not know it till lately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never learn it till you came to give evidence here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear it from the officers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever happen to you to have any misfortune yourself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been a smith? - A. Nine years and four months in the army.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you abroad during those nine years? - A. No, at home.</p>

            , Senior, sworn. - Q. You knew nothing, I believe, till you went to get the warrant? - A. Yes, on the 5th of November, in the morning, White went out with the cart, and the next morning I took down a rug from the window, it was pinned up with a fork.</p>
               <p>Q. That window looked towards you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now go to the time when you got the warrant? - A.

             sworn. - I am sister-in-law to Needs; my sister was wife to him for any thing I know; she died the very day he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way of life are you? - A. My husband is a millwright; I lodged at Mr. Lowe's at the time these things were found.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Needs bringing any clock to your house? - A. Yes; I think it was on the 7th of November, Dorset came with him; Needs brought it in an apron, and asked me to let him leave it there, because it was so far to take it to Hoxton that night; he lived at that time in Hoxton market-place; the clock had weights but no pendulum; it was broke, the face of it was broke in two.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the baskets come? - A. Dorset brought the baskets about a week after; he said they were going to remove, and wished them to be put in Mr. Lowe's yard; they were taken away, and Needs afterwards brought them again; Needs said they were his.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the water-tub? - A. Needs brought it in the morning that he was taken up, before I was up, and he came again afterwards and asked me if I would ask Mr. Lowe to buy it; he told me himself that he had brought it that morning; he said, as my sister was dead, it was of no use to him; Mr. Chapman came with Mr. Grange, and asked me if I had any thing belonging to Needs; I told him there was a water-tub he had brought in that morning, and I gave the clock up to old Mr. Grange; I told him Needs had brought it to me.</p>
               <p>- LOWE sworn. - I heard that the officers were making a search, and they found a water-tub which I did not know was on the premises; Mrs. Finney explained how it came there; I then gave the officer information of the baskets; Mrs. Finney was coming up stairs, and heard them say they had taken every thing away, even the wooden clock, upon which she said she had got the clock, and delivered it up immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know it by - was the face broke when you lost it? - A. No, it was not; I know it by the mark here, a castle and a ship; and here is a place where I strained it when I cleaned it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You do not mean to swear to the ship and the castle, I suppose? - A. And the strain.</p>

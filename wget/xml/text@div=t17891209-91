               <p>The case opened by Mr. Garrow, as follows.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury; I am counsel for this prosecution, which imputes to the prisoner at the bar the offence of rape; and Gentlemen, these are cases in which Courts and Juries find considerable difficulties in the consideration; because from the nature of the offence, it is almost always attended with a secresy which makes it necessary for Courts and Juries to find their way as they can, and to judge from the probability and improbability of the story told by the person who complains of the injury:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the circumstances stated to me, attending the commission of this offence, are extremely bad, and extremely gross; but whether they will be made out in evidence, in a satisfactory way to you, it is not for me to anticipate: I am quite sure you will look at this case with attention and care, and not be drawn to a hasty conclusion either way; and least of all to a hasty conclusion of guilt. Gentlemen, the prisoner is a <rs id="t17891209-91-deflabel434" type="occupation">runner to one of the public offices</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17891209-91-defend835 t17891209-91-deflabel434"></join>; and the prosecutrix, who is a soldier's daughter, was a <rs id="t17891209-91-viclabel435" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17891209-91-victim837 t17891209-91-viclabel435"></join> to him a week: after she had lived there there for three days, the prisoner treated her with great indecency; and she told it to a Mrs. Ross, who advised her (very improperly in my opinion) to take notice of it; and her reason was this, because in all probability the prisoner would repeat his conduct, and then it would be a proper time to complain.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, on the 8th of November, the prisoner came home to his house; he found this young woman in the act of drying some clothes; he laid hold of her and desired her to come to him; she refused, and he pulled up her petticoats; taking her on his knees and held her towards the fire; stating to her, that that was to warm her. Gentlemen, it is stated to me, that he behaved to her with an indecency and grossness, which is fitter you should hear from the witness, as you must of necessity hear the account of it once (which is certainly once more than will be pleasant) somebody knocked at the door, and the prisoner took this young woman into the kitchen, which is behind his shop, and there made threats to her, that if she made any noise he would murder her; he then took her on his knees, let down his own breeches, laid her on an easy chair with its face upwards, and on that chair perpetrated the offence of rape: Gentlemen, as to the fact of the girl having been lain with by some person with some violence, will not depend on her evidence: Gentlemen, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090089"></xptr>will naturally enquire whether she cried out; it is stated to me that she endeavoured to do so; but the prisoner, from his large size, and a large loose great coat which he had on, prevented her from making any noise or alarm: Gentlemen, in this situation, it is stated to me that the prisoner committed the offence of rape; and after that, he is stated to me to have taken her into another room, and there to have again attempted indecencies of a gross and abominable nature to this young woman; and that on her resisting he behaved in a very shocking manner: Gentlemen, you will hear the evidence, and it is for you to decide: it is not material for me to press upon you any argument that may be favourable to the prosecution; and as for the prisoner, I am sure every thing that may come out in evidence favourable to him, will be stated to you with much greater ability, intelligence and authority than myself, or indeed any of us at the bar, can ever pretend to; and upon the whole you will give such verdict as your consciences shall enforce you to do, after you have heard the whole of the evidence.</p>

               <p>He is a runner belonging to Shadwell office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you been servant to him? - A week. He used me very ill, he began on Monday night; I went there on a Wednesday; when he came home from his office the first night, that was the Monday night; he took me and set me on his knee, and kept stroking and cuddling me up.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by stroking and cuddling you up? - Stroking me about my head and face and kissing me; and when he kissed me I cried out, Mr. Cole, if you please, to let me go and do my work, for if my mistress comes home, I shall have anger; he said, never mind your mistress; you may kiss her b - kside if you like; then I said I must not do any such a thing as that, and I must not say any thing to my mistress! oh says he, I will lick you if you are not quiet; then he kept cuddling me up; but did not do any thing more that night.</p>
               <p>Did you tell any body of what he had done to you? - Not that first night I did not, because he did not hurt me the first night; I did not take much notice of that.</p>
               <p>When did he do any thing to you again? - The second night when he came home from his office, I was in the shop by the door, and he laid hold of my hand, and said, come here, I want to speak to you; and I thought it was about some business; then he took me on his knee and pulled up my petticoats; then he kissed me, and told me to go and do my work: I mentioned that to our lodger, when she came to get some milk, she came into the kitchen; that was on the Wednesday, about noon time; I acquainted her of it; I said to her, says I, Mrs. Ross, when my mistress comes home I dare say I shall have a noise, my work is not done, and Mr. Cole is so rude and so nasty with me, that I cannot bear myself: then I told her how he used me the first night, and the Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>You described it to her exactly? - Yes; she said I must tell my mistress, or my mother and father, and if I told them, they would either have him put in a prison or hang him.</p>
               <p>That was the advice Mrs. Ross gave you? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090090"></xptr>When did you see your mistress after this? - I did not see her till past eleven at night; my mistress went out almost every night; I do not know what for; and sometimes she brought company home with, her a lady and gentleman, Mr. Morgan and Mrs. Morgan.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see your mistress till after all the mischief had been done? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see your father and mother after the time that Mrs. Ross spoke to you, before the prisoner used you ill again? - Yes, they were both of them together; they were going to bed; they lived up at the corner of King David-lane, very near; I had a great deal of work to do.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - I did not see them till after eleven o'clock; not till after he had used me ill.</p>
               <p>Court. Then as I understand you now, you neither saw your mistress nor your father and mother till after the fact was done? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Describe, and go slowly, what he did to you on the Wednesday? - It was between seven and eight in the evening, on the Wednesday, he came home, I was in the kitchen hanging some towels across the line before the fire place, and he caught hold of me round the waist and the arms, and took me in his lap, and pulled up my petticoats, and held me before the fire, as a person would hold a child to the fire to warm; he took me across his two arms with my petticoats up, by the fire side; he held me for about five minutes, then he let down my petticoats, and let go of me; and I went to run away, and he got hold of me, and called me a little bitch, and said he would not do me any harm; I need not be afraid of him, for he did not like to hurt any body's child.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I think the Jury would have run a great risk of doing wrong in finding the prisoner guilty of a capital offence; but his conduct has been so gross and indecent, that I feel it my duty to pray the Court, that he may be detained to be tried for an assault with intent to commit a rape.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. My lord, I have had no opportunity of answering this charge, because in point of law he was entitled to an acquittal; but I do assure your Lordship, I have a strong denial to every one single circumstance, so strong that the magistrate admitted him to bail.</p>
               <p>Court. Let him be detained in custody till the end of the session, and let a bill of indictment, for the assault, with intent to commit a rape, be preferred before the grand jury for the County of Middlesex, who are now sitting at Hicks's Hall. It appears from the testimony of

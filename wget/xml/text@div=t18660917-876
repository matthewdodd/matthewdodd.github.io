                  </hi>. I am a tanner, of 24, Weston Place, Bermondsey—on 12th August, about ten minutes past twelve at night I was in Long Lane, Bermondsey, walking home alone, when a man came up from behind, and put his hand round my neck—the prisoner then came across the road, put his hand in my pocket, and took out a purse containing 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; a half-crown, two shillings, and two sixpences—he made an attempt to take my watch, and I pushed it right down in my pocket, and he broke the chain—he gave the purse to a third man, who came up, and he ran down a court with it—the prisoner went across the road—I watched him; he went into a crowd of about twenty or thirty persons, over the way—I saw him again within about a minute afterwards, and gave him into custody—I am certain that he is the person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was not there at all at the time of the robbery—I was in a public-house playing a whistle.</p>

About half-past seven on 11th August I came up Long Lane, and they called me in to play the whistle in front of the bar—the prosecutor was there and he got up and sang a song, and there was some dancing—directly I came outside he came up and said, "Here is one, sergeant; I will give him in charge"—I knocked at the public-house door, to get the publican to prove I was there, and the policeman would not let me stop—I, am innocent of it.</p>

            . I am Page to Princess Mary, and had the Misfortune to lose four Silver Plates, one was miss'd August the 2d, another August the 7th, the Third August the 24th, and the Fourth November the 17th; I advertis'd them, offering a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173612080032"></xptr> Reward of twenty Guineas for them, and soon after I received Notice from Mr. Hague that he had bought them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hague I live near Goldsmith Hall, and am a Silversmith. One Herbert a Journeyman of mine, bought me a Silver Plate, and asked me if I would buy it; he told me it was honestly come by, and that the Gentleman who owned it, was a Relation of his Wife's, and being come to Decay, would sell six or eight of his Plates, but not caring to sell them himself, he employ'd him. I gave him 5 s. 3 d an Ounce, and he brought me at different Times three more; the Marks were very curiously taken out of them all. The Advertisement came out the 19th, and my Man had brought one the Day before, but I not being at Home, he was to come again the next Day. I took him before Sir William Billers, and he produc'd this Cock, a Shoemaker; Cock was taken up, and he impeach'd the Prisoner.</p>

            . I deliver'd the four Plates to Herbert at different Times; the Prisoner brought them to me, and said, they belong'd to a Gentleman that she chair'd for, who not being well desired her to dispose of them for him. My Wife said, why, Mr. Herbert is a Relation of our's, go to him; I carried a Plate to him, and he carried it to Mr. Hague. Herbert gave me but 4 s. 6 d. an Oz. and said, he could get no more because it was old Sterling. I gave the Prisoner all the Money I had for them but 3s. 6d. which I laid out of the Money I receiv'd for the last. This 3 s. 6 d. and 4s. which she gave me afterwards, was all the Money I had from her.</p>

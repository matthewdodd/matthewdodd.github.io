On the 27th of July I met the prisoner at the top of the cellar stairs, I immediately sent him out; I went down into the cellar and found some bees-wax concealed between the cellar and the flooring of the shop; I left it in the same place I found it. The prisoner came in a quarter of an hour; after he had been in the cellar and was gone to breakfast, the bees-wax was gone; no person had been in the cellar but him. Before this I had seen empty bags in the cellar that gave me suspicion.</p>
               <p>JOHN VICKERY. I am an officer. I went to the prisoner's lodging and searched his bed-room; under the bed, in a box, I found this soap, there is eight or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190060"></xptr>nine pounds, eight sticks of Spanish juice, ginger, and this tap-borer. I found all the articles in his lodgings mentioned in the indictment. As soon as ever I found them, I took them to the prosecutor's house, the prisoner was sent for into the accompting-house; I said, we had been to No. 28, Long's-buildings, Whitecross-street, we have found these things in a box under your bed, to whom do they belong. He said, I am very sorry, they belong to my master; I took the soap for my wife's washing, the Spanish juice for my cold.</p>
               <p>Coles. They are all articles that my master deals in.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

Pratt and Sewell, in Gray's-inn-lane, on 25th May, at half-past two o'clock in the morning, with Fisher—I saw Dunn come out of the premises with the water-cart—he went towards King's-cross—I saw Sircutt lower down Gray's-inn-lane, below Portpool-lane—I saw Dunn overtake Sircutt—I heard them in conversation, and distinctly heard the words, "Not now"—their carts were close together, and they were going at a walking pace—Sircutt then went on in advance, and Dunn turned down Little Gray's-inn-lane, leading to Mount-pleasant—Sircutt went on, and turned down Elm-street, which also leads to Mount-pleasant—Sircutt lives in Paradise-street, but Elm-street would be quite out of his way home—when they got to Mount-pleasant, Dunn stopped his cart, and Sircutt drove on the off side of it—I saw Dunn take from his own cart a sack half-full of some<lb></lb>thing, and throw it into Sircutt's cart, and I heard Dunn say, "All right, I'll</p>

               <p>meet you to-night"—I and the other officer went towards the carts, and Sircutt set off at a gallop—he had the reins in his hand—he went up towards Exmouth-street—he had a light spring-cart—we pursued him more than a hundred yards, and called, "Stop thief!" but could not overtake him—I gave information to Messrs. Pratt and Sewell, and by their instructions I took Dunn about half-past seven that morning—I said, "I want you for throwing that half sack of corn this morning into Sircutt's cart"—he said, "So help me God, he did not have any corn of me to-day"—in going to the station I said, "I think there was a bushel of corn in the sack"—he said, "Oh, faith, there was not half a bushel"—I have a sample of the mixture which I got of the horse-keeper at the prosecutor's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-merchant, and live in St. John-street. I supply Pratt and Sewell with horse-provender—I am not aware that I supplied this mixture—they may deal with some one else—I have supplied them with oats and beans like this sample: never with chaff—these are Egyptian beans, and black and white oats—this sample that came from Sircutt's stable is similar to the sample that came from the prosecutor's—these yellow oats are quite a distinct kind of oats from those in the samples—this clover in the mixture is first-cut clover, and this other is second-cut clover—here is some uncut hay—I should say there is none of that in the mixtures.</p>

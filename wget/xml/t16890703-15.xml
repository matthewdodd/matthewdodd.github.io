                   being a Person of very bad Fame, and a known and open Papist, did, on the First day of May last past, Write, Compose and Publish, or cause to be Written, Composed and Published a most False, Scandalous and Pernicious Libel against the People and Government of England, Entituled, A short History of the New Christen'd Convention. In which were these, and the like scandalous Reflections, viz. I would have the Prince of Orange know, that our Eyes are more and more opened; And that we see those Men that pretend to do our Religion Right, instead of securing our Liberties, do bring us into Slavery, &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>The King's Council opened the Matter and Nature of the Fact to the Jury, and told them, That he stood Indicted for Writing, Composing, and Publishing of the Libel: But that the Evidence should be implied, more particularly to prove the Publication upon the Prisoner; and they hoped if it were, the Gentlemen of the Jury would find him Guilty accordingly. The Prisoner being told by the Court, that none but a Papist would have spoke such Words. Then the Evidence was called against him, who deposed in the general, That he was seen to read the Libel to a Popish Priest, and 2 other Persons at a Publick House, and the Prisoner was heard to commend it very highly, saying, He would not leave it for a 100 l. This happened about a Month before the King's Proclamation came out, for to apprehend the Author. It was further declared, That the Prisoner lent the Libel to the Priest and the other Person: And that they were to return it back to the Master of the House where they were drinking, which they did in 2 or 3 days after; whereby the Master of the House had an opportunity to read it over at large, and to get Pendergrass Apprehended. And further, The Libel was produced in Court, and proved to be the same that was read by the Prisoner to his Companions, as above said. The Prisoner said, That he did not know who writ the Paper, neither did he Publish it. The Cou- told him that must be left to the Jury. He said, he did not know that it was [any Misdemeanor, nor could he remember that ever he read any such Paper to any Gentlemen whatsoever, and that if he had had any other Papers, he would not have prefe'd so hard to have that again. There were several other Controversies past between the Court and the Prisoner, who behaved himself like a person Inspired with the true Spirit of Popery, all the time of the Tryal; for which he received most seasonable Reprimands from the Court: And having nothing material to offer, Mr. Recorder proceeded to direct the Jury, which he did very Exquisitely, telling them, That the only thing they were to consider of was, whether the Prisoner did Publish the Libel, yes or no, which was proved to them by 2 Witnesses that he did it maliciously to do mischief, which they might be induced to believe, by the high Estimation he set on it, telling them withal, That the Crime was of a very deep die, and desired them to take notice how many such kind of pernicious Libels had been (of late) thrown up and down the streets. Putting them in mind of what dangerous Consequence the promoting of such Principles might prove to the Liberties and Properties of all True Englishmen, which if they did not endeavour to suppress, he would lay at their doors, &amp;c.</p>

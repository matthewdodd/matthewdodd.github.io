                  </hi>. I am salesman to Mr. John Mumford, warehouseman, of Milk-street, Cheapside. The goods in question were obtained by the prisoner before Mr. Mumford knew of the circumstance—on the 23rd of June the prisoner called at my master's warehouse to look at some goods—he said, "Will you show me such and such articles?"—I forget what article he first named—I showed him some articles, and he selected some to the amount of 3 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., consisting of gauze handker<lb></lb>chiefs, edging, blonde, four quarter bobinet, rouche, and fancy silk blonde—he then said, "I will give you my address," and he gave it on a piece of paper, which I have not preserved—it was given to Mr. Henry Mum<lb></lb>ford, and I have not seen it since—I copied it into the day-book about an hour or two after—I did not make the entry from the paper—I did not see the paper when I entered the goods—Mr. Henry Mumford had the paper—in consequence of what was written on the paper, I made inquiry of Ingram and Company, and of a person named Bachelard—Ingram and Co. said that he had an account with them to the amount of between 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to the best of my recollection—that he had paid them money on account, I think to the amount of about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that they were referred by him to Mr. Bachelard, and that as far as they were able to judge, they believed him to be a respectable man—when I went to Bache<lb></lb>lard, he told me that he was a respectable man, that he had commenced a business in Maidstone, which was a very successful one, that he was doing a great deal of business, that he had money in the concern to the amount</p>

               <p>of about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he had married a young lady, who had a very pretty property, which consisted of houses in Sloane-street, Chelsea, to the amount of 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Is the property settled on his wife, or is it in his own control, because if it is in the wife's, of course the creditors cannot touch it"—he said, "No, the property was that settled in case he wanted more money in his business"—I made these inquiries of Ingram and Bachelard, within an hour or half-an-hour after the prisoner coming to us—he called again that afternoon, and wanted to know if the goods had been sent—he had ordered them to be sent to some inn in the Bo<lb></lb>rough—I forget the name—Mr. Henry Mumford took the direction dow—I forget whether I or Mr. Henry Mumford gave instructions to the porter—they had not been sent when the prisoner called—we said we would for<lb></lb>ward them that evening—they were to be sent, to the best of my know<lb></lb>ledge, by nine o'clock, but I am not positive—I know the George Inn in the Borough—I pass it every morning and night—I saw the goods before they went—they were directed to "Beaumont, Week-street, Maidstone"—I believe that was the address he gave me—they were sent that evening—I am not positive whether I was present when the porter left—I cannot say whether I gave directions to take them—Mr. Henry Mumford did in my presence—on the 30th of June the prisoner called again, and made another purchase of lace goods to the amount of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we sell nothing but lace goods—I believe they were sent to the same place as the former ones, but I am not positive—the porter took them—the prisoner said he should let us have some money the next time he came, which would be shortly—he came again in about a fortnight or three weeks, but I do not know the date, and looked out some more goods to the amount of between 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—whilst he was sorting them out, Mr. Mumford came into the warehouse—up to that time he had never seen the prisoner, to my knowledge—I had delivered the goods on my own responsibility and that of Mr. Henry Mumford—on Mr. Mumford coming in, I introduced the prisoner to him—I said, "Mr. Mumford, this is Mr. Beaumont, of Maidstone"—I then turned to Mr. Beaumont, at least to the prisoner, who I supposed to be Mr. Beaumont, and said to him, "Mr. Mumford, Sen., Mr. Beaumont"—Mr. Mumford said, "Pray, are you Mr. Beaumont, will you give me your Christian name?"—Mr. Mumford then went to the desk, and the prisoner then gave him his name as John or William Beaumont, (or whatever it was, I forget the Christian name)—as he was looking out some goods, he said, "We" this, and "we" the other, that seemed to attract Mr. Mumford's attention, and he said, "I perceive you have a partner, Mr. Beaumont?"—he said, "No, I have no partner, but I have two or three very efficient yonng men at Maidstone, so that I frequently say, 'we' this, and 'we' the other,—he said, "Are you buying these goods on your own account, Mr. Bean<lb></lb>mont!"—he said yes, he was—I believe that was before he asked if he had a partner—I saw Mr. Mumford at the desk, writing, at the time the prisoner gave him his name, and he asked him the way his name was spelt—I knew nothing of the name of Shackelford at that time—those goods were never sent.</p>

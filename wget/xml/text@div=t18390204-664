                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 152.) On Saturday morning, the 9th of January, between three and four o'clock, I was on duty between Drayton-green and Uxbridge-road—there is a lane there which passes between the stables of the Green Man public-house and the house, which is a night-house—the stable is on the left-band side, and projects out towards the road—I saw two carts there—I saw one of them first, the tail of which was drawn up close against the end of the stable, and the horse to<lb></lb>wards London—I was not above two or three yards from it—there is a lamp in front of the Green Man, and I saw a man standing four or five yards from the cart, who appeared to be on the look-out—as soon as he saw me he ran off, but before he ran I saw him go up to a man who was on the cart, and speak to him, but I could not hear what he said—upon that I passed by the cart, and took no notice—I saw that cart was loaded with straw—I saw another cart in advance of that, which was loaded with hay—I passed the hay-cart also, and then crossed the road through a gate on the other side of the road to the right, but came back again, and kept myself out of sight—I could see what the persons were doing—I do not know who the man was on the straw-cart, but the man who went up and spoke to him was the prisoner—the man on the straw handed down two trusses of straw, one at a time, to the prisoner, who removed them about a</p>

               <p>couple of yards from the cart, and put them against the stable-door—I then saw a sack put down by the man on the top of the cart, which dropped down by the side of the cart—the prisoner attempted to catch it, but he missed it, and it fell to the ground—I was then about ten yards from the cart, and concealed—I had a full view of the person and face as well as the dress of the prisoner—I ran up to him while he was stooping to pick up the sack, and I said, "Stop, you are my prisoner"—he left the sack, ran away, and escaped—I turned the two trusses of straw round the cor<lb></lb>ner, so as to have them in my sight, and I told the man who was on the cart to surrender, he was my prisoner, but he slipped down by the aide of the cart, and ran off—I observed that the ropes of the straw-cart were loose—after some time I took the straw and the sack of beans to the station-house, and then went to London in pursuit of the man—I came to London, and was going back, when I found the prisoner, who was going from London—I said to him, "You are my prisoner; you are the man who escaped from me this morning"—he said nothing to me—I am perfectly sure that he is the man—I saw the trusses of straw that I speak of, and the beans, shown to Mr. Wilshin on the Monday following."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer at Hayes—the prisoner and a man named Knight were in my service. On the 18th of January, I sent hay and straw to London by Knight and the prisoner—they started from my farm with the loads—I saw the carts loaded that night, and the cloth over them—I saw the straw at the station-house, and have no doubt it was mine—I know it by a certain weed which grew in that field and no other—I have brought a sample of my beans—I have no doubt these are mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the barn locked in which the beans were? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was—one of these samples of beans is from the sack, and the other is from the heap in the barn—there is not such a sort of bean in the parish—I have a great deal of clay land—these are small horse-beans—I could not swear there are not beans of a similar description in other parishes—I could not miss any beans from my stock—there were twenty quarters of them, and they were in an unfinished state, not cleaned—the prisoner had charge of the hay cart, and Knight of the straw.</p>

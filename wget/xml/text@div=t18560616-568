                  </hi>. I live in Bath row, Old Kent-road, I have premises in Ball-court, Giltspur-street—I am a manufacturer of silk tassels. On 28th March I left my warehouse at 6 o'clock—I locked the door, and put a padlock on the door—I left silk and tassels in the warehouse, all safe—I came next morning, at 9 o'clock—I found the door safely locked—I went into the warehouse, and a great quantity of silk and goods had been taken away, to the amount of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I missed writing desks and <hi rend="italic">porte monnaies</hi>—I communicated with the police, but I heard nothing of the property till 14th April—on that day a person called on me from Messrs. Evans, with some silk which I identified as part of what had been stolen—it had a private mark on it which no silk in London has—he and I then went to the police, and then to Mr. Earl's, and I finally saw Mr. Legge, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of what he told me, I arranged that Mrs. Weller was to go to the prisoner with Mr. Legge, and she was to pass as his wife.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 121, St. John-street, and am a trimming manufacturer. I recollect, early in April, going to the house of the prisoner, in Holborn; Mr. Button was with me—it was between 4 and 5 o'clock—I saw the prisoner in the back parlour—Mr. Sutton introduced me to him, to buy some goods—I spoke to the prisoner about the goods that I had come to purchase, and he produced me this sample—I asked him the price and the quantity, and he furnished me with a list of the articles—this is the list: "23lbs. of twist, 116 girdles, 40 reels," etc.—I told him I would call again—I went again the next day, and he gave me a sample, I took it to Mr. Earl, in Watling-street, and he sent it to Mr. Evans—the policeman afterwards came to my house, and Mr. Hotter, and it was arranged that I should go to the prisoner's house, and Mrs. Weller should accompany me—I went, and told the prisoner that I had come respecting the goods that I had received a sample of previously—he said, "I don't know but <hi rend="italic">what</hi> they are sold; I had a party here on Friday night, but I was busy"—I said, "Well, if they are, so be it"—he said, "I have not received a deposit on the goods "—I said, "Very well, if you have not sold them, I will purchase"—we made a bargain about them—the whole of the goods were not shown to me then, but I agreed to pay for the quantity mentioned in this paper 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I paid a deposit of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me this receipt: "Received of Mr. Legge, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of goods bought"—I and Mrs. Weller then left the house, and I made a communi<lb></lb>cation to the police, who were outside at the time—I gave the sample to the police—I had made an arrangement with the prisoner to go in the afternoon to fetch the bulk of the property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A trimming manufacturer—I know something about the value of silk—when I first went to the prisoner, a gas fitter and two or three other persons came in, and while those persons were there my transactions with the prisoner still went on—there were one or two persons in the room—this was done as open as open could be—I did not purchase the first time, because it was in the evening, and I was not certain whether it was silk or Naples cord—those persons who were there could see the things that were there—the price was talked of that first time, I think it was about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I could not purchase them without I knew whether they were silk or Naples cord—I went into the back place to examine, and I brought a bit away—I and the gas fitter drank together, and the goods were exhibited—I told the prisoner I should take it, and show it to my agent—I believe that was on the first occasion—I may have told him so on both occasions—he gave me the sample on the day following—I cannot charge my memory whether there were people there on the second day that I went there—on that second interview I asked for a sample, and said it was to be examined by my agent—there was no reserve—it was given me as openly as I gave him the sovereign—I might be with him per<lb></lb>haps half an hour that second time—I saw the sample of the goods that second time, not the bulk—I took the sample away, arid showed it—I went again a few days afterwards, and took the sample back—that was the third</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185606160013"></xptr>
               <p>interview—the bulk of the goods was not shown me then, but I took the sample and asked the prisoner if he would invoice the goods—he said, "I am not likely to invoice another man's goods"—I said, "Well, there is an end of the matter; I shall not buy without an invoice "—he then said he would see the party—I was coming away with the sample, and he called me back asked me for the sample, and I gave it him, and he gave me my sovereign back—I went after that with Mrs. Weller on the morning of the 14th—I paid for the goods I had, and I agreed to give 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the lot—I should not have liked to have given a great deal more for them, as fancy goods alter so much in price—when he showed me the tassels he asked me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen for them—I told him I could manufacture a portion of them at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not myself know the exact value of the great bulk of the property—publicans are not likely to know the price of goods, they would be more likely to ask the price that others ask them.</p>

            . He never accounted for any of these sums.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What wages did you give the prisoner? A. I meant to have given him 90l. a year for the first six months - he had been three months with us - I had not paid him his wages; I owed him about 15l. which he might have had if he had asked for it - he had 7l. or 8l. worth of goods, and he had 7l. in cash; when I taxed him with having received these sums, he denied having received any.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was it his business to settle with you? A. Just as he came in from receiving money, either with me or some one in my establishment - I believe, on the 29th of July, he received four small sums and they were made paid - I believe he did not pay any after the 4th of July.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What took place on the 18th of July when you made the charge against the prisoner? A. I went to a place and received some information; I then called the prisoner up stairs, and said, "I understand you have been receiving money and not accounting for it," he said,"No, I have not;" I said, "Have you not received 12l. of Mr. Cook," he said, "Not on your account, I borrowed that;" I asked him if he had received anything of Mr. Black, or Mr. Down, he said, "No," I then showed him the voucher, and he said, he had.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not give you a list of the sums which I had received that morning? Witness He did; after I had shown him the voucher; I had told him the more candid he was the more lenient I would be.</p>

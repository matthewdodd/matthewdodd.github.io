                  </hi>. I am an estate and monetary agent, in partnership with another gentleman, at 14, St. Swithin's-lane. I have known the prisoner for the last three or four months—early in September he brought me two bills, one for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he brought the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill first, and asked me to get it discounted for him, bringing at the same time two policies of insurance as security, worth 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those are the bills—I know the prisoner's writing—I think the filling up of the body of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill and the signature of the drawer is his writing—I know nothing about the writing of the acceptor—I believe this other bill is also his writing. (<hi rend="italic">The</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">bill was here read, dated 1st September</hi>, 1858, <hi rend="italic">drawn by James Bayliss upon Mr. J. B. Marshall of Anderson-street, Chelsea, at two months. Accepted, payable at the London and Westminster Bank, B. Marshall.</hi>) The 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was brought after the first transaction—he merely asked us if we could obtain another discount for the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the same security—when he brought the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, he asked if we could obtain the discount for it upon that security—we said no doubt we could—we then presented it to Mr. Jones, and he said yes, provided the policies were right—I subsequently handed the bills to Mr. Jones, and he discounted them—he gave me a cheque which I handed over, less the commission—I saw the prisoner several times subsequent to the transaction of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I think we had some casual conversation about the bills, because one of the policies fell in, the party having died—there was no conversation between us as to who or what the acceptor of the bill was.</p>

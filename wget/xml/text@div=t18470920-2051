                  </hi> I am in partnership with Charles Lambert, of No. 142, Drury-lane—we sell tobacco—the prisoner has been in our service about five years. On Saturday, the 28th of Aug., my partner paid him his wages—I saw him going away, called him back, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Jacob</hi>, before you go, as I have long suspected you of robbing us, I shall have you searched before you leave"—I had previously told an officer to be in attend<lb></lb>ance—I called him in—the prisoner said he had not robbed us, and requested to go back—we went back into the warehouse—I said, "It is no use, I am going to have you searched"—he said, "It is all over; I am done for"—I saw 4 lbs. 12oz. weight of tobacco found on him at the station; it was the property of myself and partner.</p>

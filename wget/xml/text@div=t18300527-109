                  </rs>. The prisoner had frequented my house for ale and porter for four or five months; I do not know where she lived. On the 20th of April she brought me this cheque, and asked me to have the goodness to take 4s. out of it, which she owed me, and give her the remainder, as she was in want of money to pay her rent, and could not take it to the banker's, as it was evening - it was between five and seven o'clock; she put the cheque into my hands- I gave her 1l. 16s. in silver, and next day, in the afternoon, I went to the banking-house in Mansion-house-street; they said it was not good - they took my address, and kept the cheque; I got home between four and five o'clock, and found the prisoner waiting at my house - I called her out of the parlour, and told her of it; she did not seem to me to care about it at all - she said she could not think it was bad, she thought it was very good- I asked her to go with me to the banking-house three or four times, and see if we could make it right, but she refused; I called Betts, the Police-constable, in, and he asked her to go to the banker's - she would not, and I gave her in charge; I went with her to the watch-house, and pressed her to go to the banker's - she refused for a good while, and at last said she would go; we went back to my house, and as soon as she got there she said she would not go to the banker's - it was then nearly seven o'clock, and we went to Hatton-garden Office; the examination was put off till next day, and after the examination we were bound over - we were called back into the office, and a man came there, who said he had found the cheque among a parcel of lawyer's waste-paper, and gave it to her to go to the banking-house and see if it was good- he was detained till the Tuesday, and then let loose.</p>

Do you mean to state that the Magistrate (when this woman had the man taken up who gave her the cheque, and he confessed it) discharged him and committed her? A. Yes - he said he found it among some lawyer's papers; her brother had caused that man to be taken - his name was Chapman: when the prisoner first spoke to me about it she said she had it from Hare-court, Temple; she refused to give the person's name for some time, saying she did not want to expose him - I found her at my house on my return from the banker's; I do not think she can write herself.</p>

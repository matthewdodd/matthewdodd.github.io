                  </hi>I am under ostler, employed at the Coach and Horses public-house, Hounslow. On Sunday morning, the 21st of December, about half-post one o'clock at night, or between one and two o'clock, I was outside the door feeding a team of horses—the prisoner came up to our door with two more, and asked for some beer—it was not given to them—the door was shut—they kicked and knocked the door about—Hall, the constable, hap<lb></lb>pened to be in the house at the time—he came out and persuaded them to go off without making a disturbance—they were abusive to him, and said they had as much business in the house as he had—they did not go—they resisted against him—he was pushing them away, after a good deal of persuasion—they began scuffling with him—the prisoner was one of those who scuffled with him—one of his <hi rend="italic">mates</hi>pushed up against me as I was feeding the horses, and I pushed him down in the road, and directly after<lb></lb>wards the prisoner stabbed me in the face—I saw the prisoner just before I received the blow—he was not many yards from me when I pushed his <hi rend="italic">mate</hi>down—he struck at me almost directly after—I did not see any thing in his hand before he struck me—I only felt the blow in my face, and felt something jar—I then collared him and threw him down, and while he was down I saw the blade of a cl✗sp knife in his hand—I said, "I am stabbed, " and give him in charge of the constable—I charged him with having stabbed me in his presence—I went in doors, and had my face washed with warm water—I found my right cheek was cut—the knife had struck against the bone—I went to the doctor's and had it strapped up—after they got the prisoner in doors, he said Massey had given him the knife to stab Hall, the constable, with.</p>

                  </hi>I am ostler at the Coach and Horses public-house, at Hounslow. I was in the house on this night—the prisoner came up to the door with others—the constable was inside—he comes round once every hour—the constable persuaded them to go away, as they could not have any thing to drink—they resisted, and said they would not go till they did have something—after a good deal of persuasion they began to abuse the constable, and he began to push them away—Savage was feeding the horses—they pushed towards the horses—he went to push one of them away, and the prisoner then struck him on the right cheek—I was not close enough to see if he had any thing in his hand—I was going towards them, and heard Savage say, "I am stabbed"—I met Savage, with his face bleeding—I brought the prisoner into the house—he said to Hall, "Massey gave me the knife to stab you with"—there was a person named Massey with the prisoner at the time of the scuffle.</p>

                  </hi>I am a constable. I was at the Coach and Hones public<lb></lb>house on this Sunday morning, and saw the prisoner and two more outside—I was inside when they began knocking at the door—I went out to them, and begged them to go away quietly, as it was a late hour and they could not have any beer then—they began abusing me, and still kept knocking—when I found they would not go away, I caught hold of Massey and pulled him from the door—they then commenced a fight, and while I was keeping Massey back I heard Savage halloo out, "I am stabbed"—I was a distance off—I went to him, and found his cheek bleeding very much he gave charge of the prisoner—I brought him into the house, and while I was searching him he said, "Massey gave me the knife to stab you"—I produce the knife which I found in his pocket—I afterwards apprehended Massey, but the Magistrate discharged him—I did not see any blood on the knife—I saw Savage's cheek—it bled very much, and after I secured the prisoner I took him to the doctor's—it appeared to be cut two ways—it appeared to have been made by a knife like this.</p>

                  </hi>I am a surgeon, and live at Hounslow. On Sunday morning, the 21st of December, I saw Savage at two o'clock—I examined his right cheek, and found a triangular wound just over the cheek-bone—I did not probe it—I examined it care<lb></lb>fully—it appeared to have been inflicted by a sharp instrument—the knife produced is very capable of inflicting such a wound—it appeared to go down to the bone—the triangular shape must have been caused by the knife striking against the bone, and glancing—there was no con<lb></lb>tusion.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, I work for Mr. Dickson. On the 5th of October I was at work up stairs in Mr. Dickson's house about three o'clock in the afternoon, I heard a screaming in the street, I looked out of the window, I saw Mrs. Dickson and the prisoner scuffling together, they were about twenty yards from the door, I could not distinguish what was said. I saw the prisoner lay his hand upon Mrs. Dickson's breast to shove her away from him; she had hold of the flap of his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is this window that you were looking out - A. I was looking out of the two pair front, I could see distinctly all this. She would not let him go; the prisoner fell down, and the flap of his coat<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181110300022"></xptr>came off with a pair of shoes in the pocket. I could see the heels sticking out of the pocket distinctly, in the pocket of that flap that came off. I saw Mrs. Dickson come back to the shop with the shoes in the pocket of the flap that came off. I did not come down until I saw the man go down the Commercial-road.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to come down sooner when you saw the man scuffle with Mrs. Dickson - A. I had not time, it was done so quick. When I came down stairs I went out of the house and turned the corner of the Commercial-road, two captains had hold of the prisoner; he was brought back to the shop by them, and then the prisoner had only one flap to his coat, he asked for the flap. The shoes were taken to the office in the pocket of the flap of his coat. I did not examine the shoes until I came to Shadwell office, then I knew them to be Mr. Dickson's property.</p>

               <p>Q. How lately before this had you been in your shop - A. About a quarter of an hour. Griffiths looked out of the window, he said it was my wife scuffling with a man in the street; I ran down stairs, my wife had come back when I came down; the shoes were in the pocket of the flap, on the counter. I went out of doors, turned the corner of the Commercial-road, I saw two captains had got him; he was brought back to the shop. I sent for an officer; he begged me to let him go; he begged hard for the flap of his coat, to sew it on, the officer would not let him have it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife here - A. No, she is not in a fit state to come. The prisoner came to me on the day before and made application for work; I told him I would give him a winters seat of work if he suited me, if he could get himself a lodging; he asked me if I could recommend him; I told him no, I would not recommend any one; he said he would come to-morrow morning; he came about twelve o'clock, I was then in the shop, he told me he could not get a lodging, could I recommend him one; I told him no, I would not; the prisoner said, as you are going to dinner I will go and seek for one; I said, when you get one I will employ you. The shoes were in the window, he took the shoes up two or three times to look at; he said, they are very good shoes; I said, yes, they are, and if you make as good you will suit me. Then afterwards he went out of the shop, I never saw any more of him until the time that I have spoken of before.</p>
               <p>Q. When you examined the shoes at the office that were in the pocket of the coat, do you mean to swear that these shoes were the same which the prisoner had been looking at in your shop, and upon which he made the observation that they were good - A. Yes; I am sure they are the same, because they were cut particularly high for a customer, and they are higher than the other shoes. These are the shoes, I know they are mine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 74.) I went with Thompson to look for Cherry and Kemp, on Sunday morning, the 1st of Dec.—I took Cherry into custody in Petticoat-lane about half-past eleven—I told him he need not say anything unless he liked, but I was going to take him into custody, on a charge of breaking into Mr. Lamb's house, in Somer<lb></lb>ford-street—he said he did not have the selling of the things, that they were taken to Mrs. Kemp's house; that they got in by removing two of the tiles off the coal-shed, then they removed some portion of the brick<lb></lb>work from the side of the door-post, and Kemp put his arm through, and unbolted the door; that after they had taken the things, they took and buried them under the railway-arch at the back of Mr. Sutton's fac<lb></lb>tory; and about a quarter-past seven, they gave a boy named Blaney a penny, to carry them as far as the Bethnal-green-road, where he would carry them no further, and that they then took them to Kemp's house<lb></lb>after I had charged him at the station-house, on putting him into the cell, he turned round and said, "I do not see why Kemp should not be taken as well as me; for I had only 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the money the things were sold for"—he then told me I could find Kemp at the Blue Ball public-house, in Long-alley, Moorfields—between ten and eleven o'clock the same night I went and found Kemp in bed—I told him he need not say anything unless he liked, for Cherry had said enough already—he said, that if Cherry had turned <hi rend="italic">snitch</hi>, he did not mean to do it—I expect that means <hi rend="italic">informer</hi>
                  <lb></lb>after I brought him down stairs, his mother, the prisoner Charlotte Kemp kissed him, and said, "Mind you don't do it," twice—I took him to the station-house in Arbour-square—on the following day, Monday, the 2nd, Cherry came to the cell-door at Lambeth-station, and said, that the shawl which Mrs. Kemp had on the day previous, and that morning, was one of the shawls that were stolen from Mr. Lamb's—(Mrs. Kemp was not by at that time; she was up at the Castle public-house)—he also said, that if it had not been for Mrs. Kemp and his mother, he should not have been in this trouble, and he meant to tell the whole truth about it—I then went up to the Castle public-house, where Mrs. Kemp, Durell, and two more were—Durell had then left the Castle—I called Mrs. Kemp out, and asked her what she had done with the shawl that she had on that morning—she said she had given it to her husband to pledge, and that he was gone down to the police-court to see whether the boy had had his hearing or not—she then went down with me to the Court, where Durell (who she is living with and calls her husband) was—I asked him where the shawl was that she had given him—he said at first that he had no shawl—he then said he had pledged it—I asked him where the ticket was, or where it was that he had pledged it—Mrs. Kemp then said, "Give it to him, for it is the only thing they have against me"—he then pulled off his hat, and this shawl fell from it—I then placed Charlotte Kemp with the rest—she said she had pledged the shawl, and taken it out again, but she had done it inno<lb></lb>cently—on the following Tuesday I found a pair of trowsers at the wit<lb></lb>ness Dobbs', in Horseshoe-alley—Mr. Lamb was with me at the time, and owned them—I desired Dobbs not to say anything, or to give the trowsers up till he saw me again—on the following Thursday I took durell out of the Blue Ball public-house, and took him into custody—he asked me</p>

               <p>if I had found oany more of the things—I said I had, a pair of trowsers—said he had a pair of trowsers at the chandler's shop up above—I told him I did not know how that come, for they were owned by Mr. Lamb as part of the property that was stolen from him—he then said he had bought them in Petticoat-lane for 14 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; but he did not give any description of the person or name that he had bought them of—I then brought him to the station in Arbour-square, and after I had charged him, on his being put into the cell, he said, "They have got me, but they have not got any of the property but the trowsers, and that is the only thing against me"—when Cherry gave me the account of breaking into the house he said it was at about two o'clock al the 2nd, and that they had previously been to the Pavilion theatre together that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chandler, and live at No. 3, Horseshoe-alley, Wilson-street, Finsbury. Durell came to me on the 25th of Nov., and brought me this pair of trowsers, which he left as a security for some goods which he had to the amount of sixpence—I considered they were of very little value—it would be a difficult matter to get sixpence on them—he said he gave either 14 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 15 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them in Petticoat-lanes—I afterwards them up to the policeman—I cannot say on what day—it might be a week or a fortnight after.</p>

I saw Mrs. Kemp at the police-station on the 2nd of Dec.—I asked her if she had seen her boy—she said she had, and spoken to him, and he told her to go away on account of the shawl she had on—I asked her what about the shawl—she said it was one belonging to the stolen things, that she took it off; and gave it to Durell, and he put it into his hat—I have not known Mrs. Kemp long, only since my boy has got into company with, her boy and her—she enticed my boy away from his home—she is living with Durell.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I was present at John Kemp's examination before Mr. Norton, the Magistrate—what he stated was read over to him—no threat or promise was made to induce him to make any confession—he afterwards made his mark to it in my presence—this is the statement, and this is Mr. Norton's writing—I also heard Cherry examined, and he signed his name—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The prisoner, John Kemp, says, 'When we got the things we took them to my mother's, but she was a-bed, and asleep; and when she got up we had very nearly disposed of all the things, and what was left she ordered us to take out of the place directly;' the pri<lb></lb>soner Cherry says, 'What Kemp says is true; when Mrs. Kemp awoke, she ordered us to take the things out."</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Kemp's Defence.</hi> We were going past Mr. Lamb's, about half-past six, to go to Mr. Dunbar's, the match-maker's, to try and get employment; in crossing the Lamb-fields, Cherry stopped, and stooped down to tie his shoe; and he said to me, "Kemp, this gate looks as if it is open, there is only a brick against it;" I pulled a congreve match out of my pocket, and lit it; I pulled the gate, and it came open; on lighting the match, me and Cherry looked inside, and saw a pair of boots, and several articles lying just inside the gate in the shed; we took what things there were, tied them up, carried them across Lamb-fields, and left them till it was day<lb></lb>light; light; we gave a boy named Blaney a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to carry them to Bethnal-green-road for us.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Leytdnstone Road, West Ham, and am superintendant of police on the Great Eastern Railway—on Thursday 17th June, a few minutes before 6 o'clock in the evening, I was in Leytonstone Road—I saw Green there—he is an assistant boiler maker in the employ of the railway company at Stratford—I saw him go into the shop of Wade, who is a zinc worker—I followed him in with detective Harris—I saw Green standing in' the shop—I said, "What have you brought here?" he replied, "This,", holding up a piece of plank that he had—in his hand—I said, I believe you have some of the company's property about you ".—he made no reply—I told Harris to search him—Harris unfastened his coat and vest, and I saw suspended round his neck this square canvas bag, which contained a quantity of copper, screws, and other matters—this piece of perforated copper Harris took from his left hand trousers pocket—I then charged him with stealing the copper the property of the company, and Harris took him to the station—I remained behind in Wade's shop with a constable—I had the shop searched, and a large quautity of copper was found which I believed to be the property of the company, it weighed 1 cwt. 19 lbs. altogether—it is copper that is used in that form on the railway works—Wade was not there at the time it was found, he came in about an hour after, I was then waiting outside and followed him in—I told him that I had found a large quantity of copper that had been stolen from the Great Eastern-Company, could he give any account of it—he replied, "I bought it of a man," I then gave him into Harris's custody for receiving the property—the copper was found in a part of the shop where the shutters are kept closed, underneath some zinc and other metal—I was at the station when the sergeant read the charge to both the prisoners—Green made no reply to it—Wade said, I bought it of that man," pointing to Green—Wade did not produce any invoice or any books referring to the copper—I inquired of his wife, but not in his presence.</p>

Green has been in. the company's service between ten and twelve months—I do not think he has been a respectable man during that time—I will tell you what I have heard, if you wish it—there are a great many workmen there, and a good deal of copper lying about—the value of that found in the bag is between 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

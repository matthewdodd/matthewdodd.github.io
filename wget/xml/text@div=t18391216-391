On the night of the 7th of December I saw some silver in the back part of my till, beyond the money partition, among the loose bills and papers, &amp;c, not where I kept my money—in consequence of which, I marked the money, and returned it to the same place—next morning the prisoner came, as usual, for the key of the bar—I followed him down, and as I was standing in my parlour, in the dark, I saw him go to the till, and put his hand to the back where the marked money was—I kept watch on the till that no one else should go to it—my servant came down with a light—I went away from the spot for a time, and then returned—the prisoner came out of the bar—I then examined the till, and the marked money was gone—I bad locked up the bar over night, before I went to bed—I de<lb></lb>livered the prisoner the key in the morning—no one but him had access to the till.</p>

On Monday morning the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge, and proposed to him to searched—he took the money out of his pocket himself, and put it on the table—the prosecutor selected one shilling and one sixpence, which he said he had marked on Saturday night—I asked the prisoner if that was his money—he said yes—I then asked him if he had received any money of the prosecutor since he had been there—he said, no, and I took him into custody.</p>

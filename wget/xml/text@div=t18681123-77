                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 9). On the evening of 26th October, about 7.40, I saw the three prisoners in Church Row, Horselydown—they were standing talking together by the side of two vans—Turner got on one van and drove off—as they were passing me I saw a cask lying at the tail of the van—the other two prisoners were following after the van—I followed it into Goat Street, where it stopped—Turner got off the seat, went to the back of the van, the other two prisoners came up, and the three lowered the cask to the ground from the van—Turner then got on to the van and drove away—Scotcher and Clearey rolled the cask into the back yard of Mr. Johnson's, a marine store dealer, whose place has since been burnt down—after they had rolled it in, Clearey said to Scotcher, "Do you think she is tight?"—Scotcher said, "She is tight enough, come on"—they then went across Johnson's yard into his house at the back—I ran round to the front—I saw Scotcher come out, and followed him down Free School Street, Charles Street, and Church Road, where he again joined Turner, who was then there by the two vans—they got on, one to each van, and drove off</p>

               <p>into Church Street—they stopped behind a van there—Clearey was then standing by his own van—they all three conversed together, and then went into the Old Giant beer-shop—I immediately went to the police-station for assistance—Scotcher came out of the beer-shop, and went towards Johnson's yard, where the barrel had been left—I took him into custody, and told him I should charge him with stealing a cask or barrel, I could not say what it contained at the time, which had just been left at Mr. Johnson's—Clearey was not present then—Scotcher was taken to the station—I then returned to the beer-shop and found Clearey and Turner drinking together—I said "I shall take you into custody for stealing a cask or barrel, which you have; just left at Mr. Johnson's premises"—the both said, "I know nothing about it. I have not left one there"—they were taken to the station—I after<lb></lb>wards went to Johnson's, and he was then in the act of loading the cask into his cart, which he said he was going to take to the police-station—he took it there, and it has since been identified—I have not the least doubt about the three prisoners, I knew them before by sight.</p>

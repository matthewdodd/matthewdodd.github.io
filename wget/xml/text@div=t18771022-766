I live at 28, Rutland Street—I am the wife of Charles Smith—about last Saturday month the prisoner came into our shop and said, "Will you sign the name of Mary Ann White for me on the back of this cheque, as I cannot write?"—I did so—that is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and that is my writing—she was a customer.</p>

Christian Street, and am a publican—on 3rd August prisoner came and asked me to cash this check for her—she did not say how she got it—she said it belonged to a woman she was housekeeping for—I do not remember her giving any name—the second name on the back is mine—the endorsement, "Mary Ann White," was on it when I cashed it.</p>

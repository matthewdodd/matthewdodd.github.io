                  </hi>. I am a farmer's man, in the employ of Mr. Hunt, of Hayes. On the 18th of December, I was going home from work, and overtook the prisoner—I did not know her before she asked me how far it was from Uxbridge—I said four miles—she rolled up against me, and put her hand into my pocket, and took the shilling—I had my hand in my waist, coat pocket—we had not been talking at all—the shilling was in my left<lb></lb>hand trowsers pocket—it was unbuttoned—I was not standing still till the took the shilling—I stood about a minute, then I asked her for the shilling—she would not give it me, but told me to get away—I caught hold of her band—I had not been playing with her—she fell in the struggle, and called Scott, a man that was a little way before her—he was coming back, and then she hallooed "Murder," and the petrol came up.</p>

               <p>five o'clock in the evening—I had seen the prisoner and prosecutor before, and the other man—I passed the lane and saw the mass at the time—I went on, and saw the prosecutor and prisoner standing stills, and did not hear any noise, nor see any struggle—I passed on fifty yards—I heard screams of "Murder" from a woman—I rode back, and asked what was the matter—the man was coming up from the end of the lane—the woman said the prosecutor was ill-using her; he said he was not she had robbed him—I took her and the man into custody, but the man was discharged; he said she belonged to him.</p>

I was going on the road to Liverpool, with my cousin Scott—I went into a beer-shop to ask if I could get a bed there—this young man overtook me, and he offered me the shilling for a certain purpose, which I would not allow, and then he demanded the shilling back—I would not give it him, and he said I had robbed him.</p>

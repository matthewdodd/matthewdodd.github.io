             (Police-constable E 85). On the 12th of August, I was in the <placeName id="t18320906-33-crimeloc204">Quadrant, Regent-street</placeName>

               <p>PETER FERRARO. This is my handkerchief - it has my name on it; I had not observed the prisoners till the officer seized them.</p>

             (Police-constable C 31). I saw the prisoners; we had them in sight about thirty minutes - they were close together; they stopped several times when people were passing, and then they went on again - I took Smith; he got from me, and ran about forty yards - I took him again.</p>
               <p>Aker's Defence. I had been to my sister's to get my clean shirt to go to Mr. Jackson, in Smithfield, my employer - my sister was not at home; and as I was coming back down Regent-street, the officer took me - I asked him what for; he said he had got me; I saw some one run and throw the handkerchief down - the officer pulled me up against the shutters, took up the handkerchief, and said I stole it, which is false - I had never seen Smith before; I was on the curb-stone, making room for people to pass.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOBBS. Akers dropped the handkerchief from his hand when I put my hand on his shoulders - itwas near the shutters.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I was walking along, the man came, took hold of me, and said, "I have got you;" I swung out of his hand, because I knew I had done nothing.</p>

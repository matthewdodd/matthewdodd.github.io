            . On Sunday afternoon, the 13th of May, about half past three o'clock, I left my house; my wife and me and the child went out together to spend the evening, and left Mr. Dobbs and Mr. Lee in the house up stairs, in their own room; these young men had one key and we the other. I returned at half past eight in the evening, I found the door locked as usual; I took the key out of my pocket and opened the door with it.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nothing amiss with the lock - A. Nothing at all; it is a spring lock, there is no latch; the door was single locked. As soon as I opened the door I saw two men, they stood before me, close by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not dark then - A. Not quite dark; it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060006"></xptr>was so dark within doors that I could not tell who they were by their faces; they both of them instantly rushed out by me; I was alone; as they passed me they dropped a small dark lanthorn. This lanthorn gave me full reason to believe they were thieves.</p>
               <p>Q. What business do you carry on in your house - A. None at all. I am a porter to Miller, Berry and Co. King-street, Cheapside. I instantly cried out, stop thief; I kept them in sight, and ran after them as far as the top of Tabernacle-row, very near; they ran together; when they got near the top of Tabernacle-row the prisoner turned round and rushed back by me again; I turned round after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite positive that you kept them both in your sight till they both got to the top of Tabernacle-row - A. I kept them both in my sight. The prisoner rushed back by me again, the other got out of my sight, up the road; I turned round after the prisoner, I still cried out stop thief, and kept my eyes upon him all the while; after he passed me about twenty yards he was stopped by a gentleman, his name is Pearce, I got up to him, and, with assistance, took him to Worship-street; Armstrong searched him in my presence, and took out of his pocket a small bag containing thirteen picklock keys, a steel crow he took out of his pocket, also a small box, and a red leather pocket book; the prisoner said the pocket book was his own; he took from him a watch and some silver, I believe he returned him the silver. When the prisoner was secured I went home with Mr. Armstrong and others about nine o'clock. When I first ran after the prisoner the door was left open, on my way other office I returned to my house then with the prisoner and told the people that was the house where I lived, and where I had found the prisoner. I locked the door and took the prisoner to Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. After having secured the prisoner, when you came from the office you found the door locked as you had left it, did not you - A. Yes; I opened the door with my own key; Armstrong, my wife, and two or three more went in with me; we first went into the parlour, we saw on the floor, close by the door, a black canvas bag, Armstrong asked if the bag was ours.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bag yours - A It was not. I never saw the bag before to my knowledge. Armstrong took out of the bag a tea caddie with some tea, and a silver shell in it, he also took out of it a shawl, six napkins, an ironing blanket, and a piece of wrapper about the same size.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any of these yours - A. Yes, all my property, they were in my house when I left it, about three in the afternoon; the tea caddie was on the dining table in the parlour, and the tea and the shell, the napkins were wrapped up in the ironing blanket, and the piece of wrapper was with it, they were in the closet in the parlour when we went out of the house We then went up stairs into my lodgers room, the lodgers were out, they lodged in the one pair of stairs; when we got into the room we found Mr. Dobbs's box, the ead of it was thrown open; we examined the lock, we found it had been broken open with a crow; Armstrong asked the lodgers names, I told him; he said very likely the pocket book had been taken out of that box. Lee and 
               <persName id="t18100606-5-person92">Dobbs</persName>
             both lodged in one room; we examined all over the house, we lost a silver tea spoon, and two plated spoons, but never recovered them.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street office. On Sunday the 13th of May, about nine o'clock, I received charge of the prisoner from Mr. Davis, at the public house next door to the office; I said I would search him; he said Mr. Armstrong, I will give up all to you; I searched him, in his coat pocket was this bag, with the major part of these keys in it, one or two might be loose in his pocket, the India-rubber was loose in one of his pockets, and this crow in his waistcoat or coat pocket; this phosphorus, in his putting his hand, this came out, I picked it up, with one piece of match in it. One of these parts of the lanthorn was given me by some gentleman accompanying Mr. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at these two pieces of the dark lanthorn and tell me whether that was the lanthorn that fell at your door - A. The lanthorn dropped down in two pieces; I had not time to examine it. I believe this to be the same lanthorn, it fell in two pieces.</p>
               <p>Armstrong All that I found about the prisoner were the matches, keys, and phosphorus; I then searched his breast pocket of his coat, I found this red pocket hook, he at that time said it was his; I saw some papers in it, but no bank notes; there was in it a ticket of she mill wrights company, and a bill and receipt in Dobb's name; after I had found these things I locked the prisoner up, I went with the prosecutor, and a number of gentlemen accompanied me to his house, the door was unlocked, and in the parlour, just as I turned in, this bag laid on the floor, I opened it and turned these things out, which Mr. Davis said was his; here is the tea-caddie and the shall I went up stairs, and in a minute Bishop came to me; he was placed at the back of the house; I found a box wrenched open.</p>
               <p>Q. Would such an instrument as that crow wrench it open - A. Yes; the hasp appeared to have been forced out; Mr. Dobbs was not there. I took care of this pocket book, hearing his name was Dobbs, I have had it in my custody ever since. The next morning Mr. Dobbs appeared, he said he had lost pocket book; I then took Mr. Davis, Bishop, the prisoner, and one or two gentlemen that were there into the parlour at the side of the office; I had the prisoner stripped; I searched his clothes and could not find any thing; I got hold of his coat, I rubbed the collar, sleeves, and breast part, and at the lower part of the breast I heard some paper rattle; I pulled them out and it was eleven one pound bank notes, I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Davis. Look at these things - A. The caddie and silver shell is my husband's property, the shawl is my sisters, she left it at my house; I washed it; the napkins are my property; they were all in my house when I left it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dobbs. Look at that pocket book, is it yours - A. It is my pocket book, I know it by my own hand-writing; the mill-wrights ticket and the letter addressed to me is there.</p>
               <p>Q. You say at least there were nine one pound notes in it, you believe more - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I leave it entirely to the mercy of the court.</p>

               <p>street, the window was not open—some one opened the door to him, and he came into the room—he said to his wife, "Where have you been?"—she said she had been with me to look after the other children—he said, "You might have come home and looked at the baby first"—I said the baby was all right; and there were other persons present who said the baby was all right, and had been very good—he was cross for some time—I almost forget what he said, there were some other words between them—he said he would have his tea at home—I advised him to have tea at Mr. Bur<lb></lb>ton's, as Mr. Fearon was waiting there for us—he objected to it for some time, but afterwards he agreed to it—he said he would prefer having his tea at home, but the children were playing with some fruit, and I advised him to leave them as they were very good, and go to Mr. Burton's; at last he said, "Very well, I will have a wash and go"—we all three then left the house—I was rather before them—we went on foot to Whitechapel, it rained very hard, and the prisoner said, "Are we to get wet? shall we have a <hi rend="italic">cab?</hi>"—we had a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and rode in it to Mr. Burton's house—the pri<lb></lb>soner appeared rather cheerful till we got to Mr. Burton's house, and then the horse shied, and nearly turned us over; and the prisoner never offered to save us, which seemed very remarkable for him—we jumped out while the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was going on, but he never put out his hand to save us—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was not quite overturned—we all got out—it was about 4 o'clock, or a little after, when we got to Mr. Burton's; we first went into the sitting room where the tea things were prepared, all three of us—Mrs. Corrigan and I directly left the sitting room to go into the bed room, to take our wet clothes off—we left in the sitting room Mr. and Mrs. Burton, the two Mr. Marleys, Mr. Fearon, and the prisoner—the bed room is on the same floor as the sitting room, a small passage divides them—we did not shut the bed room door—we had not been in the bed room a minute when I observed the prisoner come on to the landing which separates the two rooms—I was speaking to his wife—there is a gate at the top of the stairs, which shuts with a spring, to prevent the children from falling down the stairs; it is on the first floor, above the parlour—I thought the prisoner was opening that gate, because there was a sound like the gate clicking—I did not know what it sounded like, but I thought he was opening the gate—the deceased said, "Who is that?"—no answer was given—I said, "Who is that? is that you, <hi rend="italic">Tom?</hi>"—by <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> I meant the prisoner—the passage was rather dark, he made no answer, but came into the room, walking hastily—I was standing close to commenced striking her—I rushed towards them and tried to separate them, but I could not, the prisoner had his back towards me—he was rather to the left, the deceased was more to the right, I put up my hands and felt a slight pain in my arm, I did not notice it for the moment, but still kept screaming out for help—I began screaming for help directly the prisoner began to strike his wife—I felt that my hand Mrs. Corrigan—he separated me and Mrs. Corrigan, and threw her towards the child's bed—I rushed up to them, and said, "What do you mean; what are you doing?"—he then threw her on to the child's bed, and commenced striking her—I rushed towards them and tried to separate them, but I could not, the prisoner had his back towards me—he was rather to the left, the deceased was more to the right, I put up my hands and felt a slight pain in my arm, I did not notice it for the moment, but still kept screaming out for help—I began screaming for help directly the prisoner began to strike his wife—I felt that my hands were wet, I looked at them and found they were all over blood—I became alarmed and rushed out of the room—Mrs. Corrigan began to scream directly the prisoner began to strike her—she was lying on the bed with her face uppermost, and he appeared to be striking her about the body, I could not say where, with his right hand—I was not aware that he had anything in his hand—I was so frightened that I rushed down stairs—Mr. Marley overtook me on the staircase—I told him what had happened, and rushed down stairs towards Mr. Cook's, the</p>

               <p>surgeon's, holding my arm, which was bleeding—I heard footsteps behind me on the stairs, but did not look behind me—when I had got four doors from Mr. Burton's, I heard the deceased's voice—she said, "Betsy, Betsy"—I turned my head, and begged Mr. Marley to go to her—I saw her behind me—she appeared to be fainting—she fell upon the steps of a house in the street—I went on, and went into Mr. Cook's—I was about having my arm dressed, when the deceased was brought in by Tour men—she was brought into the surgery where I was sitting—I felt very ill, and left the room—I was not present when she died—I have known the prisoner between eleven and twelve years—when I saw him the morning after Christmas day, as he was leaving, he had been drinking all night, at least, I cannot say all night; he had been drinking, but he had had a wash, and appeared somewhat refreshed—I saw him drink before I went to bed—he had a wash in the morning, and appeared better, but I do not suppose he had exactly recovered from the drink by his appearance—he appeared to know what he was about—I merely said "Good morning" to him—he had had his breakfast before we came out of the bedroom—when he got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in the afternoon, he appeared under the influence of drink, but he had had a wash, and was again refreshed; still he had been drinking—we could discern that the instant he came to the window, because he looked wild about the eves, which he generally did if he had been drinking—he was in the habit of drinking—I have known the prisoner and his wife living together for about seven years—we only knew them a part of the time—I believe they lived rather unhappily together—we were not in the" habit of visiting their house—I do not think they were living very happily.</p>

               <p>supper they were about to retire, but it being wet I persuaded the females to go up stairs to bed, instead of going out into the wet—there was some drinking going on during the night, but not more than you would find in the most rational society that was ever formed—the prisoner breakfasted hurriedly in the morning—I saw him drink some cocoa, I believe—I do not think I spoke to him—he was hurried to get to business, and stood with the cup in his hand while I passed from one room to the other—he did not appear intoxicated then—I cannot say that he was intoxicated when the females retired to rest, but he looked remarkably strange at some part of the night, after the females had retired—I saw him again somewhere about half past 2 o'clock, that same day—he came up stairs at my house, and said, "Where is my mistress?"—I said, "In the other room," but she was not there—he then left the house, and I saw no more of him until about 4 o'clock, when they came in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not see Mrs. Fearon and Mrs. Corrigan go into the bedroom—the prisoner came into the adjoining room, the sitting room—the first thing of any importance that I heard was some screaming—that was two minutes, or not so much after the prisoner had come into the room, it was what a person would call immediately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in the Minories. On Wednesday evening, 26th Dec., I went with Mr. Burton to Aldgate Church, and saw the body of Mrs. Corrigan—I did not see her at my surgery—she had been removed from there to the Church—she had then been dead about two hours—I examined the body, and found three wounds, one on the top of the left shoulder, about an inch and a half in length, and about half an inch deep; one on the inner side of the shoulder, about an inch long, and super<lb></lb>ficial; and the third on the inner and upper part of the left breast; that was about an inch long, and in depth to the breast bone—I traced that wound with a probe, and found that the instrument had entered the cavity of the chest—by the direction of the Coroner, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exami<lb></lb>nation of the body—continuing my investigation of the wound, I found that the instrument had struck the bag that covers the heart—I laid it open, and then came to the heart itself—I found in it a longitudinal wound,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185602040038"></xptr>
               <p>about half an inch long, and nearly a quarter of an inch in depth; which wound was the cause of death—they were such wounds as might have been occasioned by a knife of this kind—it would require some force to make a knife penetrate to that part of the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you had not known any of the parties until you were called in on this unhappy occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the disease called <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> is the result of a constant habit of drinking—I think it is a disease which generally gives signs of its coming for hours before—it depends upon the stage of the disease whether it produces entire delusion—it does in extreme cases produce entire delusion upon every subject—it is generally the case that when a person has been subject to attacks of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, a very little will excite another attack—a swollen appearance about the pupil of the eye would be one of the signs of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—it is gene<lb></lb>rally one of the symptoms—it shows the state of the brain—I mean the swollen appearance of the eyelid—a fulness and prominence of the eye is indicative of the state of the brain—I am speaking of a swollen appearance of the eye itself—a swollen and wild appearance of the eye is one of the indicia of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—I have seen cases of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—a thick perspiration on the face or lip is an indication of it—it is mentioned by writers as a strong indication of it—there is an extreme state of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> which is decided insanity—that is the cane where a man requires five or six persons to hold him down and control him—he is perfectly unconscious of what he says or does; and when he recovers, if you ask him if he is cognizant of anything he said or did, he will tell you he was not aware of it—some kinds of insanity may be cured, even such insanity as, while it lasts, prevents a person from knowing the' difference be<lb></lb>tween right and wrong—there are forms of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> in which a person does not know the difference between right and wrong—unless I saw a patient while under a fit of that kind, I should not be able to tell from any description.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person to have been labouring, upon a previous occasion, under <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, what effect would drinking all night have upon him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would have a tendency to throw him into the same state—the drink would reproduce it—<hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> follows upon drunkenness—it often occurs after a person has been drinking exces<lb></lb>sively that taking away the stimulant will produce <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—sometimes a fit of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> lasts for days, at other times but for hours—it all depends upon whether you are able to procure sleep—if you procure sleep, the disease generally subsides at once.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does a person labouring under <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> from intoxication of necessity not know right from wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not necessarily, I think—it may come on during intoxication, during excessive drinking, and it may also come on by the stimulus being withdrawn—a great deal depends upon the consti<lb></lb>tution—an attack generally comes on within about twenty-four hours after the stimulant has ceased—I find persons suffering under <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> labouring under delusions, and expressing those delusions—if a man had been drinking at night, and went to his business in the morning with nothing the matter with him, <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> might come on the same afternoon, if he had been drinking excessively the night before, and been in want of sleep and rest.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although he had exhibited no signs of delusion in any way whatever, will you say that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it might come on after excess—delusion is a part of the effect of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremena</hi>—after the disease is set in and established, then delusion is manifest—I have seen several cases of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—I have remarked in extreme cases of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> that there is an absence of the knowledge of right and wrong; for instance, I go and find a man requiring five or six persons to hold him down, and prevent his doing himself some bodily harm, and everything he says and does is inconsistent—generally in <hi rend="italic">delirium tremena</hi> the party who com<lb></lb>mits an act of violence is labouring under the delusion that somebody is about to hurt him—that is a very frequent delusion—I have met with a case where a man would fancy that the police were after him, and he would jump out of bed suddenly, and go the window, and break a pane of glass, and endeavour to get out, and if there had not been some one there to prevent him he would have thrown up the window, and precipitated him<lb></lb>self into the street—there would be a plain indication of delusion in that case—violent excitement from drink very much simulates a weak state of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—a man who is very intoxicated would have symptoms of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, but not all the symptoms—he would probably be very violent—you often see a man intoxicated in the street, requiring five or six policemen to take him to the station house, but that man is conscious nevertheless, and there is no tendency to injure himself—want of conscious<lb></lb>ness is one of the symptoms in extreme cases of <hi rend="italic">delirium trement</hi>—I never saw the prisoner until he was at the police court.</p>

               <p>Betsy, if you knew the anguish of my mind, I have no rest night or day now that I have come to my senses. Oh! Betsy, save me a lock of my poor Louisa's hair; now that she's gone, I would give anything to undo what I have done. Be kind to my poor helpless children, and the great God, that I trust in for mercy for my crime, will reward you. When you come up with my shirt, bring my blue waistcoat, and take the one I have got on away with you; you must get the most you can upon it for the children; also a collar or two, and my black necktie: if you can carry baby with you I should be glad to see her. Oh! Betsy, forgive me for what I have done, and beg of your father to do so too; none of your feelings, bad as they are, can be like mine, as I am the cause of all If you cannot come to<lb></lb>morrow, you cannot come till Monday; when, if you will bring a little butter with you, I shall be glad. Give my love to my poor father and sisters, and accept the same for yourself, from your heart broken and wretched brother-in-law. You most try and come at 12 o'clock.")—(" House of Detention, Friday night. My dear Mrs. Fearon,—In the midst of my dreary solitude I write to you, to beg you will forgive me for the injuries I inflicted upon you in my madness of Wednesday, though I honestly feel assured you believe they were accidental; but, my God, if I had wounded you in a vital part, as well as my wife, what would have been my torture to know that I had committed two murders. Let me beg of you to forgive me for the harass of body and mind I have caused you, and also Hannah, and your sister Lucy; tell them that I hope their fates may be happier than mine; give my kindest and best respects to them both; ask them not to hate me; tell them that I would not deliberately hurt a worm, either drunk or sober, much less go so blood thirsty to work as to buy the knife in cool blood to murder a woman. Little did I think when I bought it what would become of it; but it is done, and may God have mercy upon me for it. Give my respects to <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, and all who inquire after me. Thank them for their interest in my behalf. If you have an oppor<lb></lb>tunity, can you see <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, and ask him to exert himself about a counsel for me as soon as possible. I have written to <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Rose. I have never been very backward in assisting others, and among them all something may be done, but do not have Pelham; have somebody better than him: have a counsel for criminal cases, and send him to me before Thursday, so that he may meet the case at Arbour-square on Thursday morning, if possibla I will en<lb></lb>deavour to collect my energies together, and pray to God to give me strength to go through it all. Pray for me too; none of us know what hangs over our heads; who would have thought on Christmas night I should have been here now.

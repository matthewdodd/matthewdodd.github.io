                  </hi> I am in the employ of Joseph Page, when he has got work for me to do—on 3d November, I was acting as watchman for him, and left the premises safe at 10 o'clock at night—I tried the doors before I went to rest, but the windows I left to Mr. Page—about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by a scuffling under the window—I looked out, and saw the prisoner and Williamson the policeman scuffling—I saw them fall—the prisoner said to the policeman, "You b—, I will rive you some<lb></lb>thing"—the prisoner got away, and the policeman sprung his rattle, and called "Stop thief!"—when he was brought back, I went down stairs and found the shutters broken open, the bolts forced off, the catch off, a pane of glass broken, and everything had been shifted—the desks had been forced open—I picked up this bolt in the street, about half-past 7—it was missing from the shutters.</p>

On Saturday, 3d November, about 2 o'clock, I was on duty in King-street, Spitalfields, and met three men coming out of King-street—I stood at the dark entry of the court a few minutes, and saw them return again—I could not see at that distance that either of them was the prisoner, but they walked right up to Mr. Page's, and stood at the shutters, near a gateway—the third man was in the carriage-way—I do not know who he was—some females then came along the street, and they all walked under the railway-arch—in two minutes two of them returned—the prisoner was one of those two—they got up against the shutters again, and in about two minutes, one of them disappeared—I then saw the prisoner get partly into the counting-house window, but he came out again, stood on the pavement, and looked back in the street—he then got partly in again, and I ran up and caught him in that position—I did not see the other man get in at the window, but he was standing near it when he disappeared—the prisoner said, "If you don't let me go, you shall have it," striking with his fist—the other man then jumped out at the window—I struggled with the prisoner—his coat came off piece by piece, and he ran away—I ran after him, springing my rattle for about twenty yards, and saw him stopped by another policeman, without losing sight of him—I brought him back, and we found the shutters open, and one of the writing desks in the counting-house open.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer shop in South Street, Greenwich. On 23rd Jan., at 7 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and called for a pint of beer and a screw of tobacco—he wore a hat—I served him; he tendered me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I thought it was not good, and put it in the drawer by the side of the bowl, by itself, gave him change, and he left directly—as soon as his back was turned I examined the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and found it was bad; I ran after him, but turned the wrong way, and did not see him—I had seen him five or six times before that—he used to come in on Saturday night and have half a pint of beer, and <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> down 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the first time he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the first time I found bad money in the till—I bent the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and put it in a can by itself—I afterwards gave it to the policeman at the Court—on 13th Feb., he came again, at 7 o'clock—he usually came at that time, but sometimes a little earlier—he had on a cap then; he called for a pint of beer and a screw of tobacco, and gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I bent it before him, with my finger, and thumb; he put his hand in his pocket and produced 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he threw towards me—I said, "I have had enough of your bad money," and refused to take it—I asked a stone mason who was there to collar him—I went out, brought back a con<lb></lb>stable, and afterwards gave him both the shillings—he took about half the beer, and then filled his pipe, lighted it, and then threw down 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he then drank the remainder and went away—it was about three minutes before he paid me.</p>

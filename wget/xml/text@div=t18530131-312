                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, York-street, Walworth. On 18th Jan., about 2 o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner on Finsburypavement—she asked me for some beer—I told her I thought she had had enough, and she had better go home—she walked by my side to the corner of Fore-street; she pulled me two or three steps down Fore-street, and was standing in front of me when I felt a jerk at my waistcoat pocket—I put my hand to my pocket, found my watch gone, and the chain dangling down—I seized the prisoner, and said, "You have got my watch; give it me back; and I pulled her to the corner of the street, and called "Police!"—she did not make any answer, but commenced rolling about, and appeared very much intoxicated, and threw herself down on the pavement, near where there was a grating—I had had the watch half an hour before—it belonged to Mr. Charles</p>

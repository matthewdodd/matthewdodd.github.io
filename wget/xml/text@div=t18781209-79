About 12.20 on the morning of 17th November I was with Sergeant Witham—we stopped the prisoner and asked him if he had anything which did not belong to him, and he said No—Witham felt the outside of his coat and said "There is something hard inside"—I searched his breast pocket, and found this pewter measure—he said to Witham "Perhaps you put it there"—he was asked at the station his name and address—he said he should not give it—after he was charged, I went with Whitham and two other officers to 73A, Churchill Road, Junction Road, Islington, and Mr. Brown, the landlord, took us to the top room back, where I found on the mantelshelf this little box, covered with a piece of paper, which I removed, and found these two plaster-of-Paris moulds, one for making shillings, and the other for pennies—I found on the</p>

Speedy" on it, and on the second shelf these two pieces of metal, covered with paper, and this frying pan, with pieces of metal sticking to it, and Some other pieces which fit into the grooves of it—on the table I found this spoon with metal sticking to it, and this pair of pliers—this bag, three parts full of plaster-of-Paris, was under the table—I went back to the station with Witham—the prisoner was taken out of the cells, and the articles were on a table where he could see them—I said "Is your name Walter Cooper?" he said "Yes"—I said "Do you live at 73A, Churchill Road, Junction Road?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I have been with your landlord, and found those things at your lodging"—he said that he knew nothing about them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He appeared sober when I took him—he gave Witham his name and address, and I found he-had been there two nights before—I have heard from his landlord that a young man had been there one night—I did not hear anything about sleeping—I think the landlord said "I heard from my wife that the prisoner frequently had a young man staying with him"—I do not know that the young man we discharged was the young man who used to stay with the prisoner—I have seen him since in the Caledonian Road, a fortnight ago, and asked him how he was getting on, and if he had got any work—he said "No," and I passed on—I knew him before, he is an iron bedstead maker—I did not 'ask him if he knew the prisoner—I never mentioned the prisoner's name to him—I had never seen him in the prisoner's company before—I left the bag of plaster-of-Paris and the frying pan in the room, and when I went again two days afterwards the plaster-of-Paris was gone—the prisoner gave his address after I had searched his lodging, but he refused it when he was first charged—we got our information from the man we let go, upon whom we found nothing, or we. should have detained him—he gave his address.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I don't know his name, but it was taken and put down at the station; he did not give the same address as the prisoner—Clifford knew the prisoner's address I believe before he was brought in—I said before the Magistrate that the prisoner said "I have only known the man a few minutes," but it is not in my deposition because it was interposed in, the middle of Brown's evidence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 73A, Churchill Road—the prisoner lodged my second-floor back from 6th April till he was taken in custody—his sister paid the rent—he was the regular occupant <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the room, but a young man slept with him occasionally—I pointed that room out to the three officers on 17th November, and saw these two moulds found in a little tin to the best of my knowledge—there was a box on the mantel shelf; I am not positive whether it had a lid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I never saw the other man, but I knew from my wife that he slept with the prisoner occasionally—I do not know that he slept there on the Friday night before the prisoner was taken—my wife is not here—I saw a young man who called on Sunday, the 16th, between 10 and 11 a.m.—I let him in and did not see him go out again all day—I cannot say whether he was the man who was taken in custody and let go because I was not there—I heard one of the police say that they took another man in custody who was let go as they could not find anything on him—I don't remember the police saying that he gave the address of the prisoner, but I told them I thought it must be the same man—I believe the prisoner was at home and went out on the 16th after the young man called—I have never heard anything against the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the Victoria Tavern, King's Cross, for Mr. Baker—these two pewter measures are his—one has "Baker" on it, and the other "Speedy"—Mr. Speedy was the former proprietor—the prisoner was a frequent customer—I saw him drinking beer there on the night of the 16th from 9.30 to 11.30—these measures must have been taken from the back of the recess.</p>

                  </hi> I am Inspector of Coin to the Mint—bad money is frequently made from pewter pots—these are two moulds, one for making pence and the other for shillings—they are made of plaster-of-Paris, but I have seen pence cast in sand; this was never intended to do anything at all—this frying-pan has metal adhering to it now, and might be used to pour lead into the moulds, but it would be a clumsy way of doing it—these pliers have plaster-of-Paris sticking to them; they would hold a coin which was too hot to hold with the fingers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I have been connected with the Mint many years, and never saw such a set of things produced before in any coining case—I should say that a man had been trying to make something with them and did not succeed—the fact is he could not use these moulds; copper would break them by its excessive heat—both sides of a coin could not be com<lb></lb>pleted in one mould; if he wanted to make a cheap copy of the Queen's head it could be done, but I doubt if he could make either side in this penny mould—the shilling mould shows the same peculiarities precisely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. A bad shilling cannot be made in this mould because it is so badly made; the hot metal would run through it, and you would not get any impression, but you might stop it with a bit of grease.</p>

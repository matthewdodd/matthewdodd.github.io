            . I live with my parents, in George-lane, and work at a jewellers, in Great Queen-street; the prosecutor's cellar is under our house. On Monday, the 10th of December, about a quarter to nine o'clock, the prisoner came and asked for a light; my brother was at the door with me; he brought a truck, went into the cellar, and took away three bundles of cork on the truck; he had been there before, about cork; the cellar was not locked; my father has the care of it; the door is inside the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Does not your father keep the key? A. There is no lock; it is bolted; we have two lodgers - I had never seen him there before myself; he had a fustain coat on, I believe. When I was at the Mansion-house, I was desired to look among the prisoners for the man, and it was five minutes before I fixed on him - I passed him several times; my brother pointed him out, and then I knew him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you now say, you are sure he is the man? A. Yes - I always said so.</p>

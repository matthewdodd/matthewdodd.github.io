               <p>Recollect yourself, and say now, whether you are able to swear to them with certainty? - Yes, my lord.</p>
               <p>You are very positive? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You are very sure they were not pointed out to you, but that you pointed them out? - I did not see my body to point them out to me.</p>
               <p>Were there other persons there at the time? - Yes.</p>

               <p>In general I know, (do not suppose I am trifling with you, or making game of you, I should be above it) I know in general, persons in such a situation, their sight is weak? - It is as strong as any body would expect.</p>
               <p>From the ball of your eye being turned so much inward, it requires more exertion in you, and therefore exhausts the power of vision, more than in persons who look strait? - I can see to work at my business.</p>
               <p>What is that? - A <rs id="t17881022-23-viclabel108" type="occupation">shoemaker</rs>

               <p>That is not a business that requires very strong sight? - Yes, it does.</p>
               <p>This was about eight in the evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you had not seen either of the persons before? - No.</p>

               <p>And that you crest go to the justice's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To see the two men that they had found? - Yes, we went to see the watch first.</p>
               <p>Then of course, when you went to the justice's, you expected to find the two men that robbed you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were told so by the runners? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You fixed on these two men that were there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you equally sure to both the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might this be transacting? - The space of three minutes or more.</p>
               <p>You are equally sure to Pace, as you was to Scamp? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Though he, according to your account, was the man that was engaged with your brother? - Yes, I was not quite so sure, but I knew him again.</p>
               <p>What sort of hats had the men on that robbed you? - Round hats.</p>
               <p>Court. But if you was not quite so sure as to Pace, before the magistrate, as you was to Scamp, what makes you quite so sure now? - I should not pretend to swear to the other, because I was not so much with him as I was with the other that robbed me, but I knew his face again.</p>
               <p>But you say, you was not quite so certain as to Pace as you was to Scamp, was you quite so certain then? - No.</p>
               <p>What makes you then quite so certain now? - I shall not take an oath to the man.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that now you do not swear to Pace positively? - I swear to George Scamp.</p>
               <p>But you have already swore to Pace as being present when Scamp committed this robbery; are you sure that Pace was so present? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, you was not so sure as to Pace? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you are not quite sure as to Pace? - I know it is the man.</p>
               <p>Then you are now sure that Pace was the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But before the magistrate you was not quite so sure? - I did not pretend to swear to that man.</p>
               <p>You did not swear to him then before the magistrate? - No.</p>
               <p>What makes you swear to him now? - I know him very well.</p>
               <p>Then if you knew him very well before the magistrate, why did not you swear to him before the magistrate? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you not swear before the magistrate, that Pace was one of the two men? cannot you answer that question? - No, my lord.</p>
               <p>Did you or not, swear to Pace before the magistrate? you have swore to him now; did you swear to him then, is the question, what do you say in answer to that? - I said, that was the man.</p>
               <p>Then you swore it was the man before the magistrate, you said it upon your oath? Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you now finally say, that you swore before the magistrate, that Pace was one of the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you now swear that Pace was one the men, look at him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do swear it now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you do take your oath that he was one of the men? - Yes, I know him very well.</p>
               <p>Court. Let him go out of court, and not speak to any body.</p>

               <p>Did Scamp say any thing to that? - I will not be sure whether he did or not; Pace let go of me directly; and he asked me whether I had any money about me; I told him I had not; Pace said, we will shake hands with you; and he shook hands with me and went away.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoners, or either of them again? - On the Saturday following, this was on the Sunday; I saw the two prisoners on the Saturday following, at Mr. Wilmot's office.</p>
               <p>Were they in custody? - Yes, I knew them again when I saw them; I swore to both of them.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself, and say whether you took such observation of them at the time, as to be able to swear that these two prisoners are the men? - Yes, sir, I did.</p>
               <p>Was there light enough to observe their faces? - Yes, I saw them at the time, Pace had hold of me by the right arm.</p>
               <p>How were they dressed? - Pace had got a blue coat on, and the other had a lightish coloured coat on.</p>
               <p>How were they dressed when you saw them before the magistrate? - Scamp was dressed as he is now, and Pace had a blue coat on then.</p>
               <p>So that you have no doubt at all of the two prisoners being the men? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They were not with you above two or three minutes? - About five minutes; I was a little frightened; I had been told by the runners, that they had taken two men up; and I went, and saw them there.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker; I live with Mr. Davidson, in the Borough; I have a watch here, which I took of a man, but I know nothing of the prisoners; I took it in on Monday, the 13th of October; the watch and chain, just as it is, I lent seventeen shillings on it, which he asked for; I gave it to the constable.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to this office; I took the prisoners; Harper and Lucy were with me; it was last Friday night; they were both together in Islington-fields, by the side of the New River; it was between seven and eight; I searched Scamp, and found two duplicates on him; one of a silver watch, pawned at Mr. Davidson's; this is it; it appears October something, but it is a little defaced;

            , a watch, seventeen shillings; I asked Scamp how he came by this duplicate; he said, it was his own watch, and he had had it near three years; I searched the other, and found in his pocket, some small shot; and the next day I went to Davidson's, and found the watch in the Borough; there were three duplicates found on the other prisoner, but not relating to the business.</p>

               <p>I took this blue coat from the prisoner, Pace, off his back; Armstrong brought the duplicate; I had the care of one prisoner; and he took the other to search him; he asked Scamp whose watch it was; he said, it was his own; Armstrong asked him how long he had had it; and he said, for three years; when he came before the magistrate, he said, he bought it of a soldier.</p>

               <p>As I was going over Tower-hill, I met a sailor; he told me he was distressed; and he shewed me this duplicate; he said, he had pawned the watch for seventeen shillings; and he sold it me for five shillings to it, as I wanted a watch; I gave him four shillings for it.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Scamp called six witnesses; and the prisoner Pace, called eight witnesses, who gave them good characters.</p>

            : On the 30th of November, a little after eight in the evening, there was a noise in the window, as if the glass was breaking; I went out, but the window was not broke; there were three people round it, and the window not being broke, I did not suspect them; a short time after, the same noise was repeated again; I went out again, as before, and there were the same three persons at the window, but there was no window broke; when I went out, they went away different ways; about a quarter of an hour after, the same noise was repeated again; I went out again the third time, and saw the same three standing round the window; they went off in different directions, as before; I went to the window, but still did not perceive it broke; my master then gave me a small bill, and told me to go and pay it, about four doors lower down; upon coming back again, I saw the same three standing round the window, and heard the glass crack; they perceived me, and went away; I went up to the glass, and saw there was a piece of glass gone out of the corner; I then told my master the window was broke, and if he liked, I could take one out of the three; he told me by all means to take them, if I could; I directly followed them, they were all going up Holborn-hill together; Brown was a little before the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that these were the same three that you had seen at the window? - 
               <persName id="t18020113-93-person883">A. </persName>
            Brown I am sure of; I saw all their faces at the window, and, when I followed them up the hill, I saw the face of Brown only; I am sure they were all of them the same people; I then took Brown, and brought him into the shop, the other two walked off together; I then went for a constable, but could not find one; and, in coming back, I saw two men in conversation, and I suspected they were the other two men; they were standing on the opposite side of the way, looking at our shop; I stepped close up behind them, and the one who made his escape, said, I am glad he did not take me; they did not see me at that time; Johnson immediately repeated, so am I; for, when he came out the third time, I had my knife in the window; I then stepped in between them, and took hold of one with each hand; the one, who made his escape, kept several times saying, it is not me; I asked him what it was that he had done; he still repoased, that it was not him; Johnson, in the mean time, jumped up, and stuck a knife in here, (pointing to his head;) as soon as he had done that, he got my hand up to his mouth, and began biting; I having hold of the other as well as him, could not defend myself but by drawing my hand out of his mouth, which I did three times, and the fourth time he got hold of my finger; I then found that my finger was so fast in his teeth, that I could not draw it out, and I was obliged to let the other one go; I then got my finger out of his mouth, and took him over to the shop; the knife was so stuck into the bone, that I could not get it out; I tried twice, but could not get it out; Mr. Bainbridge got it out for me.</p>

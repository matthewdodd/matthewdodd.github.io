On Monday evening, 13th Jan., I went with Aldren to the Prince of Wales beer-shop, Maiden-lane—there were several persons there—the prisoner was one of them—I gave them some beer—a conver<lb></lb>sation took place between Aldren and the prisoner about the wages paid by some contractors—Aldren is a contractor; the prisoner is a labourer, I had never seen him before—he did not seem pleased with the con<lb></lb>tractors—he got up and said, "I will go and fetch a <hi rend="italic">gang</hi>"—he left the room, and Aldren followed, and pushed him down in the passage—I had Dot done anything to the prisoner—he had not spoken to me—he left the house, I and Aldren remained a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and then left—the landlord had said something to us—when we got to the door we saw the prisoner in the road, about ten yards from the door—he went over to a stack of bricks on the opposite side of the road, and took up something, and threw a brick at me, which hit me on the forehead, and stunned me, but I did not fall—Aldren was nearer to him than I was—I lost my senses—I did not see him throw a second brick—I cannot say who it was thrown at—it was very quickly done.</p>

On Monday evening, 13th Jan., I saw Roberts and Aldren at my house—I saw the prisoner leave after that, and saw him outside, peeping under the window into the room—I went out and saw a brick on the window-sill, and the prisoner close to the window, and took the brick away from him, asking him if he was going to break my windows, and threw it into the middle of the road—he said, he did not care a b—, he would wait there a week for them, and would cleave their skulls open, or rip their b—guts open if they came out—he did not mention any names—I begged him not to do anything of the sort, and went into the house, but did not tell them for a quarter of an hour, because I thought his temper would cool—I did tell them; they left, and I saw the prisoner in the middle of the road—he Went</p>

I went with Roberts to the Prince of Wales, and saw the prisoner in the parlour—I had some altercation with him—he got up and said he would fetch a gang—I thought he was going to fetch some ruffians to get up a row—he let the parlour—I followed him, and said, "What will you fetch a gang for?"and caught him by the collar, and pushed him down in the passage—about twenty minutes afterwards, Roberts and I left the house, and saw the prisoner over at the brick-stack gathering something up—he came straight up to the path we were on, six or seven yards from us, and threw a brick, which struck Roberts—I turned round to look, and he heaved another, which caught me and knocked my bat off—he ran away—I went after him, and met him coming up with a crowd, and gave him in custody—he said he would have his revenge if he lived, to rip my guts open, mentioning my name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the detective officers of the City—on 11th January, in the present year, I was with Brett and Legg, two other detective officers, in the Minories—while there I saw Reichberg and Harwitz—I took Harwitz into custody, and Brett took Reichberg—they were both together—I told them we apprehended them for forging Russian rouble notes—they did not make any reply at that time—I conveyed Harwitz to the station and there searched him—I found this type on him in this brown paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his trousers pocket—the type has a figure on it—the brass is the numbers and the type is the border—there is some brass and some type metal, when put together it forms an ornamental border—Reichberg was searched by Brett—I was present but I did not see him search him—on the next day I went with Brett and Legg to a house, No. 28, Primrose-street, Bishopsgate—this was on Sunday, 12th January—on going there I saw the prisoner Josephson standing at the door—I told him we were officers, and wanted to have a few words with him—he took us up to the first floor—I told him we wanted to put some questions to him, and the answers he gave us might be made use of as evidence against him—I then asked him if he knew a person of the name of Reichberg, living at No. 12, Haberdasher-place, Hoxton—he said he did—I asked him if he had done any business with him—he said, "Yes"—I asked him what business—he said that Reichberg was a diamond-setter, and had done several things for him in that business—I then asked him if he ever got any copper or zinc plates engraved for Reichberg—he said, "No, never"—I said, "We must search your place"—he said, "Oh, yes; search any<lb></lb>where you please"—"By-the-bye," he said, "I must tell you about three months ago, I was in Liverpool, where I met a man named Mercer, who asked me my name and address, which I gave him; he then gave me a zinc plate which had some engraving on it, and asked me if I could get a copper plate engraved like it in London; I said I would try; he also gave me a copper plate of the size that he wanted the impression done, as a pattern. I brought it to London, and took it to London-wall and got it engraved"—I asked him where it was—he said, "Oh, I have not got it; I sent him a proof from it on paper, addressed, 'Post Restante, Liverpool," at the same time he brought this plate from the cupboard, and said, "Here it is"—he pulled it from under some paper in the cupboard—I asked him where the copper plate was that he had got as a pattern—he said he had sent that to the gen<lb></lb>tleman, who promised to call and see him, but he had never seen him since—I then took him into custody, and took him to the station—this is the plate that he so produced—I had previously gone to 12, Haberdasher-place—after leaving him at the station I went there again and searched—I have stated what I found there—that was on the Monday, about 10 o'clock in the morning—there was Andrews, the landlord, there, and Brett, my brother officer, and Inspector Leonard—I found a great quantity of engraving tools, which are here, some colouring matter for printing, and all these other things which are produced—here is a galvanic battery, tools of all kinds, chemicals, gutts percha, and wax for taking impressions—they were found in the second-floor front room, on the table, and in different parts, in the drawers and boxes—I also found this paper, cut into sizes, ready for printing—I afterwards went to 6, Bevington-street, that is a place also occupied by Reichberg—I there found a letter-press, and a very heavy press which I do not know the name of; they are here—they were in the cellar or kitchen underground—on Monday, 13th, I went to 65, Lower Thames-street, where a person of the name of Sanskowski had an office—I there found a copying press, which is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186204070039"></xptr>
               <p>here—I had previously seen that press four or five days before, at 12, Haberdasher-place—it was being conveyed to that house, and I saw it in the house—I saw the prisoner Reichberg accompanying it to the house—Sans<lb></lb>kowski took me to No. 3, Mitre-square, Aldgate, his residence, and he took from a drawer in his bedroom there this piece of gutta-percha—it contained this plate, but the plate was not visible then—I subsequently held it to the fire and developed the plate which is now produced—I have retained it in my possesion ever since, with the exception of the times I have had to produce it in court—on 16th January I went to No. 7, Somerset-street, Aldgate, that is a house occupied by a person of the name of Kattowski—I went to the back room on the ground floor—in consequence of information I had received, I searched in that room and examined some of the pictures there—I took down a picture of Garibaldi, which I produce, and on taking the backboard from that picture I discovered these sixty-five forged ten rouble Russian notes which I produce—Brett found a brass plate in a cupboard in that room; it has a figure "10" upon it, which is used for the water mark of the note—before the prisoner's were taken into custody I had seen them for something like two months—I had seen Harwitz and Reichberg repeatedly in the streets, and at their houses—I have seen them at the houses of Reichberg, where Harvitz was almost a daily visitor, sometimes there would be some week elapse, or a fortnight perhaps, and then Reichberg was out of the country—when he was in town they were together daily—I have seen Reichberg and Harwitz go to 6, Bevington-street together only once—I have seen them myself for about three months—Brett has seen them longer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City—at the latter end of last year, I was communicated with, with reference to some persons who were obtaining engravings—in consequence of that I watched the three prisoners; at the latter part of the time I was generally in company with the witness Scott—I began the watching and Scott assisted me subsequently—I produce certain articles which have been referred to by Scott—here are three impressions from a plate which I found in a box at 12, Haber<lb></lb>dasher-place, where the bulk of those things were found—they were in a book in Reichberg's room—I also found a paper impression of an eagle, on a table in the same room—it was lying openly on the table, and in another book I found a piece of metal with Russian characters upon it—it is a thin piece of copper—in this box, which I took from under the bed, I found a quantity of wax, which had originally formed a square; and on examining that wax I found Russian characters on some of it—it is all here, but it is broken now—it would have formed a square about this size—I also found a small box of red ink—also a plain brass plate—I was present when the other things, which have been spoken to, were found—when I took Reichberg into custody, on the 11th, I found on him two 100 rouble notes, two ten rouble notes, some papers, and that which forms the back border of a 10 rouble note—the 100 rouble notes, and the 10 rouble notes are good—at 6, Bevington-street, I found this card, on the letter-press—I went there with the other officer—I removed this piece of parchment from the fly-press—it is part of the letter-press belonging to the larger press now produced, which was found in the cellar at 6, Bevington-street—Scott took a key out of Harwitz's pocket—it did not fit any look, because the lock had been taken off, but the landlord said it would fit the lock that was on at the time they took the place—at 7, Somerset-place, I found the water-mark plate that has been produced by Scott.</p>

               <p>berg took place through Harwitz—he acted as interpreter—they pro<lb></lb>duced an engraved steel punch, and asked me to strike it into a copper matrix—it was an ornamental punch, the back of a 10 rouble note—when put together the pieces would form the border of a 10 rouble note—the types were cast more than sufficient to go round the border—they had five or six pounds of border—the punch was exactly similar to that one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is made in steel, and struck into a piece of copper, and any number of types, similar to these, are cast from it—it corresponds in all its character<lb></lb>istics with the types here—they asked me to cast them four or five pounds weight of type, and I engaged with them as to price, which was our usual list price—they left the order with me to be executed—they called again a few days afterwards—I had the order then executed for them—I gave them the type which I had manufactured, and they paid me for it and went away—two or three days after I had another visit from them—they brought me the type, stating that it was not close enough together; that it spread out too much—after some conversation that day they left, and came again the next day, and there was a further order for some figures—it in not in brass—it was like this impression—I made it of type metal—here is one of them mixed up with the border—this is a figure "3"—this paper was left with me as a pattern, for the purpose of making up a printer's form—it would take about 120 pieces of the type placed together to form that—they produced this to show me how it ought to be—that writing was on it when I received it—they also left this piece of card with me to show the size—after having received these explanations from them, I went on with the work in their absence, and they both called again about 6th November—I then had the border ready—I think I had better refer to my notes now—my suspicions were aroused on 6th November, and I gave infor<lb></lb>mation to the police, and commenced making notes of every thing afterwards—they produced a small piece of paper on which was an impression of a Russian eagle, precisely the same size as on a genuine rouble note, as far as I can judge by afterwards seeing a genuine note—they asked me if I could engrave that—I told them "Yes"—they ordered it to be engraved—a few minutes afterwards, I think about ten minutes, Harwitz came back and requested the pattern—he said that the other, alluding to Reichberg (I did not know their names then), was a beautiful engraver, and that he had altered his mind, and would engrave it himself—I gave the pattern back to him—I next saw Reichberg alone about the 9th of November—on the previous visits Harwitz had acted as interpreter—when Reichberg called alone on this occasion he spoke English quite intelligibly to me—he pro<lb></lb>duced a piece of coloured printing, and asked if I could make him some printing-ink of that colour—it was crimson ink—I and one of my men mixed a few samples and pulled some impressions to show him what could be done—he said it was not good enough, there was not enough fire in the colour—I had been pulling off some on our own paper, and he produced some paper out of his pocket, the size of which I know to be the size of a 10 rouble note, because we had some of them left—he requested it to be pulled upon that paper, and that altered the colour again; it did not look so well on his paper, and he wanted the form altered—I complained that it was not a paper that it should be done on, and he said, "Oh! this is bank-Paper; I want it tried on this paper"—two of my men were present at the time—I did not suit him at last—he asked me if I had a copper-plate press that I could sell him—I told him I had one, and I walked with him round to our stores to show it to him—he did not buy it—it was too large—he ordered</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Bettaridge, press<lb></lb>maker of 47, Old Bailey—in the commencement of August last, Reichberg called at Mr. Betteridge's—I believe the first time he called, he wanted me to make him a steel or brass plate—he gave me the size—it was the size of this (<hi rend="italic">the brass plate</hi>)—there were to be two brass plates, both plain—he also ordered a hundred type and four "No's," "N," and a small "o" at the top—he wanted ten sets in all, consisting of figures, each up to 10; not differ<lb></lb>ent sizes, all one size; and four type keys, adapted to fit tbe type—I exe<lb></lb>cuted that order for him—on 13th August he took the articles away, and paid me for them—in September, I believe, Reichberg called again—on that occasion he gave me an order for the figure "10" cut in steel—this is it—the plates were quite plain when he received them—Reichberg took them away—I saw him again two or three days after he received the plates in September—he had ordered some plates in August, but not these—in Septem<lb></lb>ber he ordered these two—I made both of these; but they were both plain when Reichberg received them—two or three days after he took these plates away, he brought a paper bag, and wanted to know if we could cut one similar to what if on the plate—I did not do that, and he received the pat<lb></lb>tern back—some days afterwards, Reichberg called and produced some paper, I should think about a ream, and wished it out up—some of it is here—I cut it for him, and he took it away with him—when he brought the paper, he laid it one way, and wished the whole of the water-mark to be cut off—the water-mark is on the bottom of the paper; it occupies about 2 inches or 2 1/2 inches—I have a portion of the water-mark here—I preserved it.</p>

In July last Josephson called on me and purchased a small zinc plate—for about two months afterwards he called frequently, and had other copper and zinc plates, always about the same size—I cannot say exactly how many—they were about eight inches by four—they were not so large as this plate—it would be sufficient for the circle to be engraved on—he came in December with Reichberg, and asked me if I recollected his having some plates from me previously—I said I did—he said he had brought his friend and wanted me to do a job for him in the making of plates—he said he wanted a copper plate made of an extra substance, extra thick, and he wanted a centre cut from the plate so as to make a border—I showed him some plates that I had in, but none of them were stout enough—he left my place then, with the impression that he was coming back again, but he did not come back—the prisoner Harwitz called about a week afterwards, and brought a piece of paper and gave it me as a pattern to cut the border from—I have not got that; he took it back with him—I was to cut the copper plate so as to represent the piece of paper that he brought with him as a border—I prepared the border, and Harwitz called and paid for it, and took it away with him—this is the centre that I cut from the plate—there is no engraving upon it—the border was to be prepared for engraving, but the centre was not required—Harwitz did not refer at all to the other persons, when he came, he merely said that he wanted me to make a plate the size of the border that he brought—it was a piece of plain paper that he brought—I was to cut a plate and prepare it for engraving.</p>

                  </hi>. I shall be nineteen years old in July—I have been living with the prisoner five years, ever since I was fourteen—I lived with him at No. 5, Lauderdale-buildings, Aldersgate-street—I recollect the officer coming there on 5th Dec.—I know a man named Clements, he used to come to our place with his wife on Saturday evenings—he came with a basket, sometimes on Saturday, and sometimes on Friday night—he was not in the habit of bringing things to Beckley—I mean to swear that he never brought anything—I know these parcels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), they contain bark—I recollect their being at No. 5, Lauderdale-buildings—they were removed there from Red Lion-street, where we formerly lodged before we lodged there—I do not know when we removed from Red Lion-street—I had left Mr. Beckley when he was in Red Lion-street, and was away about two months—I joined him again at Lauderdale-buildings—I found the same parcel of bark that I had seen in Red Lion-street—I removed the bark from Lauderdale-buildings to Aldersgate-street, I do not know the number—my mother occupies the top room there—that was on the day after the prisoner was in custody—these are the prisoner's books, I do not know whose writing they are.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my uncle and others, under the firm of Howard and Kent—we are manufacturing chemists, at Stratford—we grind large quantities of bark—we grind the half of what is imported, or it may be rather more—we had a person named Clements in our service, in the grinding part—I believe this bark to have come from our premises—without doubt it must have been stolen, as it is in an intermediate state—it is never sold in this state—we use similar paper to this in the warehouse—it is not wade on purpose for us, but it is rather different to what the generality of druggists use—while Clements was in our service, he would have direct access to this bark—it was what he was working—we believe we have from time to time missed quantities of bark in this state—it would be very difficult to tell what was missing—we have no means of knowing that any was missing from our stock, but looking at this I believe it to be part of what was on our premises—Clements was discharged at the beginning of Nov.—I dismissed him because I had full undoubted reason to believe he was a thief—I dis<lb></lb>missed him on suspicion, in consequence of what I heard oxen Evans and others—this bark weighed about 30 lbs.—it is worth about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound in its original state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Gross-examined.

My daughter Eliza is sixteen months old; James Wright used to take her out; on the 18th of April she was brought to my shop with Dickenson, who had the beads round his finger - Moore said Dickenson had taken the beads off the child's neck; he said he had taken them off the neck, but was going to give them to the child or the lad; I had seen them that morning - I do not know the number of beads, but the string has four knots in it; I had tied two of them myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 16, Fitzroy Place, Euston Road—the prisoner also lived there, and his daughter, and the landlady of the house—on Good Friday night I went home at 11.30 and opened the door with a latch key; as I went upstairs I knocked against somebody on the stairs, it was a young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> and the prisoner's daughter—I said "Who is here?" there was no answer; I asked again and he said "All right, it's only me"—I knew his voice and said "You have no business here, you know you have a wife and little children," and I opened the door and let him out, and said "Good night"—I told the daughter that she ought to be ashamed of herself, and the landlady said that she would not have a bawdy house made of her place—the prisoner came out of his room and said that he did not encourage his daughter to make a bawdy house of his place—a good deal. of bad language was used—the conversation lasted about five minutes—I went up into my room, and had undressed myself all but my trousers and boots, when he called the landlady bad names—I went down again and told him it was not his place to call her out of her name, because she had been a good landlady to him—she is my mother-in-law, and when I took her part the daughter laid hold of us and the prisoner stuck a knife into my neck, my elbow, my left ear, my right hand, and my left side—he said nothing—Scanlan came to my rescue and put me into his room and I was taken to the hospital—I did not strike or wound the prisoner at all.</p>

I live at 16, Fitzroy Place—about 11.10 on Good Friday night I opened the door and let in a young man and the prisoner's daughter—Henley came in soon afterwards and halloaed out "Who's there?" and I showed a light and showed the man out—I heard several words between Miss Tucker and, Henley, and then went back to my room</p>

               <p>and closed the door—a few minutes afterwards I heard a scuffle on the stairs, and on opening the door saw Henley bleeding from several places—I pulled him into the room and shut the door—he said that he should faint and his boots were full of blood—he only had on his boots, trousers, and shirt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at University College Hospital—Henley was brought there on Good Friday at 11.50 p.m.—his clothes were saturated with blood, and I found a wound across the left side of his throat three inches long; not deep enough to cut the main artery, but over it; a wound over the seventh rib which had struck it, and did not penetrate the chest; a wound two inches long above his left elbow, down to the muscles; a wound at the back of his neck about an inch long, of no importance; a cut on his hand, and a bit of a graze behind one ear—the wound on his throat was in a very dangerous place, but not deep enough to be dangerous—the wound on his chest might have been dangerous if it had gone into his chest instead of striking a rib—the prisoner was brought to the hospital about 12.45 the same night—he had lost a great deal of blood, and was very collapsed—I found a wound on his wrist cutting through one of the muscles—I took him into the ward and put some questions to him—he said "I will tell you the truth; I had been drinking with a friend; I had gone to bed, when a man came to my room; I said to him "If you come in here I will cut your throat"—I said "Well, did you cut his throat?" he said "I do not know"—I said "How did you get this wound?" he said "I did it myself."</p>

He had lost a great deal of blood—the wound had divided an artery, and he might have bled to death if it had not been looked to—it was on the inner side of his left wrist; it will not injure him permanently—I have examined Henley's hands; they are not absolutely paralysed, but he has very little power; it is what you call wrist drop.</p>

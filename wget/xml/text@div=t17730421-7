               <p>Q. Was there any light?</p>
               <p>Munie. Yes, from the sky, and from the the lamp, I could see very plain.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Webb is the man, that held you by the arm?</p>
               <p>Munie. Yes, he held me while the other took the money out of my pocket; after they had took my money, they desired me to uncase, and they took off my great coat and walked off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they produce any pistol?</p>
               <p>Munie. I did not see any; I read about the 5th of March, an advertisement that the two persons were in custody, that had taken a great coat from a person; I went to justice Welch's on the 6th, and found the coat there. I knew it to be my coat. (The coat produced and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

When I unlocked the door, I asked him who the coat belonged too; I told him the man up stairs said they had robbed a man of it in Covent-garden; I took the coat to the justice's; Webb said he was to give them so much money, and keep the coat himself.</p>

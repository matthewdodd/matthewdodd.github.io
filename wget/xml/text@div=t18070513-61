On the 20th of April the prisoner came into our house about eight o'clock in the evening, he called for two pennyworth of brandy, he gave a crooked seven shilling piece to pay for it; it proved to be a good one; he asked me to give it him again, he could pay for it with halfpence. I gave it him, he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket a little while; he then said I must give him change. He offered me another seven shilling piece, it was bent, but paler than the other; that I weighed, and found to be a very bad one. My husband sent for an officer.</p>

My lord. - Having a conviction of the excellent philanthropy you possess, more particularly for those whose awful situation has brought them before this tribunal, and not being able to deliver my defence, owing to a severe in disposition and long confinement, being now under medical aid; having it not in my power to procure counsel, I must throw myself on your lordship's candour, together with an English jury, denying the charge of ever uttering base coin of this realm, knowing it to be such.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 133.) On Saturday morning, the 28th of Dec, I was on duty in High-street, Kensington, about five o'clock, and saw the prisoner walking up and down in front of the prosecutor's shop—he passed it twice—he continued to do so about twenty minutes—I then lost sight of him fat about two minutes—I then saw him. leave the gateway in company with Laws, Mr. Oak's servant—the prisoner was carrying a large bundle under his arm—Laws went into Mr. Oak's shop, which is two doors from the gateway—the prisoner went up Church-street, which is nearly opposite—I stopped him at the George in Church-street, and asked what he had in the bundle—he said, "Some meat I bought in Newgate-market"—I said, "This will not do for me, you must come with me to the station"—I took him by the collar and brought him about ten yards—he twisted my arm completely round and tried to escape, but I got firm hold of him—I found the bundle contained a leg of mutton, a saddle of mutton, and two pounds odd ounces of beef—that leg of mutton was afterwards claimed by Mr. Oak—he brought the fellow leg to the station, and matched it—he also claimed the saddle and the beef—I myself matched the beef with some in the shop which had been cut—it was beef steak cut right along the top, and it fitted exactly—I am certain it came from that piece of beef—the top part of the fat, which was crumpled, fitted exactly—I was in the habit of calling Laws up every morning for the last five weeks, sometimes at four o'clock, never later than half-past four o'clock—I produce the leg of mutton—it weight 10 1/4lbs.</p>

This leg of mutton is mine—I produce the fellow to it—I am certain it formed part of the same sheep—it is a wether sheep—the string is divided, and you will see part of it in one leg, and part in the other—I saw the beef applied, and that fitted—I saw the saddle of mutton that belonged to the same sheep, but would not keep, owing to the kid<lb></lb>neys</p>

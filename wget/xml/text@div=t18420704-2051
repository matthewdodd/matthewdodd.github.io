                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and live in Oxford-street. I furnished a quantity of property for the Italian Opera-house for the Spital-fields ball on the 26th of May—among the rest, were the articles stated in the indictment—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have no doubt these are part of it—I sent it to the Opera-house—I do not know where it was stolen from—I can</p>

               <p>only swear it is part of the property—I hare had the goods returned from the Opera-house, and there was a very large deficiency, much larger than the articles produced.</p>

On Tuesday morning, the 14th of June, about seven o'clock, I was in Pall-mall, and saw the two prisoners and another loitering about under the colonnade—after waiting some time, I saw Cook and another go into No. 4, under the colonnade, and in about ten minutes Cook came out with these two bundles—No. 4 is not connected with the Opera-house at all—Barnes was waiting, apparently watching, under the colonnade—I went across the road, stopped Cook, and asked him what he had got—he said he did not know—I asked who gave him the bundle—he said his mother—I took both of them to the station.</p>

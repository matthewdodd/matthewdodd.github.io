                  </hi>. I am a furniture dealer of 12, Weston-place, Penton-ville—on 26th October, at a little after 8 in the evening, I was in Cowcross-street, and saw some boys facing Booth's distillery—I felt a tug at my arm, and thinking it was somebody who knew me, I looked that way, and was pinioned against a post the other way—the prisoner then came and dragged my chain from me, but it was too strong, and he gave two or three snatches before it gave way—it then gave way at the ring, and my watch went—I caught hold of the chain, held it fast, and kept it—they then threw me on the ground, and escaped—I saw three run away—I followed them, and saw the prisoner's face—I know him, because he came quite close to me, under the lamp—I gave a description of him that evening at the police-station—I went a week afterwards, and could not identify the person, and in a fort<lb></lb>night I was taken to the Clerkenwell police-court, saw a number of persons assembled, and identified the prisoner the moment I got in.</p>

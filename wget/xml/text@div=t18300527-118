            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner on Saturday, the 8th of May, about a quarter before five o'clock in the morning, at Kilburn, with the bundle of bread and flour - I asked what it was; he said breaddust - I asked what he meant by that; he said bread and flour, that he brought it from Oxgate farm, and this was his allowance - I let him got but followed him; I met another officer, who had been a baker - I asked him about baker's allowance, and he told me to take the prisoner, which I did.</p>
               <p>MR. LARDNER. We give no allowance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had broken bread given me by my young master - I was in the habit of instructing him; rather than see the goods spoiled; on that Saturday, I took a piece of broken bread for my use, and the rest was given me by him.</p>

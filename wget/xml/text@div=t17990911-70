             sworn. - I am a waterman: On the 23d of July, I was looking in at a picture-shop just by Union-stairs, when the prisoner came up to me; I never saw him before, but I am sure he is the same person; he asked me to carry a letter to a friend of his, Mr. Dunn, No. 7, Bell-alley, Wapping; he went with me as far as Wapping Church, very near the top of Bell-alley; he shewed me the alley, and desired me to tell Mr. Dunn that I came from Mr. Broad, and I was to bring an answer; he told me to tell Mr. Dunn, if he asked whether I worked at Mr. Broad's, to say, no, that I worked just by; he said he would wait till I brought him an answer, as he did not chuse to see his friend; I carried the letter, and delivered it to Mrs. Dunn; I told her I brought it from Mr. Broad, and was to wait for an answer; she asked me how Mr. Broad did; I said, they were all well as far as I knew; she said, you don't work there; I said, no, I work just by there.</p>

               <p>Q. And you told them what the prisoner desired you, though you knew it to be false? - A. I did tell her so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it a right thing to tell that which is false, because another man bids you? - A. I acknowledge it is not right; but I did not know that there was any harm in it, because he said, he did not wish to see his friend; I waited about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, and then, either Mr. or Mrs. Dunn gave me a letter, sealed up, directed to Mr. Broad, and I delivered it to Mr. Broad, as I thought, I delivered it to the prisoner at the bar; I found him within twenty yards of where I had left him, he walked a-head of me about five or six yards; I did not see him open the letter, but when he had walked a little way before me, the letter came all in little bits behind him, he tore it and threw it away; then he said, we will have something to drink; we went into a public-house and had a pot of ale, and some bread and cheese, we stopped a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes; he wanted the landlord to give him change for a two pound note, and he could not, and then he pulled out a one pound note; then he put four shillings into my hand; I looked at the four shillings, and I looked at him, and said, I did not know that I ever earned four shillings so easy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110111"></xptr>in my life; he said, I was very welcome; we walked together as far as Tower-hill, and there we parted. On a Monday morning afterwards, between ten and eleven o'clock, Mr. Dunn stopped me in Wapping, and there was a man came up, that passed his word that he should find me whenever he wanted me; about an hour afterwards Mr. Dunn met me, and I went to the office, and was there till six o'clock, and then I saw the prisoner there; I had described him to Mr. Dunn, and I am sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. When you went with this letter, you pretended to come from Mr. Broad? - A. I did not know that it was not Mr. Broad.</p>
               <p>Q.And yet you had no idea that you were assisting to cheat Mr. Dunn of his money? - A. I had not the least idea of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did it not strike you as very extraordinary, that he should desire you to say that which was not true? - A. No.</p>

               <p>"My dear Friend,"I shall ever be obliged to you if you will have the goodness to lend me three pounds for two or three days, I have a gentleman with me at this time for a sum of money, and if you can let the bearer have it, I shall ever esteem it a favour, and enclose the money in this letter back; in doing which, you will ever oblige your's, William Broad."</p>
               <p>I then took half a sheet of paper, and put up a one-pound and a two-pound Bank-note, put a wafer in it, and directed it to Mr. Broad, at Hackney; I gave it to my husband, and saw him give it to Dale.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any reason to suppose the letter came from the prisoner? - A. No; I thought the letter came from Mr. Broad.</p>
               <p>William Dunn called again. I stood by while my wife put the notes up in a letter; there was a one-pound and a two-pound note; then she sealed up the letter and gave it to me, and I gave it to Dale. In two or three days time I began to suspect it was wrong, and in about five weeks after I met Dale accidentally, I tapped him on the shoulder, and said, did not you bring a letter to me? and he said he did; he described the person of the prisoner as the person who gave him the letter, and I found him at a house in Whitcomb-street. I told him I wished him to go before a Magistrate to clear himself; he walked with me to Charing-cross, and then we took a coach, and brought him to the Shadwell Office: Mr. Broad was with me; he told the prisoner that we had taken him in regard to a forged letter that was brought to Mr. Dunn some time back; he seemed to deny it at first, but after a little time he said, to say he knew nothing about it would be wrong, for he did know about it; he then proposed giving us the three pounds, and pay all expences; I told him I could not, for I had got the young man that brought the letter in custody, and then we brought him to the Shadwell Office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. How long have you known the prisoner at the bar? - A. Between three and four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever employed him at all? - A. Never; he was engaged in a piece of business that I was involved in, but not by my employment, nor by my directions; there was a note got from me in a wrong way, and I told him if he could by any possible means get the note returned, I would pay him for his trouble; but he never got the note. A fellow that is in the Fleet obtained it from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Provided he had got it back, what were you to pay him? - A. About a guinea and a half, I think he said he had paid to counsel.</p>

             sworn. - I am a gardener at Hackney.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that letter; did you write that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sign it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you authorize any person to write it? - A. Never any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of its being written? - A. I did not; I had seen the prisoner twice, I saw him at a house in Fleet-lane, during the last Sessions here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive a one-pound and a two-pound note from Mr. Dunn, in consequence of that letter? - A. No, from no person whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hart took an objection that the evidence amounted to no more than a fraud; that it was obtaining the notes under false pretences, but could not be a felony.</p>
               <p>Court. The circumstances under which this case stands, distinguishes it from the case of a false pretence; it may be a question to be submitted to the Jury, whether they are of opinion that this man, at the time he wrote and sent this letter, had or had not the felonious intent of obtaining from Dunn these notes for his own use, he, in the name<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110112"></xptr>of William Broad, without any authority from him, writes this letter, which he sends, by Dale, to Dunn, the prosecutor; in consequence of this letter, Dunn parts with these notes to Dale, never intending to part with them to the prisoner at the bar; but thinking that he parts with them to Broad, the person in whose name the letter is written; so that he never parted with them to the prisoner at all, but to the messenger, under the idea that he was sending them to Broad. If therefore this man has made use of this letter as a trick and a device to procure possession of this property from the prosecutor Dunn, and afterwards converted it to his own use, I apprehend it will fall within the principle of the different cases that have already been determinded, where chalking under the hat, finding a ring, and a variety of devices of that sort, have induced a man to part with his property, thinking that he parted with it to a person who was to give him a share of the booty, which afterwards turned out to be worth nothing; so, in this case, Dunn has parted with these notes to the prisoner, under the idea that he was parting with them to Broad; I am, therefore, of opinion, that it ought to go the Jury. I will save the point certainly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 20th of June I received the note of the Rev. Mr. Footman, in the Fleet, drawn by him, and accepted by

            ; this note was given to me to be discounted for the use of his nephew, to buy him out of the guards; I had the note in my possession fourteen days; I then gave it to Mr. Abrahams, a builder; I afterwards learned that it was rather doubtful whether it would be applied to the use it was meant for; I went to Mr. Dunn, and acquainted him that I thought they were playing tricks with him, and told him where the note was; I went with him to Howland-street, and a number of other places; it took up a great deal of my time, and I had been at two pounds three shillings expence; he gave me half-a-guinea on account, and told me he would pay me all the expences I had been at, and also for my trouble, provided he could get the note back undiscounted, he got it back in about eight days; Dunn and his wife both told me I might depend upon being paid every demand I might have; and Mr. Broad assured me he would see me paid; as I had acted like an honest man; when I found he had got the note back, I went to Mr. Dunn, and he told me, that those who employed me might pay me; says I, surely you don't mean to trick me in this way; he said, he thought it no tricking at all, he had been at too much expence already to be at any more. I cannot deny what the witnesses have said respecting the letter; when they took me along in the coach, Dunn said, I dare say my nephew is in this, and you had better own it; I said, he had no knowledge of it at all, and I acknowledged it myself; I offered to pay him the three pounds, and all expences; Mr. Dunn said, he would freely forgive me, and would not hurt me, only they wanted to know the truth of it, and as I had told them the truth, they would not hurt me; but, as the matter was before the Magistrate, it must be decided there. <rs id="t17990911-70-verdict375" type="verdictDescription">

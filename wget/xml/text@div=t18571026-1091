From information given to me, I went on 7th Sept, and examined the premises where the brass was—I was told that an entrance had been effected by forcing the door open, by lifting up a bar which fastened the two gates—I believe a person who had seen and known the inside of these gates could have undone them—I likewise examined the door at the other end of the premises, and found that the lock had been taken of and was lying by the side of the door—I after<lb></lb>wards found my way to Griffiths, in the evening of the 8th; I saw him—he did not show me anything at that time; he afterwards showed me some brass—I left it with him—I obtained some from him on the Thursday following—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is part of the brass which I saw—there were some more pieces—it weighed altogether 3 cwt. 3 qrs. 14 lbs.—there is one piece of brass weighing 3 lbs., which was delivered by Mr. Griffiths at the station, which was not identified by the prosecutor—I went to the prisoner's house on the night of the 8th—he lives about a quarter of a mile, or rather more, from these engine sheds—I saw him there—I went in, and said, "Mr. Baker, I want you; I am a police sergeant; I want you on suspicion of stealing a quantity of brass from Sir Samuel Morton Peto and others"—he said he knew nothing at all about it—I then took him to the station house—I told him I had found where the brass had been sold—he did not say anything, but appeared very excited.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Plaistow Marsh, close to Baker's house. I know him—I remember one Monday seeing a quantity of brass lifted from Mr. Baker's shed into Mr. Barber's cart—there was a tall man assisting Baker; I do not know who it was—there was no one in the cart—after they had done that, Mr. and Mrs. Baker rode in the cart, and the other man followed it walking—I did not look to see what kind of brass it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, Mary Street, Stepney. On Monday afternoon, September 7th, a person came and brought some stuff to me—I should not like to swear to the man—he is familiar to me, but I do not know him by his features—there were two men—they brought four parcels of brass, in four small bags—it was between 12 and 1 o'clock, as near as I can guess—it was not left there—it was fetched into the place, and I cut one of the bags open, and asked the master if he knew what he had got, he said, "No, "and I said, "You had better come and look what it is"—we refused to buy it, and it was taken away—it was not on our premises ten minutes.</p>

About 4 o'clock on Monday afternoon, 7th Sept, Baker and another man came to my shop with a horse and cart, and offered me this quantity of brass for sale; he said he had bought it of a vessel lying in the Victoria Docks—he showed me a sample of it—I weighed it; there was 3 cwt. 3 qrs. 14 lbs.—I bought it at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, the price of old gun metal—Baker took the money—my book is here—he gave me this receipt for it: "Sept. 7th, 1857. Mr. Baker, 4, Rathbone Place, Plaistow. 3, 3, 27 of metal; Win. Baker," on the stamp, with a cross at the bottom, here is" his mark"—I sold it afterwards to a man named Cowan, and I went and had it back again—I afterwards gave it up to the police.</p>

On Saturday, 5th Sept., about half past 12 o'clock, I went into my employer's engine shed; there were four engines there, two of them in pieces, undergoing repair—the things were all right then, and in their proper place—I saw these pieces of brass there on the Saturday—I went to the shed on Monday at half past 1 o'clock, and found several parts of the engines lying on the floor, all deranged—they had been moved, and the brass taken out from them—even the duplicate parts of an engine will not fit with the engine itself—this is a piece belonging to one of the engines where the brass was taken off—it is marked with a cross, and so is the brass; so that any individual who is a mechanical man would know how to fit this engine so as to be ready for it to work—if this had been lost, it would have cost 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to fit up, perhaps more—I do not know the prisoner; I might have seen him there, but I do not remember having done so—I recognise this brass as being the property of Sir Samuel Morton Peto.</p>

             sworn. I was coming down the Strand about three weeks ago, to the best of my opinion about one o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you drunk or sober. - A. I was a little intoxicated, not much: I was going to my lodgings in Bowling-alley, White-Cross-street, I met the young woman, the prisoner, I enquired of her the way to Smithfield.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you a stranger in London. - A. I was; with that she told me to go with her that night; I accordingly did; I went with her to Spencer's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where it was situated. - A. No, it was about a quarter of a mile from the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you see in the house at the time. - A. No one but the woman; I staid there about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to bed. - A. No, I was in a bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. After being there twenty minutes did you go away. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was there did you see any body there besides that woman. - A. Yes, I saw this man, Spencer; he came up stairs into the room and demanded some gin of me, I refused him, and said I had no money, she made answer that I had, that she see me put it in my pocket; at the same time he collared me, she put her hand in my breeches pocket and took the money out; he asked her to give him the money, she handed it to him; he laid down half a guinea of the money, and six-pence in silver, and some halfpence, and said that was all the money that I had got; I said it was not there was another half guinea and a seven shilling piece; he demanded me to go out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take up the money that he put on the table. - A. No, I said I would not go out of the house till I had got my money; he said he would take me before a justice; I told him I was willing to go there; I went down with him as far as the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the money. - A. The money was in the room up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you take your money up. - A. I was not getting all my money.</p>
               <p>Q. You might have taken the money off the table if you pleased. - A. No, I was in dread, I'd sooner be out than in.</p>
               <p>Q. Why you had talked to him, you said that was not all, you would go with him to a justice; you might have taken the money up, might not you. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out together, when you got to the door, what happened then. - A. He struck me at the door and pushed me out, and bawled out to the watchman, that I was robbing him; two watchmen come down and took both of us to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. The woman was not taken to the watchhouse. - A.No, she was left in the house; I went back with the watchman and got this money that was on the table in the room where I had been with the woman; the watchman took the woman to the watchhouse then.</p>
               <p>Q. The watchman took the money and the woman; she was then in the room. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The next day you were taken before the magistrate, they were committed to prison, and you were to prosecute. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of another half guinea and a seven shilling piece, how came you to know that you had so much money in your pocket. - A. In the morning when I went to work, I took a seven shilling piece, two half guineas, and six-pence in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it from the morning till this time she put her hand in your pocket at the house. - A. Yes, I had, at breakfast time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it afterwards. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been at work all day. - A. Yes, till seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been from seven till one or two in the morning. - A. I was drinking at the public house; I spent eighteen-pence for my share in that one house with the landlord and some of my shopmates; I am a smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been long in London. - A. Two years next May.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lodged in this place called Bowling-alley. - A. Twelve months next March.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been working in the same place that day where you had been used to work some time. - A. No, I only worked there from Monday to this day at this place.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you, having been so long in London,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190010"></xptr>and having lodged a twelvemonth in the same place, not to know the way to your lodgings. - A. I had only been three days at work at that part of the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you put your hand into your pocket to take out any money after you went into the house with her. - A. No, not after I had been in the house with her; below stairs I was paying the half crown to the woman of the house, that let me in, for the room.</p>
               <p>Q. That was not the prisoner. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had taken out your money, did you change it to pay that half crown. - A. I changed a crown piece in the morning; I had half a crown and one shilling and six-pence out of it, the eighteen pence I spent.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you in the morning. - A. I had two half guineas, a seven shilling piece, and a five shilling piece; that five shilling piece I changed at my breakfast in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you was not sober, do you recollect what past in the house. - A. Very well, I was sober enough to recollect afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the man going in the house. - A. Not till he came up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see what the woman took from your pocket, nor what she gave him. - A. I did not, I had my money loose in one of my breeches pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that no money had dropped out of your pocket. - A. To my opinion not a farthing, because I searched my pocket, after she had taken the money away and I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you searched your pocket before. - A. No, after paying the half crown, I put all the money in again.</p>
               <p>Q. When you paid the half crown did you take all the money out of your pocket. - A. Yes, some halfpence and a half guinea I took out in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you saw the seven shilling piece. - A. Yes, I took out the half crown, and put the rest in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you put the rest in your pocket. - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. What piece are you sure that you took out of your pocket. - A. I am not sure whether it was a seven shilling piece or a half guinea that came up with the half crown and the halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that woman is the woman. - A. Yes, and I am positive that that man was the man that was in the house.</p>
               <p>WOOLSTONCROFT. Q.(to prosecutor) You took me first to Chancery-lane. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>SPENCER. Q.(to prosecutor.) I want to know why you did not make an alarm in the house where you say you was robbed; you went out with me to get some liquor, and you passed the watchman that is here. - A. No.</p>

             sworn. I am a watchman: on the morning of the 16th, between the hours of one and two in the morning, just near the New Church in the Strand, facing a private house in the Strand. I was called.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who called you. - A. I cannot say whether it was the prisoner or the prosecutor, they both called watch, and gave charge of each other to me; I took them both to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they give charge of each other for. - A. The prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner for robbing of him, and the prisoner gave charge of the prosecutor for robbing of him; at the watchhouse the prosecutor explained the matter to the constable of the night, who ordered me to go back with the prosecutor to Marygold-court; we went up stairs along with the prosecutor, and found the money that he described that the man had laid upon the table, half a guinea, a six-pence, and some copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in bed in the room. - A. The woman prisoner was in bed; we took the money and the woman to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners searched that night. - A. They were not searched, the room and the bed was searched, nothing was found but what was on the table.</p>

             sworn. I am a watchman, I stand at the corner of Marygold-court.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing of this business till your brother watchman called you to go into the house. - A. That is all; I found the woman in the room, she was dressed and in bed; there was half a guinea on the table, a six-pence, and eleven pennyworth of halfpence, and two farthings; I searched the room, but not their persons.</p>
               <p>Woolstencroft's Defence. The first time I saw this man, I was coming down Fleet-street, he told me he wanted a lodging, he was very much intoxicated, he told me that he would pay for a bed if I would go with him; he took me to Mrs. Norman's in Chancery-lane, there he gave half a crown for a bed; the waiter seeing him so much intoxicated, said he would rather have him take his money back, and go about his business, the waiter gave him the half crown back again; he followed me down Temple Bar, where he squezed me round the neck; I could not get rid of him, I took him to this man's house, he gave this man's wife a half crown, he told her to give me one shilling and six-pence, and she had a shilling; when I went up into the bed room, this man, Spencer, says, my dear, to his wife, I shall lock them in, this gentleman says, I will not be locked in, can we have something to drink, I am an Irishman for ever, do you think I have no money; he put his money in his hand, he says there is half a guinea and some halfpence; they went down stairs, and what became of them I do not know; a woman came to this bed after they were gone out to get some liquor; I laid there an hour on the bed; I did not touch his money, I only told it, there was half a guinea, a six-pence and eleven pennyworth of halfpence, the watchman took it, and told me I must come up to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Spencer's Defence. When I have a strange person to have a nightly bed at my place, I make it a rule to ask them whether they will be padlocked in, that all may be right in the morning; I never went into the room, I asked him if he would be locked in, he said he would not be locked, immediately he says to me can you give me any thing to drink, I says I do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190011"></xptr>not know whether I can or no, he says we will go and try; he came down stairs, and at the bottom of Marygold-court he passed the watchman that has his stand there, he never said a word to him; after we had got a little further, I said I'll go no farther with you, he asked me which was the way to Bishopsgate-street; I still refused going any further with him, on which he called watch, and I called watch.</p>

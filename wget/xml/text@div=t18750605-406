I am principal at the Money Order Office—on Saturday, 29th May, in consequence of a communication from Mr. White, the prisoner was brought into my room—I asked her from whence she got the order—she said from Mr. Spurgeon, who was a customer of theirs who had given it to her to get changed—I asked her if she could give me his address—she said "No," that they did not usually know the names of their customers—I asked her own name and address—she said "Street," but corrected herself and said "Barnes"—I said "Mrs. or Miss Barnes"—she said "Miss Barnes"—I asked her what business she was in—she said "Private boot and shoe makers"—I asked her if the name would be in the Directory—she said "No," because they were private bootmakers—I told her that 1 must keep</p>

               <p>the order and that Mr. Spurgeon must come himself for the money—she then left the office—I kept the order—I wrote to Mr. Spurgeon the same afternoon—I also wrote the name and address she had given me on the back of the order "Miss Barnes, 6, West Square, Southwark"—Mr. Blackshaw, Mr. Spurgeon's secretary, called on the morning of 31st May and I went with him to 6, West Square, and saw Mrs. Barnes—in consequence of what she said I went to a shoemaker's shop in Garden Row, which is two or three minutes' walk from West Square, and saw the prisoner seated in the shop—I asked her if she recollected coming to the office with a money order—she said "Yes"—I said "Why did you give the name of Barnes?"—she gave a confused answer which I did not quite catch—I then asked her from whom she had got the order—she still said she had got it from Mr. Spurgeon who was a customer; that he-gave it her about 2 o'clock-to-get cashed as she was going to the City, but afterwards came for it as he was going to the City and would get it cashed himself, and that afterwards he brought it back to her and said that he could not get the money as there was no advice, and he asked her to get it the next day—I asked her for Mr. Spurgeon's address—she said-she-did not know it, that she might not see him again for a week or perhaps a month—I asked if it was usual for: their customers to leave 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on their hands for a week or a month—I think she said "No"—I asked her if she could describe the gentleman who gave her the order—she gave a sort of description, answered my questions as I put them to her, whether he was tall or short, and so on—I asked her if Mr. Spurgeon called for the money' whether she would give him in custody and she said that she would, she was then given in custody—the order is for Charles Hadden Spurgeon—I have not been, able to find any other gentleman "of that name except the gentleman who is so well, known.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to George Alexander Miller, and an<lb></lb>other. The prisoner Thomas Painter is a spermaceti candle-maker, em<lb></lb>ployed by us—he was given into custody op Wednesday while he was at work at our house—we have lost candles—here are twelve pounds of pieces—they are whole candles broken down, and offered for sale as pieces—I can identify the wicks, and have not the slightest doubt they are the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's—I know the paper they are wrapped in—I have paper from our pre<lb></lb>mises corresponding with it—I believe them to be our candles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Thomas Painter. Q.</hi> What do you know the wick by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the number of threads in it—we make two sizes—while your wife was in cus<lb></lb>tody in our warehouse, you came down with some candles, called me out, and said, "For God's sake do what you can for us, it will break my wife's heart"—he came down with the candles, not expecting to find his wife there—I saw them exchange looks, which convinced me he was guilty—the had been brought to us with the candles in her possession, offering them for sale—they have not been sold—here is one piece of candle I can swear has never been into any body's stock—the mould had been a little defective and would not come out without being melted, and it was found in a candlestick in the prisoner's house—the wife never came to our house to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Childs, a wax-chandler, in Green-street, Leicester-square. On the 18th of September the female prisoner came to our shop to sell the pieces of sperm ends—I had pre<lb></lb>viously received information, and asked where she got them from—she gave no decided answer, and wanted them back, which I refused—she went out of the shop without the money or ends—I followed her into the Strand, and gave her into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Thomas Painter. Q.</hi> Are you in the habit of buying many ends? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not always examine them—I can tell the difference between sperm wax and tallow—I do not say all this is spermaceti—I do not know whether there is any wax in it—she did not bring all that is pro<lb></lb>duced.</p>

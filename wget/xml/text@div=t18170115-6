On the 17th of December last, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in my parlour, at the back of my shop, from information that I received from Malim, who was in the shop, I went down the street after the men; I met Frayne, and he directed me to go another way; I could not see them, and went home; about ten minutes after Frayne came into my shop, saying, he would point them out. Before I went out the first time a pane of glass had been cut, and a great number of dominoes and bones taken out - A person could get them out by cutting the glass-Frayne pointed out the two prisoners to me, Goodhall was coming towards me, the other had crossed over the way; I passed Goodhall, his foot slipped, when I thought I heard dominoes rattle; I collared him, and took him to the watch-house, in his way there he attempted to throw something out of his hand, I found it was a domino-box; he was searched at the watch-house, and four more domino-boxes were found on him. I saw the prisoner at Tothill-fields, on the 29th of December, he then said, he was drawn into it by two men of his acquaintance, and that they had taken away about twenty boxes. I took the prisoner, Wilson, on the 21st, the officer was with me, we found him in White Lion-street; he was searched, and some duplicates found on him.</p>

            . I am a boot-closer, and live in Piccadilly. On the 17th of December, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I saw the two prisoners talking together at the corner of Francis-street, at the top of Mary-le-bone-street, I had seen them before, at the prosecutor's window; they walked away towards Mr. Wyatt's; I went after them, and saw them run back, and then run up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150006"></xptr>Brewer-street. I was on the other side of the way. I told Mr. Wyatt which way they were gone; I went round Brewer-street, and met them. I am sure the prisoners are the men. I afterwards went with Wyatt, and saw the prisoners putting the things into their pockets.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. James's; Mr. Wyatt's house is in that parish. On the 17th of December the prisoner, Goodhall, was brought into the watch-house. I found four domino-boxes on him. Wyatt gave me another box, which, he said, the prisoner had tried to drop; the prisoner did not deny it.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL PLANK. I am an officer. On the 31st of December I apprehended the prisoner, Wilson, at his lodgings. I found a duplicate of a blue coat at his lodgings, which, he said was his. The boy had described him to have been dressed in a blue coat. When I brought him out of the house, I asked him if he knew Goodhall, he said, he did not; when Goodhall saw him at the office, he said, that he knew him, and Wilson confessed it. The pawnbroker brought the coat before the magistrate, and Wilson claimed it as his property.</p>

               <p>FRAYNE re-examined. They were both dressed in blue coats.</p>

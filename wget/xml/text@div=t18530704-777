               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">THURSTON</hi>. I am clerk to Commissioner Fane of the Bankruptcy Court. I produce the proceedings in Bankruptcy of Joseph and John Legge—I have the adjudication here—(<hi rend="italic">this was dated 2nd April</hi>, 1853, <hi rend="italic">and declared Joseph and John Legge, upholsterers and cabinet makers, to be bankrupts, within the meaning of the Act. Signed, "Edward Goulbourn, Commissioner.</hi>") I also produce the declaration made by the defendant on 4th April (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "I Joseph Legge, being declared a bankrupt, do solemnly promise and declare that I will make true answer to all such questions as may be proposed to me respecting all the property of me the said defendant, and all dealings and transactions relating thereto; and that I will make a full and true disclosure of all that has been done to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief")—I was present on 4th April before Mr. Commissioner Evans, at some part of the defendant's examination, but not the whole time—his signature is to each page of it—I did not see him sign it, but I know his writing—(<hi rend="italic">part of the defendant's examination was then read as follows</hi>: "Mr. Marshall is the landlord of No. 4, York-terrace aforesaid. He is no relation of mine. I have not taken any portion of that house. About two month's since I applied to Mr. Marshall for an advance of money. Mr. Marshall is not in trade, he is a speculator in anything and everything. I have known Mr. Marshall about two or three years, I imagine he was always a speculator and never in business. I think it was about two month's since Mr. Marshall agreed to let me have what money I required upon my stock in trade, as also of my partner. It was upon a portion of my stock about a month ago. Mr. Marshall gave me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money, all gold, to the best of my belief, as a loan on personal security. I gave him no security whatever, nor did my partner to my knowledge; but I promised to do so in case any further sum was advanced. He did make to myself and partner one advance of 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., about a fortnight since. It was paid partly in notes and partly in gold. I cannot positively state whether any one was present")—that examination is sealed with the seal of the Court—on 5th April, the defendant was examined before Commissioner Fane, as follows: "Have you anything further to add to your examination of yesterday as to your books? All memorandums or books that I have, to my knowledge, are at Southampton.—Where at Southampton? They are with Mr. Marshall, whose address I do not know, with the exception of a few memorandums, which the officer who took me has in his possession.—Where did you see those books? At Southampton, in the house in which I was arrested: I wish to state that all memorandums were there when I left, relating to my transactions—Where were the books, were they in a desk? In a desk.—Describe those books?</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185307040019"></xptr>
               <p>They were chiefly memorandums and invoices, bankers' books, checks, and other memorandums; I cannot remember anything else at present.—Were those books and papers the only books you kept in your business? They were, to the best of my belief.—Did you keep a ledger? There was a ledger, but there was no entry in it.—As the property you speak of was deposited with Mr. Marshall for the benefit of your creditors, was Mr. Marshall selected to receive that property and deposit by your creditors, or any of them? He was not.—By whom was he chosen? He was chosen by myself and brother.—How came you and your brother, or you alone, to choose him? For the security of the property until we could make arrangements.—I ask you, why you selected Marshall more than any body else? Because we had known him.—How long had you known him? Two or three years. As what? As a cabinet maker, at Canterbury.—Where is he now? At Southampton. "On 9th April, 1853, the defendant was again examined as follows: "Do you adhere to the statement you made on your first examination? No.—In what respect do you wish to depart from that? That Marshall is a relation of mine—he is my father; that he has all the property I have or had deposited with him at Southampton, at No. 4, York-terrace, New Town, Southampton, That is the only thing that I can remember in my examinations that I can correct; I wish to correct others, but I cannot remember them.—Who took the house at Southampton? Marshall Legge, the person I have spoken of before as Mr. Marshall.—Was Marshall Legge, your father, ever in business?Yes—Where are the account books relating to your business? The memorandums and papers were at Southampton, in York-place, when I left; they were in a desk, and all the books I had, except a pocket book and banker's book.—Where is the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you received from Gingell? 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposited with Marshall Legge, my father, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid to Mr. Fisher, my former landlord, for rent, and the rest was spent in going to Southampton, and other little expenses.—What were your intentions when you went to Southampton? To rest for a short time, and to make arrangements for the benefit of my creditors.—By the Commissioner—I am not satisfied with that last answer, because it is impossible to believe you went to Southampton, and put your goods into the hands of your father, assuming a false name, with any intention to benefit your creditors; I therefore again call upon you to state what your real intention was? The sole reason I had in placing the goods there, or one of the motives, was to preserve them for the benefit of my creditors at a future time as soon as I recovered myself, as I was very ill at the time: I intended to see them to make them an offer, and to throw myself upon their mercy I had this motive also, which was to prevent one or two creditors coming in and sweeping off what there was, and thus deprive the whole of the remainder of the benefit of them, that was my motive; I also wished to prevent an execution coming in, and I had been threatened by the holder of a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill; signed, Joseph Legge. "On that occasion the defendant was re-committed to the Queen's prison, the answers not being satisfactory.</p>

               <p>Zuccani, one of the creditors, went with me to No. 4, York-terrace, New Town, Southampton—we searched the greater part of the house for the prisoner and his brother—after immense difficulty, caused by a man who called himself Marshall, who has since told me his name is Legge: and the prisoner's wife—on my return from the coal cellar they attempted to keep me from getting into the house again; but with the assistance of Mr. Zuccani I got in again, and proceeded up stairs, when Marshall got two upholsterer's hammers, and the prisoner's wife a very large stick—I kept them at bay, and sent Zuccani up stairs—we eventually captured the defendant, who came from the upper part of the house—I did not see John Legge, the other bankrupt, there—I took possession of the furniture that was there—the house was full of cabinet and upholstery work, some finished and some not—I should say it would weigh full four tons, and there was more furniture at No. 5, as No. 4 would not hold the whole—on the following day, Monday, 4th April, I took the defendant up to London—I was present at his examination, at the Bankruptcy Court, on 8th April, I think it was—I then saw the man who had represented himself to be Marshall—on 20th April I again saw him at Guildhall, and having been told something, I said to him in the defendant's presence, "Your son has given you some money, what is it?"—the defendant heard it, and said, "I have not given him any"—I said, "You have"——Marshall then said that Mr. Wontner, his attorney, had given him some—since that I have twice seen the defendant and Samuel Marshall Legge together, at Guildhall police court—I have 'not heard them say anything about their relationship, but have always heard them address each other as father and son; I cannot give the exact words—I heard them conversing together for half an hour, and they appeared to understand each other perfectly well as father and son, but I cannot recollect any of the words that passed between them; they identified each other in a general way—I was not present in the Court of Bankruptcy on 9th April, when the defendant was examined, and said Marshall was his father.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

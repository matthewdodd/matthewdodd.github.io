            . Q. You I believe are the mansell. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to a room over the Charter house building over Dr. Fisher's house. - A. I did, I went on that roof; when I got to that roof a slater met me, I observed that lead was taken from two different parts on Dr. Fisher's house; from information I went to the prisoner, he was in the hall of the Charter house; I desired him to follow me, he followed me up to the roof. I told him he had taken some lead, as we were going up stairs; he told me he had not; I charged him a second time, he still denied it; I told him a person saw him, he said who; I think, I said the slater; after a short space of time, he said he had taken the lead; he went with me, and shewed me where he had deposited it, he went to Mr. Barber's water-closet. In that water-closet is another closet; there he said was the lead; he attempted to pull it out but could not conveniently, it was rather dark at that time; I said let it remain; I took him to Dr. Fisher, he was afterwards given in charge of a constable; when the constable came I went with him to the same spot the prisoner had pointed out; there I saw the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was there. - A. About twenty eight pound; the constable afterwards fitted it in my presence to the place where it was taken from; it corresponded nail for nail.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it taken from that part of the Charter house in which Dr. Fisher lives. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Barber. - A. The receiver of the hospital. Mr. Barber's house adjoins Dr. Fisher's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the young man at the bar. - A. Yes, he is a son of a respectable tradesman in the neighbourhood, a plumber.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. I believe you know he is a young man of good character. - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this lead jagged at the edges. - A. Yes, as if it had been ripped up from nails.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any business on the premises. - A.None in the least; there were other workmen. they were slating and tiling; there was no plumbing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had any lead been stolen from the Charter house. - A. Not long before.</p>
               <p>- TRIGGRY. - . Mr. Knapp. You are a slater. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you employed on the 23d of November, about the Charter house, as a slater. - A. Yes, I was employed to slate the roof.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes, I saw him upon the roof of Dr. Fisher's house, he was measuring a pane of glass by a sky-light; I saw some lead laying in the gutter very close to him, rolled up; I acquainted the bricklayer's labourer of it; he went down and acquainted Mr. Dixon. When I saw him on the sky light I went into another gutter to get some slate. I was gone away half an hour; when I returned he was gone and the lead. I did not see him go away nor the lead.</p>
               <p>- MARTIN. Q. You are servant to Mr. Barber. - A. Yes, he is the receiver of the Charter house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember in the course of that day we have been speaking of, the prisoner applying to you to go through the house and up the trap door. - A. Yes, about half past two on the 23rd of November, he said he wanted to go to the top of Mr. Stewart's house. Dr. Fisher's house is between Mr. Stewart's and Mr. Barber's. I gave him leave; he said he was going to do something upon Mr. Stewart's house, he did not say what; they had lost the key of their trap door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Dixon coming to your house to enquire for the prisoner. - A. Yes; the prisoner was at the top of the house at that time. Mr. Dixon went and could not see the prisoner; Mr. Dixon went up the second time, and then the prisoner came down; I asked the prisoner whether he had seen Mr. Dixon, he said he had not; he had been up stairs about half an hour.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Monday afternoon the 23rd of November. I was going through Charter house-square, a man asked me if I was going to the Charter house, he said there wanted some repairs at Mr. Stewart's house on the leads, but I could not get out there, there was no trap door at all, and the windows had bars across them. I went to Mr. Barber's through their trap door, I found the lead laying in the gutter, I doubled it together and put it in Mr. Barber's house; I was going home, the young woman said Mr. Dixon had been looking for me, she asked me if I had seen him, I told her no; I waited at the door till I saw Mr. Dixon, then he told me what had happened; he accused me of taking it away.</p>
               <p>Court. Produce the lead (the lead produced); what is the value of the lead that was applied to Dr. Fisher's. - Mr. Banner. There is about fourteen pounds; it is worth about eighteen pence.</p>

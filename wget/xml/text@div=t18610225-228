                  </hi>. I am a cab proprietor, living at Little George-street, Bethnal-green—I know the prisoner—I had a horse and cab—which he drove out on Friday, 1st February—he drove them out in the ordinary way as a cab-driver—the horse was in harness, with the cab—he did not return at all</p>

               <p>with them—on the Saturday three boys brought home the cab, without horse or harness—in consequence of what was said, I made some inquiries, and ultimately saw the horse and harness in Tothill-street, Westminster, at a stable belonging to a publican—I there saw a person of the name of Hewlett—the horse and harness were worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to me—the prisoner had been taken into custody previously—I asked him what he had done with the horse—he never spoke—he ought to have returned at 12 o'clock on the Friday night, that was the arrangement.</p>

I am a general dealer, of 4, Catherine-court, West<lb></lb>minster—last Saturday three weeks I saw the prisoner at Tothill-street, Westminster, leading a horse along by the halter—the horse bad no harness on it—I asked him what he was going to do with it—he said he was going to sell it—I asked him how much money he wanted for it—he said 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10s—I thought that too much—I bid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he would not take it and went away—he came back afterwards and took it—Mr. Downey paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me—I took the horse to St Martin's-lane to see if I could sell it outside Aldridge's—finding I could not sell it, I took, it home again—that was the horse that was shown to Mr. Abbott—I bought the harness after I bought the horse—he told me he had an old set of harness that he would sell me—the cab was down the yard in. Tothill-street—the harness was up in one corner of the yard—I gave him 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the harness, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to a man that was with him—the harness was also given up to Mr. Abbott—the prisoner did not say where he got the horse—he said he had been working half-time with Mr. Abbott, that he did not want to work any longer—that he had had bad luck, and should sell the horse—I did not see what became of the cab.</p>

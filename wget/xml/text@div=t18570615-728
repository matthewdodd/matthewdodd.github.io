                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Victoria Villas, Queen's Road, Dalston. I have a warehouse, where I carry on business as a haber<lb></lb>dasher, at No. 1, Cripplegate Buildings, on the ground floor—there are two doors to the warehouse, one communicating directly with the street, the other opens into the passage of the house—on the evening of 13th May I left the warehouse about a quarter before 8 o'clock—both the doors were shut, and fast—the outer door was shut by my assistant—I shut and locked the side door, which opens into the passage—I and my warehouseman both left together—I returned the next morning about 9 o'clock—I found the door leading from my warehouse to the passage open, and the lock was completely destroyed—it had been opened by force—I examined my stock, but missed nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a schoolmaster, of No. 1, Cripplegate Buildings, where Mr. Townsend has his warehouse—one door which leads into the warehouse is not used by any one else, it is used exclusively by Mr. Towns<lb></lb>end—the door leading to the passage and staircase is always left open in the day time—Mr. Townsend communicates with his warehouse by my passage and the outer door—on 13th May I left my house about half past 12 o'clock in the day—I returned in the evening about half past 10 o'clock—as I approached my house, I looked up at the front of it, and made an observation to my son—I stood about a minute looking up—there is a shop window in front of the warehouse—while I was in front, I saw the prisoner and another man come out from my house as I was just stepping from the road on the pavement—the prisoner partially closed the door—he held the knocker, and pulled it to as he went out—I followed them, and asked what business they had there—I followed them to Philip Lane, and approached the prisoner with the intention to stop him—he turned and threw a dark lantern in my face, which cut my face and made my nose bleed—he ran down Philip Lane, turned up Aldermanbury, and was stopped in Three Nun Court—I saw him stopped—the furthest distance I was from him in the course of the pursuit was three yards—I did not lose sight of him for a moment—when they got to Philip Lane, they separated—I followed the prisoner—after he had been taken to the station, I returned home, and examined the doors of the warehouse; I found the door which leads into the passage from the warehouse had been forced open—inside the premises</p>

               <p>I found a wedge—on the top of the stain was a roll of sacks, and behind the street door a crowbar, which I gave to the officer who was with me—Mr. Townsend's warehouse is held separately from me—I am not his landlord.</p>

A. 1836"—this Register is an annual publication—we print the names of the practitioners with their altered addresses—it remained the same in 1860—for 1861 the following entry appears: "John Potter Serjeant, 8, Store Street, Bedford Square," with a repetition of the qualifications—we altered the address to Store Street in consequence of having received this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the name does not appear in the Register of 1862, in consequence of a notice having been sent us under the 14th section of the Medical Act—I wrote a letter by direction of the registrar, and no answer was received—it was posted with other letters that day—it was in consequence of not receiving a reply that the name did not appear in the Register of 1862—it was on the receipt of this application (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) that the person calling himself John Potter Serjeant was registered in 1859—this is his first application (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "I request to be registered, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">as before read, but giving the address King Street, Long Acre.

I am a Fellow of the College of Physicians of England, and have been registrar of the Medical Council of England since the passing of the Medical Act—about 24th November, 1863, I recollect a person calling himself John Potter Serjeant calling at the registration office and presenting a document to the clerk, and he was not content with that, but desired to see me—he did see me, and I left him immediately after answering his question—I am rather shortsighted, and cannot say whether he is here—Mr. Routh was present—the person said that he applied to have his name placed on the Register, that he had been registered before, but his name had been taken off—I said that I could not do so; I was instructed by the Medical Council not to do so—he was not content with that answer, but said, "Dr. Hawkins, why will not you place me on the Register?"—I said that I could not enter into that subject with him, but must refer him to the solicitor of the Medical Council—he com<lb></lb>plained to me that he had unjust enemies, who spread calumnies against him, and that his name was removed on that account—his name has not been registered—Mr. Ouvrey knows more about it—he is the solicitor to the Medical Council—I have given directions for every facility to be given to the prosecution—I am subpoenaed, but if I had been told that my atten<lb></lb>dance was necessary for the purposes of justice I should have attended—I had intended to come—the Medical Council does not itself prosecute—I think there are ample grounds for this prosecution—it is impossible for the Council to assemble more than once a year, because they come from all three divisions of the United Kingdom.</p>

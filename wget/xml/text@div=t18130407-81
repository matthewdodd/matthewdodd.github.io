            . I am an officer. On Saturday the 6th of March, I went (in company with Leadbetter, Cartwright, and Wilson) to <placeName id="t18130407-81-crimeloc413">No. 14, Little Wild-street</placeName>

We waited a few minutes below stairs, and then we proceeded up stairs into the front garret. When we came up there we found a key in the door, in the front garret door, on the outside, whether in turning it to open it we had locked it. I knocked at the door and heard a voice say, who is there? I knocked again. The voice again said, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070054"></xptr>is there. I then said, Wheeler, it is me, or us, open the door. I had a warrant, and knew the name was Wheeler. I put my foot against the door, and open the door went. When we came into the room the younger prisoner's wife was in the room with a child in her arms, and the younger prisoner was in the room with a short jacket on, and a white apron before him. Wheeler, the elder, was not there. Wheeler, junior, was secured. Every one of the officers were then in the room. We then proceeded to search. The first thing that caught my eye was a cutting engine, in the corner of the room, which is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light in the corner. Could you see distinctly what it was - A. Yes, I could plainly see what it was from a window in that room. I am acquainted with a cutting engine. There was a lathe fixed in the middle of the room, or nearly opposite of the window. A bench was before the window, with a vice fixed to that bench. This is the cutting engine.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain to the court the use of that cutting engine - A. This is called a dab; this was fixed in, and this is called a bolster; it was at the bottom, but not screwed. The top one is called a dab, and the bottom one a bolster; it works by the force of a screw. The piece of metal is put between the dab and the bolster; the dab forces into the bolster by the force of the screw, and cuts the metal into a round blank. On the same board were these other cutters, which are of the size of blank shillings. These are dabs and bolsters of the size of a shilling; here are three. This litter here was found in the engine. Here is the drawer that goes in undeneath; the blanks from the metal were found in that drawer, and these are the blanks that were found on the board close by the engine. On that day we matched a great number of these counterfeit blanks to the dab; they corresponded. These coppers in the drawer are cut into blanks. This drawer, they are copper, and in that there are more than thirty or forty of mixed metal. The waste of the metal is called sissel. The sixpences fits the round space in the sissel. The lathe is for the purpose of turning the edges. Here are sixty-three counterfeit blanks, with the edges turned by the lathe. This one was in the lathe at the time. I took it out.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state of perfection is that and the others you have just now produced - A. They are towards conclusion. A very little thing to be used to them would bring them to the colour of silver; the edges are turned. On the top of the lathe, besides them sixty-three, were a great number of blanks with the edges apparently turned. These others were laying on the lathe; some of them appear not to be edged. After I had searched the room, and put the officers in possession, I went down stairs into the front two pairs.

             owned the goods, and I have some receipts to show that the furniture is his in that room. He and his wife lived there. I searched the drawers in the two pair front room; I found fifty counterfeit shillings finished, and fourteen sixpences. Here they are. They are fit for circulation. To bring the silver to the surface aquafortis would be used. I found this pocket-book with two others, containing receipts of his landlord, and here are two punches for stamping letters on the counterfeit money. After I had searched the two pair of stairs front room, and secured the implements, I sent two officers down into the one pair, and when I went down there I found the elder Wheeler in their custody. That was in the back room one pair of stairs. He rented the one pair back room and the garret. I found the elder Wheeler without his coat. I searched the drawer in his presence. I found twelve counterfeit blanks of the size of a sixpence, and I found twenty that apparently appeared to be brace buttons. They were with holes in them, and too thick to be used in coining. The old Wheeler was secured, and so was the young one. These things I found, and all the things I found have been kept by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the garret situated with respect to light - A. It has a window in the middle which lets in a good light. The cutting engine could not be viewed from without, because there was a parapet wall besides a curtain that hung on the nearest side of the window to the cutting engine, and there were a great number of stains on the cloth that hung at the window. This leather was nailed inside of the door, over the key-hole, with three tacks, so that nobody could see into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the sort of cutting engine that you have seen used for the purpose of coining - A. It is. I have seen many like it where this kind of business has been carried on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the prisoners say any thing, as you recollect - A. Their behaviour was remarkably civil; no men could behave better.</p>
               <p>DANIEL LEADBETTER. I am one of the marshalmen. I accompanied Armstrong and the other officers. I saw the things. I was not in the two pair where he found the things. I was up in the garret at that time. I found a quantity of punches and pots in a box. I found them in a lidge, close to the window. There was a bench also. This was in the garret, where the cutting engine was. I saw this cutting engine fixed there. I found some bags with two sorts of emery. I also found three or four crucibles, one with some white powder in it, and this one appears to have melted metal. I found thirty or forty blanks in the window in a paper marked, but I counted sixty-three blanks. I saw one blank fixed in the chops of the lathe, and on the top of the lathe was some file dust. This bottle, containing quicksilver, was given to me by

            . I am one of the marshalmen of the City. I went into the front garret with the other officers; we all went in together, and after that I went into the one pair back room with Wilson. There was the elder Wheeler, his wife, and a daughter, and another man; they were coming to the door, hearing us come down stairs; I immediately pushed in and handcuffed him and the other man together. I searched them, and found nothing upon them; the elder Wheeler was in his shirt sleeves, without his coat, and his spectacles on his forehead, as if they were thrown from his eyes. After taking the elder Wheeler I went into the front garret again. We began to pack up the things that were found in the press, and which I now produce. I found this sissel upon which the blanks are cut out. On the floor, by the side of the press I found some files, and a winch to take the press down. They are all here. I conveyed the elder prisoner away in a coach. He said the officers had behaved remarkably civil, and had done their duty as men, and he said if people played at bowls they must take rubbers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman to Mr. Griffiths, of the Rising Sun, York-road, Lambeth. On the 15th of July, about half-past one o'clock, the prisoner came, asked for half a pint of beer, and offered a bad sixpence in payment—I said, "This is a bad one; do you know it?"—he said he did not—I asked if he had any more money—he said no—I asked where he got it—he said from a man named Simmons, a plasterer—I asked him where Simmons lived—he said he did not know—I then told him I should know where Mr. Simmons lived before I let him go—I let him go out, followed him a quarter of a mile, and gave him in charge to Hughes—I held the sixpence in my hand till then, then bit it, and gave it to him.</p>

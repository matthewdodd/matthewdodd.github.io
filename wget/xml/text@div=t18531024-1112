I am a grocer, and am a member of the Working Man's Equitable Building Society, of which the prisoner was secretary; our meetings were held every Wednesday evening at No. 71, Old-street, St. Luke's, for the purpose of receiving the contributions of the members. On 22nd June, I was indebted to the society 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my rent, and the prisoner called on me in the middle of the day, and said that my rent had become due that day, and he should be very thankful if I would let him have it, and accordingly I gave him a check, and he signed my books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—each of these three books refers to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they are books furnished by the society—he said my rent was due, and said how much was due, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was due to the society—I considered when I paid him that he had authority to receive it.</p>

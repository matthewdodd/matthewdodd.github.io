On Tuesday evening, the 13th of December, I had a concert, and was in the room the greater part of the evening; I was in conversation with Mr. Arundell, a carpenter, and Mr. Blunt, an attorney; I was sitting facing the fire place, in the second part of the room; while I was in conversation, the prisoner came up and had a little conversation - he was quite a stranger; I had not seen him before, to my knowledge; when he spoke to me, I spoke to him, but I cannot say what passed, but I am pretty well sure he sat down at the table - I remember passing a joke with Mr. Blunt, and I think the prisoner went to another part of the room; I did not see him again till the concert was over, when I was having some conversation with Mr. Bell, respecting some deeds Mr. Blunt was drawing up; the prisoner came and sat very close to my side; I wished the conversation to be more private; I said it was very unfair for him to come and sit by me while I was talking to those gentleman on business; I told him his company was quite a bore, and there were other parts of the house where he might go to; he said where could he go; I said, "You may go into my parlour if you think proper;" he said, "May I go into your parlour?" I said Yes, and he went into the parlour - it is a parlour for company; I do not know whether there was any one in it then, but I should think there was, as the concert-room was cleared; when I had done speaking to those gentleman I put the lights out, and went to the bar - I stopped there some time; I then went into the parlour, where I saw the prisoner, Mr. Blunt, and several other persons - I do not remember saying any thing particular, but I passed a similar joke to Mr. Blunt to what I had done in the concert-room; I do not remember joining in the conversation; I sat in the elbow-chair, laid my head on my hand, and dozed into a sort of sleep - I might awake once or twice in the course of the evening, but did not join in the conversation; when I awoke the last time, I heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050081"></xptr>the prisoner and Mr. Perry going away; I went to open the door for them, but they were before me, and got the door open before I got to them; I bade them good night, and the prisoner said something to me about masonry; the prisoner and Mr. Perry went away together; I closed my doors, went round my house, and went to bed; I saw no more of the prisoner that night - I was not alone with him that evening at all, and to my remembrance, I had never seen him, before; on the following Saturday, an old man brought me this letter, wrapped up in this case - this is the letter, but I never read the whole of it, because there is so much of it - I was in the bar when it came; Dr. Newman and two more respectable gentlemen were there; I took off the case, and laid it on the bar table; I opened the letter sufficiently for Dr. Newman to read a word or two, and I said "Here is a nice little letter;" I thought it might be from some of my family for money; I went into my parlour, and read part of it; I could not understand it; I turned it over three different times to know if it could be for me or not, and the last time I turned it, I spelt my own name letter for letter.</p>

            . I was a clerk in the office of Mr. Collins, No. 33, Spital-square, for fifteen years; I left him at Christmas. I know the prisoner perfectly well, and I believe this letter to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you known him? A. Five years last December; I am sorry to say that he has been given to drink for the last two or three years, but he has had considerable sums of money of mine, and I have found him honest.(Letter read)</p>
               <p>"SIR, - The occurrences of the other evening are still fresh in my recollection, to what the relate, a moments reflection will present; or in other words, an attempt most deliberately made by you of a most disgusting and abominable character, which my resistance, and the dread you apprehended of an exposure, rendered abortive; any thing short would have rendered me equally culpable as yourself. Much as I have heard that there are in existence creatures bearing the outward form of men, and addicted to those bestial propensities, I had nevertheless, in a great measure discredited such realities, until the affair of Wednesday morning unveiled that doubt, and awakened the too horrible conviction, that I had at length unhappily fallen into the hands of one of the detested advocates and perpetrators of a crime loathsome and abhorrent; and in one too of all others, on whose unsullied reputation, this every thing is staked, and dependant entirely upon public opinion for patronage, support, and protection. The circumstances under which it was at tempted, I need not here detail, being of so gross and flagrant a description, that the recollection of them can never be dislodged from my memory, indeed I have not been well since; and on the most serious and mature deliberation (and I have not been hasty in forming my resolution) that it is but a right to which decency has a privilege, to enforce that, so during and insulting an outrage should be submitted to magisterial investigation, for the effectual suppression of advice of the blackest die, unpardonable an the eyes of Heaven, and horrifying in those of men. I thought it right, however, are I proceed to extremities, to put you in possession of my resolution, with a view to your being sufficiently impressed with a proper sense of the situation in which you have placed yourself, your character, and reputation - it is I say for you to consider and weigh well the consequences how you stand, and how your interest may he effected; not only as it regards your moral character as a christian individually, but in your public and accountable capacity as a licenced victualler, will fall under the servest lash of well deserved reprehension, and subject yourself to the contempt of all your friends, your family connexions, and the derision of the world. Should I repeat it, this affair once get buzzed abroad that"the worthy host" had himself made an attempt of the kind, and with fastened doors, securely and carefully barrid by his own hand, under his own dwelling, a licenced receptacle for refreshment and entertainment, in the hearing of his own family and servants, and that upon the person of an occasional visitor, unwarily entrapped within his fangs; the name of "Hemingway" would become as odious as the wretched miscreants who, but a few moments since, expiated their crimes amidst the execrations of thousands. Upon deep consideration of the purport of this letter which I have sent to you in private, not wishing to risk the possibility of its falling into other hands than your own by the post. You must be aware of the very perilous precipice on which you stand; and it is by your answer, for me to know whether you wish to hazard the result of the affair being made public by an application to the Magistrate for a warrant, it being a criminal charge, and of a capital nature; my deposition must be registered on oath, to obtain that document for your apprehension, which when once done, you will only have yourself to blame; nothing on my part can afterwards he allowed to impede the regular course of justice. Need I say more to point out clearly to you the rain that must be the inevitable consequence of disclosure. The affair as yet, I pledge myself, is unknown to any mortal on earth, even my own wife has not had the slightest intimation of the matter. Is it not for your interest, character and peace of mind, to let it remain so? How many in your fine in your neighbourhood, would glory at your shame, and exult in your disgrace; on your character, as the proprietor of a house peculiarly privileged, yet under peculiar restrictions depends every thing; the hazardous speculation in which you have embarked must fall into ruins in the estimation of its frequenters. The probable suspension of your licence may be the disasterous result; and independent of the awful consequences attendant on conviction, and placed at a criminal bar, on a charge of so revolting a nature, must mar for ever your future prospects - your credit with your brewers and distillers would be fast upon the wane, and you will never regain that respect which your condition in life otherwise entitles you to; but entail upon a rising family, a dreadful stigma which time can never destroy. I am, Sir, your obedient Servant, J. T. MORGAN.</p>
               <p>1, Sydney-street, Mile-end, 16th December, 1831.</p>
               <p>P.S. The bearer of this will wait your convenience, to bring back your answer; if you wish any reasonable time to do it in, say so, and send the letter inclosed, privately, to me, either at my house, or 35, Spital-square, Norton-falgate."</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to MR. HEMINGWAY. Q. What passed between you and the bearer of the letter? A. I called him, and said, "Have you any knowledge of the person who sent me the letter?" he said, "He is a lawyer in Spital-square;" I said, "Oh, dear," or "Dear me," or"God bless me, he has sent me a letter of a very disgraceful nature, and wishes me to give him an answer - how to give him one I do not know; tell the person to call upon me;" he went away, and in less than a quarter of an hour, the bearer of the letter and the prisoner came to my house - the bearer came in, and said I was wanted outside; I went outside, and saw a very about man - I advanced towards him, and said, "Do you want me, Sir?" he said No; the prisoner came into my house in a very few minutes - I had told the messenger to tell him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050082"></xptr>come in; I was in my parlour - the prisoner opened the door, and said he wished to speak to me privately; I took him up stairs into the saloon, where the concerts are held - he then said he had sent me a letter, and began to accuse me of the guilt of the letter; he said, "I have sent you a letter, and I shall accuse you of the whole of it;" I said"For what?" and began to talk to him respecting what I had read of it: he said I was guilty - he did not say of what, but he alluded very strongly to a base purpose; he said he should abide by what he had written - I replied,"I have never insulted you in my house, nor any other person, to my knowledge;" I told him I could swear it, and would swear it, which I did, and asked him if he thought I was an Atheist or a Deist - he said No; I then lifted my hand with a firm resolution, hit my hand on the table, and said, "So help me, God, and so help me, Jesus Christ, you never was insulted in this house by me or by any other person, or may 1 drop;" he said my swearing would have no effect, he was a lawyer, and his oath would be taken, but mine could not, only by evidence which I could not obtain - he then began to talk of my credit with my brewer and distiller, and how glad my neighbours would be to hear of it; this was on Saturday evening - he said there was a better was of setting it, if I would give him something in the shape of a 10l. note, not even his own wife, nor any creature upon earth should know it; I told him I was not prepared to give him 10l., but to call again some night next week - he proposed Tuesday; I said that was a concert night, he had better make it Monday - he agreed to call on Monday; he said he would walk into my parlour, and call for a pint of porter or ale till I saw him - he begged of me not to show the letter to my wife or any other person, but I do not remember that he said why - he then left, and I went below to my parlour; Mr. Hickmott was there, and before he went away Mr. Perry came; I made an arrangement with Mr. Perry for the Monday evening: on Monday evening I saw the prisoner again - Mr. Perry was there in a small anti-room between the club-room and the saloon; he was there in pursuance of our arrangement - the prisoner came into the parlour, and called for a pint of ale; I came down when I heard the bell ring once, and the prisoner walked up stairs with me - Mr. Perry was then in the gallery of the saloon, and the prisoner was in the saloon, under the gallery, just at the edge of it, so that he might be seen: a person in the gallery could hear the conversation in the saloon, and see the person if he thought proper: I said to the prisoner,"My good man, you ask me 10l. for what I am not guilty of - it is a deal of money to give away for nothing, knowing myself not to be guilty, nor nothing like it," or words to that effect;" I am a family man, the father of ten children, and I have a good wife - you must have made a mistake when you left my house and gone somewhere else;" he said No, he had not - I said, "You must have gone somewhere else - I will allow you might he in liquor, and probably went to a bawdy-house;" he said, "No, I did not;" I said, "There or somewhere else you must;" he said, "I did not, by God;" Then (said I) I will say no more, but for my own peace of mind allow me to ask you one or two questions: - Did you, after you bade me good night, return to my house again?" he said, "Certainly not, Sir;" "Did we pass five words together during the whole time, or the whole night while you were in my parlour with me?" he said, "Not on this business, but on commercial business we did;" I then said, "Can you suppose or think, in your own mind, that I am a man who would he guilty of so abominable a crime as you formally accuse me of?" he made some reply, but he moved somehow at the time, and I did not distinctly hear it, but I think it was "No," in a low tone of voice - I put the question, and did not care about his answer; I said, "If you will walk into my anti-room, which is private, I will endeavour to get you 5l.;" he said nothing less than 10l. would do - I showed him into the anti-room, where there was a little fire, but no light; in going down stairs to get a light I saw Mr. Perry at the bottom of the stairs without his shoes: there was no light in the saloon.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Then how could Mr. Perry see any person there? A. He was close to the window, which would show a light - there was no lamp outside, but you might see the shadow of a man's person: I could see the top of the table plain enough.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What did you say to Mr. Perry when you saw him without his shoes? A. I asked him to walk up stairs, as I had a word or two to say to him - I showed him into the anti-room where the prisoner was, and asked him if he had any knowledge of the prisoner's person (the prisoner and myself were the only persons who had been in the saloon while Mr. Perry was in the gallery, I am quite certain of that) - Mr. Perry said Yes, he had a knowledge of him from last Tuesday evening; the prisoner then said, "Yes, sir, I think I have a knowledge of you; I remember you" - I then said to Mr. Perry, "This person has accused me of a very bad crime;" Mr. Perry said,"Indeed;" I then put out my arm, pointing to Mr. Perry, but could not recollect his name, though I had said it a minute before - I said, "Mr. -, Mr. - ;" he said Perry - I said, "How to tell you I cannot tell" - the prisoner said, "I thought you were acquainted, but I perceive you are not, as you don't know his name, and as you seem determined on its being made known, if you don't begin, allow me;" I said, "Yes, any body but me" - the prisoner then began to tell Mr. Perry, in some sort of way, of my ill usage to him, and said I had acknowledged to it within the last five minutes; Mr. Perry said, "Indeed, sir;" I did not make any remark - Mr. Perry then said, "Before you go any further, allow me to ask what might your name be?" and the prisoner said, as far as I can recollect, that his name was

I was at the prosecutor's house on the night of the concert, on the 13th of December; I saw the prisoner there - I was not much in Mr. Hemingway's company that evening; I was not sitting with him: the prisoner sat on my left hand from the time he came into the parlour till we left the parlour together; the prisoner was not alone in the parlour with Mr. Hemingway at any one moment till we went away together; the prisoner and I were the last persons in the house- he was after me, but close to me; I opened the door, and he followed me - we were the last two persons in the house - when we got out I went to the right and he went to the left; I saw him go beyond the house, and bade him good night - I heard Mr. Hemingway fasten the door of his house before I bade him good night; in consequence of what Mr. Hemingway said to me I went on Monday evening into the gallery of the concert-room; I think it was from eight to half-past eight o'clock - while I was there Hemingway and the prisoner came into the concert-room; there was no light in the room for me to see the prisoner, but I knew him by his voice - I heard the conversation which passed between them; I was there for that purpose, and had taken off my shoes, that I might make no noise- when they came in Mr. Hemingway said, "My good man, you ask me for 10l. which is a great deal of money, and you know that I am not guilty;" he said, "I am a man of family, the father of ten children: you must have been mistaken, and gone somewhere else" - the prisoner said he had not; he said, "You must; the prisoner said,"No, by G-d, I did not; I went straight home" - Mr. Hemingway said nothing further on that subject, but he said, "Do I look like a man that you would suspect of being guilty of any thing of the like?" the prisoner said,"Certainly not;" Mr. Hemingway then said, "If you will retire with me into the anti-room I will go down and see if I can get you up 5l.;" the prisoner said, "Nothing less than 10l. will do;" they left that room, and went into the anti-room - I then came from where I was, and met Mr. Hemingway on the stairs; I had not then put on my shoes - I then went into the anti-room; Mr. Hemingway introduced me to the prisoner, and asked if I knew that gentleman; I said certainly I did from what had occurred on the Tuesday previous - he said, "Here is a very awkward circumstance occurred here with me;" I said,"What might it be?" he said, "Upon my word I can't tell you?" he said, "Mr. - , Mr. -, Mr. - ;" I said, "Perry is my name;" the prisoner said, "I see you are not very well acquainted, if you will allow me I will tell;" Hemingway said, "Any one but me" - the prisoner then said that Mr. Hemingway had put his arm round his neck, kissed him, gone down on his knees, unbuttoned his breeches, and behaved in an indecent manner to him on the Tuesday evening; I said, "Is it possible that he has done this?" he said Yes, and he had owned it within the last five minutes; I said, "You will excuse me, what is your name?" he said, "

               <p>Q. Had Hemingway owned any thing of the kind? A. No, certainly not - I then rose up from my chair, and said,"You are a d-d infernal rascal, and have not a bit of man's flesh about you - out of this house you shall not go, but under the protection of an officer;" Mr. Hemingway then began to call him a rogue, a liar, and a rascal, in a high tone of voice, and stamped with his feet; Mrs. Hemingway came up, and begged her husband not to be in a passion, as he had got everything provided; I then desired her to leave the room, but prior to her coming up, the prisoner fell on his knees, and called his God to witness that what he said was true; Mr. Hemingway followed his wife down - the prisoner followed him, and I followed him; I took hold of his coat, and gave him in charge of the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CLARKSON. Q. Were you at the house between the Tuesday and the Saturday? A. Yes; I went there one night, and was there on the Saturday night, I suppose as late as twelve o'clock; I have seen Dr. Newman - he is not here; I went on the Saturday night, about eight o'clock - I went there on the Sunday; I first heard of this transaction on the Saturday, about the time I went in; I saw the letter - Mr. Hemingway and I made an arrangement on the Sunday that I was to go into the gallery, and that he would bring the prisoner into the saloon, that I might hear what transpired, and that he would put such questions to him as we thought proper, and one was to ask whether he looked like a person who could be guilty of such an officer, which the prosecutor did, and the prisoner said No, not at all; he spoke that as loud as he did the rest - he did not say it in a muttered tone, that the prosecutor could not hear; I should think not; I could hear it very plain - the prisoner was under the gallery; the window was on my left hand, and the prosecutor stood close against the window, on one side of a table - I cannot tell which side the prisoner stood; one was farther off than the other, but I cannot say which was furthest - I had never seen the prisoner in my life till the Tuesday, but I knew his voice by having so much conversation with him; I cannot tell whether the answer the prisoner gave to the question, whether the prosecutor was a man likely to commit such an offence, was so low that Mr. Hemingway could not hear it; he was not a quarter the distance from the prisoner that I was - I should consider he must have heard it - whether he paid any attention to it I cannot say; he might be in that state of mind that he could not pay attention to every word - we had prepared an officer below; the same officer was in the habit of attending the house - I was perfectly sober on the Monday evening; I had only had a glass of gin and water, while we were waiting for the prisoner; I was sober on the Saturday evening - I was not drunk on the Tuesday; I might be rather fresher than I was on the other two nights - I had taken more than I generally do; I swear the prisoner left the house that night at the time I did, and Hemingway and him were not alone any time that evening - I had not lost sight of them; they did not change their room; after they came from the concert-room they were in the parlour, and they were not alone there.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen, - When you shall hear the strict and undeviating line of honesty which I have hit her to pursued, with oredit to myself and satisfaction to my employers, I trust that you will not suppose, that I would, all at once, invent and write a letter, involving such consequences as it does; my prosecutor has undeavoured to support his own case, and blacken mine, but in the eyes of God, he is the only guilty man - the letter was written in my own hand, and subscribed with my own name and residence - the bearer was ordered to answer any questions: on my first interview with the prosecutor, be expressed his earnest desire to have it made up, and appointed me to meet him on the Monday, when he placed the witness in ambush, to get rid of the adium himself, and to place it on any shoulders: when the inspector asked what I had, I voluntary took out the copy or draft, from which I took the letter, with only a few verbal alterations. Did this look Like guilt? Should I not have destroyed it if I had been guilty? Whatever may be the consequence of this prosecution, I have not acted designedly wrong; if I have erned in writing the letter, instead of bringing the prosecutor to the bar of justice, it was done in ignorance of the consequences of it. Perry passes much of his time at the prosecutor's, but it was utterly impossible that he could tell what took place between one and two o'clock on the Wednesday morning: he was intoxicated, and might have gone out; I had myself gone out once or twice, and what inducement could he have to watch me away; not a soul was moving in the horse when the prosecutor let one out, at twenty minutes to two o'clock, and no eye but the eye of Omniscience was witness to what was done.</p>

On the 4th of January I lost a cloak, which had been hanging three or four feet inside my shop, and the door was closed - the prisoner had been a customer of mine, but I did not see her at the time I lost the cloak - I mentioned it to the Police.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner in consequence of hearing of a watch being lost - I found fourteen duplicates on her, and one was for a Bath cloak, which she said she had bought in Cranbourn-alley three years and a half ago - this is the cloak; the prosecutor identified it as his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had she not a cloak on her back when you took her? A. I cannot tell whether it was a cloak or a shawl - she did not refer to a cloak on her back; she referred to a cloak I had the duplicate of, and which she had on her back at the time she was here to give her son a character - I do not know that there is any one here who saw her then.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Tomlinson, a pawnbroker. I have a cloak, pawned by the prisoner on the 5th of January.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you not known her exceedingly well for some time? A. No; I never saw her in the shop before - I had not been there above a month; it is in the name of Susan Croney - she pawned this with me, and gave me this name and direction, which I believe is all right - I lent her 4s. on it; I do not think it is worth more as a pledge.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in the habit of pawning at that shop, and they have known me for many years; I have six children, and endeavour, with my own industry and my husband's, to bring them up in an honest manner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wollen-draper, in partnership with Arthur Wilson and another, in Vigo-street, St. James's. The prisoner has been in our employ, as clerk, for about nine months—it was his duty to pay and receive petty cash—one Saturday, towards the end of Jan., he came into the counting—house, and delivered to me some bills, and a book in which he made entries—there was this bill and receipt for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on Monday morning I compared it with his entry in this book, and I ascertained, by referring to another book, that the bill was altered—the one yard at 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., has been altered to four and a half yards, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the adding up, from 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the book is in the prisoner's handwriting.</p>

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk at Topping's wharf, which belongs to John, Henry, and George Scovell. The prisoner was warehouseman there—on the 26th of March, he placed the keys of the warehouse in my possession—at eight o'clock the same night, I was passing the ware house, and saw the prisoner going into the warehouse, which he had no reasons to do—I waited some time, and then went into the ware house, and saw him coming out—(it contained eighty-one loose hams, which had been on the floor—while I was out, he took the opportunity of going to the counting-house, and taking the keys again)when I saw him., I asked him what he did there—he said, to see that the ware house was locked up—I told him to get a light—he dropped something, and when he brought a light, I found it was a ham in a bag—i asked him what it was, and he said a ✗ which he was going to take home—he had no right to remove it at all, nor to go there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I had permission to have a ham at cost price, and was going to weight it in the flour scales on the other side—Mr. Cruso was the person that authorized me to have one of the hams—I had not given up the keys nor taken in the notes of what hams had been delivered that day. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He had delivered a note an hour before, of eighty-one hams delivered that day—he placed this note on the desk, as his return of what goods I should find in that warehouse.</p>

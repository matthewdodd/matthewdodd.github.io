               <p>JOHN JAMES BOZIE. I am cook and seaman of the ship. On the 1st of December, somebody pulled at my watch as I lay in my hammock, about one o'clock in the morning, I thought it might be one of the ships company that wanted to know what o'clock it was; I recollected there was no light on the half deck; I then thought they could not want to know what it was, there being no light there; I found a pull at my watch a second time; I instantly seized the person by the wrist; he pulled me out of my hammock; I sung out for assistance, and held him fast until assistance came, and then I gave the prisoner into the charge of the ships company; the prisoner said his name was Peterson, he did not belong to the ships company; I never saw him before. When we got a light,

I went on deck and found the prisoner's shoes and stockings, he had pulled them off to make him tread soft. I stood centry over him while the people went and found Barras's clothes. These are the clothes that were found on the forecastle.</p>

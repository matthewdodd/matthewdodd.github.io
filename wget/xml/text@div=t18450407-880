                  </hi>. I live at Harefield, in Middlesex. On the 21st of March, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner coming from my gate with some clover hay on his back—he deals in hay, I believe—he chucked the truss up on his father's cart—I was going up in the field, and sent my wife after the prisoner, and she ordered Wright to throw the hay down—I have seen it since, and there is a sample of it here—I have no doubt that it is mine—he had no right to take it from my premises—I had not sold him any clover hay.</p>

                  </hi>. I was present when this hay was sold to the pri<lb></lb>soner's brother—he was to have the load of hay, and one truss more, which he bought—it was all meadow hay—it was put on his father's cart—I am sure of that—it was taken from the hay yard altogether—the clover hay was kept in the cart shed, which was quite a different place—I saw the prisoner go into the shed and take a truss of clover hay and put it on his lather's cart—I had seen him go into the yard two or three times.</p>

                  </hi>. I went to the prisoner on the road on that day, and charged him with having one truss of our hay—he said he had no clover-hay on the cart—I saw one truss on the cart—I directed him to take it down, which he would not do—I directed Wright to take it down, which he did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Blott, a baker—we now live at No. 10, Mint-street—a short time ago we lived at No. 12, the same house in which the prisoner lived—we removed from there about two months before the death of the child—we had been living there about two months before the prisoner came home—the child was in the house at that time—the prisoner's husband was living there with her and three other children besides the deceased child, and older than her—she was about 14 months old at the time she died—they occupied a room at the top of the house, I occupied the room immediately under them—when the mother brought the child home the first week it cried very much, but I did not take any notice</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186102250081"></xptr>
               <p>of it till my attention was called to it by the neighbour next door, in consequence of that I listened to it and I heard the mother slap the child repeatedly, and scold it for being dirty—the child cried on and off very much the second week—I heard the slaps frequently, mostly every day—the child cried very much—on one occasion I heard it slapped three times in the day—after the mother had been at home a fortnight with it the child was one day crying very violently and I heard the mother slap it—Mrs. Freeman who lodged in the next room wished me to go in, and I did and said to the prisoner, "You will excuse me, Mrs. Connor, for coming in, but it very much upsets me hearing the baby cry so, and hearing you flog it"—the baby was then sitting in a corner of the room and the family were getting their dinner at the other side of the room, the prisoner, her husband, and the other children—I wished Mrs. Connor to let me take the child downstairs and let my little girl nurse it while they were getting their dinner—she took it away from me, sat it down in the corner again, and said she would not allow me to take it down, and I left the room—I did not say anything more—I heard it slapped after that—it went on for another fortnight) at times—I heard it slapped on Friday night and I knocked at their room door and asked what she was doing to the child—the man brought the child out and abused me very much indeed—I said I could not help it, I did not wish to interfere! but I could not bear to hear the baby cry so and hear it slapped—I thought it was because the mother was strange to it and it had not got used to them and I wished her to take it and comfort it—I told her on one occasion that I was afraid that being away had won away her affections from the baby, and in mercy to her I think that was the cause of it—she said it was no such thing, it had not won away heraffections; it was very dirty—they threatened to punish me for interfering, but she was in a passion at the time and I did not take much notice of it—I told her I did not wish to interfere; 1 had a great regard for her at one time and I undertook to do for her children while she was away from them, as I thought striving to do what she could for the benefit of her family—she had been put to it very much at home through her husband being out of employment—the husband was generally out when I heard the slapping—I heard it slapped on the Saturday afternoon, after I had interfered on the Friday—the father was out then—the mother flogged it as if she was in a great passion with it because it would not go to sleep—I was on the staircase at the time—I heard the prisoner say she would make it go to sleep—I did not go into the room then—I accused her once of stifling its cries, and she said she merely threw a shirt over it that she was making—it sounded very much to that effect, not as if it was severely stifled, but it did not cry so plainly—on the Friday night when the man abused me, the neighbour next door wished me to take a policeman in, and I said I would have them watched for I knew they were not kind to it—on the Saturday afternoon after the mother had flogged it, I said I would fetch a policeman if they continued to ill-treat the child—she said she was not afraid of a policeman; she had done nothing to her child no more than she had to the other children—she said if the policeman did come she would put him and me down stairs—I heard the child slapped next day, Sunday, but nothing more than I have heard a baby slapped by other mothers if they have been cross—I went in on the occa<lb></lb>sion and found the mother and father both there, she was holding the baby over a pail to have a motion—there had been a great many words on the Saturday, and I went in and said I had no ill feeling, only the baby made me very unhappy, I did not wish them to suppose for a moment that I wished to</p>

               <p>interfere—before I went in I was on the stair-case and I heard the father say, "Don't 1" when she was slapping it—the child was not crying when I went in—I asked them to let me have it a little while and the father said I should not—the mother said, "Yes, let her take it," and I took it, but he said I should not take it downstairs—I never saw the child put into water; I have heard it washed in water several times—I have heard it moaning very much, I thought it was from teething—I did not hear it slapped on those occasions—I heard her slap it very little after the Sunday—I do not think I have been in about the child above four times since the mother's return; I gave great offence by going in, and the mother was never friendly with me afterwards—I have given it something to eat—I went in on several occasions when she was gone out with the little boy to the hos<lb></lb>pital, for two or three hours together—it ate what I gave it—I never saw it fed.</p>

ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you have never <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> the child ill-treated in any way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard it—some of the slaps I heard were very violent, too violent for an infant—I thought they were slaps on the bare flesh—after the slaps the cries appeared to be stifled—I have not been constantly abusing them and calling them murderers—I did at the time the man came out and abused me—I did not one day, when I heard the child crying, go up to the door and call out, "You murderess, you will murder your child," nothing to that effect—I said to her on the Saturday after she had been beating it so severely, "You had better murder it, do not torture it"—that was the only time I said that to her—she told me that she treated the child as she did the other children—I never had any conversation with her afterwards—I lived in the house about eight months altogether—my sister-in-law, Mrs. Freeman, also lived in the house—the prisoner went as wet-nurse to Lady Frederick Fitzory—during that time she entrusted the baby to Mrs. Freeman—I did not hear any complaint that the child was not looking well while it was with Mrs. Freeman—it had a severe cold on one occasion—their room was a very small one—I heard that they had been in great destitution before she went to Lady Fitzroy's—she came back in September—in consequence of the child being ill, the prisoner took it away from Mrs. Freeman and lodged it at Notting-hill—I did not see it all the time it was—at Notting-hill—I heard it was getting on nicely there—there was a little contention between Mrs. Freeman and the father, he said she had not time to attend to the child sufficiently—after that I offered to take charge of the three children, not of the baby—I don't know that the prisoner said she would prefer having it at Notting-hill where it was improving—it looked a very nice baby; I nursed it the day it came home for nearly an hour—I never observed any peculiarity about the eyes—I have seen much finer children at the age, and many worse—I did not think it a very fat, fine child, but I thought it was through not having the milk from the mother—I never knew a fed child thrive so much as one fed from the breast—I left that house about a month after Michaelmas as near as I can judge—I have been away from the house three months now—I had seen nothing of the child, I think, for nine or ten weeks before its death—I did not know the prisoner took the child to Mr. Llewellyn—I knew it since—I was told, that she took it to Mr. Wood, a medical gentleman in the neighbourhood.</p>

               <p>opposite, but I don't know their name—I was told afterwards that Mrs. Higginbottom had told Mrs. Connor that 1 had been to her—I don't recollect on one occasion after I had complained of Mrs. Connor having slapped the child in that way, her stripping it before me and Mrs. Freeman and showing the body to show whether there were any marks—she did not show it to me, and not to anybody in the house that I know of—I don't know that she did to Mrs. Freeman—I never heard that she did—she has threatened to go before a magistrate and have me punished for annoying and insulting her—I believe on two occasions she threatened to do so, the man and woman too—she never did go before a magistrate—I never heard that the man was not kind to the children—on one or two occasions he has told me that he would not put up with my constant interference and annoyance, that he and his wife were doing their duty by the child—the child cried very much indeed—I did not see her after she had been to Mr. Wood.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it suffer much from cutting its teeth? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I told the mother that I thought it suffered very much from cutting the teeth—it cried very much, and I thought it was the teeth, and I wished the mother to take and have its teeth lanced—I said I was sure something was amiss by its crying so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 71, Black man-street, Borough—I saw this child about three times before its death—it died on 30th January—I saw it first about four months and a fortnight before its death, shortly after its return to Notting-hill—I do not know exactly the time—it was in a very good state of health then—the prisoner brought it to me to examine to see whether there were any bruises on the child, for the nei<lb></lb>ghbours had complained that the child had been ill-treated—I examined the child but could find no external marks of violence whatever—I did not give it some powder for teething at that time, but a few weeks after she brought it again, said it was very fractious, she thought it was teething, and I gave it a little soothing medicine, and, to the best of my belief, I lanced its gums, was to remove any state of irritation—the child was then in a very good state of health to all appearance—I saw it again the day it died; it was then very much emaciated, quite a skeleton—I saw that the child was dying. and it was useless to do anything—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found all the organs of the body perfectly healthy—I saw it a few hours before its death—my assistant saw it the day before—it was quite emaciated,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186102250086"></xptr>
               <p>quite a skeleton—I found no evidence whatever of any disease—the stomach was very pallid and completely empty, except two or three spoonsful of mucus—the bowels also completely empty and contracted—I found no particle of food at all, and no feculent matter in the bowels—there was neither food nor the results of food in the bowels—I cannot judge whether there had been food within a recent time—I did not see any marks—the stomach was not eaten away—the stomach was healthy—the child could not have had food for some little time, but how long it is impossible for me to say—the cause of death was inanition from want of sufficient nourishment—I can come to no other con<lb></lb>clusion, because there was no disease—all the fat was completely absorbed, there was not a particle—there was not much blood in the vessels, they were relaxed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Considering that the organs were healthy, can you judge from what cause it was that there was no fat and so little blood I <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If there was not sufficient nourishment the child must have fed on the fat of its own body, and it must consequently have become absorbed—that would be caused by want of nourishment certainly—there was a small bruise on the forehead, apparently recent, within a few days I should soy—that had nothing to do with the death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it because you could find no ostensible cause of death, that you say it died from want of nourishment I <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is so—there was no evidence of disease—I examined the brain—it was perfectly healthy—I examined the state of the teeth, and can say pos<lb></lb>itively that teething was not the cause of death—teething does not induce children to reject food so entirely as that you would not find the slightest particle in the body—if it had rejected food for two days,' that would not have got rid of all the feculent matter from the body, not in that short space of time—the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination was made by direc<lb></lb>tion of the Coroner—I never knew a case precisely like this—I have made many <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examinations—my assistant was with me at the time, and I also had the assistance of another surgeon, Mr. Randall—he is not here—he was not examined before the Coroner—he did not see her at all before death—my assistant is not here—I heard, after the child's death, that a gentleman of the name of Wood had seen it a fortnight previous—I believe Mr. Wood's assistant is here—my assistant saw the child a day previous to its death—he had not seen it before—he is a young man of twenty or twenty-two years of age, studying at Charing-cross Hospital—Mrs. Blott has been to me; she came once before the child's death—only once to the best of my recollection—that was a few months before the death—that did not induce me to go and see it; the child was brought to me—I don't recol<lb></lb>lect Mrs. Blott coming to me after the death; she may have done so—I know the neighbourhood of Mint-street very well—it has been a very un<lb></lb>healthy neighbourhood; it is better now—the air of Notting-hill is decidedly preferable to that of Mint-street—a removal from Notting-hill to Mint-street, would not be likely to have a beneficial influence on the child's health—I don't know that the transition would be so very violent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Wood, a surgeon, of 22, Union-street, Borough—I saw the deceased child on one occasion when it was brought to the surgery about a fortnight before its death—it was very much emaciated and apparently sinking from mirasmius, which is synonymous with consumption, it is a wasting away of the body—whether that wasting away arose a rose from want of food or disease of the lungs or some other organ, I cannot tell—Mr. Wood never saw it.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186102250087"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Will that wasting away frequently occur without any ostensible cause? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, without any apparent cause—I have no doubt that the removal from the atmosphere of Notting-hill to Mint-street would have a very marked effect upon the child—I am not prepared exactly to say that it would produce the wasting away I speak of, not wholly perhaps—no doubt it would have a very marked effect, but I think not to that extent—I have known instances where a child, in teething has entirely refused food for a certain time—teething will produce irritability of stomach that may induce a child to throw up its food as soon as it had taken it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might that go on with a child until it would die, as a result of that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never knew an instance of it—I have never known an instance of this kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where you find the stomach absolutely empty, with<lb></lb>out a particle of food or any fat, would you infer that that would arise from teething? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; teething might occasion a child to reject food for a time—I don't think it would do so to such an extent as to cause the stomach to be absolutely empty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any experience to enable you to give a positive opinion upon that. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I cannot take on myself to give a positive opinion—the change of atmosphere that has been spoken of might cause a child to fall off in its appetite—mirasmius is such a disorder as is sometimes called "atrophy,"—supposing the child to have died of mirasmius, the ex<lb></lb>ternal appearance would have been such as Mr. Llewellyn has mentioned—I should expect to find disease in the intestines or stomach; I mean perforated intestine; it would be very evident—disease is very apparent in such cases—when I saw the child a fortnight before its death, it did not appear to be in want of food—if it had been perishing for want of food, I think it would have appeared to me on that examination.</p>

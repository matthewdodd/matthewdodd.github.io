On the 7th of September, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my shop. She had been there before that morning. I was at dinner, and saw her in the shop. I did not see her come in. I saw her reach her hand over the counter, open the till, and run out. I saw nothing in her hand. Before I went to dinner there was a silk bag, with 3l. 5s. 6d. in it, all in silver; I had counted it about an hour before she came in. I ran out after her as fast as possible; when I got to the door I saw her going down the lane towards Holborn. My girl went after her.</p>

I went up to her, and asked if she had not been to my mother's just now; she said who is your mother? I told her; she refused to return with me, and said she had not been there. I took her back; she went quietly with me. As I crossed Holborn I observed her throw something away. I do not know what it was. I took her to my mother. My father gave her in charge. She had been to the shop before that morning, for half an ounce of tobacco. The silk bag belonged to me; my sister gave it to me. There was some silver in it which belonged to my father.</p>

On Tuesday three weeks, I called on Robinson to order him to get a load of bricks—I did not see him, but I saw his wife—in going down the street, I met the prisoner in his master's cart—I asked him where his master was—he said, "Behind"—I told him I wanted a load of bricks fetched the first thing in the morning, and for his master to send for the money, to go to the brick-field to fetch them—when I went home I ordered Mrs. Sherman to let Robinson have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a load of bricks, as I was gave out—it was dark when I met the prisoner, about five o'clock in the af<lb></lb>ternoon, on the 9th of February—I know nothing about any one coming for money—the bricks were never brought—Mr. Bridge sells the bricks and Robinson is the man I employed—I saw the prisoner three weeks after, and had him taken.</p>

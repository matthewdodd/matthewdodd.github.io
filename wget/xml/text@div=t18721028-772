I took the prisoner into custody on Tuesday night, 15th October, at 170, High Street, Peckham—I told her I should take her for marrying Edward Pratt, her former husband being alive—she said "Very well, I will go with you"—I took her to the station, and Charged her—the inspector showed her the first certificate with the name of Benjamin Dorling—I received that from Pratt—the inspector said "This is the certificate of your farmer husband, Benjamin Dorling"—she said" That is right"—I afterwards showed her the second certificate of her marriage with Edward Pratt—she said that was also right—I have com<lb></lb>pared them with the register, and they are correct.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an umbrella-maker, at Railway Approach, in the Borough—I was present at St. John's Church, in the Waterloo Road, on 10th September, 1650, when the prisoner was married to Benjamin Dorling—they lived together, I think, for about fifteen years; I should think up to 1866, as near as I can guess—the prisoner worked for me as shopwoman from 1860 up to about April 1868—I received two letters directed to Mrs. Ashley at my place—I read those letters, and then I spoke to the prisoner—I asked her if she was married again to another person, I think I did name the name—she swore that she was not; she took an oath that she was not—she said "I am not; so help me God, I am not," and I showed her the letters and said "What do you mean by that?" and then she said she was married the second time to Mr. Pratt—I have seen Dorling nearly every day since that—he was at the Lambeth Police Court—he has been into me for money once or twice since the prisoner left my employment—he came to my place at the time she was working for me, and she saw him as late as three or four years ago—it was very shortly before she confessed she was married again—I should think it was about six years ago that she and Dorling separated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in business as an umbrella-maker, at 130, High Street, Peckham—I became acquainted with the prisoner in 1867—I knew her as Ann Ashley, and ultimately married her—we were married by license at her wish—she did not tell me previous to the marriage that she was a married woman—I did not know till about twelve months after, when her brother came and told me—I was in the army at the time I married her—I was invalided afterwards, and retired on a pension of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week, and I received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I left—I subsequently established myself in business with the prisoner in High Street, Peckham—after her brother came to me I spoke to her about her previous marriage, and she told me she was married—she did not give me the date or any particulars of her marriage—a sum<lb></lb>mons</p>

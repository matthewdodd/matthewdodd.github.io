                  </hi>. I am a wadding-maker, and live in Little George-street, Bethnal-green. On Tuesday night, the 7th of December, about one o'clock, I was proceeding down Rose-lane, on my way home, and was accosted by the prisoners—I knew Andrews, by working at a neighbouring factory—he asked me to come home with him—I considered a minute or two, and at last I went to his place with him—I had hardly been there a minute before Allen and Smith wanted me to stop all night—I said I could not stop, I wanted to get home, and as I went to go out, Andrews struck me in the back of my neck—this was in a back room, down stairs, the same room I had first gone into—they all three then fell upon me, the light was blown out, and something like a pillow was put over my mouth—Andrews held me down, and the other two took out of my pocket two half-crowns, two shillings, and about six halfpence—Andrews went away directly the money was taken—I caught Allen and Smith in my hands—Allen got away—I retained my hold of Smith till she got to the bottom of the stairs, and then she got away—I came outside, saw a policeman, and gave her in charge—she was at the corner of Wentworth-street and Rose-lane—we</p>

               <p>took her to the station, came back, and took Allen—Andrews was taken afterwards—I was not drunk—I had been having a little part of two pots of beer along with Andrews about two hours before this—I went into a public-house to have a pint of beer, and saw him there—he told me he was out of work, and I spent two pots of beer with him—I afterwards went round Whitechapel, Bishopsgate-street, and one place and another—I was coming home—I had not been drinking at any other public-house.</p>

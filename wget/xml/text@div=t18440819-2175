                  </hi>. The prisoner was about three weeks in my service—I employed him to receive money—I sent him with some gin to Gayton's bouse on three several days—he was to receive the money for it, and account to me for it every night—he did not account to me on the 18th or 15th of June for any money he received—I have had no communication with him on the subject—he left me in consequence of getting in liquor, and this was discovered after<lb></lb>wards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Gayton. I do not recollect paying any money to the prisoner on the 13th and 15th of June—I deal with the prosecutor, and buy beer and gin, or whatever I want of the prisoner—I always paid him for what I had, and never missed doing so—if I had any gin on the 13th or 15th of June, I paid him, but I kept no account of the time—my husband and I have a little gin and water of a night.</p>

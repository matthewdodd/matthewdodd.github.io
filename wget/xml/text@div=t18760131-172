                  </hi>. I came from Ireland this morning—I am brother to the first wife of the prisoner—they lived together for about six years, and then went to Australia, I believe—he left her in Australia and went to California—she returned to her father's house, and lived with him for two or three years until he died—she then, having no place to go to and no one to support her, resided with me at my house for a year and a half—there were three children born, and she was left with two in. A-istralia—the prisoner returned from California to London about two years ago and visited his wife at my house—his excuse was that he was looking for an appointment fa London—there was frequent correspondence between them—I pressed upon her to go to London to see what he was doing; she did so, and they met—they lived together again for probably a month on and off—he then deserted her, and she was obliged to return to Ireland—her property was settled upon her, it was very small—she returned to Dublin, not to my house, in February or March, 1875, survived about six or seven months, and then died in September—the children are alive—I heard of the second marriage last April for the first time—I am informed that the proceedings were instituted by Dean Dickenson, who, hearing her case, made an applica<lb></lb>tion to the solicitor in Ireland.</p>

                  </hi>. I was married to the prisoner on the 22nd April, 1874—I had known him some time, but I do not know exactly how long; it was longer than two months, it might have been three—my child was bom on the 28th March, 1874, before the marriage—I had a child by the prisoner on the 2nd April, 1875—I did not give him into custody—I have been living in London—he represented to me that he was secretary to some com<lb></lb>pany in Crutchedfriars, and a single man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I asked him if he was single; what made me do so was because I have read of cases of men having married before—I did not ask the other gentleman, the father of the other child, whether he was a single man or not—I was living with the prisoner until he was taken into custody—he left me last March—I am in the service now of the Rev. Canon Lloyd—I had seen nothing of him after March until last Saturday week—I had not quarrelled with him.</p>

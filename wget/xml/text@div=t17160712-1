               <p>Then Mr. Dunbar depos'd he was at Old Man's Coffee-house by Charing-Cross, and the Deceas'd being there, ask'd him what News, who replied, None, as I know of. No, said the Deceas'd, I hear News about fighting, but the King's Guards would not let them; and that there was no fighting now without the Guards; upon which this Evidence told him, he did not do well to talk so of Things when a Relation of the Gentleman who was concern'd was near him,(the Prisoner being in the same Room :) To which he said, he did not care for one nor t'other. And being ask'd by the Prisoner, said, the Deceas'd told him they were a couple of worthless Brothers.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Urqubart depos'd, That being at the Same Place between 6 and 7 at Night , he and Mr. Cathcart were talking about indifferent Things , and the Prisoner came to them she told the Deceas'd he heard him speak disrespectfully of another Gentleman, and desired to know who was his Author, upon which the Deceas'd replied, G - d - n you, I wont tell you, and Shifting his Cane made a Motion to strike him , but he put in between them and separated them, and soon after they took Coach.</p>
               <p>One Barnes depos'd He saw the Prisoner put his Hand to his Sword , when he went out.</p>
               <p>A Surgeon swore, the Wound the Deceas'd receiv'd , was the Cause of his Death; and that he took a Piece of a Sword out of the Prisoner's Shoulder.</p>

               <p>The first depos'd, That being at the Coffee-house aforesaid, the Deceas'd came in, and ask'd Mr. Dunbar if there was any News; and said he heard that some of his Countrymen had a new Way of fighting, which was, after they had agreed to fight, to hire the Guards to prevent it.

Upon which Occasion he ask'd it no Gentleman there would follow them, and prevent the Mischief; and was inform'd that Captain

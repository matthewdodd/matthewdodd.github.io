                  </hi>. I am regiment sergeant-major of the military train, second battalion, stationed at Walworth—I knew the deceased James Morris Knight—he was a very well-behaved man—the prisoner belonged to the same troop—I cannot tell when he left—I first heard of his leaving between half-past 2 and a quarter to 3.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private in the same troop as the prisoner and the deceased—on Christmas-day last, about half-past 2 o'clock in the after-noon, I was standing near the cook-house, and I heard a man crying, "Stop! stop!"—I did not know whose voice it was—I am not aware of the man's name—when I looked out, I saw the prisoner and Knight struggling—I observed them for about two minutes—they were in <hi rend="italic">grip</hi> of one another—after they ceased struggling Knight broke away from him and ran by the side of the hatches, and May ran after him—he overtook him at the corner of one of the hatches, and struck him under the right ear with his right fist—Knight fell on his left temple, and May fell over him—May got up—he did not strike Knight when he was down—he walked between one of the hatches—I picked up the stone that Knight fell on—I have not got it here—it was about the size of an egg—I assisted in carrying him to the hospital—at that time there was blood flowing from his left temple—I picked Knight up instantly after the prisoner left—he was insensible then—he did not move—the prisoner struck him with all the weight of his body—his temple fell on the stone.</p>

I am a private in the same troop—on Christmas-day, between 2 and 3, I saw this disturbance—I came out of the rear and saw May and Knight fighting—they were fighting in the ordinary way in which men fight, squaring at each other—May knocked Knight down with a blow of his fist—Knight was running away, and he picked up a stone and flung it at May, and May ran after him and knocked him down again—the stone did not hit May—the prisoner got up again and ran away, and when he got to the corner of the rear May hit him under the right ear—that was the second time he ran after him—he knocked him down and he laid there two or three minutes—Welch came and picked him up, and he was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer in the military train at Woolwich—on Christmas day-last I was called to attend Knight—I first saw him about thirty-five minutes after 3, at the hospital—he was then labouring under symptoms of concussion of the brain—I attended him up to his death, which was at five minutes past 5 that same afternoon, two hours and a quarter after it happened—he was perfectly insensible when I saw him, and he never rallied—I used everything I thought likely to produce re-action—I found an abrasion of the skin, extending from the sixth rib to the hip on the left side, and a scratch on the left temple over the left eye, about an inch long—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination and found a fracture extending from the seat of the external wound, which fractured the frontal bone passing downwards to the base of the scull and extending up to the right temporal bone, terminating opposite the right ear—there was extravasation of blood at the base of the brain—I believe that was the cause of death—I believe the severe shock the brain sustained, and the extravasation of blood, causing pressure on the base of the brain, produced death—I believe that was caused by the injury which the man received by falling and his head coming in contact with a stone or some hard substance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. On Christmas-day the man that is dead had a pipe of mine.

I don't know any more of it.</p>

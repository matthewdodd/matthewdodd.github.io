                  </hi>. I am a cooper—the prisoner was my porter. On the 50th of March I had been confined to my room a week—he came to me, and said there were three casks to be sold in Union-street, one was a port hogshead, another a sherry hogshead, and the other a brandy quarter—I gave him a sovereign and a shilling to pay for them, and told him to bring me a bill—he came back in an hour and a half, and brought me this bill, which excited some suspicion—I said, "Who made out this bill?"—he said, "The man where I bought the casks"—I said, "Very well, go and get your dinner"—I sent my wife to the house to inquire—I went to my gateway, and under the gateway saw these three casks stand<lb></lb>ing, and I knew I had had two of them in my warehouse three weeks be<lb></lb>fore—one was a sherry hogshead, and one a brandy quarter, and one a port hogshead—when my wife returned I got an officer, called the pri<lb></lb>soner, and said to him, "Go get these casks from the gateway"—when he</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Stevens, who keeps a wine-vault in Union-street. The prisoner came to our house on the 20th of March, looked at a cask, and said he would have it weighed, and asked me to make him a bill and a receipt for that and the other two—I said I would not, and then he took that away and the other two which were in the track.</p>

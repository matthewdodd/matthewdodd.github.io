                  </hi>. Until 20th February I was master of the barge "Acton," which was at Woolwich—on that day I received 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Messrs. Sturman and Clerk of London—it was paid to me by John Anderson between 11 and 12—about half-past 2 I was in the George and Dragon public-house, in Ratcliffe high way—the money consisted of six 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, twelve sovereigns, and a few shillings in silver—it was in my left-hand pocket—I was passing along the Highway when O'Brien offered to give me a little dog—I told him I did not want the dog, and said, "Perhaps it does not belong to you"—he said, "Oh yes, it does," and he would give it to me—I said, "I will give you a pint of beer for it"—I did not want the dog—I took O'Brien to the George and Dragon public-house, and gave him a pint of beer for it—he did not tell me what public-house to go to—we went into the taproom—two coal heavers were there when we entered—I ordered a pint of beer with some gin in it, but I drank very little of it—I was quite sober—I was sitting alongside the table, and O'Brien was sitting near the two coal heavers, and when I got up to go aboard my ship he caught hold of me and choked me—I had paid for the gin and beer—I took the money out of my waistcoat-pocket—I had not said a word about having money—one of the others took the money out of my pocket, and they cut away and ran out of one door, and one out of the other—it was done in an instant—I hung by O'Brien, till I gave him in charge—I could not swear to the other two.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the George and Dragon, High-street, Shadwell—I saw O'Brien and the prosecutor come into the house between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—the prisoner called for a pint of beer and gin, and they had it at the bar—they went into the taproom—soon after the bell rang and I went in—O'Brien and the prosecutor were sitting together—another not in custody was standing up, and Pickett at another table on the opposite side of the room, about four or five yards from the prosecutor, having his pint of beer—he did not appear to have anything to do with the prosecutor—he had been there before the prosecutor and O'Brien came in—about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour afterwards, I went in again to look round, and saw the man not in custody, O'Brien, and the prosecutor, as I thought <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> or scuffling—Pickett was sitting down—I fancied something was not right, and went and spoke to my master, and we went in together—the prosecutor was then standing—the man not in custody was just coming out in a very great hurry—Pickett was in the act of coming out, coming from his seat—he was not coming very hurriedly—he said nothing to me about what had taken place—O'Brien was standing near the prosecutor—the prosecutor said he had been robbed of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my master said, "Then we must have a policeman and settle it"—O'Brien was not trying to escape—he and the prosecutor were standing close together—I went for a policeman.</p>

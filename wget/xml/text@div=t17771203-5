               <p>I am wife of the last witness. I had been out upon that day the 17th of November. I came home about seven in the morning. I found my parlour window in <placeName id="t17771203-5-crimeloc38">Albemarle-street</placeName>

I found the prisoner in my room; there was no candle in the room. I asked him what he wanted: he said he had jumped in to get his hat out. He tried to go away. I took hold of him by the shoulder, and said he should not go till I was a little better satisfied. I called out to Mr. Sexton, who was coming by, and Mr. Murrell the constable was also coming by at the time the boy was endeavouring to get out at the window. Mr. Sexton seized and secured him. I saw him searched in my back parlour, and in his waistcoat pocket was found the box, containing the stones and paste.</p>
               <p>[The box and its contents were produced in court, and

               <p>I came up just at the time the prisoner was taken by Mr. Sexton. I took charge of him, and immediately carried him into the back parlour of the house. I saw taken out of his waistcoat pocket the box, containing these things. The prosecutrix immediately claimed the box as hers, and said she would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712030007"></xptr> go back to the bureau from whence it was taken. The box was not there.</p>

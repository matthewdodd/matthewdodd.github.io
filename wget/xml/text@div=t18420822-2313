                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at Dalston. The pri<lb></lb>soner worked for me for two or three years—I had a pair of pistols—this is one of them—I had them safe about ten o'clock in the morning on the 18th of July, they were on the kitchen mantel-piece, and the prisoner was at work in the parlour adjoining the kitchen—he left about four—he had his left hand in his pocket when he went out—I called to him, and said, "What are you going for?"—he said, "For the compo-tub"—I said, "We don't want it," but he went out into another house—I afterwards saw this pistol in Bensley's hand—he asked me if I had lost it—I then sent for the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I work for Mr. Rowe. On the 18th of July I was at work eighteen or twenty yards from his house—I saw the. prisoner take this pistol from his left hand pocket—he went into No. 1, which is a house belonging to Mr. Rowe—it is not occupied at present—I and another man went after the prisoner into the house—he came down the stairs—we went up, and found this pistol on the top of a cupboard.</p>

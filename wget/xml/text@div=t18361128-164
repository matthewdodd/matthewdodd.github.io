                  </hi>. I live in Piccadilly, and am a cardmaker. Between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, on the 2nd of December, I was in Drury-lane, coming from the Olympic theatre, with my sister—I perceived something at my left-hand pocket—I turned, and saw the prisoner near me—I caught his left hand at my pocket, and with his right hand he passed my handkerchief to his accomplice—I saw the end of it in his hand—the other man went away—my handkerchief was safe a few moments before—I charged the prisoner with it—he said he had not got it—I kept hold of him, and gave him in charge.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody in Drury-lane—I was on duty on the opposite side, regulating the coaches, and saw the prosecutor dragging the prisoner towards me—he said, "I give this man into custody for stealing my handkerchief?"—I asked the prosecutor where the handkerchief was, and he said he gave it to an<lb></lb>other man, who ran away with it—the prisoner said it was not him that stole it.</p>

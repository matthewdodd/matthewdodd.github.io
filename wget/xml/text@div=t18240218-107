On the 21st of January, about five o'clock, the prisoners came and asked me to buy coals; Bruce came to the cart with half a bushel - I said I wanted none; and at the same time there was a knock at the door - I went and found Butler there, he said I should have the half bushel for 7 1/2 d. I said I was a poor widow, and had no money - I stood at the door to hinder him from coming in, and said I would not have them - he sold them and went for another half bushel. Bruce said he insisted on it that I should have them; he pushed me in doors - they said Mrs. Temple had had two sacks. I then said I would have half a bushel - they both came into the room with them; and while I was getting the money from the cupboard, I suppose they snatched a bundle, containing this linen, off my bureau bedstead; I had put it there just before - one staid for the money, and the other went out - and their cart drove off in great haste. I took up a candle and found they had not left me a quarter of a peck of coals, and missed the bundle - I ran after the cart, but they got out of sight, and I have not found my property. I am sure they are the persons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BUTLER. Q. Did I come inside - A. He was inside, standing against the bedstead. The bundle was safe two minutes before they came in.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 25th of January, I and Gleed apprehended the prisoners in Gorgan-place, and told them it was for stealing linen from a woman in Bath-street, where they had sold coals; they said they had sold none in Bath-street, at all, and did not know where it was.</p>
               <p>BUTLER's Defence. I did not know the street by name - I did not enter her door.</p>
               <p>BRUCE's Defence. I offered her a bushel at half price, as I wanted to get home; she lighted me to the cupboard, and came to the door with me. I was not out of her sight.</p>

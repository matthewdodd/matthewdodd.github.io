I had eight sovereigns in a small bag, and three half-crowns and a sixpence in a large one, which were safe after I got into the room; I sat down on the bed with her, and while we were talking I felt one of her hands in my trousers pocket- I took hold of her, and called for the watchman - when he came I told him what I had been robbed of; before he came another woman came in, struck, and scratched me to make me let go my hold, and the candle was put out; I held the prisoner tight, and did not let her go. She gave charge of me for saying I was robbed, and I was taken to the watch-house; the money was afterwards found in the bag.</p>

He had been acquainted with me on the week before Christmas, and I appointed to meet him at the house between seven and eight o'clock, which I did; we came home to my house about eleven o'clock, and he offered me half-a-crown, and said he had no more - I refused, and told him to go away - he said it was late, and he would stay there all night; he then struck me a violent blow; and when I went before the Magistrate I was not fit to be seen; the person in my house came in, and I gave charge of him, for ill-using me - the woman tried to get him away, but he would not go. When I went to the watch-house I had an opportunity of getting away if I had been disposed - he was in the habit of putting his money between the bed and the sacking, when he was with me.</p>

               <p>A. Stevens. They took me round by Lincoln's-Inn Fields, and about eight at night we went into the White-Lion, where the prosecutor pull'd out his watch, and the prisoner took it out of his hand, and he and his wife went away with it, leaving us behind without a farthing to pay all the reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor sober?</p>
               <p>A. Stevens. No, he was very much in liquor, but I was not; I saw the thing done.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prosecutor?</p>
               <p>A. Stevens About six years.</p>

               <p>A. Stevens. I did not think he intended to keep it from him.</p>

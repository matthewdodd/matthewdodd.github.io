               <p>Court. Does your master live in a house of his own, or does he take lodgings when he comes to town? - He rents a house, and these things were at Mr. Harden's clubhouse, which goes by the name of Boodle's club-house, he dined there on the 25th of November, he lost his pin while he was in the house; it was a diamond pin set in gold, a pin he always wore in his bosom when he was dressed; he had it not in his bosom then; he sent there for his things to dress after dinner; he lives in Charles-street, Berkley-square; I carried to Mr. Harden's the things mentioned in the indictment, except the leather breeches and boots, which he changed; he changed the leather breeches for sattin ones, and the boots for shoes.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose these things, exclusive of the pin, are worth more than forty shillings? - Yes, my Lord, for they were almost new; I carried the things to dress my master a little before night, and they were lost between seven and eight; I asked for a room for Sir George to dress in, and I was shewn into a room up one pair of stairs, I put the things there, and there he dressed all he did dress; there was a fire made on purpose; he only changed the breeches and boots, and the cotton stockings for silk stockings, and put on a clean neckcloth; he was not long dressing himself, and then he went into the room again where he dined: I packed his things up directly after, and put the pin in the coat; I pinned the diamond pin in the coat, and I brought the things all out of that room, and put them into the porter's hall; the boots were dirty, I wrapped them up in paper, and put them inside; I went down the street for some tea, a little lower, which was for my own use; I intended to take the things home myself, I thought I would not take them to the tea warehouse, but call for them as I came back; I was absent about ten minutes, and when I returned, the things were all gone; they were wrapped up in a linen packing-cloth; I immediately enquired after them, and asked the waiter; there is an outward door and a door within that door; all the family of the Harden's lay in the house; when I missed them I immediately informed Sir George. I have seen part of the things since. I first heard of them on the 28th of November; I was at home at Sir George's own house, and there came a man from the Office in Bow-street, and informed us of them; I do not know his name.</p>

               <p>Court. How came you to think of Sir George? - Because the pin answered the description of Sir George's; I took him back and searched him, and he had a ruffled shirt on, and it was marked O. P. No. 14, the same that was in the advertisement; I found nothing else upon him.</p>
               <p>Court to Harding. Look at that shirt. - This is my master's shirt, I marked it myself, I have another of the same set in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect whether it was the shirt you carried that day to Boodle's? - Yes, I carried it clean, that mark will not wear out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd, Prisoner's Council. As to this pin you pinned it in that coat. - Yes, I put the pin in the coat again.</p>

               <p>How do you account for the one shirt and the other being marked differently? - They are not.</p>
               <p>Yes they are, there is a dot in the one shirt between the names, and not in the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What makes you so sure that was the shirt you carried that day? - That was the only set of shirts I had in town.</p>

               <p>What did the prisoner say? - The prisoner told me he had it of a man for a bad debt of seven shillings and sixpence, but I did not believe that; I am a judge of things of this nature, I believe it to be worth forty pounds, I would give forty pounds for it; it is a diamond set in gold, that is the pin I received from Mr. Clarke.</p>

               <p>Court. What is become of Paterson? - I cannot find him, he told me to bring a duplicate to him to No. 5, Charles Court, Strand.</p>
               <p>How long might you be with Paterson, before such time as you sent this woman to pawn the pin? - About half an hour.</p>
               <p>How came you to have this shirt on your back? - I was going to see a friend, and this shirt was rather cleaner than my own, I took the shirt off and put that on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Heather. You will hear my Lord from Mr. Macmanus how the shirt became torn, it was by the prisoner making a resistance, for I had sent Macmanus to see if he could find any such a man as Paterson.</p>
               <p>Court to Harding. Was the shirt tore when you carried it to Boodle's? - No.</p>

               <p>I took the prisoner at Mr. Heather's, he said, he had it of one Paterson, who lived at No. 7, Charles Court, in the Strand, and that he took it for seven shillings and sixpence, I went to enquire, and there was such a man lived there near four years back; then he was pressed very hard to know where he lodged, he did not like to tell his lodgings, at last he said at Ratcliffe Cross; I took the directions, I went there the same night, and no such man ever lodged at the place, nor they did not know such a man: Harding went with me, I think the shirt was tore in struggling to get away from Mr. Heather, and Clarke, and me, in Broad-court.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he endeavour to get away? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Harding. Had you examined the shirt before that time? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Court to Atkins. What account did he give of this shirt? - I took the shirt off his back and I saw it answered; I said to him this will affect you, and he said you need not take it over the way.</p>

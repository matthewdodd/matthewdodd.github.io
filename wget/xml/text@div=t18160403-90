               <p>ISAAC FIELD. I am in the service of Mr. Pontifex, a copper manufacturer, No. 22, Lisle-street, Leicesterfields. About seven o'clock in the evening of the 27th of February, the prisoner came into our shop, in company with a man, who had a copper to sell. On examining it, I discovered it was one we had sold to Mr. Fyfield. I called Mr. Pontifex down, and he said it was his copper. As soon as the man who had it, found this, he said to the prisoner, you are the master of the copper, and then ran off; the prisoner stood still.</p>



               <p>(Copper produced.)</p>

               <p>Humphry Fyfield. That is my copper, I had bought it of Mr. Pontifex.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along, and I met a young man with a copper, and he asked me if I could tell him where to sell it, and I went with him to Mr. Pontifex's, and they found out it had been stolen, and then the young man ran away. I never stirred, because I knew myself innocent.</p>

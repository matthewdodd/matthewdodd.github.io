                  </hi>. I am a corn-chandler, and live in Church-street, Bethnal-green. On the morningg between the 28th and 29th of July, I lost some tame pigeons out of the loft of my father's house—the tiles seemed to have been shifted, and put on again—I was three of the pigeons the following day in the prisoner's loft, next door but one—I found the prisoner in the house at work, with another young man—I told him I had come after the pigeons—he said they were up in his loft; the officer was with me—he said they had fallen down the chimney-pots—we went up to the loft, and they were there—he said I ought to pay him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for "trappage"—the pigeons I lost are worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had fed them that night and they could</p>

               <p>not get out unless somebody had let them out—I saw marks in the gutter, as if somebody had been there—there was a little mud.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there not a custom of paying "trappage" when pigeons come to another man's place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If any body catches a pigeon, they will make you pay for it before they give it you—I have caught people's pigeons myself, but never made them pay for them—other persons' pigeons have come to me; but unless you have pigeons your<lb></lb>self, they will not come—they do at times go down a chimney—they are always locked up at night—I do not keep traps and snares at the top of my house—there are traps to draw the doors up to let my pigeons out and in—when they come in they cannot get out again—it is to stop my own pigeons from going out—strange pigeons often come in—all the prisoner's chimnies are wired but one, but my two pigeons could not get out unless somebody let them out—these pigeons had eggs, and were on the eggs—I saw them all there on the 28th of July—I did not count them, but I can miss one without counting—nobody goes up to the roof but myself and brother—I do not walk on the tiles—it is a left at the top of the house—I do not mean to say the prisoner got in, but somebody must have got in—he said directly that they were in his left, and took us up there at once—they have since brought another pigeon, and said it flew down the chimney, but it was not mine.</p>

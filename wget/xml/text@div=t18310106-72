            . I am a Police-officer. On the 27th of December I saw the prisoner in Woodbridge-street, Clerkenwell, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock at night - he had these three rails on his shoulder; I asked how he got them - he said he gave 4d. for them: he made some resistance, and I had some difficulty to take him.</p>

I did not miss any of these rails till they were produced; I knew them again, having put them up, to keep people from going down into the coal-cellar - I took the prisoner with them about a hundred yards from the place, before the officer came up; I suspected they were what I had put up, but was satisfied of it when I fitted them to the place - they had been taken the same night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you fixed them yourself? A. Yes - some others had been taken from the spot, and I put down two of these; I had seen them that morning - if any had then been gone I should have missed them; they run the whole length of the street, and the next morning I found the greater part of them were loose - a great many boys play about there.</p>

            . I first missed the rails, and first saw them in the prisoner's possession, not fifty yards from where they were taken; these are three of six which were taken that night- these three were safe about seven o'clock in the evening, and I saw the prisoner in possession of them about half-past eight; the first three were missed about half-past six- I went round again in half an hour, and these three were gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then you missed three, two hours before these were found with the prisoner? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along, and met a man, who asked me to buy these bits of wood, and I gave him 4d. for them; these gentlemen came behind me, struck me on the head, and gave me a black eye.</p>

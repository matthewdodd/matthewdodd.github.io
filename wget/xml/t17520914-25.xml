I staid there about half an hour, then brought the goods to London to where they were bought, in order to prepare a proper advertisement. I went then to Finchley, and had a search warrant, and searched two or three houses there, but found nothing at either. There was a box picked up on the Common by a man with a hay cart, which was carried to my inn, the cord was cut, but the box had not been opened, it was directed to esquire Bradeel at Preston. The robbery was on the Friday, I set out again for Lancashire on the Sunday morning, after leaving money in my landlord's hands for him to spare no cost in inquiring and advertising to find the goods. I overtook my man with the horses at Fenny Stratford, there was then one of the fifteen horses without a pack.</p>

            , I was the driver of these packhorses, my master and I set out on the 24th of July from Lad-lane, he left me at Islington and went back. When I came to Highgate, I had all my horses and packs, one horse carried a woman, and 15 with packs; I stopped and drank at the Wrestlers, and there told the horses over; it was then dark and a rainy night. I turned them before me, and did not stay above five minutes after them, and kept with them all the way till I came about a quarter of a mile beyond Brown's Wells, sometimes on the side and sometimes behind them on foot. Near the six mile stone, but it was so dark I could not see it, in telling them over I found the bald mare with her halter about her feet, and no pack on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss her out of the number before you found her unloaded?</p>
               <p>Fenton. I told them and I thought I had made a mistake in telling them, so I ran forward and found she was about the third or fourth without a pack. Then I got upon her and looked about backwards and forwards for almost an hour, but could not find any thing; then I rode on and over-took the rest of the horses on this side Barnet; I believe it was then betwixt 10 and 11.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with any body that you drank with on the road?</p>
               <p>Fenton. No, I did not. I was quite sober. I went on to my inn the White Lion at Coney, and got there betwixt 12 and one. Then I dispatched a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175209140011"></xptr> messenger to let my master know what had happened, and proceeded for Lancashire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search to see if your saddle things were cut?</p>
               <p>Fenton. The saddle and girt were safe; but the wantey that fastened the pack on was taken away.</p>
               <p>Glover. The wantey was found on Finchley common. I saw it on the Saturday morning, it appeared plain to be cut.</p>
               <p>Q. to Fenton. Did you observe any body on the road that night molest you?</p>

I asked her if she knew any thing of the goods? she knew me again by seeing me at the searching of the house. She carried me to an adjacent place in her mother's house, and there I found two pieces of brown callimanco, another piece of dark callimanco, some red, some yellow, of the remnant of which her gown was made. And likewise another gown cut out, which she said was for her sister. Some muslin wrappers, and calico wrappers, black gloves, white gloves, womens green shoes, a handkerchief with pins in it, a piece of new lawn, an apron. (These all produced in court at they were named over.) I brought her to town and had her committed.</p>

He now looks on the goods found at Deptford, womens black leather gloves, pins, mens black gloves, womens shoes, and some silk gymps.) Of these I can swear I put the mark on six pair of womens gloves; and I made the mark on the board to the gymps. The gloves were for Addison, and the gymp for Branthwaite.</p>

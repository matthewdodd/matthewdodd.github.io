                  </hi>. I belong to the firm of Perrott, Watts, and Penrott—we are packers, and live in Tenter-street, Moorfields—we make up our ac<lb></lb>counts four times a year—we have a collecting-book made up every quarter—on the 19th of Aug. Messrs. Dixon and Co. were debtors to us—on the 29th of Aug. Messrs. Butler were debtors to us, and on the 19th of Sept. Messrs. Brusiotti were in our debt—if the prisoner had received any money of those persons, it was his duty to pay it to me, or to my servants—he ought to have paid it to Warwicker, and in less than an hour it would have come into my hands—on this list, under Messrs. Dixons' name here is, in the prisoner's writing, "No account," and under Messrs. Butlers' name is the prisoner's writing, "Next Saturday"—these receipts on these bills of Dixon, Butler, and Brusiotti's are the prisoner's writing—I gave the prisoner into custody—there was nothing said to induce him to make any statement—he stated that all the money he had received, he had paid over to Warwicker, who was a villain and a scoundrel, and we should find him so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am book-keeper to the prosecutors—it was my duty to keep the casebook correctly, and to receive the money from the prisoner and other persons who collect—on the 7th of Nov, I gave the prisoner a paper with Butlers' and Dixons' account on it—I had on the previous day, when he went out, directed him to call on Messrs. Brusiotti—he brought back the list, and gave an account of what he received—I put that in the cash<lb></lb>book—I went through the original list and I asked him what the Butlers said—he said, "They said they will pay next Saturday"—(this was on the 7th of Nov.)—I came to Dixons' account, and he said, "No account"—he wrote that down—I told him to write it, to prevent any dispute—I had some tima previously asked him about Brusiotti, and he told me they would not pay till the account was more—he did not pay me these sums.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Your mode is to have a cash-book, and to give the people lists, who go out to collect the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and when they come home I credit the account in the cash-book—the prisoner has latterly done nearly the whole of the going-out—perhaps one more goes out beside him—I give lists to perhaps four persons—Mr. Thomas Perrott, Mr. Watts, the prisoner, and Mr. White—it sometimes happens that when persons are going to the docks or elsewhere, I give them a list—I know these sums were not paid, by their not being entered in the cash-book, and I should have recollected it—this is the cash-book—I cannot recollect who paid without referring to the book—when persons have come in and I have been in a different place from where the cash-book was, I have not made the entry immediately, at all times—it is very likely I have been pressed by the</p>

               <p>prisoner to enter a payment in my book, but have been engaged, and not done it then—I have never forgotten anything—I have always credited the accounts on the same day—I may have credited them three or four hours afterwards—the prisoner has never complained to me—he may have asked me to cross off accounts when he has paid me, and I have refused because I have been busy—I have a great deal to do—I manage the affairs of the counting house—I have never lost the list and asked the prisoner and others what was the amount they paid, and from whom they received it—there has been no transaction like it—we have gone on working for Dixons' ever since—this was the Midsummer bill—the words, "next Saturday" were written against Butler's account—if the prisoner went to Dixons' one day, it is not very likely that Mr. Perrott might call the next Saturday—I have been in the habit of sending the prisoner out principally with these small accounts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever had any notion of leaving Messrs. Perrotts' service and setting up with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I can hardly call it a notion—such a thing was mentioned—I do not know any of his friends—he mentioned to me some months ago about his advancing money, and I to join with him in setting up—I never entertained the notion for above a week—I will not swear that I did not mention it first to the prisoner, I might—I know a person named White—the prisoner has not refused in White's presence to go out collecting, unless I would give him receipts when he came back—he never asked me for receipts.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who makes out the list? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—when the party collects money he crosses it out on the list—I should say the longest time that had elapsed after I have received the money and these lists from the persons, before I entered them, has been four hours—I have the list to refresh my memory when I enter it—the list would contain the prisoner's or the collector's marks—I compare the list with the cash-book every night—the prisoner makes the crosses on the list—he has carried money to the Bank and brought back the wages in gold and silver, and it has been paid in<lb></lb>stantly.</p>

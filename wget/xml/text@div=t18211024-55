He said he had taken them. He did not call till Wednesday, and then said his sister was out of town, or she would advance the money, and he would bring them all back on Friday; he did not come on Friday, and so I had him apprehended, and then some duplicates were found, which led us to miss other things.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner at his sister's, at Camberwell, on the 17th of September, and found duplicates for two silver forks, one plated waiter, and two pair of decanters; he said, "I have all the tickets of Miss Watson's property, except one for the plated dishes;" I asked what was become of that, he said he took the dishes without one of the handles, in consequence of which, the pawnbroker did not lend him so much by 1 l., and kept the ticket until he took the handles, and he was then to have another 1 l.; that he could not afterwards get the handles, and did not have the ticket, he said he got 5 l. for them, and was to have had 6 l.</p>

On the 28th of August, the prisoner pawned a plated waiter for 1 l. 5 s., it was worth two guineas - on the 1st of September, he brought four plated dishes and covers, and asked for 6 l.; I asked for the handles, he said he had forgotten them, in his hurry, that he was a plate dealer, lived at No. 24.

(as he had a person waiting for a bill) he would bring them, and have the other 1 l. another day - I found he did not come. I made a duplicate out in the evening. He brought them in a box which had his initials, "N. S." on it. They would cost fifteen guineas; I think them worth 12 l. now - I questioned him a good deal, and apologised for questioning him so. One dish alone is not worth 3 l.</p>

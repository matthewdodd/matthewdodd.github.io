                  </hi>. I live in Hoxton. I am porter to Robert and George Webb, of St. John-street—they are contractors for the Blackwall railway—I have seen the prisoner frequently about the railway—Mrs. Whatten gave me information, and I went with her to the Old Fountain public-house—I found the two prisoners there and these two pieces of timber against the wall—I asked where they got them—Hughes said it did not belong to me, he had taken it from some old brick-work which he had been pulling down the day before, and Hearn said he had bought this short piece, but he thought it was only fire-wood—I had ordered some timber to shore up a house, and this is a part of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Whatten, a bricklayer, we occupy a house in the line of the Black wall railway—there was a plank which had been used for wheeling some sand. On Monday I saw Hughes carry that plank into the Old Fountain public-house, and Hearn followed him—I saw them then return to the works, and in the mean time there had been a load of timber put down—they stood by it and were conver<lb></lb>sing over it—Hughes turned some of it over and then he took this long piece out, put it on his shoulder and carried it away, Hearn followed him with another piece—I sent a message to Mr. Pressney, and he and I went to the Old Fountain public-house—the prisoners were there with the wood.</p>

On the Monday in question I saw the prisoners near my house, about eight o'clock—I heard Hughes tell Hearn he wanted some gin—Hearn said the plank would do for a drop of gin—there was a plank across some bricks—and Hughes said he would take that to Mr. Bradley's for a drop of gin—I said, "Leave the timber there; it will be better for you"—I then went to breakfast—my wife afterwards called me to look at them, and Hughes had got the plank on his shoulder.</p>

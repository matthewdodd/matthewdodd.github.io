                  </hi>. I am foreman to Samuel Parker, a bone merchant, in Castle-street, Saffron-hill; the prisoner Burridge was in his service about five years, and slept on the premises. On the 28th of August I went with the witness, Parker, to a marine-store dealer's in Compton-street, Clerkenwell, and there saw a bag, containing bones, which I knew to belong to my master—I fetched my master, and then the bones were gone away—I have once seen a bag and bones of the same description in the hands of Allen—there was one hundred weight, three quarters, and three pounds, and they were worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the sacks they were in did not belong to Mr. Parker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live in Onslow-street, Saffron hill. On the 28th of August, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock, I was at my door, and saw the prisoner Lovey come out of Mr. Brien's gate with a bag of bones—I saw Burridge in the yard with Lovey—Gladwin spoke to me, and I went with him to the marine-store shop in Compton street, and saw the same bag as Lovey had passed me with on his shoulder a quarter of an hour before—I remained at the shop while Gladwin went to fetch his master—while I stood there Lovey came in with another sack, and I stopped him—he said a man had employed him to carry them, and given him three pence—I carried the bag to the station-house, and gave him in charge—neither the policeman nor Lovey would carry the bones—I was obliged to carry them myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. I followed Lovey, in consequence of what my husband said. There is an archway leading into Compton-street—he went through that, and before he got to the archway by Clerkenwell Church, I saw Burridge join him, and they went on to gether—Burridge swore at him, and said, what did he stop there for, and to come along—I saw them go through the archway together, and then I came away.</p>

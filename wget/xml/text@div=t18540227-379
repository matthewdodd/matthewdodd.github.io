                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City police. On 14th Feb., I was in Oxford-street—I saw the two prisoners in conversation together, near the shop of Mrs. Gower—Jones went in the shop, and Beard remained outside, near the shop door—before Jones went in the shop, Beard went to the shop door and looked in; he then went close to Jones, who was a few yards off, and appeared to give him something—Jones then went in the shop, and when he came out, Beard was a few yards from the door—I went in the shop and got this sixpence, and when I came out they were walking together along Oxford-street, about fifty or sixty yards from the shop; I followed them, and saw Jones and Beard both occasionally looking in shops as they passed, and Beard opened the doors of several public houses and looked in—they walked on sometimes together, and sometimes apart—they went on to the St. Alban's Hotel, in Charles-street; Beard went to the door, opened it, and looked in—he then turned round, looked towards Jones, and raised his hat—Jones was a few yards from the door—he then came forwards, and went into the public house, and Beard walked across the street towards the Opera Colonnade—I went into the hotel while Jones was there; he was being served with some gin—I saw him put down a sixpence; I said to Mrs. Smith, "I think you will find that is a bad sixpence;" she took it up and put it to her mouth, and bent it, and gave it me directly; this is it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270035"></xptr>
               <p>—Jones was then taken in charge—I left him there, and I went out and saw Beard standing between two columns; I took him into custody, and told him I charged him with being concerned with another in passing bad money—I found on him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and copper, and on Jones, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I took them both to the station—all the money found on them was good—Jones gave his address at No. 12, Albert-street, Stepney; I went there, but no such person was known—Beard gave his address in Green-street, Hammersmith; I went, and there is no Green-street there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mrs. Gower, in Oxford-street. On 14th Feb., Jones came in the house for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of postage stamps; I gave him them, and he gave me a sixpence, and left the shop—almost directly afterwards, the last witness came in, while I was looking at the sixpence—I did not give him the sixpence then, but I marked it, and soon afterwards he called again, and I gave it him—after I had marked it, I put it aside, and when he called, I gave it him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

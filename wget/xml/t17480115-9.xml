Yesterday he was committed, and then he did not say he was a shoemaker, but carried coals, and did what he could for a livelihood.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a twitch at your pocket, Do you think you lost your handkerchief at that time?</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going along, and picked this handkerchief off the ground; the gentleman took it in his hand and owned it; he desired me to give it him, and I gave it him directly.</p>
               <p>A Juryman. Was it dirty?</p>
               <p>Jones. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long had you made use of it before?</p>
               <p>Jones. But a very little time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in a dirty place?</p>
               <p>Jones. It was upon the paved stones.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dirty weather?</p>
               <p>Jones. The stones were slappy.</p>

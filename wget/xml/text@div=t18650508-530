I am a licensed victualler, of College-street, City—on 20th April, about a quarter to 8 in the morning, the prisoner came for three halfpennyworth of rum and shrub, and gave me a bad shilling—I said to my potman in the prisoner's hearing, "Look here, is this a bad shilling? for this is the man that gave me a bad shilling before"—I said to the prisoner, "This is a bad shilling"—he said, "Is it? then I must give you another"—he took it up and pulled out a good one—I said, "Stop a minute, we will have a policeman over this affair; it is not the first one you have given me; I have the other in my pocket, and have been waiting</p>

               <p>for you some time"—he said that he had never been in the house before—(I remember his being there on 20th March; he ordered three halfpennyworth of rum and shrub, and tendered a shilling; I found it was bad when he was gone, and kept it in my waistcoat pocket till he came again). I have no doubt be is the same man—I sent my son for a policeman—the prisoner ran out, and ran into his arms—I gave the first shilling to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Gaydon House, Hungerford Road—about 5 o'clock, on 23rd February, I left the house safely locked—I left by the front door and fastened it after me—the windows were shut and the blinds were down.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y R</hi> 28). On 24th February I was near Gaydon House—two or three minutes after 6 o'clock I heard a noise in the front garden, and in an instant I saw the two prisoners rush through the garden-gate into the road—I ran after them and took Coad into custody, and another constable took Driacoll—I then returned to the house, and found a silver teapot lying on the gravel walk close to the window, which</p>

               <p>was open—in another part of the garden I found a toast-rack and cream jug—on the sill in the front of the window I found this jemmy—I aroused the inmates, and went into the house—I found the sideboard emptied of the silver, and there were traces of a foot-mark on the chair under the window—I tried the jemmy to a mark in the paint, and it fitted—I asked the prisoners at the station if they knew anything about the silver which I produced—they said they knew nothing at all about it, nor yet the jemmy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Coad's Defence.</hi> I was going to my work with Driscoll. As we passed the gentleman's house, we saw something lying outside the window. We went up to see what it was, and found it was a teapot. We were looking at it, and the constable came down the street. He sprang his rattle and ran after us. I asked him what we had done; he made no answer, but took we to the station. They said that the lady had lost a parcel of linen, and accused me of stealing it, and I said I did not know anything about it. It was 6.30 when we were taken to the station.</p>

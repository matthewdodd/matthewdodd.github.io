On the 17th of August, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop and bought a handkerchief which came to 2s.; he tended to me a 1l. bank note, I looked at it and told him it was a bad one - He said, "here is another," which I took and requested his address - He said, "

I had the first note by itself - I wrote the address on the good one; I wrapped the bad one in it, and put both in my pocket (looking at the notes), this is the first he gave me. I put his name on it at the watch-house before I parted with it. This is the second note he gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him - A. I told him that having had so many forged notes, I should see if he had given me a right address; he made no objection to it, but went out of the shop towards Queen Anne-street. When we got into Crawford-street, Montague-square, I had not got hold of him, he said he had taken the note at the Green Man and Still, and wished me to go there with him; I said I should go to the first address. He then said he lived in Castle-street, and I must go there with him; I said I would go nowhere till I had been to the first address; but that I thought it very strange that he should prevaricate in that manner, and if he did not choose to go to the first address he had better surrender himself; upon which he ran from me; we were then at the end of Crawford-street - he ran as fast as he could. I attempted to pursue him, but a man ran against me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that appear by accident or design - A. It was designedly, he crossed directly in front of me, saying-"Which is the thief;" he must have seen the prisoner runing before me. I had called out "Stop thief! stop that man."</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man who ran against you knock you down - A. No; I stumbled, and then pursued the prisoner; he was stopped by a soldier and taken to the watch-house, I never lost sight of him. The watch-house-keeper asked him his name-he said it was Thomas

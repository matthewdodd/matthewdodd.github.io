                  </hi>. I am a watchman. On the 24th of July, I was on duty in St. Paul's Church-yard—I saw Mr. John Ress, who was a stranger to me, and the prisoner picked his pocket of his handkerchief—he threw it down—I went up and took it, and took the prisoner—I told the gentleman, he went to the watch-house, and gave his name as John Ress—I am informed he is gone to America—he said it was his handkerchief—the robbery took place just through the piazza of St. Paul's school—I was standing by the church rails—I did not state that I was on the coach-rank.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he saw the hand<lb></lb>kerchief lying on the ground, and was in the act of taking it up, when he was apprehended by the witness, who declared he had seen him take it; which was false.</p>

               <p>I was apprentice to Mr. Theyts; I remember the prisoner coming to our shop, he came between twelve and one o'clock, and rang the bell, he came to inform us that his master had got some fresh lime, we use lime in our business, and I told him there was nobody there that could inform him whether we wanted any or not; he then asked me if I would give him a little small beer? I told him I would; he then came in and went backwards to the back part of the shop, and I watched him, and I saw him take the nails from a copper vessel, and saw him put them into his bosom, between his smock frock and his coat, and he went out of doors, and then I told my fellow apprentice, he was up stairs in the kitchen; I called him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the small beer? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this place where these nails were, light or dark? - Light; I saw him, but I don't know that he could see me; I was gone about half way up the kitchen stairs after a pot, and I looked over the banisters, I was going up to get him the beer, and I could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179306260009"></xptr>plainly see that he took the nails I called to my fellow apprentice, my fellow apprentice came down to him, and then he was out of the shop; I don't know what number he took; I know there were nails in the vessel before I had seen them there before.</p>

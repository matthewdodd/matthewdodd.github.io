               <p>Could they by the hole you have described in the shutter, have undone those bars? - I apprehend they could, I desired my servant with all the force he could to force the shutter, and see if he could not put his arm through, he did, and undid the bar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did this witness ever come down into the kitchen; he says we were taken out of the kitchen? - My servant and I went by ourselves, first the watchmen were alarmed by Mrs. Gale, when we came down we found an inner kitchen door, but one hole made through; they can make four of them in a minute as the carpenter convinced me; there was one hole made through the door, and a second begun.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Gale, on the night my master's house was robbed 31st of August, I was alarmed by the ringing of a bell, which was on a room door, I jumped out of bed, my master stood with a brace of pistols in his hand, and called, says he, Joe, I wish you would go down; Sir, says I, give me the pistols, I will go down directly, my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100038"></xptr> master said, no, leave one with me here for my own sefety, I took one, and as soon as I got to the bottom of the stairs I saw a hole thro' the door, I had undone one bolt, and was going to undo the other: I called to my master, and said, Sir, they are in the kitchen now, we let in the watchmen and went in, and desired them to resign directly; first came out was Berryman, the watchman took hold of him, and he said, for God's sake, Sir, do not shoot me, says he, keep your pistol away, I shall make no resistance, he said, he would go quietly, the watchman rather went out to the other door, they had opened the shutter, and unfastened the outer door, which was so thick lined with nails, that it impeded the enterance of their instrument, and the other prisoner we took, rather of the outside of the fill of the door, and he begged, and prayed, and made a half drop behind the watchman, for fear of being shot.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he in the kitchen too? - I do not think he was, I think he was rather in the area, here are somethings that I found.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you shut your master's house? Yes, I barred the windows myself, and fastened the door.</p>

               <p>Had these people any arms with them? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did you search them? - I did not, as soon as they were gone up, I was employed in searching my master's house, to see if there was no more of them, for I thought it not proper to take their words for that; here are some flint, some tinder, a bit of candle, and somesteel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Blunt. Did you see ever a one particular in the kitchen? - I saw Berryman in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Court. Where does this celler door open to? - It opens into the area, they had unbolted the bolts of that door after they had got into the kitchen, that they might have a retreat.</p>
               <p>Where did you take Blunt? - He was rather on the outside of the sill of the door, rather leaning towards the area, and the other man was in the kitchen.</p>

               <p>When did they beg for mercy? - At the time I rattled, they begged for mercy to let them get up and they would surrender, I told them I would not, they must stay there, Mr. Gale came down, when I went into the kitchen I found they had boared a hole, they opened the kitchen door belonging to the area and got in there, I said, come and resign yourselves, one came to me, and the footman stood in the passage, and they begged for mercy.</p>

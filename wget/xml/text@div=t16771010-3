               <p>The most considerable Tryal was of two Highway-men apprehended at Westminster upon suspition, and in one of their pockets a Watch and silver Tobacco-box, in the others three Rings; of which notice being given in the Gazet, the Owners now came in and prosecuted. The occasion and manner of their being taken was thus: Lodging with others of the Gang, not yet taken, at an Inne at Westminster, some Gentlemen took notice of their often riding out and coming in at unseasonable hours, and inquiring who they were, 'twas pretended they were bound for Ireland very speedily; but suspitions dayly encreasing, the said Gentlemen finding them abroad one Saturday, resolved to watch them all night: About ten or eleven a clock the two that were now Prisoners at the Bar, came in, and going to bed, early in the morning they broke in upon them and secured them. There were here preferred<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16771010004"></xptr>two Indictments against both of them for several Felonies, which appeared to be Robberies in other Counties, and consequently excluded them from the benefit of the Clergie; and a third against one of them for <rs id="t16771010-3-off8" type="offenceDescription">

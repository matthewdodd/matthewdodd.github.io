                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Crawford-street. The prisoner was my shopman for about eight months—in consequence of some suspicion I marked three half-crowns, some shillings, a sixpence, and some coppers, on the 11th of March—I placed them in the till, which was not locked—next morning it appeared to be all right, and the same evening I missed a shilling and two pence, which had been marked—a person named Sampson was staying at my house—I tossed up with him as to who should pay for a newspaper which we was to have for an hour, and the prisoner was to take the loser—I lost in tossing—the prisoner was then to toss with me—he took out a penny to toss with—he put it on the counter, and it fell on the ground—I noticed that it was one of the marked ones, which I had places in the till—I asked if he bad any more, and he produced another marked penny—I asked where he got them, he said from home, I said he did not—he said if I could swear to them he could not say any thing—I asked if he had any more money, and he produced a marked shilling—he said it was one I had given him on the Sunday to pay for his dinner, but I had not any marked then—I bad some silk handkerchiefs hanging in my shop—I told the prisoner I believed he had a handkerchief of that description, and I asked him how he became possessed of it—he said he took it from me—he fetched it down, and begged my pardon—I gave him in charge.</p>

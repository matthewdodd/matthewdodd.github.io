                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 209). On Saturday evening, 7th April, I was on duty in Church-court, Richmond, and coming into the street towards Messrs. Bryant and Fields, I saw the prisoner standing near the pillar under the front of the shop—there was a good deal of property outside the shop for sale, and among other articles a piece of huckaback—I saw the prisoner stoop down and take up the huckaback and endeavour to conceal it under her shawl—she entirely lifted it from the place it rested upon, and got it into her own possession—she covered it partly with her shawl, and turned round hastily into a public thoroughfare; when she had got several yards she looked round, and saw me—she immediately turned back again; and said, "Oh, I was going inside to ask the price of it"—her back was turned to the shop, and she was going away from it—she had got between six and seven yards from the place—I stopped her, and called Mr. Field; he came to the door, I related the circumstance to him—he seemed inclined to think, in consequence of her respectability, that she did take it up for that purpose—she resisted violently, and I called him to assist me—she broke away from me once, but I caught her by the dress again—she refused to give her name or address—I made inquiry, went to her lodging, and found a great quantity of property there, and also at another lodging—I found a quantity of ribbon, in her box, at Mrs. Peters', which I produce.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 3, Grove-place, Hammersmith.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and apothecary, and live at Hammersmith. Mrs. Jackson lodges at my house, and the prisoner with her—I have known her nearly ten years—I remember her having the attack of brain fever; it was the opinion of myself and a brother practitioner that the probability was she would not recover with the use of her senses—she has been very strange and eccentric since that time—I have observed her <hi rend="italic">shy</hi> her friends; if she saw them in the street, she would look round the corner and cross the street, and not meet them—I am of opinion that her mind has been affected, especially since that illness—I have had frequent opportunities of seeing her.</p>

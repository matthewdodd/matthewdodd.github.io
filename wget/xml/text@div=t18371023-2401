                  </hi>. I am a wholesale druggist, and live in Finsbury-circus. The prisoners were both in my service, and I believe are husband and wife—about a quarter-past eleven o'clock on the night of the 1st of October, I went out—a friend had dined with me, and I accompa<lb></lb>nied him part of his way home—I took with me a patent latch key—I returned about twelve o'clock, and let myself in—I made the door fast in<lb></lb>side, as I always do—it was bolted and chained, and could not be opened from the outside by a skeleton key—I retired to bed—I had a particular wooden snuff-box, which I took out with me that night, and on returning home I put it on the mantel-shelf in my dining room, with two other silver snuff-boxes—I cannot be certain whether I saw the other two when I put it down—they are usually there, and I missed nothing—the male prisoner had the charge of my plate, and the key of my plate chest—next morning, about eight o'clock, I awoke, and the male prisoner came into my room, and said, "The plate is all gone, and the snuff-boxes are all gone"—I went down stairs, and saw the female prisoner, who appeared very agitated, and crying—she said she had picked up a telescope on the stair-case—I went down stairs to the butler's pantry, with the two prisoners, and the male pri<lb></lb>soner said the plate drawer had been found open, and the plate was gone—some of the plate had been in use at tea time, the night before—I sent the man for a constable—one came, and two other officers were called in—a search was made, but nothing was discovered—the plate chest was kept in the attic—I went up, and examined it with an inventory, and missed the plate stated, and also the wooden snuff-box, which I had put on the mantel-shelf—I something was afterwards said by the female prisoner—Reynolds, another servant, was present at the time, and I rather think the male prisoner was sufficiently near to overhear her, but I cannot answer to that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. M'Murdo. On the morning the robbery was discovered I saw the female prisoner, when she and my master were together—I think the male prisoner was present at the time, I but I am not certain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called into the prosecutor's house on the morning of the 11th of October—I examined the premises with a view to ascertain whether any violence had been done by persons breaking in—I believe the robbery could not have been done by persons outside—there was no appearance of the house being broken.</p>

                  </hi> re-examined. I was one of Mr. M'Murdo's servants. On coming down stairs, on the morning of the 11th, I went into the drawings-room, and found the windows all safely fastened inside—Mrs. Farley brought me a telescope—I shut the drawing-room door after me when I went out—the blinds were drawn down—there was no shutter—the catch of the window was not fast, and had not been for some time—the windows were shut as they had been for some time—a person could open them from the outside—all the servants slept up stairs—persons could come in at the window from the balcony—the drawing-room door was not locked when I went in.</p>

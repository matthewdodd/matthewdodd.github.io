                  </hi>. I was at the Four Swans on the 22nd of January, between one and two o'clock, and saw the prisoner come into the coffee-room—I am sure he is the man—he took hold of one of the papers, but while he had it in his hand he was constantly looking over the top of it, as if to watch some one—he sat there till about five minutes past two o'clock—I then missed him, and saw him coming down stairs with a blue cloak on—he had come in without a cloak—I sent the porter to watch him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at the Four Swans. I was in the coffee-room, and saw the prisoner come in—I am sure he is the man—he had no cloak on then—he asked me for a glass of Port in English, and I brought it to him—he asked how much it was—I said 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and he gave it me—I saw him for some time afterwards, in the coffee-room—he kept reading the paper, and occasionally going to the waiter's box where I was cleaning the plate—I at last said, "I should like to know what you want here"—he made no answer, but walked away to the middle of the coffee-room, and I saw no more of him till I heard he was gone off with the cloak—he spoke good English—I afterwards went to the Marlborough Head, and found him and the cloak there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter at the Four Swans. On the 22nd of January, about two o'clock, I saw the prisoner come down the stairs with a blue cloak on—that was the first I saw of him—Stone told me to follow him, and said he had a cloak which he had no business with—I followed—I lost sight of him as he turned round the corner to go into the street—I then ran after him, and saw him at the corner of the Green Dragon gate-way—I know he was the person, because he kept continually looking back, and I had seen him coming down the stairs at the Four Swans—I saw his fea<lb></lb>tures—I followed him to the Marlborough Head, and stopped there till I sent to the under-waiter, who came and sent for an officer—we went in and found the prisoner in one corner of the room—he said something in a foreign language—this is the cloak, it was found in the waiter's box as you go in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you not state before the Alderman that you never lost sight of him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know whether I said so or not—I lost sight of him as he turned—I said so, and I believe it is down in my deposition—I believe I read over what was taken down—I do not think it was cor<lb></lb>rect in all parts—I swore to it—I did not see but that it was correct—I do not know whether it was exactly—to the best of my knowledge, it was in the deposition that I lost sight of him—I did not see him go into the room at the Marlborough's Head—the room is a good way back—I suppose that is a hundred yards from the Four Swans—he was walking fast—I could have overtaken him by running, if he had not gone into the Marlborough Head.</p>

In Oct., 1842, the prisoner took a first floor room in my house—he said he would bring his wife to look at it, and he brought a woman who passed as his wife—he gave the name of Bourne—they continued to live there as man and wife till Jan.—Mrs. Bourne was found dead on the 8th of Jan.—an inquest was held on her body, and then for the first time I found the prisoner's name was not Bourne.</p>

After the woman committed suicide, by direction of the overseers, (as it was understood Webb was not her husband,) I went to Harvey's-buildings, to the apartments, and all the goods I found in the room I removed to the workhouse—while doing so the prisoner came into the room, and asked by what authority I removed them—I said, "By order of Mr. Le Breton, our clerk"—he said I had no right to remove them, they were his—he fetched a policeman—I took them to St. Martin's workhouse—I produce a quantity of sugar, a glass soap-dish, salt-cellar, three saucers, some tea, a piece of carpet, a tea-cup and stand, a cream-jug, which has the words, "Reform Club" on it, and other articles—I delivered all the articles to Tetsall, the master of the workhouse.</p>

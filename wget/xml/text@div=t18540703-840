                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am a Norwegian, and am a sailor. On Sunday night, 4th June, I was in a public house drinking with some others—the prisoner is a shipmate of mine—there were six together, drinking—while we were there, the prisoner came in with a girl—I asked him what he brought the girl in for, and I tried to persuade him to go home with me—he was not willing to go—he would not go at present—we went out of the house together—the prisoner and the others, and the girl, all went out together—when we came out the prisoner began to run about; I was waiting for him—the prisoner was jumping about—I took hold of him, and said, "What do you do that for? come home with me"—I turned round, and the prisoner put up his hand and struck me—I had seen a knife in his hand two or three minutes before—he struck me on the ear and the cheek, on the right side—it bled much—I could not get my mouth open—I had no talk with the prisoner before—I had no quarrel with him; only I said he should leave that girl and come home with me—I am sure it was the prisoner who struck me—there was none so close to me, only him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Fox's-lane, Shadwell. I was in Little Spring-street, on Sunday, 4th June—I saw the prisoner, and the prosecutor, and all the rest coming out of the public house—the prisoner was very quarrel-some—all the sailors were trying to get him home—the prosecutor was trying to persuade him to go home—the prisoner was a little tipsy—in going down Spring-street the prisoner fell, and two sailors fell on him—when he got up the prosecutor was coming towards him, and he raised his hand, and struck him—I did not see anything in his hand—as soon as he struck him, the prisoner ran away—I came to the prosecutor's assistance,</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon, at the Tower Hamlets Dispen<lb></lb>sary. The prosecutor was brought to me on the night of 4th June, bleeding severely, with a severe wound, extending from the ear to the chin, on the right side—it was a deep wound; it exposed the jawbone; it had divided the ear—it was a very dangerous wound.</p>

My father keeps the Old Dog public-house in Holy-well-street—On 27th May, about 12 o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my father's house with another woman—the prisoner called for a pint of porter, and paid for it with a bad shilling—I put it into the till—there was no other shilling there—there were sixpences, and fourpenny-pieces—I gave her the change, and she went out of the house with the other woman—she came back again in about five minutes with a woman—I can't say whether it was the same who came in with her the first time—the prisoner called for half-a-quartern of gin, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and offered me a shilling in payment—I tried it, and found it was a bad one—upon that I went to the till and took out the other shilling—I then went to my father and showed the 2 shillings to him—he gave them back to me—when I came back the women were going out of the house—my father followed them and they were both brought back—I had not given the woman change for the second shilling, she went away without it—when they ran out I was showing the shilling to my father—we have two doors to the house—one ran out of one door, and the other out of the other door—they could see me.</p>

For some time I had reason to suspect his honesty. On the 24th of March, about nine o'clock in the morning, I went to Mr. Gay, in Chancery-lane, and gave him two one-pound notes. I took the number and date of them, and requested him to give them to Mrs. Gay, and for Mrs. Gay to go and lay them out at my shop. I returned home at about half past eleven in the morning. When I came in, I asked the prisoner what he had sold. He gave me an account of different articles which I set down in this book, as we always do of the money that we put in the till. He gave me an account of one pair of silk stockings, having sold them for fifteen shillings, and several articles that I cannot enumerate, to the amount of about five pound; he told me there was nothing else to set down. I returned to Mrs. Gay, to know what articles she had bought with the two one-pound notes, and then I returned home, and sent for an officer. The officer went into the back-room. I then came out into the shop, and stated to the prisoner that there was money short in the till; he referred me to the book, and told me that the till and the book would correspond, if I examined them. I told him there was money short, and I missed it. I desired the prisoner to walk into the back-room, where the constable was; he did so; I desired the constable to search him.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you searched him, what did you conceive that there was too short - A. A one-pound note, not accompted for. Upon searching him, there was found three guinea, a few shillings, and that one-pound note; before the constable examined the note, I told what number it ought to be, and the date. When the note was examined, it was the same number and date I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181004110028"></xptr>mentioned. The prisoner acknowledged that he had stolen it: I desired the constable to walk into the shop; I then told the prisoner I had strong reasons to suspect his conduct for some time; now I could prove it so; as he could not deny if, I should be glad if he could tell me to what amount he had robbed me at various times. His answer was, that he had never robbed me but of a five-shilling and a seven shilling-piece before that one-pound note, and that he meant to return that one-pound note on the following Monday.</p>
               <p>JAMES GAY. I am a baker; I live in Chancery-lane. On the morning of the 24th of March, Mr. Nicholson called on me; he delivered me two one-pound notes, with directions for Mrs. Gay to lay them out at his shop; I gave the two same notes to my wife.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH GAY. On the morning of the 24th of March, my husband gave me two one-pound notes; I went to Mr. Nicholson's, and laid them out. I bought of the prisoner with these two one-pound notes six pair of cotton stockings and one pair of silk; they came to 1 l. 16 s.; he gave me four shillings change.</p>
               <p>Q. to Nicholson When you asked the prisoner for the account of what he had sold, did he give you any account of six pair of cotton stockings - A. No, he did not account for them. I entered the account that he gave me; the six pair of cotton stockings are not entered in the book; they came to a guinea; here is one pair of silk entered.</p>

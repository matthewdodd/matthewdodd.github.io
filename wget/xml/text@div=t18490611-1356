                  </hi>. I am foreman of the laborers engaged at the railway at Woolwich—I know the prisoner. On 27th May I met him at the White Horse at Charlton—we left between eleven and twelve o'clock, and when we were just between the turnpike-gate and the half-way public-house, he was walking along-side of me, and pulled my watch out, jumped over the hedge, and went away with it—it had a sixpence with a hole in it, in place of a seal hanging to the ring—I gave information at the station-house—this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine.</p>

On Monday, 28th May, the prisoner pledged this watch with me in the name of John Johnson—he said it was his own, and that he had pledged it once before for 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he returned in the afternoon, and said another man had substituted another duplicate for his, and he wished to stop the watch; and in consequence of information I had received, I detained him till a policeman came and took him.</p>

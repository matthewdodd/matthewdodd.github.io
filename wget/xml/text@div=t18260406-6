On the 20th of March, towards the afternoon, I observed that the shop window had been cut by somebody - it was not cut through, but what is called starred, by a knife being driven into the putty, which cracked it, but made no hole - I immediately went to Bow-street, and a little before seven o'clock the officer (Stevens) came; I went on the opposite side of the way about seven, and kept watch; it was rather dusk, but not quite dark; the lamps were just being lighted; it got quite dark before any thing happened. Samuel Rand, my fellow-shopman, was with me- we parted, and went in different directions, and in about twenty minutes I saw the prisoner and another come to the shop window; there were lights in one window, but nobody in the shop; they passed the window two or three times, did something, and went to the adjoining shop, which is a bookseller's, then returned, and looked into both our shop windows; I could not distinctly see what they did, but I saw one of them put his hand to the window - they went away, returned again, and afterwards I saw the prisoner's hand within the window, which was then broken; I am sure it was within, up to his wrist - I am quite sure of that - I did not see him take any thing: I went and seized him - the officer had gone away; I took him to Bow-street. The broken glass laid inside the window; some tortoise-shell combs laid near that glass, and when I took him I observed that a comb laid partly in and partly out of the window, and the ticket, which was on that comb was gone from it - it was found outside the window by somebody. The other man ran away; the prisoner had taken his hand out of the window when I seized him.</p>

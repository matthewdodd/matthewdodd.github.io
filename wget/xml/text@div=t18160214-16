I generally leave my business at night, about eleven, or half after eleven o'clock; I tell it at rather better than eleven o'clock. My wife was with me, and we left it fastened by two street - door locks, perfectly safe; I felt against the door to try it; it was safe. All the property that was stolen, was safe at that time in my shop. The shop is separate from the lodgers; there is a private door for them. I went to bed shortly after I went home. I was called up at a little before three o'clock by the watchman; that was Chapman. In consequence what he communicated to me, I and my servant, named Valentine, discovered the shop was broken open; that one lock was off, and one staple also. I found my shop was all in confusion; the goods were turn off the shelves, and scattered about the shop; I found my property was gone, a great deal of it. I missed seventy-two coats, worth seventy-nine pounds, and the other articles named in the indictment, which was safe before. Afterwards I applied to an officer of the name of Hancock; I went in company with him to Saffron-hill. That house belongs to a man named Winsley; but it is let out in lodgings. I lit the candle, and had it in my hand; I stopped at the door; I heard some man coming down stairs, and I caught Butler, who had a bundle in his hand. That bundle contained my wife's clothing. When I found him and bundle; I said, where is the rest of the thieves. I called Hancock in. In the consequnce of what we heard of Butler, Hancock went up stairs, and I remained at the street - door to prevent any one going out; I did not afterwards go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. My house No. 22, is in the city of London. The business is carried on at No. 22. in my name.

The first man I lit on, was Butler, I met him just coming out of the street - door; he is the accomptice. I seized him, and pushed him into the passage; I told Solomon to go to the other door, as there was a double stair-case. I then shut the door, and hand-cuffed Butler; I then made Butler go up before me, and I held the skirts of his coat. I went up to the atttic-story. I held him with my left hand, and drove my right shoulder against the door and broke it open; I pulled him in with me and barricaded the door, in order that no one might surprize me without.

They were lying in the bed, with the clothes covered up; the woman layed at the foot of the bed with her feet towards their head. I then told Turner to dress himself. He rubbed his eyes and walked to the window and looked out, and said, there is that b-y Jew. I believe the prosecutor was down stairs; I looked about for something, and fastened Turner to Butler. Turner said, he did not know what was the matter. I saw a long sword hanging up, and I took it down, and bid the other two get up, and I fastened them together also; then I proceeded to search the place, and found these skeleton keys, five bits of gold lace, a bottle of phosphorus, a file, and two or three matches (producing them.) I found nothing else in that room that applies to this subject. I saw the skeleton keys had been recently filed; I did not find any thing else that I place to this. When I entered the room I looked out at the window, and told somebody to go and fetch Banbury. I afterwards apprehended Hurley in Caroline-court; that is on one side Saffron-hill, you turn off Saffron-hill into it.</p>

            , (accomplice.) I know the prisoners at the bar. On the night of the 11th of January, or the morning of the 12th, at about twelve or one o'clock, I left the Thatehed House in Field-lane, and was going towards the Borough, when I met Hurley; he asked me if I had seen a man named Mahony, or Comer, and I said no. He asked me if I would go a little way up Holborn to meet them, and I went with him, and met Comer and Mahoney coming down; when we met them, we went up Holborn, and met two girls, whom they knew, and coming down again, they had a quarrell, and the girls went away. Hurley said there was a shop in Field-lane they were going to break open. We went to the middle of Field-lane, and on the left hand side going down the lane is Solomon's door, I can't exactly tell the number, it is a clothe's shop. I did not know it to be Solomons's, but Hurley said it was. Then two of us. Hurley and I, went into Field-passage, at the other side of the lane; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140021"></xptr>went there to look if any body was coming down while Comer and Mahoney were breaking open the door. Comer and Mahoney broke open the door; I and Hurley were in the passage. While we were in the passage, we heard some persons coming from Saffron-hill way down Field-lane, and then we called Mahoney and Comer off. They came to us, and we let those persons pass us; they were Turner and a man named Bradley, and several women. I called Turner back, as knowing him, and mentioned to him that we were going to break open Solomon's house; he came away with Bradley and these women, and stopped with us. When they were out of the way, we proceeded in opening the door again; Mahoney, Comer, and Turner, then all went to the door; they had a crow bar, and four keys, which I saw. Turner, Mahoney, and Comer, went in; they said the door was open, and Hurley and I followed them in; Turner got a light with some phosphorous, and he put the match to the parlour window, which is in the door, to see if any person was in the parlour; there was nobody there, and three of them went in; I went into the parlour, but was not in there a minute, I took out a lady's green pelisse from the parlour; that pelisse I believe has been seen since, Mr. Hancock apprehended me with it. After I took this pelisse out, I took a whole arm full of things, and went with them to Field-lane-passage. We went seven or eight journeys, all of us loaded with clothes. While we were carrying the things into the passage one of them said, that the watchman had gone out of the lane, from his box, so I carried the armfull of things I then had to Martin Comer's father's house, which is the first door in Red Lion-court; that is the house I gave Mr. Hancock direction to. We made four or five journeys to this house; we carried the things four or five times to Cormer's room; going up the last time, I saw a watchman going down that passage, and almost close by; then we took them up a passage where

             lives up stairs; that was the house in which I was taken. I and Turner took a great many things into that passage. The lamps were lighted, and I saw the watchman from Holborn pass twice; I saw a light coming down from Holborn. I was apprehended before all the things were removed from the passage. A great quantity of things remained in Field-lane-passage when I was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. At my call, Turner joined us; if I had not called him, he would have gone past. I came from the House of Correction this morning, and have turned King's evidence to save myself. I have fallen into bad company. I was never in this Court before. I have been to sea eight years, under Captain White, as his servant; I had left my master; I ran away from him, and went on board the Marine Society vessel. For the last two years I have been a shore; I have worked in the white lead mills during that time; I have worked with Mr. Smith, that keeps the large dust head in Gray's-inn-lane. I have been in custody for an assault about twelve months back; I believe I was in custody about five weeks; the person who gave charge of me knew I was in liquor, and left me to be turned up; I was never to have been tried. I have been taken into the watch-house for being drunk. I have been lodged in Clerkenwell, and now come up from the House of Correction. I had no lodging at Arthur Ellingham's; when I stopped out late, I generally stopped there. I have got my bread lately by thieving.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Tuffnell Arms public-house, Tuffnell Park Road—I have two cricket gardens, divided by a road, one called the old ground, and the other the new—I had two houses in the old ground, one of iron and one of wood, connected by a small room—there is no means of getting from one house to the other without going out of doors—on 26th September I was removing the iron house to the new ground, and some canvas, paper, and felt were stripped off and placed outside the iron house, which was between the felt and paper and the wooden house—that rubbish was set on fire by my orders before 6 o'clock that afternoon—the wind was then north-east, blowing direct from the iron house—I left at 5.45, and then it was all embers—I was sent for to the wooden house about 8 o'clock the same evening, and found it full of smoke—it had been put on fire, but had been put out—the back part was burnt, and the canvas inside the house was partly burnt, but none of the material of which the house was built was on fire—next morning I noticed a hole in the weather board at the back of the house large enough for a man to put his hand in—the can<lb></lb>vas was scorched or burnt near the hole about two feet from the ground—the charring was at the bottom of the hole—the canvas was against the wall—whether it was set on fire from inside or out I cannot tell—the prisoner Tye used to bowl at the cricket-ground for gentlemen—he was there in the summer, but not by my permission—I would not have him on the enclosed ground, and my manager ordered him off—Mr. Brighton lived in the wooden house with his family, and slept there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The place set tire to was not the small room between the two houses, but a small room at the back—there was a communication between the place that was burnt and the living rooms—Brighton had the whole range—those four rooms constituted the whole house—they are all on the ground—the roof is boards and asphalte, and there are windows like a cottage—I do not know that Tye was the engaged attendant of the gentlemen who used the old ground—the new ground is quite apart from the old—the old ground is fenced in with iron hurdles and garden walls.</p>

               <p>between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, there was a fire of rubbish burning—I was near it, with my brother—it was dark, as the fire was very nearly out—it was burnt down, so that there was no flame, but there were some embers—the two prisoners, who I knew before, came up and warmed their hands, and two small boys followed them—they remained there about ten minutes, and then they all four went round to the back of the iron house for ten minutes—that made twenty minutes—I followed them round and saw all four against the wooden house, and smoke and <hi rend="italic">flare</hi>, was coming out of a hole in the wooden house—Tye was as close as he could get to the hole—I ran and told my mother, who was in the kitchen of the wooden house, and got some water and put it out—I saw the prisoner's faces, and knew them before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been out to service, and have had the charge of children for three or four years—I have not been to school very long—I understand the nature of an oath—the fire was burnt down, and there was no light, but I could see the prisoners in the dark—they were quite close to me—the embers gave no light—there was no moon—this was in a field—I also knew Tye by his voice, because he spoke—I said before the Magistrate, "It was dark, but I could distinguish their faces by the fire"—the boys were nearly as big as the prisoners, but I did not take notice enough to say—when Tye spoke, he said "Don't put the fire in your pocket"—I did not tell my mother who had set the house on fire, because I was in such a hurry; but my belief was that Tye had set fire to the house—besides my little brother and me, there was a young gentleman from the farm with us, at the embers—I do not know his name—that is he (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Hope</hi>)—he had been on the ground not quite half an hour, and was there when I saw these men—I told the Magistrate that two of the men worked on the ground, but I did not say the other two.</p>

               <p>I was at a public house, and a man hired me to carry it, he took me down there and gave me this head of a chaise to carry to Whitechapel; and when I was stopped, the man ran away, and Mr. Francis took up a piece of rope, and was going to hang me in the stables.</p>
               <p>Court to Atkins. Is that true? - Mr. Francis was very angry, and he took up a bit of harness, and said now I will take the law in my own hands, I will hang you, but I do not think he hurt the prisoner. The prisoner never said that he had the things from any body.</p>

I came home about five o'clock on the 24th of August, and asked him to clean my shoes; I took off my trousers, with this money in them, and put them on a box in the dressing-room - I went down stairs, and in about five minutes I came up again, to take the money out of the trousers; I then missed upwards of 30s.: my fellow-servant came in, and I sent for the prisoner - I asked him if he had picked up this money; he denied it - I told him I would make him pull all his things off; he still denied it, and my fellow-servant went for an officer - while he was gone, the prisoner said if I would not hurt him he would give me the money; he took some of it out; I said that was not all - he then took out the rest from his inside trousers pocket, and laid it down; I went out for a few minutes - when I returned he was gone; he was taken soon after, for something else.</p>

When the prosecutor came home that day he was quite intoxicated - I was called to go on an errand, and when I returned I went to finish the shoes; I let one of the brushes fall, and in picking it up I saw the money - I should have given it him, but he had some friends at tea. <rs id="t18291029-235-verdict1331" type="verdictDescription">

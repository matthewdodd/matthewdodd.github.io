               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. Not quite sober; I remember every thing I did; we went to bed together. In a short time I fell asleep; I had taken off my clothes and my handkerchief off my neck, and my watch was in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put your breeches - A. I put them on the bed with the watch in them; I awoke between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner was gone; I searched my breeches pocket; my watch, and my handkerchief I took off my neck was gone. I had a seven shilling piece and some silver; the seven shilling piece was gone; four shillings had dropped on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your property again - A. Yes. I found the watch at the pawnbrokers; I went to all the pawnbrokers I could, I gave them the maker's name and the number, for them to detain any person that offered to pledge it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the prisoner is the woman - A. Yes.</p>

My house was broke open on the 15th of March, between seven and eight at night. I went out at seven and returned at eight. I left nobody in the house; I locked the door; it is a spring-lock; I tried it to see that it was fast. When I returned, I found the door as I left it; I opened it with the key; I went in and got a light, and saw a tea-chest which I left upon the dining table in a chair that was in the lower room; there is but one room on a floor. I said to a lady that was with me, that I was robbed, and immediately missed the gowns, which I had left below stairs; I then went up stairs, and missed the plate out of the closet, and my clothes out of a drawer. I came down again and missed a watch which hung over the mantle piece.</p>

               <p>Did you examine how they got in? - I apprehend by opening the door with a key. There were no marks of violence. I was sent for to Sir

               <p>I live at Mile-End New Town. On the 16th of March, between ten and eleven o'clock, a young woman brought six or seven gowns to me from Mrs. Ireland. Mrs. Ireland came in after her; there were two silk gowns, and a silk gown not made up. I bought them of her; I was to give her four pounds eight shillings for them; I gave her two guineas in part. In the afternoon Mr. Phillips came and asked for the bundle the young woman brought from Mrs. Ireland.</p>
               <p>Who did you pay the money to? - Mrs. Ireland. She keeps a sort of chandler's-shop.</p>
               <p>Do you keep a shop? - No; I did keep a chandler's-shop, but I do not now; I work at my needle, and do clear starching; I am a house-keeper. I delivered the gowns to Phillips.</p>

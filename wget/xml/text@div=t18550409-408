                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Dowling. On Saturday afternoon, 17th March, about 3 o'clock, we were walking home together—there was a party of about twelve young men and boys, and three or four of them rushed against my husband, and threw him down—some were larger and some smaller than the prisoner; I call him a young man—after my husband was knocked down, the prisoner came up and struck me here (<hi rend="italic">on the temple</hi>), and cut me; the blow knocked me down—Regan held me down by the arm, while one of his comrades robbed me of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my pocket; it was loose in my pocket—he then ran away, and then Regan let me go, and went off with his comrades—they all ran away—I got up, and found I had lost my 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I knew Regan well; I had known him about six months—I described him to the police, and next day, Sunday, they showed a man to me, but he was not the right person, and I would not <hi rend="italic">go</hi> against him—I saw Regan after that, every day till he was taken; he used to come to the window every day gambling—a policeman brought him to my door four or five days afterwards; he is the man.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where were you coming from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the west end; we had been for some flour; we make our own bread—we left home about 10 o'clock in the morning, and went over London bridge, and up the New Cut, to St. John's parish, close to Westminster Abbey—we walked there and back—we had only one quartern of spirits between us—a great many boys are playing about on Saturday afternoons—my husband got up and ran away to see if he could catch the persons—it did not take them many minutes to take my money—I saw the prisoner every day after the robbery, and when I used to get my bonnet and shawl to fetch the police, he ran away—I know the <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> who took the money; I see him every day, but he always runs away—I was not the least unsteady—I knew what I was about well—I never was tipsy in my life, and my husband is a man who drinks nothing to hurt him—on the Sunday evening, when the policeman brought me the man to look at, I did not hesitate before I said whether he was the person or not—I said that I would not take a false oath for anybody—I gave information to the police two or three times—the policeman did not advise me as to what I should</p>

               <p>do to get my money back—I call it Cross-street where this took place; I do not know what it is called, but I have lived there two years—the men and boys are always tossing when the police are away—I saw no policeman for them to run away from at the time this happened; they rushed against me; they have plenty of dens to hide them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said that you knew one of the party, what did you mean? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I knew him by sight, as I might know you—it is a great place for gambling, and they come under my window—it is a street shut up at one end, but they can get out of it through a public house—one end is in Nicholl-street, and the other runs into Old Nicholl-street—there are two Nicholl-streets—there is a thoroughfare, by going through the public house—when they ran away, after knocking me down, a party of them ran into the public house; my husband ran as far as the door, and they shut the door.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 97). A description of the prisoner was left at the station house on the same Saturday evening, but I was not pre<lb></lb>sent—I first received a communication from the prosecutrix on Tuesday, 19th; she described the person who she said had assisted to rob her, by per<lb></lb>son and by name as well—in consequence of that I looked for and appre<lb></lb>hended the prisoner, who I knew, having seen him several times before—I told him I wanted him for knocking down a woman, and robbing her, on the 17th; he said that it was not him, it was some one else—I took him to the prosecutrix, and she identified him at once.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you taken somebody into custody on the Sun<lb></lb>day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; that was some other constable—I do not know where the prisoner lives, I know him by sight about there; I see him there every day—they often give me chase—the exact words that the prisoner said were, "It was not me, it was some other person"—I have not the least doubt about it—I cannot be certain whether he said, "I am not the right person.

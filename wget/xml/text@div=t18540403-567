I am thirteen years old—I have a bro<lb></lb>ther, named John, he is getting on for eight years old, I believe. On Thursday afternoon, a fortnight ago, my mother came home about 2 o'clock—she was not very sober—she went into the back room—the two little boys were there—I was in the front room—I sent Johnny into the room where my mother was—in about 5 minutes I heard him cry, and saw him come out of the back room—I ran down stairs after him, and saw him at the street door, with his head bleeding—I took him to a doctor's in the <hi rend="italic">Cut;</hi> Mr. Brooks attended him, and sent for a constable—there was nothing the matter with my brother's head when I sent him into the room—there was nobody in that room but my mother and the little boys.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Arlington-place, Kennington, and assist the surgeon at the workhouse. On the Thursday evening, the little boy was brought to me—I found three wounds on the left side of his head—the skin was broken in one—they must have been inflicted by some heavy blunt instrument—the child has been under my care ever since—they were serious wounds—he has not been in actual danger—I have seen the prisoner once, medically—she was admitted into the Lambeth workhouse, supposed to be insane—she remained there about sixteen hours—I did not see any symptoms of insanity about her; she had not been violent—I did not hear any of the particulars—I do not know who brought her—she complained of having been very much ill used, and she bad the marks of several severe bruises on her arms, head, and shins—that was about a month ago—I should not think that her head was affected by those injuries; the most severe blows were on the legs.</p>

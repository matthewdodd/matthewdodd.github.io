On the 3d of October, about a quarter before two o'clock, I had occasion to go to No. 145, on the third floor; I might be there a quarter of an hour; when I came back I saw the prisoner in the alley, where the tea was lying; he was looking towards the door of No. 19; he then put his right hand into the chest, and took out a handful of tea, which he put into his right-hand breeches pocked - I waited to see if he would take any more, which he did not - he then rubbed down his breeches and thigh and threw some of the tooth and egg into the chest. I went up to him and said, "Are you satisfied;" he said "Yes, it is all right;" I said, "I am not," and I desired him to go with me; he said he had taken a little tea, and he hoped I should not hurt him. I took him to the counting-house; he wanted to go back to fetch his stick, but I would not let him. I told the elder what I had seen;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270089"></xptr>I desired him to get a tray, I put my hand in the prisoner's breeches and took out the tea.</p>

            . I am an elder in the East India Company service. I was called to elder's office by Upton; I said, "What is the matter;" he said, "Here is a tea job - I saw it taken from his right hand breeches' pocket;" I do not think the prisoner said any thing about it. I weighed the tea, and found 4 ozs. - has been in the service ten years.</p>
               <p>The prisoner pleaded poverty, and received an excellent character.</p>

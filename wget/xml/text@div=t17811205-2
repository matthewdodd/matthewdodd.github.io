We have only lived there since this affair happened. Since that he has had the good-look to be a serjeant. This affair happened about three weeks ago upon Monday.

               <p>At what time did this happen? - I can't say the day of the month, I went out between eleven and twelve, it will be three weeks ago, when Monday comes, when this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Did you leave any body in your house? - No; I locked it, and found it locked: I returned about three o'clock in the afternoon. When I returned, there was a petticoat gone, and an apron, and this pocket-handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Where in the house did you leave those things? - The apron upon a line, drying before the fire; and the petticoat was wet, and hanging upon a nail.</p>
               <p>Did you see any marks of violence upon your house? - No; none at all. They persuaded me the house was haunted, and sure enough I found it was haunted. I was afraid of my life.</p>
               <p>No part of the house was broke open? - No, sir; I left it locked, and found it locked.</p>
               <p>What reason have you to suspect those two girls? - Because the little one was going to pawn it on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>What day of the week did you find your things gone? - On the Sunday; the next day in the morning, the little one was going with this to the pawn-broker's. I saw it, and took it from underneath the cloak she had on.</p>
               <p>What is the little one's name? - Catherine.</p>
               <p>How old is she? - Not nine years old.</p>
               <p>Is she sister to the other? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did you find the other things? - This handkerchief I bought it out of pawn, they had pawned it. I took it from Mr. Browne's.</p>

               <p>I was going to a place upon Saturday. I was in that woman's room; she told me to sell one of my mother's beds: I would not. I pawned all my things. I took her apron and pawned it, and she took me up for it.</p>
               <p>Court. To the prosecutrix. What value did you put upon them? - She said she did not know the value.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not only necessary the goods should be of the value of 5 s. and no person in the house; but absolutely requisite the house should be broke open, to make the person fall within the penalty of this act. There is no evidence of that, therefore it is less necessary to take notice of the value of the goods whatever they are, as the house was not broke open, they can't be capitally convicted.</p>

In consequence of suspicion on the 12th of December, between five and six o'clock, I concealed myself in a ware room adjoining my shop; as I went in I met two of the men coming out of the shop going to their tea; the prisoner was then the only person left behind; I then went in my place of concealment, I might be there about five minutes. I observed through a hole in the partition the prisoner coming from an upper shop into a lower one; he left his candle in the upper one, consequently I could not see him in the lower one; I could hear him distinctly in the lower shop, as if he was taking up some loose materials that sounded like brass I could hear them drop as if into a bag or pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay in this lower shop. - A. About a minute and a half; he returned from the lower shop into the upper, and put out the candle; then he came down and went into the retail shop; I followed him; when I came in the front shop, he was asking my man to change a bad shilling I had given to him a day or two before. I desired the man to change it, and I walked out of the door and stood upon the pavement; the prisoner came out and passed me; as he was going about half way over the street I hailed him, he came back to me; I took hold of him and told him he had robbed me. He said he had not. I told him in positive terms that I heard him doing that which he ought not, and insisted upon it that he had something upon him. On this the prisoner fell on his kness and begged my pardon, saying he had robbed me and would come in the shop and take the things out himself. He walked into the back shop and took it out of his pocket himself. - These are the pieces of brass, I have no doubt but they are mine.</p>

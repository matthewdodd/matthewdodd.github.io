            . I am a watchman. On the 22d of April, about a quarter to five o'clock in the morning, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310009"></xptr>was in Crown-street, Finsbury, and saw two men standing in a door-way, one with a livery coat on, the other had a hat tied up in a handkerchief - it was broad daylight; they were about the eighth of a mile from Mr. Sykes'; while my back was turned they shifted across the street into another door-way; while I was ringing at a public-house to call some people up, a man passed, looked at the two men, and then looked at me - I thought all was not right, and was going to challenge them, when a private patrol in the same street got out of his box, and started them; they moved off, and as I went towards them I saw a piece of linen drop from under the coat of the man in the livery coat; that man went up Clifton-street, and got away - I followed the other, who was the prisoner Smith; he was caught, and given into my custody - I lost sight of him three or four times, merely as he turned the corners; but am sure I caught sight of the same person, and that he is the man - I saw him throw a hat down, which was tied up in a silk handkerchief; it was the same as I had seen him with in the door-way - I do not know that I have seen the man who was in his company since - I saw him make a blow at Holden, who pursued him - I also saw him drop a bottle which had some liquor in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you the first person who pursued? A. Yes; persons who were before me joined in the pursuit, after I gave the alarm - I had a great coat on, and had been up all night, and was tired - Holden ran faster than me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner SMITH. Q. Did you not see the man in the livery coat give me the hat. wrapped up in the handkerchief? A. No - I saw him pull the coat off, and the linen dropped; my brother watchman took up the coat and linen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see Jackson? A. I saw him a little before five o'clock the same morning, standing at the corner of the City-road, just out of Finsbury-square - I was without my watchman's coat, and saw him look at me, and walk away - I then went after him, and called Stop thief! - I lost sight of him for about a minute; but am certain he is the person; he was taken by a watchman of St. Luke's; I saw a hat drop off his head; it appeared never to have been worn before.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far is Mr. Sykes' house from Finsbury-square? A. I cannot exactly tell; the hat which fell from him appeared the same as the others found; they all three appeared hats of one sort and east; I believe nothing was found on his person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You believe you assisted in packing them? A.

            . I am a watchman of Long-alley, Sun-street. On Sunday morning, the 22d of May, about four o'clock, I saw the prisoner Jackson, alone, coming up Long-alley: he passed me as I sat in my box - I thought he seemed rather intoxicated; in about a quarter of an hour after that I heard a rattle spring, at the corner of Clifton-street - I went to the spot, and saw this piece of print lay on the pavement; I left it in charge of the watchman, and went in pursuit - I turned back, came down Long-alley again, and saw Smith coming up Long-alley, in the custody of Bollen and another man; I went with him to the watch-house, pulled off my coat, and went in pursuit of another, and in the City-road I saw Jackson running - I called to another watchman to stop him; one tried to stop him at the corner of Featherstone-street, but he crossed over, and got down Tabernacle-row; he was secured; he had a hat on then, but it fell of several times on the way to the watch-house; it was delivered to Tickner - I did not observe whether it fitted him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How did it happen to fall off?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310010"></xptr>A.

            . I am a constable. On Sunday morning, the 22d, between six and seven o'clock, I was fetched to Mr. Sykes' premises; I found two locks broken open, and one picked; and in the top warehouse I found a taper, two old hats, and an old cap left behind; they have all been a good deal worn; one hat is torn; an old umbrella was found in the yard, which nobody claimed - I have not fitted the hats on any body.</p>
               <p>JACKSON'S Defence. I was in the City-road about four o'clock in the morning, going home rather intoxicated, three or four watchmen laid hold of me: a young man collared me, and beat me with a stick, but I never resisted; he took up a hat in the watch-house, and said, "Does this belong to you?" I said, No; there were three hats there.</p>
               <p>SMITH'S Defence. A man gave me the things at the corner of Clifton-street, and said, he would pay me for carrying them; the watchman saw him give them to me.</p>
               <p>JACKSON - GUILTY. Aged 21.</p>
               <p>SMITH - GUILTY. Aged 16.</p>

               <p>Was you in Golden-lane when Mr. Murphy's house was attacked by the mob? - Yes; during the whole time.</p>
               <p>When did the mob first begin to demolish it? - Between the hour of six and seven on Wednesday the 7th of June. I saw the prisoner enter Mr. Murphy's house and go up stairs. I afterwards saw him at the top of the house, helping to destroy the roof, and throwing the tiles down into the street. I expected he would fall from the top of the house to the bottom; at about eight o'clock, in the little street adjoining to me (I have lived there twenty-two years) I saw one Mr. Nunn, who had been in the action himself, wallowing drunk. I went to get him home; the prisoner put his hat up to Mrs. Bevans's face and said D - n you smell it, it has been full of gin, and if you want any I will fetch you some.</p>
               <p>Did he say where he fetched it from? - He fetched it from Mr. Murphy's.</p>
               <p>What was done to Mr. Murphy's house? - It was demolished from the bottom to the top; every thing was demolished.</p>
               <p>Are you positive the prisoner is the person of whom you have been speaking? - I am; when he was fetched before the justice I said, My friend I am sorry I see you here, for I must speak against you; my conscience will not let me do otherwise. I shed tears for him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280067"></xptr>Court. Was it upon your evidence he was first apprehended? - No; I did not inform against him.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - I had seen him several times, he living in Playhouse-yard, but never to speak to him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What time of night are you speaking of? - The first time I observed him was about seven in the evening of the 7th of June.</p>
               <p>How long did you see him there? - For the space of about three quarters of an hour in the house; he might be there longer for what I know.</p>
               <p>You hardly knew him before I understand, did you know his person before this? - Yes, for a few years back I knew him.</p>
               <p>Where was you standing at this time? - I was at my one pair of stair's window facing Murphy's house, and could see every transaction as plain as I can see you.</p>
               <p>Can you see well at a distance? - Yes, I can; thank God I have my sight pretty clear. I am sorry it happened for me to be in the way to see this.</p>
               <p>And do you swear that you saw this man on the top of the house? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - Between seven and eight, or rather before seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>What other part of the house did you see him in? - Chiefly at the top of the house.</p>
               <p>Did you see him there a quarter of an hour? - If I said half an hour I should not tell a lie.</p>

               <p>In the course of that evening did you see any thing of the prisoner? - Yes, my house is opposite. I never was out of my own house during the time. I did not see him at Mr. Murphy's house; he came before my house after they had done at Murphy's house, How long after they had done as you call it, was it, before he came before your house? - A quarter of an hour. He offered me his hat which was exceedingly sopped in the gin; he pushed it into my hand, and said he would fetch me a hat crown full of gin to drink; I insisted upon his keeping off, and taking his gin away, for I would have none.</p>

               <p>You saw a man there of the name of Nunn? - Yes, he was exceedingly in liquor in the horse-way. The prisoner endeavoured to put on Nunn's shoe, which had fallen off. He was so much in liquor that he fell down.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing to you where he fetched the gin from? - Not a word, but I was standing at my own door. I saw where he went to and came from; he came from Murphy's house along with the rest of the mob to my house.</p>
               <p>You did not yourself see him at Murphy's house? - No further than coming in the mob from Murphy's house to my door.</p>
               <p>Murphy was a publican, and dealt in spirits? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Perhaps it was a fortnight after? - I cannot be punctual to the day when he was taken up.</p>

               <p>Was you there when Mr. Murphy's house was attacked? - I saw a great mob in the street. I heard the glass fly; I went to the door. When I came up to the house I saw a great many people in it, breaking the windows. I knew several of them. Some people came to me and told me my house would be the next to be pulled down, for that Mrs. Clarke had declared I had Murphy's goods in my house. I stood at my door till Murphy's house was pulled down nearly. The mob called to them to come out for they were afraid the house would fall upon them. They came out into the street. There was a cask of gin in the street; they dipped their hats into it and drank a good deal of it.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - I have seen him; I had no acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>What did you see him do? - I saw him with his hat full of gin. When he came to my house, he fell down under the window.</p>
               <p>How do you know he came from Mr. Murphy's? - I saw him come from Mr. Murphy's house with the gin in his hat.</p>
               <p>Did you give the information against the prisoner? - When I went down to the Artillery-ground, the justice asked me who I was most in fear of; I told the justice several of the neighbours were concerned. I told him of Bulkley for one, and several others who are gone away, and are not taken. I told the justices; they told the constables to take away whatsoever people they saw. When I was down there about Mr. Clark, the second time, I was ordered to attend again.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You say the prisoner had gin in his hat? - He had when he came to my door.</p>
               <p>Where he had that from you cannot tell? - He had it out of a butt which was taken out of Mr. Murphy's house into the street.</p>
               <p>I think you stood there? - Several people came and said Mrs. Clark was determined to have my house down.</p>
               <p>Is your door in sight of Mr. Murphy's house? - It is.</p>
               <p>And you had your eye upon the rioters there? - A great many of them threatened my house. I took notice of as many of them as I could to make interest with them that they might not pull my house down when they came there.</p>
               <p>If the prisoner had been doing any thing else but getting this gin in his hat you must have seen him? - I saw him when he came across with the rest of the mob with the gin in his hat.</p>
               <p>That is all you know of him? - That is all I know in particular of him.</p>

               <p>Then according to your account you saw this man from five in the evening till ten at night? - I did.</p>
               <p>Was he perfectly sober all the evening? - I cannot say, he was sober when he first came.</p>
               <p>Had he any liquor with you? - We had three pints of beer between him and I and his wife. When we sat at the door we had a pot of beer. We did not drink it all, we had a pint more when we went to supper.</p>
               <p>He probably then got sober? - He was not over and above drunk at first but a little in liquor. When he gets a little in liquor he is like a madman.</p>
               <p>But he was in his sober senses that evening, for he came to tender his services? - Yes; he wanted to help move off my master's property before the second mob came.</p>
               <p>What did he say about the second mob? - He said he would have me move off the best of my master's goods before the second mob came to destroy them, the mob said another mob would come, and we must hang out a flag of truce, which I did. He said when he went out, I will go and see for my friends to let them know where their property is, and then I will be back with you again.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - That was rather before five.</p>
               <p>And he never was out of your sight from that time till ten o'clock? - Not till very near ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>How far is your house from Mr. Murphy's house in Golden-lane? - If it was quite straight not half a gun-shot.</p>
               <p>Forty, fifty, or sixty yards? - It might be that compass for what I know.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Bevan's house in Golden-lane? - I do not.</p>

I was at his house the 15th of last month; an information was laid against a neighbour. I said it it well Mr. Bulkley that you have kept out of these broils. He said yes he had not been at all in it, except in assisting Mr. Lynch the pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Has he been always in his business since? - Yes, he has been working in his open shop since.</p>

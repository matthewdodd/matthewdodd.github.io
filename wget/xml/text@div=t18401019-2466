                  </hi>. I am waiter at the York and Albany tavern, in the Regent's-park. On Tuesday evening, the 29th of September, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner was in the tap-room—the pot-man, Henry Brown, a groom named Shill, and other persons were there—the prisoner was sitting down with his arms on the table, leaning forward—he was drunk—while he was sitting there I took up a splinter, which is used for lighting the pipes, and put it towards the prisoner's hands—it was alight at the time—I did that twice, but did not put it near enough to burn him either time, nor did it touch him on either occasion—on the second occa<lb></lb>sion he said if I did it again he would <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> a knife into me—he jumped up, and put his hand into his breeches' pocket, and took a knife out—I saw the knife—it was shut—I saw him open it—he followed me—I was afraid he meant to stab me, and jumped on the top of the seat on the other</p>

               <p>side of the room to where he sat—he followed me, and made one or two thrusts at me with the knife, across the table which was between us, and I picked up a short whip—he was standing on the floor facing me—I had done nothing to him then—I tried to knock the knife out of his hand with the whip, and struck him with it on the hand the knife was in—I did not strike him till after the second time he made the thrust at me—I did not succeed in knocking it out of his band—I felt the knife enter my belly, when he made a third thrust, just below the navel—I called out that he had stabbed me, and they took the knife away from him—the pot-man interfered then—he had not interfered before—he held the prisoner's arm back, and I got down and showed him where he had stabbed me—I undid my breeches, and the blood was flowing from the wound—the pot-man fetched tome rag, applied it to the wound, and stopped the blood—the prisoner sat down, and called for some beer—the pot-man said he should not have any more there—I went into the kitchen, leaving the prisoner in the tap-room—MR. Knaggs, the doctor, came, he dressed the wound, and attended me till the following Sunday.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 29th of September, I went to the York and Albany public-house, between eight and half-past eight o'clock—I found the pri<lb></lb>soner, prosecutor, and Brown in the tap-room—the prisoner was sitting down leaning on the table with his head down on his arm—he was not asleep, but was quite drunk—I saw Metcalf put a lighted splinter to his hand two or three times, and likewise to his face—it touched his hand—the prisoner wished him to leave him alone, and not trouble his head with him—Metcalf did it again, and then the prisoner said he was an old man, and wished him to leave him alone—on his doing it the third time the prisoner got up, and walked across the room—Metcalf was on the other side of the room—he got up on a seat—the prisoner walked to him—I did not hear him say any thing before he walked across the room—I did not see any thing in his hand—I did not hear the prisoner speak at all when he got to Metcalf, nor see him do any thing—I was sitting near the fire at the end of the room, and did not leave my seat—I have known the prisoner many years—I saw nothing of the stabbing—I heard Metcalf call out, "Take the knife from him," but I did not see the knife—Brown got up, and took hold of his arm—Metcalf pulled down his trowsers, and said, "He has stabbed me"—I did not see the wound.</p>

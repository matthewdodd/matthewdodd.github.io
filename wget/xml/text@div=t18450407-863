                  </hi>. I am a gas-fitter, and live at No. 7, Jackson's-court, St. Andrew's-hill. On Monday afternoon, the 10th of March, about ten minutes or a quarter to five o'clock, I was at my water-closet, from which I can see the back of No. 11, Currier's-row—I saw the prisoner come through the passage, and go up the stairs leading to the water-closet of No. 11—he came back, and then returned up the stairs again—I listened for a few minutes and heard him at the window—I then saw him go down the stairs and look out of the passage—he then returned up the stain again, and I heard the wood-work of the window begin to break, and pieces of glass fall—I listened fora few minutes, then pushed the window up, and perceived him draw himself back again—he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the window in about five feet—I ran out, and went into No. 11, Currier's-row—I did not delay half a minute—I met the prisoner in the passage of No. 11—I said, "Halloo! what have you been up to here?"—he said, "I have merely been to the water-closet"—I said, "Yes, it is a pretty water-closet, you have been breaking into this poor woman's room"—he said, "What do you mean?"—I said, "Come back, and I will show you"—I went to the foot of the stairs and saw the window completely gone—I knocked at Mrs. Knight's door and said, "This fellow has been breaking into Mrs. Haw-kins's room"—he then made a pretence as if he was going up stairs—Mrs. Knight hallooed, "Paget! Paget!" who is a person living up stairs—no one came to our assistance—she opened the street door—the prisoner very nearly <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her down, and tried to runaway—I caught hold of his coat-tail and tore it up to the collar—he ran out, and ran into No. 3, Ireland-yard, where he pulled his coat off and tied it in a handkerchief—he then ran up St. Andrew's-hill—I pursued him with Benbow the policeman—he ran up Knight Rider-street and threw the bundle away—I did not stop to pick it up—he ran up Old Change, and into St. Paul's-church-yard, where we lost sight of him—I then gave information to Barnes, the policeman, and told him who the prisoner was, for I knew him by bif lodging on the same floor about three weeks or a month previous to this, and he then stole a coat—I am sure he is the man I saw break the window, and who I found in the house.</p>

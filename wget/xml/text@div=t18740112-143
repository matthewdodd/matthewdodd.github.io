                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 59, Blackfriars Road—I am a saleswoman—on Saturday night, 20th December, I had been drinking, and I was afterwards locked up in a cell in Tower Street police-station—after I had been there some little time the two prisoners were locked up in the same cell—I had a piece of bacon with me when I went into the cell, wrapped up in a cloth—I don't remember what I did with it; it was there I know—the women were quiet at first, but after a little while one com<lb></lb>menced dancing about and singing, and they wanted me to join them,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187401120062"></xptr>
               <p>because I would not do so they attacked me, and bit my ear, and after that I don't remember what happened—they bit my ear, my lip, and my cheek—when I came to my senses afterwards, the doctor sewed the piece of my car up, and put some strapping on it—my upper lip was very painful at first and was very much bitten—there was a piece right out and there is now—my cheek was very much bitten—there were teeth marks, and I had a black eye for a week after—I think it was the one that made the most noise who bit me, but I don't know which that was—I don't know what the other did—they stood on my stomach, and my legs were discoloured, and I suffered great internal pain for some time—I had some money, but I can't say whether I lost it or not.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector L</hi>). At 9.30 on Saturday, 20th December, Daniels was charged with being drunk, and was looked up—at 10.50 the prosecutrix was brought in—she was in the same state, and was placed in the same cell—at 11.40 Pountney was brought in in the same state, and placed in the same cell—it is the practice to place two or three women in the same cell—at 12 o'clock I visited the cell—at that time the prisoners were dancing about, and the prosecutrix was sitting down—she spoke to me, and said she was all right—about 12.45 I repeated my visit—the prisoners were then sitting on the bench at the side of the cell, and the prosecutrix was crouched up in the right-hand corner—I asked if she was all right; I received no reply—I raised her head, and her face was covered with blood—she was wiping her mouth with an old towel that she had—I found that she had been bitten at the ear—it looked as if a dog had seized hold of it and torn it to pieces—I also found that a portion of her lip had been bitten clean out—there was a mark of teeth on her cheek, under the eye—no doubt they were disturbed by my approaching visit—I asked who did it; she did not speak, but pointed to the prisoners—I examined Pountney with my lamp; her lips were covered with blood, and there were portions like flesh sticking between her teeth; there was a sort of shred between the teeth—the backs of her hands were also covered with blood, and her finger nails—I asked them why they did it—they said they did not know anything about it—there was no one else in the cell—I removed the prosecutrix, and sent for a doctor—the cells are dark, but there are lights in front; you can see when you are in the cell, but not when you are standing outside—there was a man on duty right in front of the cell, but nothing was heard of any cry—the prosecutrix said she was unable to cry out in consequence of being held down by the prisoners—they are visited every half hour—the prisoners had been very noisy and riotous, but the prosecutrix was very quiet—the constable supplied them with water between 12 o'clock and 2.15—the prisoners perfectly well knew what they were about.</p>

I was gaolor on Saturday night at the Tower Street Station—during the night the prisoner and prosecutrix were brought in the worse for liquor—I went to the cell with Mr. Peacock at 12 o'clock, and saw the prosecutrix sitting in front of the door—I served them twice with water—the last time at 12.40—the prosecutrix was then in the same position as when I left her—at 1.15 I visited the cell again and</p>

               <p>she was then lying at the right hand corner, with her head covered up—the prisoners were sitting quite close to her head—she was bleeding—I saw her state and the state of Pountney's mouth, and I agree with what Mr. Peacock has stated.</p>

               <p>I am the constable; I produce the property; I took all these things out of a little Court in Moor-lane, No. 2. I found them there on searching the house; it is let out in tenements; the prisoner was in the room and another man; the things have been in my custody ever since; and they are now in the same condition as I found them; this shirt I took off the prisoner's back, which the prosecutor said was his.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know my linen, because my wife had been unwell for a good while, and I generally gave them to the washerwoman; and I examined them when they came back again; some of them are marked, and some not marked; but they are very particular shirts; there are three different cloths in each shirt; each sleeve has three quarters of a yard, and the width of the shirt is about a yard and nail; I was in great exercise at that time, and used to walk and ride a great deal; this shirt appears to be marked in one of the gussets with J. R. which are my initials.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to that being your property? - This was my property.</p>
               <p>Was that in your bundle when it was carried out of your apartment in Compton-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Look at the other articles? - I was ordered by the Justice to bring, if I had any, remnants of the gowns as proofs of the indentity; here is a piece of the same pattern of one the gowns, and here is another; this gown was hung up in a closet in the prisoner's appartment; and here is another.</p>
               <p>From these circumstances, will you venture to swear that these were the gowns that were your wife's and your property? - They were my property, and I put them in the bundle; this is a part of what the prisoner took away, and what were found in the prisoner's house; the sleeves of the shirts were the full width of the cloth.</p>
               <p>Court. From the marks that you saw on these several articles and your observation upon them, can you say, upon your oath that they are your property? - All but one old sheet.</p>
               <p>Can you speak with the same certainty to your wife's wearing apparel? - I have delivered all the linen to the washer-woman for these four years; I myself examined them, and gave the whole to the washer-woman, and took them from her.</p>

             I am robbed, and I went immediately down stairs; and he said, Mr. Davis, they have taken my bundle; I was in the yard; he went out in the passage; when we came to the end of the passage the door was locked; it was the street-door; there is but one door; finding the door locked, I sent my wife for a hammer, to endeavour to force the lock back; as soon as we got into the street; Ramsay and me went down Compton-street, towards John-street; we went from there through Allen-street; we traced the people through the ruins; we heard of some men going with a bundle.</p>
               <p>What number were they? - We heard there were three men; when we got to the end of the ruins, that runs into Bunhill-row, we heard nothing of them after, then we went immediately home, and my wife said, she had heard of their names; in consequence of that information, the next day, between ten and twelve we went to Mr. Newman and Mr. Negus the constables; I was present, and we went to No. 2, in a court in Moor-lane; I stood at the door with the prosecutor, and Newman and Negus went up stairs; and while they were up stairs or in the room, I cannot tell which, one man jumped out of the window; within a short time after that, Newman and Negus brought down the prisoner; when they brought him into the passage, Newman ordered me and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070063"></xptr>prosecutor to go up, and own the property; I went up, and picked up the things, and brought them down; they were delivered to Newman the constable.</p>

               <p>Were they found in the apartments of the prisoner? - Yes, I went up with him to Guild-hall, and he was committed.</p>

               <p>I am one of the constables that was with Newman, when the search was made at the prisoner's house in Moor-lane; Newman and me went up together to the one pair of stairs door; Newman desired the door to be opened; a woman answered in the room; she said, there was nobody in the room but herself, and she was very ill, therefore the door could not be opened; Newman said, there is enough in the room to open the door; open the door; accordingly the prisoner came with a poker to the door, and made strong resistance; he continued keeping the poker in his hands till we got him down stairs; and into the court; and it was with some difficulty that we got the poker out of his hands; I did not search the room; when we got the poker out of his hand, I held him, while the woman went with the prosecutor and Davis, to search the place; I did not go up myself again into the room; I can say nothing as to the situation of the things in the room.</p>

               <p>When I was taken to Guild-hall, I was ordered to come into the out parts to be examined; Newman says, pull off your coat, and let me take the shirt off your back; says Ramsay, I will swear to that shirt; I know my wife's plaits; she ironed it; the room was none of mine; it was my mother's room; I went there on Monday morning to put on a clean shirt; my mother was very bad in bed; I have people to call to my character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

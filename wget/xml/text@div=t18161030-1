            . I was taken up upon a charge of having forged notes in my possession, on the 17th of August. After that, I was employed by Mr. Westwood, the clerk to the Solicitor of the Bank of England, to detect the prisoners in selling forged notes. By his desire, I introduced a person to the prisoners. Before I introduced that person, I had dealings with the prisoners respecting forged bank notes several times. I obtained some from them at the price ten shillings and sixpence of the prisoner, and the old sixpence was allowed to them. I paid them ten shillings and sixpence for a one-pound to ged Bank of England note; I understood that they had the sixpence for themselves for their trouble. Between the time that I was apprehended and the time. I introduced a person by Mr. Westwood's desire, I dealt with them five times and get from the nineteen notes. I introduced Giffiths to them on the 29th of August, at the <placeName id="t18161030-1-crimeloc3">Crown and Cushion in London Wall</placeName>

Accordingly Griffiths, and I went to the Fountain, at twelve o'clock at noon; I believe Mr. Christmas followed us, and if I am not mistaken, one of the Mr. Foys, but I am not certain which, if either. We went there at twelve o'clock and stopped there until about three minutes after one; then we went away from there; neither of the prisoners were there when we went, nor did either of them come while we stopped. We then went to the Old Rum Puncheon, in the Minories, commonly called the Gully Hole, in Rose and Crown-court; it is generally called so, but I believe it was the Rum Puncheon. When we went there. neither of the prisoners were there; but we stopped a little while, and then they both came in. When they came in, we told them where we had been, and one of them, but I can't say which but both were present, said, there could be nothing, done until about eight o'clock at night. A little after seven, I, Griffiths, Andrew Savage, and

             went close to the church at Aldgate, and we staid near the watchhouse, and the prisoner Andrew Savage asked me how many I wanted, and I told him four; and I gave him a genuine one pound Bank of England note and one pound two in silver, which was the money that I received. Then I saw Griffiths deliver him his one pound note and his shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. To which - A. To Andrew. When Andrew received the money of us both, he said to Benjamin, then take them somewhere where you know, and he took us to the Coach and Horses in Northumberland-alley, Fenchurch-street. I can't say rightly how long we staid there, but I think it was an hour before Andrew returned, and when he returned he said, my darling boys, you are enjoying yourselves. Then he gave me my four notes, and I put them into my right hand waistcoat pocket. I then saw him give Griffiths two, but they were not separated, and there might be only one; there were two I believe. Griffiths put them into his left hand pantaloon pocket I believe. We stood there a little while together, and then we all four came out and another man with us. As soon as I got to the door, I gave my four notes to

Benjamin Savage there asked me how many I wanted; I told him two; I gave him a one pound Bank of England note and a shilling, which I had received from Mr. Westwood. Then I saw Charles give him three pounds three shillings in silver; three shilling pieces and eighteen penny pieces.

               <p>Q. Did you go to this other public-house - A. Yes; we went to the Rum Poncheon; we did not find them there, but they came in, in a short time; both came in. They said nothing could be done until eight o'clock that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear either of the prisoners say any thing about not waiting the night before - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you part that night - A. Yes; we went down to the Crown and Cushion first; that was at night, at about eight o'clock. We were with them there; we went thence to the Fountain.</p>
               <p>Q. What took place at the Fountain - A. When we went in, Andrew Savage was sitting there.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you went to the Fountain, had any money been given to Charles - A. Yes; I believe a one pound note, and one pound two shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any money been given to you - A. Yes; one pound one shilling, Mr. Christmas gave it to me. I am not certain whether he gave the money to Charles.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you and Charles go to - A. To the Fountain, at about half past seven in the evening; and saw Andrew Savage there, and Welch.

               <p>Q. Now you went there and saw Andrew Savage. Now what passed - A. A short time afterwards. Benjamin came in, and he said,</p>
               <p>"it was a pity we did not stop ten minutes longer, as Tom ran home last night, and came back with some." Benjamin then sat down by me; he asked me how many I wanted; I told him two; and then John Charles told me to give him my money; I gave him the one pound note and a shilling, which I had received from Mr. Christmas. I saw Charles give him his money; I believe three pounds. Then Benjamin went out, and he was gone about half an hour. and then came back. He sat down with me; he gave me two one pound forged bank notes, and I saw him give Charles his. He gave him six; I put the notes which I had got from him into my left hand pantaloon pocket; and I saw Charles put his into his right hand waistcoat pocket. In a few minutes we all came out together. Benjamin Savage told us, if we wanted any more on the Sunday, to meet him at the White Swan public-house, in Colman-street, at twelve o'clock. Then we drank together; we went into Aldgate together, and into a public-house opposite Aldgate Church; soon after we parted; we had half a pint of gin at that house, and then parted. Charles and I came away together. Charles gave me six forged one pound notes. He gave them to me about five minutes after we came out of the Fountain; he had not been out of my sight from the time he received them, until he gave them to me. He had not been out of my sight from the time he left the Bank of England, until those notes were first in his possession. He had been searched before he went away; he was searched by Mr. Foy, in my presence. The six notes I received from Charles, I put into my right hand pantaloon pocket, and went then to the Grave Maurice, and met Mr. Foy and Mr. Christmas there, and gave the six notes I received from Charles, and my own two, to Mr.

Charles and Griffiths came to our office, Charles was searched there, and was Griffiths so as to ascertain that he had no bank notes about him. He was supplied with money there to the amount of three pounds three shillings; I gave that money to Foy, who had previously marked it; he gave Charles three pounds three shillings, and Griffiths one pound one shilling I am not confounding two different periods. After they had got this, they went to the Fountain in the Minories followed by me and Thomas Foy. We kept at a distance to avoid being observe to be of the party. They both went in we remained in the street some time, we were there for about an hour or more, and they did not come. We returned to the office but did not see any thing of them; about ten o'clock I saw Griffiths; he delivered to me the notes which he had purchased; he marked them before I took them they are all foegeries. On the 2nd I was to watch were Charles and Griffiths went to. On the 31st, I followed them to the Fountain in the Minories at some distance behind; this was about half past seven in the evening; I waited there for about ten minutes; Andrew Savage then came out from the Fountain. He went across the Minories, and went to the Coach and Horses public house, in Northumberland-alley; I followed him; I waited under the archway for about ten minutes whilst he was in the public house; he came out accompanied by a man, a stranger to me; he came out, and went into Jury-street, and under the East India company wall, they were met by Benjamin Savage; they all three stopped together a few minutes, and then they went to the Bunch of Grapes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they appear to be doing before that A. They appeared to be exchanging something from one another; then they went all three to the Bunch of Grapes;

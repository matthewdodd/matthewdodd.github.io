                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler in Lower Thames-street. On 27th November the prisoner came to my house in the evening about 5 o'clock—he asked for half-a-quartern of spruce, and some hot water and sugar, which I gave him—they came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he laid down a half-crown—I</p>

               <p>had a doubt whether it was good, and I said to him, "What is this, a half-crown?"—he said, "Yes"—I put it up over the till and called my potman, and said, "Run and get me change for a sovereign"—I then said, "Never mind, I have some small money up-stairs"—I came outside my bar and backed the prisoner into the tap-room, and sent my man for an officer—the officer came, but before that I <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> the half-crown down on the counter, and it fell inside the bar—I remained against the tap-room door till the officer came—I got inside the bar and got the half-crown—I tried it in the officer's presence, in the detector—I am quite satisfied it was the one the prisoner gave me—the prisoner did not make any remark—while he was in the tap-room, he thrust his umbrella over the counter and pressed me very much to give him his umbrella—I said, "No, let that be, it will do no harm"—he asked me to give him the spruce and I gave it him, and while I did that I saw him stoop down by a bucket in the corner—I afterwards examined the place where the prisoner stooped when I came back from the station—I said, "I will lay anything that he has planted something against this coal bucket"—Bryant went into the tap-room and moved the bucket, and by the side we found these eight half-crowns—I took possession of them and took them to the station—they were in a piece of paper, one over the other.</p>

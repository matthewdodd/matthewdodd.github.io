On Friday, the 11th of February, I went out about half-past six o'clock, returned between twelve and one, and found my house broken open and this gun gone, which I had left over the mantel-piece; there were footmarks on the window - I found it the same day, nearly a mile from the house, covered over with sod, and a handkerchief tied round the lock to keep it dry; I do not know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>BRIDGET KENNY. My husband went out about a quarter to eight o'clock - I went out myself; I fastened the window, and left every thing secure - when I returned I found the window broken open, and the hasp opened - the gun was gone; the door was locked as I had left it.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL CASTER. I live at Edmonton. I saw three boys before Kenny's house, between eleven and twelve o'clock on the day of the robbery, about one hundred yards from the house; I cannot swear the prisoner was one- it is a good while ago; Bradford, who was taken, was one - the three boys were cutting a stick.</p>
               <p>JOHN CASTER. I live at Edmonton. I saw Bradford in company with two others on the day in question - one of the others had a gun; I cannot say whether the prisoner was one.</p>
               <p>Three other witnesses were called, but they knew nothing against the prisoner.</p>

            : On the 3d of March, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop with two others; one of the women came to the counter where I was, not the prisoner, and asked to look at a piece of cotton for a child's frock; I took down two pieces; the second piece they told me would do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean they - I thought you only said one person, not the prisoner? - A. One person said one of the pieces would do.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was not one of the two women? - A. I think she was not. When they said it would do, I cut off a yard and a half; they gave me a seven-shilling piece to pay for it, the yard and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110068"></xptr>a half came to two shillings and ninepence; I gave them four shillings and threepence change, and they went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say they all three came in together? - A. I am not certain; I saw the prisoner warm herself at the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe, as they all three went out of the shop, that at the same time, they all went the same direction from your shop? - A. I cannot say, I had more customers in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she, while these women were bargaining for this yard and a half, interfere in the matter? - A. She did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing after these people were gone? - A. No, not immediately; in the space of two minutes after, some person said the shop was robbed; a servant of mine ran out; I immediately left the shop, and went out myself; I turned to Piercy-street, which is two doors from my shop, and I saw the prisoner and another person running up Piercy-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pursue them? - A. I saw another person running after them; they were secured, and brought back to the shop. In the pursuit of them, I saw the prisoner drop one or more of the pieces of cotton; I did not stop to pick them up, but I pursued the prisoner; as soon as they were dropped, the servant stooped, and picked them up; I pursued the prisoner; they turned down a place at the top of Piercy-street, the first turning is Gresse-street; the prisoner turned down the left hand turning, and the person that was with her kept strait into Rathbone-street; I catched the prisoner in Gresse-street, and brought her directly back to the shop, and the servant followed me with these goods; they had been put upon a bale of goods for shew; I know them to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen them before? - A. Half an hour before these people came in, that was the extent.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other customers in the shop at the time while these women were in? - A. I had two or three, I cannot say exactly the number; I brought the prisoner back myself; an officer was following me back from Piercy-street, and he took charge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search her? - A. The officer did; nothing was found on her concerning me; she said she came on purpose to buy a gown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she herself make any purchase? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. While these people were talking, she was about the fire warming herself? - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these goods? - A. They were on a bale of goods about two yards from the fireplace, fronting the door-way; they were not on the counter at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Who were serving in the shop at that time? - A. Two lads, whom I have here; my partner went out in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of that that was dropped by her, and picked up by your servant? - A. I have not directly ascertained.</p>
               <p>Q. Put the lowest value you can? - A. Upwards of four pounds, upon the most moderate calculation; Mr. Kelly, the officer, has the pieces of cotton.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never dropped any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Are you quite sure you saw her drop the things in Piercy-street? - A. Yes, she acknowledged the same in Marlborough-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they speak together as if they were acquainted? - A. The woman with the child desired the prisoner to take her cloak, which is here, and the prisoner put it on the bale of goods, and this piece of print was on the bale of goods where the cloak was put.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner desire to look at any thing? - A. No, she was by the fire.</p>

               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) Did the prisoner leave the shop before the other? - A. No; she did not take the child; the child was troublesome.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an artifical flower maker, and live in Bri<lb></lb>tannia-street, City-road—on the 13th July the prisoner came with two other men, Jones brothers—he said he had brought two gentlemen who were going to commence business as artificial flower makers, and he was going to conduct their business for them—he said he had known them seven years, and they had kept a house, 7, President-street, Goswell-road, six years—they selected some goods—theprisoner was the person who told them what they wanted, Mr. Jones did not understand the business, and he did—the value of the goods I let them have was 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I sent them to the place—on the Thursday after the prisoner came and selected some of the goods, and asked me to give him something—he said he should expect something—I said, "When I have the money I will give you somethin"—I called on the following morning—I saw the landlady—I did not find the prisoner there—on the Saturday I called there again, and not finding them I went to a public-house in East-road—the prisoner was there, and directly he saw me he said,</p>

               <p>"Then I am off"—I said, "You are the man I want"—he said, "I was just I going to see Jones"—I gave him in custody.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far is Britannia-street from I President-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five or seven minutes' walk—I had some com<lb></lb>munication from my sister that induced me to go to 7, President-street—I had seen the prisoner before, but before I went to 7, President-street I had no conversation with him about this matter—I went to 7, President-street, and there I saw the prisoner and the two persons, Jones's brothers—it was there I had this conversation—it was on the next day that the prisoner came to my place and selected goods; that was on the 14th—the prisoner told me he was engaged to Jones's to manage the business for them—I spoke to the other persons as Mr. Jones, and they answered me as such—I went a second time to the house and took some of the goods—I did not make some inquiries at the house—Jones did not tell me that they were going to trade under the name of Jones Brothers, and that they had lived at 7, President-street, for six years, it was the prisoner, they did not say so—I was examined before the magistrate—this is my writing—it was read over to me before I signed it—I did not say, "The two men represented themselves as Jones' Brothers, and said they had lived at the house, 7, President-street, for six years—it was on the faith of the other two men saying that they had lived in the house for six years, and traded under the name of Jones Brothers that I trusted them, otherwise I would not have trusted them with the goods"—I said it was Mr. Pincomb made the representation; I only said it on the representation of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you enter these goods in a book as a sale to Jones Brothers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I made an invoice debiting them with the amount—I did not trust them with these goods on the representation that they made to me—it was what Pincomb said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When this paper was read to you did you tell the magistrate it was not correct, or did you sign it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said it was on Mr. Pincomb's representa<lb></lb>tion—I objected to it—I did not see this gentleman who is here; he was in the Court before, but he was not in the room when I signed the paper—I have only carried on business in England since Christmas—my own place is in Britannia-street—the Jones's came there two or three times with Pincomb—my sister was there when the Jones's and the prisoner were there—my sister takes a part in the business; she is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I have kept the house No.7, President-street, for seven years—I remember the prisoner and the Jones's coming to hire the front-room on the first-floor at my place—they had no furniture, the room, was furnished—they brought a bag there—they took it on 11th July and left on 19th—they paid no rent—I had half-a-crown deposit and nothing else—they left a bundle of straw behind, that was all—they had not lived there six years and carried on business as Jones Brothers.</p>

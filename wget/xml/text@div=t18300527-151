               for unlawfully having in his possession a mould, made of plaster of Paris, bearing the figure and resemblance of the obverse side of a lawful sixpence
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>The mould upon which this indictment was framed was the one alluded to in the last case, and which was found by the fender in the officers' search; the witnesses gave the same evidence as in the former case, except that Phillips, on his cross-examination, stated that the informer had been in custody for uttering counterfeit coin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About half-past four o'clock on Saturday afternoon the man, Skinner, came up and asked if I would let him do a job in my room; I said I did not care - he wore a jacket, with great pockets inside and out- he pulled out the charcoal in a small bag, and said,"Will you lend me a saucepan to burn this charcoal in?" I said I did not care - he asked if I would have some beer - he went out, came in with a pot with a handkerchief over it, and said, "I have not brought the beer, but something that will fetch you a good deal of money;" I said, "I will have nothing to do with it" - he said,"Well, I will go into the yard, and fetch them directly;" he had scarcely got down stairs before the Police-men came up - I was looking at them in my hand, and was so, confused on their entering, that I dropped them.</p>

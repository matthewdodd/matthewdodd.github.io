                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Broom, a farmer, at Hampton. On 27th March, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I put two of his horses under a shed in his meadow—one was a dark bay horse, with a long tail reaching near to the ground—it was three years old—it had a long mane, and it had a mark in the side where it had been rubbed with the shaft—the next morning, about 5 o'clock, I missed that horse—I went round the meadow, and could not find it—I went and told my master—I then went and tracked the horse along the lane up to the Swan Inn, at Hanworth, which is a distance of a mile and a half, or from that to two miles—I traced it along by the hedge in the grass in the lane, till I got opposite Mr. Sibley's—when I got to the end of the lane, I traced it along the high-road—the horse had been rough shod—the ground was hard on the gravel road—it was not hard from frost—there was not any snow—I saw the horse again on 5th April, in Mr. Western's stable, at the Duke of Clarence—it had been altered—his tail had been polled and his mane had been polled, and he was trimmed up about the head—his tail was shortened about one half—I did not notice anything else which had been done to it—I recognized the horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Sibley, a farmer, at Hampton. On 27th March, about half past 8 o'clock in the evening, I was going from Hampton to Sunbury with Henry Gostan—as I was going I saw William Lord on a horse—it was a dark coloured horse, with a long tail—he was coming down Hanworth village towards Sunbury, in a direction from Mr. Broom's—I noticed the horse's tail was tied in two knots—the horse wanted to go in the direction of Mr. Hatch's farm, and William Lord drew the halter, and drew the horse the other way, and one of the knots of his tail dropped loose—I distinctly noticed it was a very long tail—I saw it by moonlight—the prisoner Foster passed me about a quarter of a mile afterwards—he was coming in a direction from Hanworth, walking in the road leading to Sunbury-common.</p>

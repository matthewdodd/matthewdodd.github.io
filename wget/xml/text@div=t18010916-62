I was called upon to examine the number of sheets left in the ward, as is usual when any sister goes away; I missed seven pair; I then, according to the Treasurer's order, took the prisoner into custody; I went with her and the officer to the Compter; but, before that, I asked her what was become of the seven pair of sheets, and she said they were in her box.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you made her any promise that you would not prosecute her if she confessed where they were? - A. I told her I had orders to take her to the Compter if she did not tell me where they were; I could not get any satisfactory answer, and I took her to the Compter; the next morning I went to the Compter, and she said she had pawned them, and would give me the duplicates if I could get her dismissed from the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say that of herself, without your saying any thing to her? - A. Yes; she then gave me the duplicates; in consequence of which I went to Mr. Briggs, Smithfield-bars, and there I found four pair of sheets pawned in her own name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the Hospital mark upon them?- A. The mark had been rubbed over with pipeclay, but there was sufficient remaining for me to see it; I then went to Mr. Watson's, in Watling-street, according to duplicates that she gave me; I saw two pair of sheets there pawned in the name of Hill; she was then committed.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOTILLER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am servant to Mr. Briggs, pawnbroker, Smithfield-bars. I remember the prisoner coming to our shop, and pledging the sheets that Mr. Payter claimed; the mark had been rubbed over with pipe-clay, or something white, so that when I held them up, I did not see it, or I should not have taken them in. (Seven sheets produced, and identified by Mr. Payter.)</p>
               <p>ELEANOR HILL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I have known the prisoner many years; I pledged two sheets for her at Mr. Watson's; she told me they were her own; I never saw them unfolded.</p>
               <p>- WATSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you remember taking in any sheets from the last witness? - A. I have no recollection of it; I don't know that I took them in; I delivered to Mr. Payter the sheets that he claimed.</p>
               <p>Hill. There were a pair of sheets that I had redeemed at Mr. Watson's, and had not returned to the prisoner, which I delivered to Mr. Payter.(Payter produced them.)</p>
               <p>Hill. These are the same that I received from Mrs. Davis; I particularly remarked the letter H at the corner.</p>
               <p>Payter. These sheets belong to the Hospital.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been in great distress before I got into the Hospital; I had been obliged to make away with a great deal of my wearing apparel; I made a very bad appearance; I thought these sheets would not be wanted, and I pledged them for the purpose of getting some of my clothes out to appear in. <rs id="t18010916-62-verdict327" type="verdictDescription">

I am a carpenter, and live in Cooper's-gardens - Thomas was my servant; I bought the truck of the prisoner on Friday, the 23d of November, for 2l. 5s.; I stopped 5s. till it was repaired, as it wanted blocks under the springs; he did that himself, and I paid him; I knew him before, as he lives in one of Mr. Miller's houses, and is a wheelwright.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know William Matthews? A. No - unless it is a person who used to live with the prisoner: he said he got the truck from Matthews; I gave a fair price for it - it was not fresh painted - I went myself to find Matthews, but could not find him.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On the 22d of November I was in Love-lane, and about four doors from the prosecutor's house I saw a person about about the prisoner's size, and similar to him in dress,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060093"></xptr>drawing the truck out of Fisher's yard - I thought something might he wrong; I called and told Fisher of it - I did not stop the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There is nothing extraordinary in the prisoner's appearance? A. No; it was half-past seven o'clock in the evening, and dark - I do not know Matthews.</p>
               <p>GEORGE TWEEDY. The man I have seen with the prisoner is about his size - I think not quite so tall.</p>
               <p>JOHN FISHER. This truck cost me 7l., and I had two props put to it, which cost me 8s.; I had had it about four months, and had 6l. 10s. offered for it within a month before - I gave it to Franks, the beadle of Fore-street, when I found it - and next day we went to Worship-street, where we found the prisoner, and the person who bought the truck, and they agreed to make it up; but, by a woman not making up the money, they took the prisoner into custody again, and sent to me for the truck - the officer came first.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON to GEORGE TWEEDY. Q. What are you? A. I am Mr. Miller's bailiff; I would not give more than 2l. 5s. for the truck - it was a large one - I did not inquire how he got it - he was a wheel wright.</p>

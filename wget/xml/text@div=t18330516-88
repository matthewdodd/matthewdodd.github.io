            . I am the daughter of the last witness. In February last I received two 5l. notes from my father while I was visiting at Mr. Britten's - I put the notes into my glove, and when I got home, I missed them - I had left my glove on my dressing-table in the bed-room; I had gone out early in the morning and returned in the evening; it was about the 16th of February - I should not know the notes again; I did not mark them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.Where did you receive the notes from your father? A. In Spode and Copeland's shop - I don't remember whether I saw them after I got into the house; I was in one or two hackney-coaches before I got home, and cannot say whether I lost them before I got home - I put them into my glove at Spode and Copeland's, and did not take my glove off after that till I got home - it was a short glove; I put the notes inside it - when I took the glove off, I left it on the dressingtable; I don't remember anything further about it - I am sure I did not take my glove off at all while I was out.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the 1st of May, I was called into the house of Mr. Britten; I saw the prisoner; she was suspected of having taken two 5l. notes - she said she would go up stairs with me to search her box; I went up with her - she unlocked the box, and immediately thrust her hand into it; I put my hand in also, and took from her hand this black bag, with the two 5l. notes in it - I asked her who the notes belonged to, she said they were her own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She did not object to go up to have her box searched? A. No, she unlocked it herself.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.When she put her hand into the box, had she anything in her hand? No, she thrust her hand into the bottom of the box; I put my hand in, and found her hand in the bag; I took out of it the two notes.</p>

               <p>Corneck. There was nobody there at night. I saw the prisoner at the bar there in the morning, and the buckles were found on him; the woman that stands here handed the buckles to my wife under the table, and she to me.</p>

               <p>Corneck. I am his wife; I was with him at this lodging house; about four in the morning, on the 10th of August, we had a pint of beer, and he missed his buckles cut of his shoes; he got up and searched all about beside the curtains of the other bed; I saw the prisoner get up; and go down with his coat in his hand; we went to Mr. Heans's, where he was quartered, but he was not there; I went down, and saw the soldier doing something to the knees of his breeches. I said, John, I believe here is the man. Mr. Evans said he was an officer, so we gave charge of him; he said he had as lief be transported: he could live as well abroad as here. The girl said, if you have the buckles, give them to the prosecutor, that there may be no more of it; he pulled them out from under his breeches knees, wrapped up in a piece of news paper. All that he had to say, was, that he was in liquor.</p>

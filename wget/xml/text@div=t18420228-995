                  </hi>. I live in Dalston-road, and am a linendraper—I have one partner. The prisoner was our shopman—I got one of my servants to watch him, and, on the 1st of February, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I got an intimation that he had something belonging to me—there were some customers in the shop—when they were gone, I said to the prisoner, "I will thank you to let me see what you have in your pocket," and to my surprise, instead of taking out money, he took out this pair of stockings—he said, "Sir, I took them as a sample, think<lb></lb>ing no harm"—we then got the officer, who found the remnants of calico and a pair of mitts on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother, and am a banker's clerk, at Cambridge. My brother was in business on his own account at Dudley, about two years ago, but was unfortunate—he has since then been in service—he did not continue in business more than twelve months—his friends interfered, and compromised hit matters—he has never been capable of conducting his affairs with discretion since he was afflicted in his mind, which was just after his father's decease in 1822—his affliction continued some months—he has been with two private physicians, and in one asylum at Bedford, where two men were obliged to sit up with him day and night—I did not see him at that time, but I have seen him when he has been under the malady—he was quite insane, quite raving, when he was at the physician's, so much so, that they were unable to keep him, as the physician's wife was unable to hear the noise he made by getting out of bed continually, and raving—he has not been in confinement since he left the asylum—a short time ago I sent him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he applied the greater part of it in buying birds.</p>

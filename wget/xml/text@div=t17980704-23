               <p>- YOUNG sworn. - Mr. Taylor and I were returning home to Enfield, and observed the prisoner getting over a hedge; I rode up to him, and asked him what he was breaking the fences for; he said he wanted to sleep; I asked him what he had got in his pocket; Mr. Taylor said it was a ham; we jumped off our horses, and took him by the collar; he then got out of the coat, it was a very large great goat, and he and Mr. Taylor had a struggle; we took him just by the George; a constable came up, and we delivered him to the constable.

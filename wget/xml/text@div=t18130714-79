               <p>Q. Did you lose a coat in June last - A. On the 17th of June between eleven and twelve in the forenoon, I sent the coat with a little girl of eight years of age to take to a customer, No. 12, Mount-street, Barkley-square, and after my child was stopped by a woman. I was sent for to go to a public-house in Grovesnor-mews; from there I went to Marlborough-street office; I there saw my coat, and the prisoner in custody. I am quite sure it was the same coat that I had sent out by my daughter; the coat was worth three pounds sixteen shillings to me.</p>

            . On Friday, the 17th of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was carrying the coat to Mount-street, the prisoner spoke to me and asked me if I was in an hurry; I told her yes. The coat was done up in that handkerchief. She asked me to carry her bundle, done up in a towel round the corner to a butcher's shop in Grovesnor-street; I took the bundle of her: I was to tell them that Mrs. Johnson would call to-morrow. She asked me then for my bundle; I told her I could not spare it. She said upon her word and honor, she would not go away; I gave her the bundle; I turned round and saw the prisoner running away: I hallooed out. I could not overtake her; I told Mr. Watkins what had happened; Mr. Watkins pursued her. I stopped at the corner of Mount-street; he sent a boy for me; I went to the public-house, and saw the very same woman that run away with my coat. I told Mr. Watkins that was the same woman that run away with my coat; my father afterwards came and claimed the coat.</p>

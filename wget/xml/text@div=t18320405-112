            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I had locked the parlour door about half-past one o'clock the night before, and put the key on the mantel-piece in my bed room; a man and woman occupy my first floor - I heard the man unbolt the door, and go out to work about twenty minutes past six; they still lodge with me -I missed a brass fender, a baize, a set of fire-irons, and a painting; the lock did not appear to be injured - the key was still in my bed-room - I went to Limehouse about ten o'clock, and on my return met the prisoner in Thomas-street, three or four hundred yards from my house, with the fender sewed up in the baize, under her arm; I knew the baize - I went and took hold of her, and asked her to let me look at the fender which was tacked in the baize; I unpinned it, and knew the fender - she said she had found them, she did not know where - I said I had been robbed that morning; she said if so, I must have lost something else - I said I had lost some fire-irons, and a picture, and would not let go of her till I got assistance; she put the fender down at my feet, and said there was my fender, and I had nothing to do with her - I called my female lodger, who was with me, to hold the fender; the prisoner struggled very much to get from me; I held her till the constable took her.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I took the prisoner with the fender and baize; she said her son had bought the fender on purpose for her to look at, as she was going to be married, and she was taking it back to her son's, No. 2, Johnson's-court, Commercial-road - that she lived at No. 40, Church-street; I found a young woman there, who at first denied knowing her - I found a key on the mantelpiece, which opened the prosecutor's parlour door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My son brought the fender that morning for my daughter to look at, to see if she would purchase it; I should not have carried it with the green cloth on it if I had stolen it.</p>

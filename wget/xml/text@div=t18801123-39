                  </hi>. I am a sailor staying at the sailors' Home, Whitechapel—I was an able-bodied seaman on board the peru, a Dundee ship from hongkong to London, sailing under the British flag—the prisoner was cook and steward—I had a quarrel with him a few days before 29th september, and threw some scandling tea in his face, and then threw the cup at him and cut his face—on 29th September, about 8. 10 a. m. I went to the gallery door and gave the prisoner my pot for some coffee—as he was giving me the office—I saw a revolves in his right</p>

               <p>hand behind his back—I said "I will go and ask the captain. if you are allowed to carry a revolver"—he made no answer—I went to the captain, who told me to go the mate—I went to the mate and he and the second mate went to the galley—I followed, and when mate asked the prisoner where the revolver was, he had a knife in his hand which he showed and said "This is what I had in my hand."—I called him a liar, he drew a revolve, pointed it at the mate's face, and fired, but it snapped—I ran away and then heard the report of a revolver, and the ball grazed my back—I ran to the valley and tried to lay hold of him—he drew another revolver and fired again from the one which he first had and shot me in my neck—he had a revolver in each hand and was two or three feet from me—I said "You cowardly son of a bitch, you have shot me"—I put my finger into the hole in my neck—I went forward and was taking off my shirt to see what kind of a wound it was, when he came out of the gallery door with a revolver in each hand—I then heard another report oil the poop and all hands were called aft to lake the revolvers from him—I went aft and ran him down the lazarette with a revolver in each hand—when he saw me he said "I won't give them up while that man is there"—I went to the cabin and as I was standing there he saw to me, "I am sorry for it, my son, but t can't help it." I heard him tell the captain that there was a plot on the ship to take his life—the captain and the mate cut the bullet out of my wound.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross examined.</hi> I never heard him say that the mate had fired at him—as far as I know there Was no plot against him—I had not been talk<lb></lb>ing to any sailors about rushing on him with a razor—I never heard of poison being put in his food or into the tinned salmon—I do not know of his taking some of the food and trying it on some of the fowls or on a pig—there was a pig on board—he used to talk to it when giving it its food, and it followed him about the deck, and came when he called it—it generally got the name of Murphy—it had a cold several times posing the voyage—I have seen the prisoner take his food out of the cabin into the galley—the first time he fired at the mate's head, not at me—I never knew that he wore armour till the police took it off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am mate of the Peru—on 29th September Ogilvy came to me, and I went and said to the prisoner "cook, where is that revolver?"—I have heard Ogilvy's evidence—it is quite correct—after he was shot in the throat, I went to the prisoner in the lazarette and said "I want those revolvers"—he refused to give them up, and said that there was a plot on the ship to kill him—I said "I will warrant there shall be no violence used on you if you give the revolvers up"—he said that it would be a very risky business for them whoever had to take the revolvers away—I told him I Should have to try and take them from. him, but would use persuasion before violence, and he gave them up—they were both loaded—he was then secured—the captain was lying ill on the deck at the time, and he died on the voyage home—Moncrieff brought me these two bullets—I made an entry in the log on the same day, and after tile captain died read it over to the prisoner—he asked me to hash it up and he would pay me for it—I said "It is impossible because it is down in the log book"—he said "You can easily throw the log book over into the sea"—I saw Ogilvy's wound; the bullet had gone entirely through, and the other mate and I cut it out—he bled a great</p>

He washed me in my blood a few days before this"—I searched him at the station, and found under his shirt, next to his flesh, the fore part of his body covered with tin, forming a kind of tin breast<lb></lb>plate—it was made of biscuit-tins—I asked him the reason for that—he said that he did not know what might happen among such a lot—I touched him behind and asked him why he had not thought of the back part—he said that it did not matter about that—I received two revolvers from the mate; four chambers of one and one chamber of the other were loaded.</p>

Gaol of New<lb></lb>gate—the prisoner has been confined there since November 11th—I have seen him daily, and examined him—he is suffering from very strong delusions, and has a very firm belief in them—I have discussed with him the idea that there was a plot on the ship to destroy his life, and he is under the belief that lie has been fired at—he told me that he had taken a tin box containing some papers relating to some pro<lb></lb>perty in Carolina, and had covered it with carpet to protect him, and had thrown the papers overboard to that the crew should not get them, and flattened the box and placed it on his abdomen to protect him—he likewise stated that there was an attempt to poison him, for one day when he took something into the cabin he saw something glitter, but he was too wideawake to take it—he also said that the fowls and the pigs had poison given to them—he said that he heard the men come and whisper, and they peeped into the galley where he was, and he put out the lights so that they should not see—he also said that he was quite sure he had been fired at some days before he fired—he implicitly believes</p>

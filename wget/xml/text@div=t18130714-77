               <p>Q. When was it that you missed any thing from your house - A. On the 25th of June, in the evening. I had been out to work, and when I came home I missed the things.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose they might be taken at different times - A. They were, by the duplicates. When I came home on the 26th I missed a shift, and a dirty gown from the clothes-bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss a pair of silver sugar-tongs - A. Yes, they are worth fourteen shillings, and a coat of my husband's, a shirt, two shifts, two bed-curtains, a pair of stockings, and a bible; I am quite sure that they were in my house at the time the lodgings was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the child a father - A. The father was at sea.</p>

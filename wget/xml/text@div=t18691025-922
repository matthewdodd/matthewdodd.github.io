                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman D</hi> 157). On the night of Saturday, the 26th of September, about 12.30, I was in East Street, Manchester Square, when I heard cries of "Murder!" and "Police!" and in consequence went to the corner of York Court, in East Street—I then saw the prisoner and another man fighting, and several women trying to separate them—I requested them to go away, but they did not—another constable came up, and then they walked a distance of about thirty yards and commenced fighting again—I went to separate them, when the prisoner said he would stab me to the</p>

I was on duty with the last witness, in East Street, when I saw him go to the prisoner and persuade him to be quiet—after a few minutes the prisoner went about thirty yards, and began fighting again, under a lamp-post—the prosecutor called to him again, and tried once more to persuade him to go away peaceably—then the prisoner said that if he came any further he would stab him to the b—heart—I saw him heave up his hand with a knife in it, and attempt to stab the officer—he struck at him towards his left breast—I saw the blade of the knife—the blow was aimed at the officer—the prisoner was drunk and dis<lb></lb>orderly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had a drop of beer—there was a couple of chaps and a young woman in the house; they got up a quarrel with her, and I would not have it—one of the young fellows went out and pulled her about—she then asked me to see her home—in the court I met two policemen, when one of them said, "Jack, get back, this is not your way"—I had my sleeves tucked up—I went back to the house and fell asleep in a chair—about half-an-hour afterwards two policemen came, and one said, "This is the fellow"—they pulled me out of the room into the passage, and said it was for another time they wanted me—when going down by Manchester Square I asked them what they were going to charge me with, and then they kicked me in the spine of the back—I never gave them a wrong word—they are mistaken as to the man.</p>

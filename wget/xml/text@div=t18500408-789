On 21st March, a buttock edge-bone of beef was shown me by Webb—I knew it instantly, because I had had a piece of steak cut off it that morning for my breakfast—I had never given Briers leave to take meat out of the shop—no one has any right to sell meat but my father and myself.</p>

On the morning of 21st March, Briers asked me whether I would have half a pint of porter, and directed me to go to the Old Coffee Pot, where he would come to me—as I was going, he overtook me in the lane, and went in before me with a buttock and an edge-bone of beef under his arm—he went straight through the bar and through a door which I believe leads up-stairs.</p>

On 21st March, from information, I watched the Old Coffee Pot, Newgate-market—about two o'clock, or a quarter past, I went in and stood in front of the bar some time—I then went up-stairs and saw some beef—I showed that piece to Mr. Venables the same day—I came down-stairs again, and remained in front of the bar—about twenty minutes past two, Briers came in by himself, had a pennyworth of gin, and remained talking in front of the bar till Bedford came in—they then whispered together—Bedford went up-stairs and brought down the piece of beef in a cloth on his shoulder, and went out of the door in White Hart-street, turned into Warwick-lane, through the Bell passage, which leads into Warwick-lane, to a shop there, and threw the beef off his shoulder on to a block, by the side of another pieee of beef—I then went into the shop, and asked him what he had got—he said beef—I asked where he got it—he said</p>

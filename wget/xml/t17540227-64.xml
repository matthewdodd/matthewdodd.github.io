My box stood in the room where I lie, with the things in it mentioned in the indictment, all but the half crown which was in my pocket. I was waked by my fellow servant, who was in bed with me. I heard a noise in the room; there was a man, I asked what he wanted, and he went grumbling out, but about half an hour after I saw him, or another person, come creeping in upon his hands and knees. I screamed out Murder, and the people of the house rising, the prisoner was taken in the stable under the straw, and my box was found opened in the warehouse below stairs; my things were bundled up in a handkerchief near where he was taken. The guinea we never could find.</p>

He confirmed the account of the taking the prisoner and finding the bundle lying by him with this addition, that the prisoner must have come into the yard, and secreted himself over night, and was locked in, so that he had no other way to get out, but by taking the opportunity after the servants were got up, and had unlocked the gate, &amp;c.</p>

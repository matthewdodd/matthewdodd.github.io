            . I know the cords; the curriers do not usualy send such cords as this about leather; I know the knot, it has a burnt place in it.</p>
               <p>Q. To Owen. Do you believe these skins to be your's? - Yes, by the bulk and appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever examined the quallity since they were taken from that man? - I have not; there is no mark on them, only by the journeyman that dressed them.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL PITTER sworn.</p>
               <p>I stand as a porter in Fleet Market; this tall man applied to me first to do this business, to obtain this leather under the false pretence.</p>
               <p>Owen. I packed up the things myself; I am certain they are the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones. On Wednesday morning, I went to work till dinner time, when my master sent me of a message; going along I met an acquaintance, with whom I had a pint of beer; when I came out, and coming along I met Doyle, and he asked me to carry a load for him; he said it did not weigh above a hundred and a half; I was to carry it from Snowhill, to Long-lane, Smithfield, and then I was to have a coach. When we came to the Cock, says he, Mrs. Reynolds and me are at variance, and I don't like to go in for it; so with that I went in and had a pint of beer; and came out again, and he comes to me; and says, your load is ready, go in and ask for it, and I will shew you where to carry it; I did not tell Mrs. Reynolds that Mrs. Pendegrast sent me; I told her I came for the leather; so a porter put it on my head; going out at the door, she asked me if my porter was paid for? I said, yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Doyle. This is propense malice against me, and I will tell you how it is. Pendegrast is one that was tried here for selling bad money this week, and I had told Mrs. Reynolds that this head man of the coiners, came there to sell the money, and I said, I would take him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170144"></xptr>out, and so? was judged in having a hand in having this Pendegrast taken. This day a man comes up to me, in my own room, and I was finishing a shoe for a customer of mine, and asked me to do some business for him; and I said, I will be down with you in about ten or fifteen minutes; and I goes down to Mrs. Reynolds's house, to meet him, and I did not see the man that came for me there, nor any body else; this man he comes in, and another man, and they had a pint of beer, and they stopped together and drank; this man speaks to Mrs. Reynolds, and he moves the leather from the inner part of the house, into the outer, towards the street; and Mrs. Reynolds delivered it to this man. I have another reason to mention, for the words I uttered to Mrs. Reynolds, I says, you know Mr. Pendegrast better than I do, and I suppose he would not send a wrong porter to you. Jones before had told me that he was the porter.</p>
               <p>The two prisoners each called two witnesses to their characters.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What is the value of this leather? - Twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Doyle. This gentleman that left the leather came and told me that if I was to pay the attorney his costs, that he would put a slaw in the bill; and wanted to extort money from me to make it up.</p>

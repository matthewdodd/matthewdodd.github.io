                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RYLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If blood had flowed from Brugger's head, must you have seen it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should—I do not say there was no blood—I saw the last hit his head, and he put up his hand—there was no blood till after he took his hand away—there was considerable blood then, and he turned to go down stairs—I did not follow him down, and do not know what blood there was—there was a stream of blood on the stairs, as far as I saw, but I never went from my door—the stream of blood came from Brugger, but I cannot say what part of his head—he was standing by the banis<lb></lb>ters when the last was thrown at him—it must have hit him in front—I saw no blood before the last was thrown—if there had been any, I think I must have seen it—I think I can swear there was none till then—I saw Mrs. Keene dragged down stairs, and did not interfere to protect her, or call murder or police—I stood quietly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When Rock held her, by her hair, had she hold of him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say positively that she had hold of him—she was behind him—whether she had hold of him I cannot say—I cannot say whether she was using her hands—it was too sudden.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi> In my judgment, a last befog thrown could have caused the blows I saw as well as a hammer or poker, but one blow could not cause all the wounds—the hammer is more likely to produce the laceration than the poker—I did not closely examine, as I did not see him afterwards—the sharp edge of the last would produce such a wound—he is convalescent now—it is impossible to say whether the last or hammer caused this wound</p>

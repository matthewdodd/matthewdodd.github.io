                  </hi>. I am a smith at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich—between 12 and 1 o'clock on Tuesday morning, I was at Mr. George's oyster shop—the prisoner, whom I had never seen before to my knowledge, came in and after annoying the customers he was turned out by the man who minds the shop—after ten minutes he came back, rushed and struck at me—I pre<lb></lb>vented him and went outside the shop—he followed and struck me again, and I struck him, and then he stabbed me—I went into the shop and found I was stabbed in three places; the blood was running down on my waist<lb></lb>coat, which was cut in three places in front—I did not strike him until he had repeatedly struck me—I did then in self-defence—my hand is still very bad—I was obliged to have surgical assistance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Blake, a labourer at Woolwich Arsenal—I was in Beresford-street on this Tuesday morning, between 12 and 1 o'clock, and went into the oyster shop, where I saw the prosecutor and prisoner—the prisoner came in—he was very noisy and insulted every one, and they turned him out—he returned in about ten minutes, went to the further end of the room, <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> against the prosecutor, and wanted him to fight—they went outside, and the prisoner struck the prosecutor first—he retuned the blow, and the prisoner struck him three times with something which glittered in his hand—the prosecutor bled very much afterwards from the hand, neck, and face—I went with the last witness to Dr. Coleman's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Woolwich—on Tuesday morning last, between 12 and 1 o'clock the prosecutor was brought to my surgery, suffering from three clean incised wounds, one on the back of the head and neck, one on the face, and another through the fleshy part of his hand; he was bleeding very freely indeed—they must have been inflicted with some very sharp instrument—a knife I should think would have caused them—the wound at the back of the neck was about four inches long</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186206160097"></xptr>
               <p>very clean cut but not deep—the one through the hand was entirely through the fleshy part, it was not dangerous—the wound in the neck would have been dangerous if it had been deeper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> If he fell on a piece of glass would he not have got that cut in his hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not think so—it would have been lacerated, and not so clean cut.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could the wound in the neck have been caused by falling upon anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, decidedly not—the wound in the face was not at all dangerous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The man fought with me fairly. I had two witnesses who were there to prove that I never had such a thing as a knife, and that the complainant struck me first and knocked me down. When the policeman came I was bleeding through the nose and mouth. It is impossible that I could have struck the prosecutor in the back of the neck without his being aware of it. He was sober and I drunk.</p>

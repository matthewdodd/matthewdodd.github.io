            . I am a surgeon and live in Whitechapel. On the 17th of May I examined the body of the deceased and opened it - his death was caused by an effusion of blood on the brain, and among the membranes; the concussion of a fall in a fight was very likely to occasion that - there was a great many contusions on his neck, breast and shoulders, but they were not sufficient of themselves to cause death.</p>

            . I saw part of this fight; I did not see the last round - after it was over, the deceased was given to me and Godfrey, to take care of; I had seen them fall - they got up and fought again, voluntarily; neither of them endeavoured to avoid fighting - they fell a great many times; there was no unfair play at all - they were both young, and appeared fairly matched; I do not know how it began.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, expressing his regret at the result of the combat, which had occured through a dispute respecting an old public-house score; that the deceased had insisted on his fighting, much against his own inclination, but that he at last agreed to meet him, having been repeatedly called a coward. - He received a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cigar manufacturer, of 5, Wellclose Square—the prisoners are my apprentices—on the 23rd November I found my wine cellar broken open—it runs along the back kitchen, and the lower part is the side of the coal cellar—the part broken open was in the back kitchen, by the side of the coal cellar, and about three yards from the door—parties going through the kitchen would go to the aperture that was made—the boarding was knocked down—I think I saw that boarding the night before—I won't be certain—there were a lot of oases up against it—I missed a great deal of wine and brandy—I might have lost twelve or fourteen dozen of wine, perhaps more, worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a bottle—some broken bottles were lying in the coal cellar—from information I received I sent for a policeman, and gave four boys into custody—the two prisoners were locked up.</p>

I am apprenticed to the last witness—I know Nathan Delew—on the 23rd November I saw him in the Tenter Ground, Spitalfields, about three or four minutes' walk from my master's place—he said "When I get you to the shop I will give you something nice"—when I got to the shop I had a chopper given me to take down to the servant—I went down to the coal cellar, and he said "Jacob, drink"—he had half a bottle in his hand—I took a little drain in my mouth, and I spat it out—Moses Delew was there alto—he was drinking.</p>

I am a fellow apprentice of the prisoner's—on Thursday morning, the 23rd, I saw the prisoners go down to the kitchen—I called out to Nathan Delew, and he made no answer—I called again—he said "What is it you want?—I said "Where are you?"—he said "I am in the cellar"—after I had been there about five minutes he brought out a bottle, and said "Drink"—I said "I don't believe it is drink"—he said "If you don't drink first, I will"—I gave him the bottle, and went up stain—it was black, and like a wine bottle—I did not drink any, but I saw both of the prisoners drink.</p>

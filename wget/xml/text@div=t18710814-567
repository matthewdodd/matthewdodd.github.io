                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, carrying on business at the Crown, at Cricklewood, near Hendon—before that, in 1869, I lived in the Brixton Road; I was then a traveller for wine houses—shortly before that I had been in business as a wine merchant—I failed in 1869, and after that I travelled for Messrs. Toft and others—after I got into difficulties I applied to a person named Page, of Bayswater Road, for some money—he had a loan office there—I borrowed 112<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him; I gave him a bill of sale for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I continued to pay him interest on that for some time, at the rate of about 300 per cent., I should think; it was so much for every twenty-one days—first of all it was 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., then 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then I think it came up to 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in consequence of that being so high I ulti<lb></lb>mately went to Bolton, and applied to him for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay off Page's bill of sale—I told him the interest I was paying—I could have raised the rest from my friends; he agreed to that—I then gave him this bill of sale (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—it is dated 19th July, 1870, and professes to be for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it recites 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then due, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. then paid—I did not owe Bolton anything at all at that time—before my bankruptcy I had had transactions with Bolton—at the time of my bankruptcy he held property belonging to me to the value of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was scheduled—it was a cart and phaeton, a bracelet and diamond ring—he had those actually in his possession—I owed him about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the goods were worth 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the time I applied to him for the money to pay off Page's bill of sale he said nothing about any previous money owing—nothing had been borrowed since my bankruptcy—the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. did not pass—I did not then, or at any time after my bankruptcy, receive a single farthing from him—this promissory note for 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given at the same time as the bill of sale—that is made out to Cooper—it was for the same transaction—I did not get any money from Cooper—Bolton told me Cooper was to advance the money—I never got a farthing from any of them—my goods were taken possession of under Page's bill of sale—my house was stripped; I did not see the goods afterwards—I was taken into custody for removing a horse and cart as being included in the bill of sale—Page was not present at the Police Court at first when I was charged; he came afterwards, and gave evidence—I saw Bolton at the Sessions, he was in the Court, and could hear what took place—I was tried and acquitted—Bolton heard that—I did not read this bill of sale—Bolton said it was to be for 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard nothing more about it for six or eight months—during that time I got through my difficulties, and took the Crown, at Cricklewood—I had got it well furnished, and was carrying on a good business there—about the middle of May last, Bolton came down there, and asked me to pay his bill of sale—he did not produce it—I asked him for it, and told him I did not owe him a shilling—he said if I did not pay him he would strip the house, and expose me to my brewers, and every tradesman, and go to the brewery, and state that I had stolen a horse and trap, and was given into custody for it—I was very busy at the time, and expected my brewers every minute, and so, through intimidation, I foolishly gave him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and agreed to pay him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a fortnight—he then left—my wife was very unwell at that time—he came down again about a month afterwards, on Whit Monday, with Cooper—Cooper had a place, at 8, Morton Street, Pimlico, the same place as Bolton—Bolton had a plate with</p>

               <p>"Money Advanced" on it—I suppose he would call himself a broker—there were a few old things in the shop; Cooper had his name up there, an office, with auction bills hanging up inside the same place—Tanner came down to my place, one evening, demanding 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had seen him before that, one evening, at a public-house in Westminster, twelve or eighteen months ago; he was with Bolton—Bolton introduced him to me as Sergeant Tanner, who, he said, went abroad, and brought the notorious Muller over to this country—I never saw Tanner at Bolton's place, except when the goods were taken away from there—when Bolton came with Cooper, he again applied to me for money—he did not ask for any amount—I told him I should not give him another shilling—he asked me if I had got any money for him—I said "No, but I have got two policemen on the premises, and if you don't go off I shall give you into custody"—that was the fact—I had been cautioned by some of my friends—I then walked down the garden with Bolton, and one of my policemen followed me down—Bolton saw a friend of mine who he knew very well—he spoke to him, and then Bolton went away with Cooper—Cooper did not say anything, or take any part in the conversation—Tanner came down one evening after Bolton's first appearance, and before Whit Monday—he brought an order from Bolton for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "The bearer is instructed to apply to you for 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., being the amount settled as due on 19th July, 1870, and to request you to name an early day for the settlement of such claim.")—I told Tanner that I did not owe Bolton any money, and that I should not give him any—I began to enter into Page's affair—I said the bill of sale was given to pay Page off, and I never received a shilling for it—Tanner then stopped me, and said "Oh, I know all about that; do you intend to part or not?" and he said "I am Sergeant Tanner"—I then ordered him out of my house, and he went—on 18th July, I went away from home—my house and furniture was all right when I left—I got back about 3 o'clock, and found the rooms had been stripped, 'the drawing-rooms were, and things were taken out of the bar, spirits, and spirit casks, and cut decanters, and cigars, my wife's and children's underclothing and jewellery—I directly went to my solicitor, and then to Bow Street, for a policeman—they told me to go to West-minster—I ultimately went to Bolton's place with a policeman, and found a van there, being unloaded; it contained nay furniture—a second van came up afterwards to the same place, with my things in it—I did not see Bolton at his house, I saw him a few streets off—I had a policeman with me, and directly he saw us he walked away very fast—the policeman went after him, and I gave him into custody—I ultimately got back some of my goods, all but about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—the value of the whole that was taken was between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—among the things missing is a lady's gold chain, a pair of ear-drops, two gold rings, and some trinkets belonging to my wife—there were seventeen bottles of spirits, and 2lbs. weight of cigars—I also lost a razor case containing two razors; and the clothing—when I was taking away my goods from Bolton's, Tanner came up—he did not say anything to me, or in my presence—these are my razors (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) that I lost; this is the top of the case—this silver belonging to a dressing-case is mine—a writ was served upon me with reference to a claim on the 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I instructed an attorney to appear for me, but nothing further was done in it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer B</hi>). On Tuesday evening, 18th July, I was in a public-house, at Westminster, and there saw Tanner—he had some papers with him—this copy of a bill of sale was one of them—he took, some cigars out of his pocket, and pressed me to have one—he was offering them to anyone in the bar—he said they were cheap, that they came from a job that he had been doing that afternoon—I was present at Bolton's house the next day, after Bolton had been taken into custody—I saw Tanner there, just as we got the things loaded, under a Magistrate's order, to take them back to Mr. Chambers—Tanner said, if he had been there before, he would have broken all our heads, rather than we should have taken them away, and he took up a poker from the fire-place—I took him into custody next morning—I told him it was for being concerned with Bolton in taking the furniture away from the Crown, at Cricklewood, and also on suspicion of taking a pair of earrings—he said he was present when the things were removed—I know both the prisoners; I have frequently seen them together as companions.</p>

I was an assistant at the Crown, at Cricklewood—on 18th July I was present when the men came in—I. saw Tanner remove some of the goods—I can't say whether he went into my bedroom—some earrings, and other things of mine, were taken from my bedroom—I can't say who took them—some things were also taken from Mrs. Chambers' bedroom, and from all the rooms—some of her wearing apparel, and some of the children's.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R R</hi> 25). On 18th July, I apprehended Bolton—I told him the charge, about taking this furniture—he said "All right, I did take some goods from there that day"—I found on him a bill of sale, two watches, one gold, and one silver, a gold chain, and this silver-plated lid, in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Charles Button, of 146, Holborn<lb></lb>bars. On 27th Feb. I followed Bacon to a marine-store shop, in Leather-lane, kept by Gibbons—he went in, and came out again—I went into the shop immediately, and saw a pestle and mortar on the counter, which, is my opinion, belonged to Mr. Button—I went back to our shop, and Bacon came in soon after, and implored me to forgive him, and not say anything about it—he must have known I had watched him—I did not see any one go into Gibbons' shop after Bacon came out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I come out of Newgate; I have been eleven months in Mr. Button's employ. On 27th Feb., between six and seven o'clock, I left my master's shop to go to tea, and took a pestle and mortar with me—I took them to Gibbons's shop, in Leather-lane, only a few minutes' walk from my master's, and he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—the price of them in my master's shop would be 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I believe—as I was coming away I saw Mr. Minton go there—I went to my roaster's, and saw Mr. Minton—he called Mr. Button; I made a statement to him—a police<lb></lb>man was sent for, and I was taken into custody—I had been taking things to Gibbons for three or four months, from my master's—I took some files—he gave me 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the small ones, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for others, and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the large—he said to me, "Is this all you have got? and when I took the last two large ones, he said, "They do not sell so well as the middling size; I shall only give you 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them"—I took some spirit-lamps, and afterwards the brass tops belonging to them—I sold them sometimes to the man, and sometimes to his wife—the first time I took him a dozen</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185104070051"></xptr>
               <p>tops; and he said, "Are these all you have got? and said they were no we, only for old brass, and put them into the scale, weighed them, and give me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—I took him between five and six dozen of them, and about eight of the lamps, one at a time—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the small limps, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the large ones—when I took the last large ones, he said be should not buy any more; they did not sell well—I took nine or ten pestles and mortars at different times—at first he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and after<lb></lb>wards he said they did not sell well, and only gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took him nine porcelain funnels at different times, and about ten or twelve pounds of lead pipe, for which he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—I think I had been rob<lb></lb>bing my master in this way between three and four months when I was taken—I did not rob any one during the other seven months.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How often did you rob your master? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three or four times a week; I did not buy these buttons on my waistcoat out of any of the goods I stole, but out of my wages, eight or nine months ago—I was seventeen on 5th April—I have no father or mother—I live with Mrs. Bashford, who takes in washing, in Bishop's-head-court, Gray's-inn-lane—one of the lodgers there drives a Post-office van, and another cleans the carriages at the police-court—I used to get home about eleven o'clock at night; sometimes earlier—I took a walk of an evening after I had done work, and I used to go and see my sister; I went there alone—I did not always walk about alone; sometimes with a young man, whose father is a master bricklayer, and lives at 18, Brownlow-street—that is a coffee-shop, kept by a person named Gates—I have been to concerts with him—about a week before I was taken, I went to the Mogul, in Laystall-street—you do not pay to go in there—I did not take any young lady there—there are girls there about my own age—it is not a Casino—I have never danced there—we have a pint of beer there, and hear a song—before I went to Mr. Button's I was out of work about six months, and Mr. Borrows, of 3, Mitre-court, Ely-place, used to lodge and feed me for nothing—I suppose he had a great liking to me—he works at Purday's music-place, in Holborn—before that I was porter at Mr. Joseph's curio<lb></lb>sity-shop, in Regent-street, about three weeks, and left on account of being <hi rend="italic">taken bad</hi>—before that I was porter, for two years and two months, at Dixon's <hi rend="italic">papier-mache</hi> tray warehouse, in Brownlow-street, and I left there to better myself—that was about seven weeks before I went to Regent-street—it was not four years ago that I left Brownlow-street; it is about two years and a half—I have never assisted the police in any way, or ever been a witness before, or in a Court.</p>

Bacon has been in my service nine or ten months—three or four months before he was taken, I began to miss articles, lamp-glasses, and brass lamp-caps, of the sort produced—I did not miss any pestles and mortars, but I have a very large stock of them—I missed sixteen funnels—this one produced is a new pat<lb></lb>tern, made in Worcester, about three months ago; and I have missed lead and files—the selling price of composition pestles and mortars is about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the files are from 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each; they were all handled with rosewood and mahogany—the lamp-glass would be 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the brass tops 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen—Bacon made a statement to me, and was taken into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you swear to the articles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from the peculiarity of their make—the lamps are not perfect—that would reduce their value considerably; but I have stated the cost price.</p>

(these three lamps were then produced) "I cannot tell—I keep a book in which I enter the things I purchase, and there are lamps entered in that book—I cannot say if these are in the book—I purchase what comes to my hand—I did not pay him for them at all"—upon that, Mr. Alderman Humphery ordered him to be put in the dock, as a person to be charged.</p>

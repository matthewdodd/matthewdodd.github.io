               indicted on the Statute made in the 12th Year of the late Queen, against vending and selling Dice with false and counterfeit Stamps
            </rs>. Mrs. Garland depos'd, That the Prisoner came to her, and offered to sell her two pair of Dice, demanding 4 s. for them, telling her he had newly come out of White Chapel Prison, and wanted Money. The Dice being produced in Court, Mr. Rolloss the Engraver to the Stamp Office deposed, that the Stamps these Dice were stamp'd with, were not the true Stamps, made by him, who was the only Person that was appointed to make them. Mrs. Walpole deposed, That a Man bought and offered to sell her two pair of Dice, for 3 s. 6 d. telling her he had found them in a Paper at the End of Chancery Lane, which were also false Dice, and stamp'd with the same Stamp. Mr. Saunders depos'd, That he having notice of there Dice being offered to sale, went and secured the Person that brought them, till he should satisfy him how he came by them, who reply'd, that he had them from one that stood over the Way, and he would carry him to the Person, but the Prisoner ran away, and they could not catch him at that Time, but did apprehend him afterwards, the same Night.

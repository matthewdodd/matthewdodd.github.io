Upon taking up the half guinea, I saw it was a bad one. and shewed it my son, and desired him and the patrol to go after the prisoners; they did so, and brought them back; I told them they had passed a bad half guinea; they said, if I would not take them to the watch-house, they would give any thing; they were then taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What sort of half guinea was given to you first? - A. A straight one.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the men been gone out of the house before they were brought back? - A. Not a minute.</p>
               <p>JAMES MAYPOWDER sworn - (Confirmed Mrs. Maypowder in her testimony.) I was present at the watch-house, and saw them searched; the prisoner had two good seven-shilling pieces in his pocket; the other man had fifteen shilling in silver, and about tenpenny-worth of halfpence; they let the other man go. When I first went up to the prisoner, he wanted to resist; I shook him, and he put his hand in his pocket, pulled out the half guinea, and let it fall; I called the watchman, who brought a light, and the patrol found it; it appeared to be the half guinea first paid to my mother.</p>

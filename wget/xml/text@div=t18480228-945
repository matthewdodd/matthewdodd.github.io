                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 618.) On the evening of 15th Feb. I met Shirley in Bishopgate-street—I asked him what he had in a bundle. which he was carrying—he said, "Some work"—I asked what kind—he said, "Some water-tight boots"—he said be worked for a shop in Shoreditch, and he was going to take them ta a shop in Westminster—I walked with him.</p>

               <p>for about one hundred yards, and at the corner of Widegate-street we met Hol<lb></lb>land—Shirley said, "Here is my shopmate"—I said to Holland, "Do you, know this man?"—he said, "Yes;" and before I could say anymore, Shirley said to him, "Am I not going to take this work home to West<lb></lb>minister?"—Holland said, "Yes, you are"—I was not satisfied, and asked Shirley to go to the station—Holland said he would follow, and justify his shopmate—I took Shirley to the station—I then went out to look for Hol<lb></lb>land, and he was gone—I said to Shirley, "Your companion is gone?"—he said, "If that is the case he has let me in a <hi rend="italic">hole</hi>; I will tell you all about them; they were taken from the shop of Mrs. Axtell, in High-street, Wool<lb></lb>wich, and I wish you to look after Holland, to take the blame off me"—I found these two pairs of boots in the bundle.</p>

                  </hi> I am the son of Ann Mary Axtell, a boot and shoemaker, at Woolwich.

                  </hi> I am foreman to Mrs. Axtell. These boots are her's—I paid shirley for this pair for Holland, on Saturday night, and he took them to Holland to drive the nails down in the toes—that was no the pre<lb></lb>mises—I missed them on the Tuesday following, when the policeman brought them—both the prisoners were at the shop on Monday.</p>

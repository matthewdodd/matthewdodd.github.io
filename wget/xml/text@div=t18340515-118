            . I am the wife of John Carter. The prisoner came and lodged in my front parlour on the 14th of April - on Friday, the 25th of April I supposed the prisoner was out all day; but in the afternoon, about four o'clock, we heard a noise, and a little girl went and tried the door - I afterwards went up to the back parlour, and a timepiece was gone from the back parlour - I had seen it safe about an hour before - I had not seen the prisoner before all day, but she was in the house then - this is the timepiece - the prisoner left my house the next day - I would not let her stay any longer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then she went away at your desire? A. Yes, she did not abscond - I had not seen her for the entire day on which the timepiece was missed - the outer door had been opened and shut several times, because there are lodgers in the house - when I missed the time-piece, I fainted, and found the prisoner assisting me - I then went into the parlour, and missed her work-box - I did not go to see how the outer door was, whether it was open or shut - I had seen the timepiece<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183405150069"></xptr>safe about an hour before I fainted - what time of that hour it had been taken, I cannot tell - the prisoner was coming in when I missed it - she could not have been in during that hour without my knowing it, but I heard a footstep about four o'clock in the afternoon go along the passage - I missed the timepiece almost at the same minute, and the prisoner came in just at the time - a person asked her how she came in - she said she found the door ajar.</p>

            . I keep a lodging-house at No. 12, George-street, Limehouse-fields. The prisoner took a room at my house on the 26th of April, which was on Saturday - one hair trunk was brought in the same night - she had the key, but did not sleep in the house till the Monday night - I saw her go out on the Tuesday, and she did not return - the room was locked - no one went in there till the officer came; if any one had, I must have known it - when the officer came, my daughter mentioned that the key of the back parlour would open the prisoner's room door, but I was not aware of it - it would open it, but not lock it again.</p>

             (police-constable K 143.) I received information, and went to Limehouse-fields, to a person named Toswell, a green-grocer. I took the prisoner there - Mrs. Toswell directed me to Mrs. Small - I went to the front room up stairs - it was locked - I examined the room, and found this timepiece wrapped in a handkerchief - I spoke to the prisoner about it - she said the handkerchief was hers, but she knew nothing about the timepiece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who went with you? A. Mr. Hart. The timepiece was wrapped in the handkerchief, which was clean - it was not tied.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was just about being discharged, when Mr. Hart said if any one went to my lodging the timepiece would be found. One handkerchief was clean in my box when I went out, and the other was on the table. I locked up my room, and have the key now. The timepiece was not in the room when I left; it must have been taken there; it was a planned thing. The magistrate saw it was spite, and he was going to acquit me, till Mr. Hart made that reply.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to ELIZABETH SMALL. Q. When did the prisoner's boxes come in? A. One on Saturday night, the other on Monday. If she had intended to part with the timepiece, she might have done it - I had been in her room while she was there.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see the policeman and Hart come? A. Yes, I did. I saw no parcel with them - they desired me to go with them into the room, and the timepiece was on the table - I did not notice any timepiece on the table till they found it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the policeman or Hart put any thing on the table? A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been out of your house on the Sunday or Monday? A. Yes; but I am confident my children would not let any one in.</p>

            . Q. Who went into the room first? A. I did - Mr. Hart could not have put the timepiece there without my knowing it, because we went from Lambeth-street - the timepiece was on the table wrapped up in a clean handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it tied? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT to HENRY HART. Q. Did you see the timepiece on the table? A. Not till the officer found it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you at the police-office? A. Yes - I cannot say whether it was the policeman or myself that suggested to the magistrate to send to her lodging - it might have been me - I cannot say that I did not - when I saw the timepiece, it was wrapped in the handkerchief - it was tied.</p>
               <p>COURT to

            ENEVER. Q. Was it possible for Hart to have put the timepiece there? A. No; it was not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any thing else there? A. There was a work-box - I did not see the timepiece when I went in - I did not think of it - I went to look for duplicates, and for the timepiece, if I could find it.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 32, Manchester Street, King's Cross, and am a carpenter and joiner—on 27th August, a little before seven, I went into a public-house in Gray's Inn Road—I had a pint of beer there—Winterbourne came in and wanted some of my beer—I would not let her have it—Mills, who was there, said, "Why don't you take it if you want it? I should, you b—fool"—she took it after that without my consent—I left the house, and after I got a few yards they rushed on me behind, knocked me about, scratched my face, and knocked my hat in—I had a hand-saw in my hand—Winterbourne held my other hand while Mills twisted it out of my hand—Mills ran away with the saw—they did not take anything else from me—they did not hurt me a great deal, only by scratching my face—Mills ran away with the saw—I held Winterbourne, called a policeman, and gave her in charge—this is my saw (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have had it some time—I know it well—I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Winterbourne</hi>. The prosecutor met me at four o'clock, took me to a house, and called for a pint of fourpenny ale, and then Mills came in with another man—the two men entered into a dispute about who would make the best four-inch door—he wanted me to pledge his saw, as he had broken the pledge and wanted to keep up the <hi rend="italic">spree</hi>—I would not pawn it, but he gave it to Mills, who had pawned a handkerchief of his before. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Mills never pawned a handkerchief for me—I did not go to a pub<lb></lb>lic-house with Winterbourne—I had not been at Mills's house—she never pawned a handkerchief for me—I had never seen either of the prisoners before—it was not quite seven—it was broad daylight.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 128, Gray's Inn Road, and am a writer on glass—on Monday, the 27th August, I was sitting at my front window, and I saw the prosecutor as he got opposite my house—I saw Winterbourne come up behind him—she caught him by the neck, and twisted his handkerchief, and while he was struggling with her Mills twisted the saw out of his hand and ran away—I knew them in the neighbourhood.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman 132 E). On August 27th, about seven o'clock, I was told to take the prisoners—I heard some one say the "Great Eastern" was the one who had the saw—I did not know who that was—I found Winterbourne at the corner of Fullwood's Rents—I said, "Liz, have you been at Verulam Buildings to<lb></lb>night?"—she said, "Yes, and I have had a rare fight there"—I said, "What about the saw?"—she said, "I have pledged it; here is the ticket, and here is the money; it was the best thing to do with it to prevent any one from stealing it"—the money was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper.</p>

I went into the public-house to be treated with some gin by the prosecutor—he gave this young woman the saw to pledge—she gave it to me, and I pledged it at Golding's—when I came back they were both gone—I told the policeman I was looking for Liz, and he said I</p>

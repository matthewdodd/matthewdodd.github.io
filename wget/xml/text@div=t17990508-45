             sworn. - I can only identify the property, I know nothing of the loss; the husband of the prisoner worked for me, and she has been in the constant habit of carrying work to and from my shop; and she was stopped on the 22d of last month, with some shoes that she was attempting to pawn, they were not shoes that her husband made, and therefore, I presume, they were shoes she stole from the shop, when she came backwards and forwards; I found eleven pair of shoes at another pawnbroker's, in consequence of her having dropped a duplicate in my shop, about a fortnight before; they were all my property.</p>
               <p>- BERRYMAN sworn. - I am a pawnbroker,(produces three pair of shoes): On Saturday, the 20th of April, I received a pair of shoes of the prisoner at the bar; on the Monday following, she offered me another pair, and I questioned her about their being her property; she told me she lived at No. 15, New-street, she said she kept a house there; I thought, from her appearance, she could not live there; she afterwards told me she lived at No. 15, St. Martin's-lane; and before I sent to No. 15, St. Martin's-lane, I jumped over the counter and felt her pocket, and asked what she had got there; and she pulled out another pair of shoes; she said she came to pawn them for a man who lived at a hairdresser's shop; my young man found a hair-dresser's shop there, and a man of that name, but he said he had not sent them by her, nor had not seen her for a long time; he was a shoemaker, but said he never made up such shoes; and I stopped her, and sent for an officer.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Cordy, a pawnbroker: I do not know the prisoner; there were eleven pair of shoes pawned at our house, at different times, which Mr. Williams owned; I took in four pair myself. (They were produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>


               <p>Prisoner's defence. I met with a person that I never saw before, who asked me to pledge two pair of shoes for him, as a favour; and the gentleman stopped me, and searched me himself, before he sent for a constable, and used me very ill.</p>

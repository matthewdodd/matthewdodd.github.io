               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You pursued through a number of courts and turnings, and therefore must have lost sight of the person? - A. No; I was in sight of him all the time till after he dropped the cloth; in going down Durham-yard I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. That was at a considerable distance from the Strand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the face of the person while he was in your shop? - A. No, only his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner? - A. No, I have not.</p>

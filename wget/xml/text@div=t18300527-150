            . I am a Police-constable. On the 24th of April, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the prisoner's apartments, No. 30, <placeName id="t18300527-150-crimeloc818">Lower Northampton-street, Clerkenwell</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This is a sixpence that, I dare say, you would take for your wages if it was offered you? A. I should be very sorry to take one like it - it is clear enough that it is bad; there are lumps on the edge of it - it would not impose on me for a moment; I consider it in that rough state that no one would take it - a solid piece of metal was found in my presence, also more plaster of Paris; a tea-cup and teaspoon, with plaster of Paris in it, and eleven more sixpences - one man could easily carry the things; the thing the fire was in, could he carried into the room, but not in the state it was then in - I took it off with the tongs; it could have been lighted after it was brought in - I went to the house in consequence of information.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know they were brought there a very short time before, by the person who gave you the information, for the purpose of getting a reward? A. I do not - I have known the person who gave the information for several years; he is a bricklayer and plasterer - he had never given me information before; I promised him nothing, nor did any body else to my knowledge - he is a poor man; I saw him about a week ago - I found nobody but the prisoners in the room; I had seen the man, who gave the information, looking out of the window not many minutes before I went in; he gave me a signal out of window - he was quite able to carry the things there; I know his name, and where he did live - when I looked through the crevice, the male prisoner was examining the sixpences; his wife was nearly opposite - it is a small round table; I never saw them before, and cannot say they live there - the man who gave the information had spoken to me about it in the early part of the day, but did not tell me where the place was till the afternoon, it might be two hours before; he had been in the company of Goodson during those two hours; I saw him part of the time - I became acquainted with him by living in the neighbourhood where he was brought up; I was a patrol of the parish before I joined the Police - I do not know where the informer is now; he could have been here, no doubt.</p>

            . I am a serjeant of the Police. I accompanied Phillips and the other officers to the prisoners' room - we could see between the door and door-post; I looked through there, and saw the moulds on the table, and the money piled up by the side - the man appeared to have some money in his hand; the woman stood against the table, and seemed as if she was rubbing a sixpence with a piece of paper - she returned it to her husband; he looked at it, and then appeared, by the movement of his hand, to put it on the others, which laid by his side - I assisted to break the door open, and tried tosecure the woman, but could not at first; she attempted to strike Phillips -I kept her from doing so, and she cried out, "Oh, you villains!" the man said, "Oh, I am done!" and seemed much affected; the woman put her hand on the table, and struck the moulds off; one fell at her feet - she stamped on that, so that it was all powder; the other fell against the fender and broke - I saw Phillips pick up a sixpence from the powder under her feet, and one or two pieces of metal were taken up with the sixpence -Phillips picked up part of the mould which fell against the fender; it was put together afterwards - he kept it in his possession; I saw it again when I went to Mr. Field's to have it put together - this is the same (looking at it) - I searched the male prisoner, and found on him six good sixpences, and one had one, which I produce; I found in the cupboard a tea-cup with plaster of Paris in it, and a metal tea-spoon which stuck to the plaster of Paris; it appeared to have been watted - I produce a mould, which I found in the iron pot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Suppose that sixpence was paid you in your salary, I dare say you would hand it back again? A. I should certainly - I should know it was not good if I examined it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose any body had paid you a number of half-crowns, shillings and five or six sixpences, and this was one of them, and you just looked at it among others, should you take it? A. I should take it if I was not to examine it, or if I only examined it in the ordinary way among others.</p>

               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. You think this might impose on you in common circulation? A. Yes - if my attention was called to it I should see that it was bad, but not without; if it was offered to me casually I should take it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say that with ordinary care, looking at it as you ought at money, that you should take it? A. Yes, if it merely passed from one hand to another I should, and so might any one looking at it with ordinary care, taking it with more money.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know a person named Bradford? A. No; nor Rose or Pope - I was desired to go to the house by the inspector; I did not myself observe a man at the window - we were not all exactly together; Phillips or Dove informed me when to go in - we might be a yard or two apart; I knew I was going about some coin, and was informed we were to have a signal -I heard so while we were walking there, and before we went in; we did not find the man who gave the signal in the room, nor meet him on the stairs - one person could carry all the things into the room; I am not aware which way the man went out - we went up gently and found nobody but the prisoners in the room; I did not hear the informer's name, and was not acquained with him at all -I was merely fetched from the station to go with the officers; I believe my brother officers saw the man looking out of window - I have seen a man who I was told was him; he came to Phillips - I saw him with Phillips about an hour before we went to the room, and he walked before us; I do not remember in what street he left Phillips - it might be half a quarter of a mile or a quarter; Phillips followed him at about twenty yards distance, but when they turned the corner I did not see them - Phillips came back to us without the man, before we went to the house; that man could not have put the thigns on the fire - I cannot say there was any thing to prevent his putting them on, and lighting the charcoal afterwards; he might be absent from us about three quarters of an hour, out of my sight - I did not speak a word to him; I do not know whether he was to be paid any thing - I was told he was to accompany us to the house; he was going towards the house at the time he left us - Phillips left us at the same time; I did not go to the house for an hour after Phillips returned to us - the man was then out of his sight.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I accompanied the officers, and apprehended the prisoners - I found one sixpence lying on the floor near the fire-place; I produce it - I examined a chest of drawers in the room, and found this piece of metal in them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe a man looking out of window? A. No; he might have been there - I had not seen the informer that day; I went with the other Police-man - I had been with Phillips for about three quarters of an hour; no man came up and spoke to him to my knowledge - Phillips did not follow a man who had been speaking to the Police-man, while I was with him - if any one has sworn so, he must be mistaken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by a mere lucky accident that you went to the house? A. Yes - I did not know of information being given, or that we were to have a signal.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of it till now? A. Oh Yes, we heard it that morning before we went to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason you swore it was by accident you went to the house? A. It was accidentally that we happened of them - we had received information in the morning, but that was not in the evening; I say we went there by accident - we did not know whether we should have it right then or not; I saw the man in the morning on my beat - I did not hear him give the information; I did not speak to him - I saw him afterwards at one o'clock, and he spoke to me; he did not give me the information - he was walking about, and I was on duty; he was not an acquaintance of mine - he had been speaking to somebody before; we went accidentally whether we should light on this man or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that what you were speaking to the man about at one o'clock? A. Yes - we went to the house at five; I have not seen the man since, and do not know who he is - he did not tell me to be there at five; we went accidentally - I did not know he was to have been at the window to give a signal; I never heard a word about a signal till now.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH GUTTERIDGE. I occupy the house, No. 30, Lower Northampton-street. The prisoners came to lodge there in June last, and have been with me in the same room ever since till they were apprehended - it was the second floor front room; the woman paid the rent.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see a man there the day they were taken up? A. Yes - I did not see him look out of window; I saw him come out of the door, and had seen him go up - I understood he was an acquaintance of theirs; I saw him there four or five times in the course of a fortnight, and had seen him that morning - the Police came in, I suppose, a quarter of an hour after he went out, but I saw him go in again with something in a jug, and shortly after the Police-men went up stairs he came to the door from the back-yard; I have not seen him since - I always supposed the prisoners to be well conducted persons.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q. What size was the jug? A. A blue jug, about a pint - he had something in it, but a handkerchief was thrown over the top of the jug, as he had it in his hand; he had nothing more in his hands.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Would not that crucible go into the jug? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin, I had two counterfeit sixpences produced to me at Hatton-garden, which I compared with the broken mould which has the obverse impression - this is the mould;(two sixpences handed to the witness,) neither of these correspond with that mould - (looking at another mould) I apprehend this is a counterpart of the other; the two from one mould - these two sixpences are a different impression altogether; I compared two sixpences with the mould at Hatton-garden, which corresponded in every respect - here they are; these were cast from the mould - they are not completely finished.</p>
               <p>Q. These two correspond with the mould? A. Yes - they appear to be the two that were produced at Hatton-garden; I observed a small indented mark under the neck, and I think I can distinguish a similar mark on the obverse side of the mould - I have compared the sixpences as accurately as I can, from the broken state of the mould, and believe them to have been made by that mould; there is a small part of the impression left on the reverse side, and that fits the counterfeit sixpences exactly - these two sixpences yet want their finishing; to the best of my belief they were formed by this mould - the eight counterfeit sixpences are from a different mould altogether; the good sixpence is of the same pattern as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270073"></xptr>the two counterfeit ones produced - it is dated 1816; the two first that I saw corresponded with the eight - one of them appears to be completely finished; I should say the other was not finished, and should doubt whether it would be taken - it is in a very rough state; the two which fit the mould are not fit for circulation - the eight are all unfinished; they want something removed from them, which points out that they are counterfeit.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing them to have been put into circulation, would they he rejected at once? A. Certainly, common observation would point out that they were not finished - the two corresponding with the mould would be rejected by the most common observer; the one that is finished has the rough edges taken off.</p>

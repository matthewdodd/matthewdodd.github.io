On Sunday evening, the 23d of November, about six o'clock, I was in the kitchen on the first-floor, and heard a noise on the stairs; I went to the staircase, and found the prisoner about five or six stairs from the kitchen, without his hat and coat. The prisoner was the man, as far as I can judge from his appearance-he had a jacket on. I gave the alarm of Stop thief! directly, ran out at the street - door, and asked the neighbours to surround the next house, which was empty. The prisoner was taken about seventeen or eighteen yards from the house. He had ran up stairs, and made his escape. I had a candle, and was within a yard or two of him when he was taken-his dress and appearance corresponded. I can with certainty say he is the man.</p>
               <p>HANNAH WALKER. I am servant to the prosecutors. I sleep in the garret. I shut the window that evening, about a quarter of an hour before-it was then dark - I had no candle with me. There was a glass on the table close to the window. After the prisoner was taken, I found the window open, and the glass overturned. It had been dark sometime before I shut it.</p>

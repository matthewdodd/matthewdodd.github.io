                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Barnett, and live in Turk-street, Bethnal-green; he is a porter. On Saturday evening I went to Mr. Wellesden's shop in Church-street, to redeem some pledges—I fell something behind me—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had seen it not many minutes before—I had just changed a half-crown—I turned round, caught hold of the prisoner, and told her she had taken my money out of my pocket—she said I was deceived—I said, No, I am not, you hussey; I am positive you have robbed me of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I kept hold of her, and told her I wanted my money—I told her she had got my money in her hand, and she gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 41/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of her hand—she had other money in her hand—she did not admit taking the money.</p>

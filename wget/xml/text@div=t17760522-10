The next day I saw the paper advertised, and immediately upon that I went and took them all up. Wade was admitted an evidence, and she shewed me where a good deal of it laid; some was found at Birch's and some at Bailey's: the prisoner Kelly went with me and shewed me where it was; and the justices thought by her conduct she was entitled to some recommendation from them, and therefore they recommended her for mercy. Wade directed me to take up a boy who was concerned in it.</p>

I saw no window broke, but Kelly told me she had cut her hand by a bit of glass in the window. This might last about an hour: the other two prisoners were there at the time: all the three prisoners and myself took some of the paper and went to Morgan, the last witness, with the paper that I had: we were at this work for two days; I was afterwards taken up for it.

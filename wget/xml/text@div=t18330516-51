The prisoner had been in my service about three months, and was so at the time this happened - I missed these boots about the 20th or 21st of March; I had left them in the passage leading to the staircase at night - it was his duty to clean them; I inquired of him about them, he said he had looked among all the boots (he had the care of sixty or one hundred pair,) but could not find them- I had seen the 5l. note on the evening of the 3rd of May in my pocket-book - when I went to bed I pulled off my coat and laid it down with my pocket-book in it - it was his duty to brush my coat in the morning - I locked the door of my bed-room; and in the morning I unlocked my door, and called my little girl to take down the coat to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160037"></xptr>be brushed - the pocket-book was then in the pocket - it was the prisoner's duty to brush it - in four or five minutes the coat was returned to me; I found the prisoner had laid it in the parlour at the back of the bar after brushing it; I saw it in the parlour about a minute after it was brushed - the pocket-book was still in it; I immediately looked into it; I had three 5l. bank notes and one Leicester bank note in it, and one 5l. Bank of England note was gone from the three; I inquired of the prisoner about it, he denied taking it - he was the only person who was to have brushed the coat - I should think it was not five minutes after I sent the coat down that I missed the note; I was dressing myself at the time - I sent it down - I saw the 5l. note again that afternoon, with an endorsement in my handwriting, and I accused the prisoner of having stolen it; he denied the charge - I sent for a police officer, who took him- the 5l. note was found in a place which he had for the express purpose of keeping his boots and shoes, and other salesman's coats; he had the exclusive possession of that place - in searching for the note the officer found three duplicates, one of which was for a pair of boots.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you swear it was not more than five minutes before you sent the coat down, till you received it? A. It was five minutes as near as I can state.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you swear it was delivered to me? A. Yes, Miss Rowlatt laid it on the kitchen chair for you to take, and you took it from there to brush; I am sure I took nothing from the pocket.</p>

            . I am a City policeman. Mr. Rowlatt called me in on the 4th of May, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, and told me he had been robbed by his boots (the prisoner), I took him into custody - I found the bank note concealed in a coat in the place appropriated for him to clean his boots and things - he said nothing; Rowlatt claimed the note, which had his endorsement on it - the prisoner was not present then; I have the note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you swear which place the note was in, I have two places to work at? A. It was where he kept his coats, boots, and shoes; Mr. Rowlatt said he had the place for his own use, and he did not deny it - the note was loose in the pocket of a coat of a gentleman who uses the house; the gentleman did not claim it.</p>

            . I am a commercial traveller. I was in the bar when the prisoner brought the coat in after brushing it - he asked me what he should do with it, I told him to lay it in the bar parlour, he did so - I was with the police officer when he found the note; it was in the place where the prisoner brushed his clothes and cleaned his boots - Mr. Rowlatt pointed out his endorsement on the note; the prisoner denied the charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you swear nobody else had access to the place? A. No, I am not sufficiently acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you in the habit of stopping at the house? A. I am the prosecutor's brother-in-law, and have been there about a month.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent; he set me to scrape the dirt off the pavement; while I was doing that, Miss Rowlatt called to me to brush her father's clothes, I answered her, but did not go for ten minutes; a second call was made and I went - I did not see them in the parlour, and found them in the kitchen; I took them and brushed them - I took the coat into the parlour and left it there, as Mr. Barlow said I might put it there - I went and finished the pavement, returned to the yard with the spade and broom, then went into the kitchen to breakfast - Miss Rowlatt came and asked where I found the clothes; I said in the kitchen; she said she did not know where she had left them - Mr. Rowlatt called me into the parlour, and said he missed a five pound note; I said I knew nothing of it; he said, if I would give it up, he would not prosecute me - Gentlemen, twice a week, come to market, pull their things off for me to brush, and put on others - I am sometimes away, and strangers are allowed about the yard, and have free access to my room.</p>

No, but I am sure I took it of him the day before, I have taken money from him before, but don't recollect ever giving him change; he is a regular customer - I perceived this to be a shattered note, which is the reason I put his name on it; other persons could go to this place, but none had business there, except the prisoner - I look over my money every night, before I go to bed - I had a good character with the prisoner.</p>

We missed, also some brasses. She had used the mug to throw water up against the window. We suspected the prisoner to take them, nobody being in the house at the time. I did not know where to find her; but knowing she had a child in the hospital, she told me where her mother lived; but Mr. Harding, a goldsmith, advertising the mug, I went to him, and there found the mug. We took up the prisoner, and she confess'd where she had sold the chamber pot and brasses in East Smithfield, where we went and found them.</p>

            . I live in the Minories, am a goldsmith. On the th of November about seven in the evening, the prisoner came to offer this mug to late. I asked her how she came by it? she said her husband was a soldier, and in the Westminster-Infirmary, and as she was going to see him in the Broadway, Westminster, she found the mug about half full of pease porridge; I said I must advertise it, that the right owner might have it again; she would have taken any thing for it. I advertised it, and Mrs. More came and owned it as her master's property.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it?</p>
               <p>Harding. It is worth about 3 l. 10 s.</p>

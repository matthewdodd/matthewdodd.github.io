            . I am an officer. On the 3d of September, between twelve and one o'clock, I was returning from Kentish-town to Battle-bridge - I saw three or four persons together, and the prosecutor was on the ground; I saw the prisoner lift the prosecutor, and take up something, which I ascertained afterwards to be his waistcoat; I did not see any stripping - that was done before I got there - I saw him shake the waistcoat twice,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140114"></xptr>and I heard something fall; Wescott stooped, as if to pick up something - the prisoner did the same; Wescott said, "You have got something;" the prisoner denied it, and used very bad language; I said, "I thought you was very busy about that man," and I asked what he had in his pockets, and whether he knew the prosecutor; he said he did, and, I think he said, he had been drinking with him; the prosecutor then got up, took hold of his collar, and said, "You have got my money - I don't know you at all;" I asked again what money he had got - he said 29s.; I searched him, and in one of his breeches pockets I found 8s., in the other 2s. 6d.; I asked him how he came to say he had 29s. - he said that was no consequence - I asked if he had no more money - he said No, but from his left-hand coat pocket I took this crown-piece; he said somebody must have put it there, and he accused us of so doing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not find three crowns and two half-crowns? A. No; the prosecutor had been drinking, but was sensible. I have found the prisoner is a coachman in place, and bears a good character.</p>

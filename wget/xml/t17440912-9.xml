            . On the 16th of July I lost a lamb, which was in a field of mine at Stratford ; I saw the lamb and the skin at Mr. Potter's the Constable at Bow: this is the skin, I know it by the mark - It is not my mark, it is the country mark. The Prisoner owned he had stole a lamb out of my field by Stratford turnpike.</p>

            . I was called up between 5 and 6 in the morning by Mr. Boot , who told me there was a man in his field killing one of my sheep. I was willing to see who it was, the man who is the Prisoner at the bar perceiving me come after him, run away, and I run after him: I run over 4 or 5 fields before I caught him; there was a man in the lane who ran along with me. The Prisoner had a hatchet with him, and a stick in his hand. I bid him lay down the hatchet or I would shoot him through the head, and he laid down his hatchet - I saw him stand by the lamb - The lamb was dead and warm, and the skin stripped ready to carry away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose lamb it was?</p>
               <p>Martin. I did not know then, I have been informed since; the lamb was given away in our town.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the skin that you saw then?</p>
               <p>Austin. I know it to be the skin.</p>

               <p>Mr. Boot deposed that he saw a man killing a lamb in one of his fields, and went and acquainted Mr. Austin with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going to Stratford to bring some beasts to Smithfield market, as I had done several market days, and found the lamb almost dead in a lane , and so I killed it. <rs id="t17440912-9-verdict47" type="verdictDescription">

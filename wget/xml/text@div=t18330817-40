            . I lived with Mr. Appleton; he gave me the order and the change; when I got to Kenton-street, the prisoner was swinging on the rails, and he said to me, "What a hell of a while you have been gone" - I said, I was sorry, but I brought them as soon as I could; he took the goods of me, and told me the reason he did not come himself was that his mistress sent him for the beer, and she caught him gossipping, and said she would never send him on an errand again - he then said, "I believe I have got to give you a yellow boy;" I said, yes, I gave him the goods and 17s. 11d. and he gave me a medal and ran away directly - I saw what it was, I ran to the corner of Henrietta-street, and saw him running; I cried out, and he was taken - I am sure he is the person I gave the goods and money to.</p>

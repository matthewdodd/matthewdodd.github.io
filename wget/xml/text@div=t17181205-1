             the Apprentice; the Midwife deposed that she being sent for examin'd her, and finding she had been deliver'd of a Child charged her with it, which tho' she at first deny'd, yet soon after own'd, and that she had put it into the Vault, that the Child she did believe was at its full time, nor did there any marks of Violence or Hurt appear upon it. Another Evidence deposed, that she asking her who was the Father, and how it was got, the Prisoner told her that she going up to make a Lodgers Bed in the place where she had liv'd before, he laid her on the Bed and did there get it, that he was since run away, and the People of the House her Master and Mistress were remov'd above 100 Miles off. She owned that she did put it into the Vault, but did not know whether it was alive or not, that she had it in her Apron to have carryed down when the Boy came up to her with the Drink, but put it away and did not then do it, till she had another opportunity. The Prisoner in her defence pleaded that she had had a fall about a Fortnight before, and had not felt the Child stir within her since that time, and that it was still born, upon the whole the Jury <rs id="t17181205-1-verdict5" type="verdictDescription">

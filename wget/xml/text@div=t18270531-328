               <p>THOMAS PEGG. I was coming from Drury-lane with my wife on the 2d of May - I was in Pickett-street, and a person came to me and asked if my name was Johnson; I said No, and came on to <placeName id="t18270531-328-crimeloc1768">Temple-bar</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You say you were a little in liquor? A. Yes; I had not seen the two persons together who asked me the question; I had a quarrel that evening, and had been fighting at the Blue Anchor public-house, in Feathers-court, about half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. You were very drunk, I believe? A. No; I was rather stupid with liquor - I saw my watch go.</p>

            . I was with my husband - he was stopped by a person in Pickett-street, but I had not hold of his arm at that time, and do not know any thing about it - I had been at the Feathers, and saw Lyall there, leaning against the table - I should not have known Lyall, but he walked all the way close behind us, and before we got to Temple-bar he tapped my husband on the shoulder - I had not hold of his arm, and did not hear what he said; when we got on to Temple-bar Lyall took hold of the flap of his coat, and said, "Is your name Johnson?" I said, "No, you blackguard," and then he took the watch and ran up Shire-lane; I ran after him, and he turned to the left - I am sure he is the man who was in the public-house, and who took the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. You say that when he took the watch he said something about Johnson? A. Yes; I never went to a public-house to find out the man. I have said the man had blue on, but I knew him by his face. I saw him again in about an hour, when the officer brought him into the public-house. I did not point out a man of the name of Heath. I never pointed out any man but him.</p>

            . I was with the prosecutor and his wife, at the public-house. I saw the two prisoners there, they went out with them. I did not walk with them to Temple-bar, but I was in sight of them. I saw the two prisoners walk in company a little way from the prosecutor. I saw Batty accost him first; but was not near enough to hear what he said; I then missed sight of them - I went through the gate-way and went on to Fetter-lane. I afterwards went back to the public-house and found Lyall there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Was there a person in the public-house named Heath? A. Yes; Mrs. Pegg did not point him out, she only pointed out Lyall.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. - I live in Manchester-buildings, near Westminster-bridge; I am a musician at the Theatre-Royal; I have known the gentleman at the bar twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a man in a decent situation of life? - A.Very respectable indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. He has a wife, and daughters grown up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What character has be home among his neighbours, for honesty and integrity? - A. He always bore the character of an honest man; I have been very intimate in the family.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to know whether this gentleman has at all times enjoyed his intellects in perfection? - A. I think, from some circumstances, for five or six years past, he has not been collected or in his mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in any situation of necessity, that should induce him to take any little articles of this fort? - A. Very much to the contrary; he has been away from his family for a week or ten days, and more, at a time, suddenly, and perfectly unaccountable to his family.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he, when he had his intellects completely, an attentive husband and master of a family? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is he? - A. He has lived at Leominster in a very extensive way.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How does he live now? - A.Upon his fortune; he lived at Leominster as a shopkeeper fourteen or fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What instances of his derangement have you known? - A. I think his taking five or six shillings worth of money out of his till, and throwing it among the multitude, is a proof of derangement; and taking these boots, when he had guineas in his pocket, and dismissing, for five months together, a favourite daughter from his own house, for no cause upon earth.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What cause did he assign for dismissing his daughter? - A.None at all; I never asked him the question; for he was so irritable in his disposition, that it was rather dangerous to enter into a detail upon his family concerns.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is his daughter? - A. The eldest about twenty, and the other turned of seventeen;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200062"></xptr>no girls, I believe, were ever better educated; they have had a very liberal education.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN INSOLK sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I was house-steward to Lord Bateman, at the time I was acquainted with Mr. Croucher; I have now property of my own, and live upon my fortune; I have known the gentleman at the bar about seven years.</p>
               <p>Q.What has been his character for honesty and integrity? - A. He was a man of strict honesty and integrity.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you observed any marks of derangement in him? - A. Not so much in London as in the country, when I was with my Lord Bateman; I have been given to understand from Mrs. Croucher, that he is at times deranged; and from what has passed in the country at different times, and what my friends have communicated to me respecting him, I have reason to believe he is so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in that situation, with respect to circumstances, that he was in want of eighteen or twenty guineas? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was the state of the moon on the 23d of August? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. It appears, from the almanack, that there was a new moon the day before.</p>
               <p>SAMPSON HODGKINSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a druggist, on Snow-hill, near Holborn-bridge; I have known the gentleman at the bar since the beginning of the year 1786; I have not known him so well since the year 1790; at that time I always considered him as a man of probity and honesty.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am collector for the stewards of the Sons of the Clergy, and several other public charities; I have known the gentleman at the bar twenty-two years; he is perfectly honest, and of perfect integrity.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any reason to know the state of his intellects for the last four or five years? - A. Yes; he has threatened to buy a pair of pistols, insisting that I should fire at him, or he would fire at me, for no reason upon earth; and his wife has been obliged to swear the peace against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any quarrel or cause of animosity with each other? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q. In the general course of his life, has he been an affectionate husband, and a tender father? - A. Yes, he has.</p>
               <p>Q. From your observation of him, do you believe that he was occasionally deranged, or not? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q.Except upon those occasions, is he a man whose conduct and general character has gained your esteem or not? - A.It has.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. His wife has swore the peace against him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that they were an affectionate couple before that? - A. He has been in this kind of way for these two or three years past, jumping suddenly up from his dinner, and going away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he given to drinking at all? - A. Yes, very much so; I have seen him very often in liquor, and look as wild as he could possibly look; in fact, he was not bearable when he had any liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole of your observations of this man's conduct, do you believe him to be deranged in his mind? - A.Positively I do, at times; Some years ago, he collected rents for me of an estate that I have in Radnorshire; I was coming down Holborn, and met the waggoner; I asked him if he knew Mr. Croucher, and he said, what, mad Croucher!</p>
               <p>Court. (To Hawkes.) Q. Was the prisoner searched when he was brought back? - A. Yes, by the constable.</p>
               <p>Constable. I searched the prisoner, and found upon him about two or three shillings; I do not think he had more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober? - A. He looked just as he does now, rather wild.</p>

My lord, I was taken in entirely altogether by a man that came to me at the Tower; he stated himself to be an old soldier of the regiment; he asked me some names, whether I knew them. He asked me of serjeant Ring, whether I knew him. After that, he met me again in about eight days; he told me on Tuesday to draw this prize money. We were drinking together; he told me if they asked me any questions, to say I was the man, and to ask if serjeant Ring's wife had

I went back and told the man; he asked me which day I should go again; I told him I was ordered on the Friday. I gave him the certificate back. On the Friday following I was going up to Chelsea with two letters; one for the serjeant-major, and the other for the quarter-master-serjeant at the depot, Chelsea. This man laid his head down on the table; he said he had been up the night before; he told me I might do his business as well as himself. He handed me the certificate. I went and told them that I had come for

I told him there was a William M'Coy, whom he thought was in town, and lived at the Cumberland coffee-house; he told me to bring the servant that gave me this certificate. I went back to the man at Charing-cross, and told him what this gentleman said. He said, do you go presently and say Mr. M'Coy is at the coffee-house; he gave me this letter with the certificate: he said that would get the money, and he would give me a drink out of it. He said they would not ask any questions when they saw this. I gave the letter to the gentleman, not knowing what was in it; he kept the letter; he said it was a defraud between me and the servant, or somebody else; he told me to go away, and come another day. 
I went off, and went to the Tower barracks. In the evening a serjeant ordered me out of the ranks, and ordered me up to Chelsea.</p>

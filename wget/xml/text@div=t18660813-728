                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Middleton, of 14, Ryder Street—he keeps a lodginghouse—about a quarter past five on the morning of 10th July I heard a noise on the stairs of my house—I went out to see what it was, and saw prisoner walking along my passage—I called out, "Stop thief;" and, "I have caught you at last, sir"—he never spoke—he turned his head round and looked at me—I got a full view of him—he walked as quickly as possible to the front door—I followed and took hold of him—he dropped the despatch-box on the mat of the door—he opened the door—I held it as long as I could, to prevent him going out, but he managed to escape from the house—in doing so he dropped this on the step—a policeman was coming up to the door as he was going out, and, hearing the alarm, he followed him and brought him back—he said that it was not he who had done it—I said, "You are the man"—I saw a latch<lb></lb>key drop from his trousers—this latchkey was afterwards tried in my door, and it opened it.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman C 86). On the morning of 10th July, about half-past five, I was on duty in Ryder Street, St. James's, near the prosecutor's house—I saw the prisoner leave the house—he had with him this cashbox and this coat—as soon as he saw me he dropped them—I picked them up and followed him till he was stopped—he ran straight up Jermyn Street—another constable came round the corner and stopped him—I never lost sight of him—I brought him back to the house—he dropped a key as soon as he was stopped—the other constable picked it up and put it into my hand—when at the house he dropped another key—that is the key I gave to Mrs. Middleton—he dropped another key after he got to the station—I searched him—these are the keys, and fit the prosecutor's door.</p>

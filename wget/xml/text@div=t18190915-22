On the 26th of July I was returning from West-End fair about nine o'clock, I was met by a gang of eight or nine men and boys, who surrounded and carried me away from my friends. I caught hold of my watch by the ribbon; I held it, and received several cuts about my head with sticks. I struggled with them for ten minutes - they then got my watch. I was separated from my friends, who were afraid to come to my assistance. I received several kicks about my body. They tore my breeches-pocket out, in which was 9 s.; I also lost my handkerchief. I was stunned with the blows, and could not discern any of them.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker, and live in Cable-street, Wellclose-square. On the 28th of July the prisoner came to sell me a watch, I said it would not suit me. He came again at three o'clock, and left it to be repaired; it was to come to 6 s. - the swivel was broken by some violence. He was to call next day for it, he did not call until the day after. In the mean time, Coombes had given me information. The prisoner was to call on Thursday, but did not until Friday at ten o'clock. I told him to come in an hour, and it would be ready - he came to the door at three o'clock, and asked for it - I told him to come in, he declined it, and went away. I did not see him again until the next day, when he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Did you know him before - A. I repaired a clock for him once. I knew where he formerly lodged.</p>

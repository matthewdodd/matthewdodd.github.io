               <p>Q. Did you use to employ him to receive your money - A. He used to receive money behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this - A. On the 24th of March. He has lived with me about eight months in the capacity of a shopman; for some time I had reason to suspect that he had robbed me, having missed money several times. On Saturday morning, the 24th of March, I took two one pound notes to Mr. Gay, a friend of mine, in Chancery-lane, and desired him to give them to Mrs. Gay to lay them out at my shop, which she did.</p>

            . I am a master baker.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the notes Mr. Nicholson gave you - A. I gave them to Mrs. Gay about nine o'clock in the morning, or a little after.</p>

            What you do with the notes your husband gave you - A. I laid them out at Mr. Nicholson's shop with the prisoner; I bought six pair of cotton stockings and a pair of silk ones, they came to one pound sixteen shillings; the two one pound notes that I received of my husband I gave to the prisoner and he gave me four shillings change.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it - A. It was directly after breakfast.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nicholson. About half after eleven o'clock I returned home, I referred to the till book to see if the money had been set down for goods sold.</p>

            Is the till book here - A. No; I was not aware that it was necessary to bring the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, it is, if you are talking about a book - A. I asked him if there was any thing to set down, he said there was nothing. I then returned to Mrs. Gay to ascertain if she had laid out the money, she told me she had, and shewed me the goods that she had purchased. I then examined the till and found that one of the notes was not in the till that she had paid; there was one note in the till, the other was not. The prisoner told me the till was right with the goods that were sold, that the money in the book did correspond to what he had sold, but he had omitted putting in the guinea for the six pair of cotton stockings.</p>
               <p>COURT. Why did not you bring the book with you - A. I did not think that book had any reference to the transaction.</p>

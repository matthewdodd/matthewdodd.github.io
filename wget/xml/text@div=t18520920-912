Upper Grove-street, and found that this key opened the top room there—I searched the room, and on the mantelshelf found this bad half sovereign in a piece of paper—in another piece of paper there were two bad shillings; and in another, this bad half crown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in the cupboard I found this ladle, which appears to have had metal in it, these two pieces of plaster of Paris, some metal, and some pieces of wire (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is no im<lb></lb>pression on the plaster—I cannot say whether it is intended for a mould or not—I showed them to Richard William Baker, who lives in the same house, and was in the room at the time—I showed them to the prisoner at the police court, and told him where I had found them—he said he knew nothing about them, some one else must have put them there.</p>

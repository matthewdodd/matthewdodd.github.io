               <p>Q. How came you out so late? - A. I came on shore with my shipmate about eleven o'clock, after mooring the ship, it was dark; he was going to see his mother, and I was going with him; I missed my shipmate, and a gentleman came and told me he knew where my shipmate was.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you fell in company with the prisoners? - A. I cannot tell, it was in a house; I was never in the house before, I do not know where the house was, I was not real sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you were in company with these two men? - A. Yes; the tall man, Williams, came in first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink with him? - A.No; I do not know whether my shipmate did, he was in company with my shipmate.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get in company with Williams? - A. About half past eleven, I cannot rightly tell; the other came to Holborn-hill; I never took notice of him before my shipmate left me in the house; a woman wrangled with him, and the watchman came and took us all out; I cannot tell the name of the place, I am a Prussian; then I was going to treat this man with a pot of beer, and I was turned out of another house.</p>

Yes, and this gentleman told me he knew where my shipmate was; I wanted to go to my shipmate, I did not know where he was; then we came to this house that was shut up, and there I put the half-guinea in at the scuttle, it was to pay for a pot of beer; they handed it me out, when the young man, Edmonds, with the blue coat, took hold of the half-guinea; he ran away with it, and I ran after him; the tall man, Williams, stopped me, and prevented me from pursuing the other man; he said it was a sixpence, and I could swear it was half a guinea; in trying to stop me, he tore my waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. The one that took the half-guinea said nothing? - A. No, he was standing close behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your half-guinea again? - A. I called the watchman; they were both stopped, and the half-guinea was found by the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. When the half-guinea was handed out through the hole in the door, did you try to get it? - A. I said, give me the half-guinea; they said it was a sixpence; I said, let me see it; I was going to lay hold of it, but he was first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I see you are an honest fellow, as I expected a sailor to be; when you handed it in, somebody not choosing to give change, handed it out to you; you gave it in voluntarily out of good nature to treat your friend? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was returned out from the door, you had no objection to his taking of it - you thought he would give it you again? - A. I would have taken hold of it if I could; I told him to give it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, afterwards; you did not object at the time; he certainly should have given it you; you did not say, do not you take it -</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of the night at the watch-house of St. Andrew's; I heard the sailor calling out stop thief; I was close by him at the time with the inspector.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he charge with taking it? - A. He said, Edmonds, the short one, was the man that snatched it from the door; when they were at the watch-house, I saw the inspector get the half-guinea in the way he has described it; the sailor was very particular in knowing the man in the dark.</p>
               <p>Q. He was quite sure of the man? - A. Yes, and he described him as the same man at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Edmonds's defence. I had been at the play along with George James, and after I had been to the play I called at Mrs. Stepner's house, in Fleet-street; I staid there till about a quarter past twelve; I could not go to my lodgings, I was locked out. Coming by this watering-house, I stopped there, and that young man came to us, with two or three more, very much in liquor; he forced his discourse to me, and asked me to have something to drink; I said I did not want to have any thing to do with him; he put his hand into his pocket, and took out the money, and put it in this hole; the landlord refused changing it, the money was returned, and he accused me of taking the money; I had a drab coat on when we were taken, and he said it was a blue coat. When I was stopped, I said, this man accuses me of having half a guinea; in the mean time, the prisoner Williams said I had nothing to do with it; the watch laid hold of him, and we all went to the watch-house together; the witness, James, will swear that I had been in his company the whole of the time; I never saw the prisoner Williams before in my life.</p>
               <p>Williams's defence. This sailor was very much in liquor; he was coming down Fleet-market, and two watchmen were dragging him to this watering-house-door; there was a cry of stop thief; I caught hold of this sailor, and the constable laid hold of me and the sailor.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Brant.) Where did you take Williams? - A. Higher up than Bartlet's buildings.</p>

               <p>Q. Had Edmonds been in company with the prisoner Williams at all, previous to taking the half-guinea? - A. He was not.</p>
               <p>Brant. This witness was the other man we took and turned out of the watch-house; there were five or six in the gang; the sailor had no charge against him.</p>
               <p>Court. (To James.) What are you? - A. I am a fishmonger, I live with Mr. Brown, of Leadenhall-market, I am his servant now; I clean fish, I am a weekly servant; I left the play at Covent-garden as soon as it was over, between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner live at the time this circumstance happened? - A. I cannot rightly tell; he was a glass-cutter.</p>
               <p>Q. You never knew who he worked with, nor never where he lived? - A. Not lately; I have known him about these twelve months; about six months ago he lived in Poppin's court, Fleet-street, I never visited him; I met him promiscuously going to the play at the top of Fleet-market, and we went to the play together.</p>
               <p>Q. In your way home from Covent-garden, how long were you going from Covent-garden to this house? - A. Not above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. To this watering house? - A. We were longer than that going there; we delayed the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do - this must be an hour after the play had finished, and you had got no further than St. Andrew's, Holborn, that will not take above ten minutes; I should be glad to know how you had been employing yourself? - A. We went into Fleet-street, to a court there, and got something to drink; then we went to No. 4, Bowling-alley, Chancery-lane; I was going home when I was turning up St. Andrew's hill, and we stopped at the watering house; we had not been at the watering house above two minutes, getting something to drink, when the sailor came up.</p>
               <p>Q. You had something to drink before? - A. We had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the man take the half-guinea out of his pocket? - A. No, I neither saw it handed in or out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did take it? - A. I cannot tell who took it, I did not see any half-guinea; I can swear Edmonds did not take it, he had hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Williams? - A. He was standing near the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him standing there? - A. I cannot say I did; my friend Thompson -</p>
               <p>Q. You have a friend Edmonds - does he go by the name of Thompson? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to talk of your friend Thompson, where was he? - A. I suppose he was a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your friend Edmonds at the time this half-guinea was lost? - A. My back was right against the pillar of the door, and he stood alongside of me; his arm had hold of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this man called out to some man taking his half-guinea? - A. He charged Edmonds; one was on one side of the door, and the other on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were within a yard of each other? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not charge Edmonds while he was standing at the corner? - A. He did not; Edmonds turned the corner, and then he sung out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you run? - A. I went up Bartlet's-buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Williams run the same way with Edmonds? - A. Williams stopped till after Edmonds run; Edmonds run first, and then the sailor run; I called out to him what do you run for; he said that man has got my half-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you call out to your friend, what do you run for? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did he make? - A. No answer at all; I was taken at the corner of Bartlet's-buildings, when I was standing there, some gentleman came and catched hold of me, he said, come along with me; I said, I will go quiet enough; he took me to the watch-house, we were all searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them then this man was at a distance? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go before the Justice? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you applied to about this business? - A. I had a subpoena to day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to your friend in prison? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not want a subpoena, you knew when the trial would come on; you do not know what this man's way of life is? - A. He was a glass-cutter.</p>
               <p>Q. That is only what you have heard him say; you do not know where he works? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he is only a casual acquaintance? - A. It is so.</p>

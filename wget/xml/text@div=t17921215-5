I knew them by the marks, I bred them myself; one of them I should have known by the marks among a thousand. They are called the right Berkshire breed; one had a particular mark in the ear; I marked it myself; I claimed these pigs. The prisoner at the bar lodged at Kensington gravel-pits; we enquired after him and found him before I went down to Hunsley; this was Wednesday. The prisoner at the bar said he had bought four pigs, and he said he had sold them on Tuesday morning at Brentford market. I had him up to Great Marlborough-street; and when we went back to Basewater, to his lodgings, we found out where the other four were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these pigs your's? - They were; there was one of a dark colour, and white stripe: they were all of my own breed. I should have known them among a hundred. I can positively swear to them; they were pigged in February last.</p>

               <p>I live in Gaggle-goose-green, in the parish of Hammersmith. I am a little gardener; five acres of ground I have and no more. I have lived there two and thirty years. The prisoner was with the other man that I bought the pigs of. I bought them on the 5th of November. I believe it was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning. I looked at them as they came along the road; but I told him I would not buy them till they came to the gravel-pits. They had ten pigs, and I bought six; I was to give him 7 l. 4 s. I paid him 7 l. all but one shilling; I had not enough. I borrowed some of the money. This man told me he had bought four pigs, and he was a going to put them in his stye, and I might leave mine there. I bought two first; but afterwards buying four more, I gave this prisoner a shilling to drive them off to my house, as I then thought it would be better. I saw no more of them till Mr. Winder come up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Hunsley, did I sell you any pigs? - No, I cannot prove you did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know Mr. Hunsley? - I was very willing to drive home the six pigs for a shilling, and a glass of gin; no man can think that I would have gone back with these pigs three miles, if I had known they had been stole; and I am as innocent as ever a man was born - worse luck of mine, I know that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you buy any pigs of him? - No, I had some pigs of his in my house, on Tuesday morning; when I was gone out to work, he brought four pigs, and said he would sell them me; and when I came back, I found some pigs; I saw him soon after, and he told me he had bought four pigs, and he would sell them to me, if I had a mind to buy them; I told him I had not money to buy them; so he asked me to let them be in the place where they were till Friday, and then he would pay me for their keep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you any price? - No, because I said I had no money to buy them; this was on Tuesday; on Wednesday night these two gentlemen came and asked whether I had bought some pigs, I said no; but told them there were four pigs, that were left in my premises, that the man would come on Friday and then take them to Smithfield. On Wednesday night he was taken and sent to Clerkenwell; I did not see him afterwards; I cannot say I knew where he lived; he told me he had bought them, or else I should not let him put them there; I had known the prisoner for some time; he drove Mr. Gray's team, and worked in Mr. Gray's Brickfield.</p>

               <p>I live at Southam-green; I was riding to Smithfield market, on the 5th of November, and overtook the prisoner at the bar and another man with him, with a parcel of pigs; on Tuesday before, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150010"></xptr>saw the man with a single pig at Brentford, a pig we all thought he had stole, he had got it in a sack; it was four miles and a half on this side of Acton; I did not say any thing to them; I told Mr. Winder, at Brentford market, what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That Gentleman never saw me at Brentford, nor any body else? - I did not say I did; I never saw you with my eyes before that morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I will tell you how I came to buy these pigs; I went down to Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, on Sunday; I have a sister that lives there; I got up on Monday morning to come home, and coming on this side of Acton, I overtook this man with ten pigs; and I am sure I had no more thought of buying a pig then of my dying day, he asked me to buy some; I asked the man what he would have for four pigs, he said six guineas; I said I would give 6 l. however says I, I will split the difference; gave him 6 l. 3 s. coming along we came up to this Mr. Hunsley, he bought a couple; but he said he had no where to put them; I said he might put them along with mine. Whilst I went to feed my pigs he bought the other four; and he gave me a shilling and a glass of gin, to drive them down to his house; I am sure if I had known they had been stolen I would never have drove them down to his house; I dare say Mr. Hunsley had no more thought of their being stolen than I had; when I bought them, there were all the neighbours about; I went down to the black lion at Basewater, and told them that I had bought four pigs; I made no secret of it at all.</p>

            . I am a watchman at Mr. Hall's wharf. On the evening of this present month I saw two men on the wharf at half past ten. I could not hear distinctly what they talked of. When they came nearer to me, one of them said, Damn him, he will not split. I suspected there were no good intentions by these words. They went down the steps to the vessel. While these two men were talking together, the prisoner made his appearance, walking too and fro upon the wharf, and about five minutes after the men had gone down to the vessel, the prisoner went into a shed, where the packages were stowed. I was placed in a situation where I could see him come out; he could not see me. In about three minutes after he come out with a package under his left arm, and in going round to the landing-waiter's box, going to the water-side, I came out, and went after him; I seized him by the right collar. I said friend, what have you got here? He said nothing, and instantly dopped the package. I said, what is it that lies here dopped down? He said he did not know; he was near stumbling over something. I then said, what was your business down here at all then. Do you know any thing of those men that went down the steps. He said, they came with him to go with the Gravesend boat. The Gravesend boat does not go from that place. They haul off there sometimes. I do not believe the tide served then. I sent for an officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of Dick's Hotel, Fleet Street—on 24th July Mr. Thompson came in with the two prisoners between 4 o'clock and 4.30 p.m.—they sat down in front of the bar and were supplied with about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of brandy and water, and port wine—I saw Mr. Thompson showing some notes to the prisoners and he tore one note up—part of it fell down on the bar floor and Ketcher picked the piece up and gave it back to him—the other pieces were in Thompson's hand—when he tore it up he simply asked the prisoners whether they wanted any money, they made no reply, and he put the pieces in his pocket—it is not true that he made either of them a present of any note—they both told me that he had a large amount of money in his possession, and asked me to take care of it; I refused; the amount was not mentioned—before I wont upstairs I gave directions to my barman.</p>

I had seen Mr. Thompson at my house three or four times before, but not with the prisoners—when I last saw him he was so intoxicated that I thought it necessary to tell my barman not to give him any more drink—he was kissing Ketcher and putting his arm round their Decks, and calling them his dearly beloved boys, and was patting Ketcher on the face; that was a common occurrence; I have seen him acting in an in sane way before; he was not intoxicated when he did that, he perfectly knew what he was about—he did not say anything when he tore the note up; he tore it in three—he had the others in his hand at the same time, loose.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On 26th July, I was on duty at the Bank of England, and was sent for to the secretary's office—the two prisoners were there—the clerk said that Mr. Thomson had stopped the note that morning, giving his address 171, Holland Road, Kensington—our clerk said that Ketcher gave the name of Phillips—Ketcher heard that and said "The note was given to me as he can prove," pointing to Eldon, at Mr. Baker's, Dick's Tavern; Thomson was drunk and he was tearing up bank-notes, and the note was given to me there by Mr. Thomson"—I asked how he accounted for the signature on it—"John Thomson, 21, Fentiman Road, Clapham"—he said "I did that"—he also said "I pointed Mr. Thomson out to a policeman in Fleet Street, knowing he was drunk, and he had about l,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his possession"—I took both prisoners to the station and found Mr. Thomson there, they were confronted with him about 2 o'clock, and I said to him "These two persons say you gave them the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note"—he said "I did not"—I said "Did you authorise them to put your name on the front of the note"—he said "I did not," they made no reply—they both referred me to Mr. Baker and said that what they had told me was the truth—I went direct to Mr. Baker—the prisoners were searched, but only three farthings was found between the two—I went to Ketcher's address in Hoxton Street, but found no money—Eldon gave his address, 90, High Street, Islington, and then 290—I went to two 90's and two 290's, but could not hear of him, and he said before the Magistrate that he had given me the wrong address—I found this piece of paper on Eldon, and said "Who is this for?"—he said "It is for Ketcher"—after the charge was read over at Bow Street they both repeated that the note was given at Baker's, and Ketcher pointed to Eldon and said "He was present at the time it was given."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. W. SLEIGH</hi>. When Ketcher referred to Eldon, Eldon said "Yes, I was there when the note was given."(<hi rend="italic">Note, read</hi>: "If the gentleman is really locked up get him out by all means and without a moment's delay. The fine for being tight will only be a few shillings, and 1 can do that, and if the old gentleman has gone astray before, then we must call in the assistance of a solicitor to advocate his cause; you will be repaid all the money you expend. Don't let the little man go wrong because I like him, and meet him almost daily at Chambers, or more correctly speaking I used to do so. He is a perfect gentleman, but unfortunately puts his hand up to his mouth too often. Mind, don't let him go to do seven days; I will, if necessary, pay expenses for the little fellow.") Eldon said that he had written that to be given to Ketcher.</p>

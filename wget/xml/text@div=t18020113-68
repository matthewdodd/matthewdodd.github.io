I said, yes, and called my aunt; she said, don't call your aunt, I will take them down; then she took the shoes down and gave them a little child, who went away with them; she kept saying to me, what's the matter with you, because I cried out; just as my aunt came up, the prisoner went away; I law her about a fortnight after going by the door, and I called my uncle, and told him; he went out and brought her back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you swear to me? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JEREMIAH SHRUBSOLE sworn. - I am uncle to the last witness, and pursued the prisoner: I asked her if she had bought any shoes at that shop; she said, what do you mean by that, what did I mean by stopping her on the King's highway; I told her she was accused of stealing some shoes, and she must go with me, she resused; an officer was sent for, who went to her lodgings, and while he was gone, I found she had a pair of velvet shoes on.</p>

I was passing on the 6th of February, and saw the gig and coat; a lad was minding it - I turned into another street, and soon after the prisoner overtook me, with the coat, and a pipe in his mouth; I followed him up Queen-street, and on to Golden-square - the lad who I had seen with the gig was following him: when they got into the square the other whistled - I then ran up to the prisoner, pushed him into a butter-shop, and had him secured; I asked where he got it - he said he had it given to him in Windmill-street - I collared him, and took him out; he ran away: I gave an alarm, and he was again taken.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 25th of January, between six and seven in the evening, I was in Shoreditch, near the Ship public-house; I observed the prisoner cross the road, he was by himself at the time he passed me; I perceived he had something under his coat on the left side, with his left arm supporting it, apparently to me; I followed him into Cumberland-street, and when I came nearer to him in Cumberland-street, he hastoned his pace; I ran forward, and collard him, and asked him what he had got; he said nothing. He scuffled with me, and this soap in the handkerchief as it is now, dropped from him at his feet. He scuffled with me a long time, and struck me several blows, and endeavoured to make his escape; I kept my hold. He denied stealing the soap, he said, he had bought it then. I was obliged to strike him a violent blow; I secured him. Where I took him was about a mile from the prosecutor's premises. This is the soap in the handkerchief that fell from him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday, the 25th of January, the prisoner was under examination at the office in Worship-street; I searched him at the office; I found these four cakes of soap concealed in his breeches, extended up under his smock frock. I sent for Mr. Nowlan; Mr. Nowlan came the next day, and knew the soap. This is the soap.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the soap, first look at that found by Barratt - A. I have seen it, I have no doubt it is my property; the other soap found by Armstrong, that is also my property. The prisoner had access to that soap; he was packing it that morning; I have not the least doubt it is mine; I wish I had.</p>

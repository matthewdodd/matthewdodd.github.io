I compared them with the Registers; they are correct—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—the prisoner was given into my custody on 30th Oct.—I told him he was given into custody for bigamy—he said, "It is not so"—he afterwards said, "The woman I am living with will not come up against me"—his first wife gave him into custody.</p>

I remember the prisoner being married on 24th Feb. to Johanna Shea, in St. Mary's Church, Paddington—I am sure the prisoner is the man; I know him well—Shea is now in her confinement, in Kensal New Town—the prisoner was living with her till he was taken—she was confined on 16th Nov., and cannot come here.</p>

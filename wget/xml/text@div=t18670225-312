I am a day watchman in the employ of the East and West India Dock Company, Fenchurch Street—about twelve o'clock on 15th February I saw Hadwin pass through our gates alone—previously to that I had seen him with Bowen—on 20th February I saw Hadwin pass through the same gate, about the same time—on the 21st I saw him pass in at another gate about the same time—in consequence of what I saw I made a communicatian to constable West.</p>

In consequence of information I re<lb></lb>ceived, on 22nd February I watched a urinal under an archway—about ten minutes past twelve I saw Hadwin walk down to the arch—he looked cautiously round, entered the urinal, and closed the door—about a minute afterwards Bowen came, he looked round, entered the urinal, and closed the door—I ran in and saw them close together and face to face—I caught hold of Bowen with my right hand—he <hi rend="italic">slued</hi> himself round and pulled his dress down—I said, "What have you here?"—he said, "Nothing, sir"—Hadwin shook himself and stroked his coat down—I caught hold of him with my left hand and said, "What have you here?"—he said, "Nothing, sir"—at the same time I felt a hard substance on his stomach—I called for assistance, and they were removed to the police-office on the premises—I searched Hadwin, and took from under his trousers this bag, containing this tea (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "How do you account for the pos<lb></lb>session of this?"—he said, "That man gave it to me," pointing to Bowen—Bowen said, "What! me? I know nothing about it"—the foreman of the warehouse showed me some packages of tea with the wooden lids off—Hadwin had no business on the premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman in this department—I believe Bowen has been in the service about twenty-eight years, on and off—on 22nd February he was engaged in the "house-room," and after that he was in a room where some tea was laid out for inspection—that tea was inside leaden cases in chests—he had to nail them up—those chests that we afterwards found open he had no business to touch—there were eleven of them—before he was put to do that work they had not been broken open—about twelve o'clock on 22nd February, from information I received, I examined the chests and found the leaden cases inside—some of them had been broken open, and a handful or two of tea had been re<lb></lb>moved from each—I compared the tea produced here with that, and found it to correspond—there is no such mixture of tea as this lying about the store-rooms.</p>

My wife let the prisoner a lodging on the 26th of March - he staid one week, and on the Friday following left without giving notice - he left the door locked and took the key. I had information that he was at his mother's, in Currier's-row, Doctors' Commons, and apprehended him there about a fortnight afterwards. I know nothing of him but by letting him and his wife in on the first night.</p>

            . I let the lodging on the 26th of March. I only saw his wife, not himself. I agreed to find her in every thing for 5 s. a week - they were to lodge in the back room first floor - they generally came in together at night - they were to have the use of the things stated in the indictment - they gave no notice of their going, but left the door locked, and I have not seen the key since - they had not paid any rent - she said her husband had lost his father, and he would pay on the week following. I opened the lodging on the Wednesday after they left and these articles were all gone - they had left some furniture behind - the prisoner was taken up about a fortnight afterwards - when I saw him at Bow-street, the woman he had cohabited with was there. I asked if he knew anything of my property - he said he did not.</p>

            . I had seen him there more than once. I have heard there were two persons in the room. I heard two persons in the room most nights when I came home - he never came to my house after the woman was gone. I never observed any other man but the prisoner come to her. I cannot find the woman. I found the prisoner at his mother's house - they took the room in the name of Davis - a man came on the following Monday after they were gone, and asked for a man of the name of Wright, a painter. I said no such person lived in my house.</p>

On the 11th of October a bill was in my window to let lodgings; the prisoner came between ten and eleven o'clock, and asked for a lodging, my wife called me down; he said he had seen the lodging and approved of it. I said I must have a week's money in advance. He said he had none, but could go to his employer's and get one or two pounds; he wrote his address, I was to go to his master at three o'clock he stopped about the place, I thought it strange; he asked the way to St. Giles's, which I shewed him. He left, and in five minutes I found him sitting in the parlour, my watch then hung over his head. I left him there for two minutes, and then met him at the door, my wife had him by the collar, and said the watch was gone; he denied having it, then gave it me from his pocket.</p>

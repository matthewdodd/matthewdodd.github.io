On the 9th of March the prisoner came, he said he wanted a watch key; he came again the next day, he said he wanted a watch key; I said you had one yesterday; he said he sold that, he got a pint of beer by that; I had missed some money, I suspected him; I marked twelve seven shilling pieces and four half guineas. On the 11th he came again, I went to a neighbour's, my lad came to me; I went to my shop and took the prisoner by the collar, and said that he had got some of my money; he denied it; I desired him to turn the money out of his pocket; he put his hand in his pocket and took out fourteen or fifteen shillings, he said is there any thing you can swear to; I said yes, there is two seven shilling pieces that I have marked, knowing that you would come; I said there was another; he said if there was, he had a wife and family, he hoped I would not hurt him; there was seven shillings for that. These are the two seven shilling pieces, I have kept them by themselves; I know they are my own seven shillings pieces by the mark.</p>
               <p>- GOODYEAR. I am a servant to the prosecutor. On the 11th of March the prisoner came for a watch key; I gave him the key; he said let me have a seven shilling piece, like that I had before to put at the bottom of a punch ladle; I shewed him the seven shilling pieces; after a bit I missed three of them; I then went and told my master, and he was apprehended.</p>

On 14th Feb., about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in plain clothes in Bishopsgate-street, and saw the prosecutor going towards Union-street, Spitalfields, walking steadily—I saw the prisoners come from Union-street, meet the prosecutor at the corner of Catharine Wheel-yard, and knock him down—they were coming in the reverse direction of the prosecutor—it was all in a minute, I did not hear any words pass—I saw them leave him—they walked away quietly as if nothing had happened—the prosecutor followed them, and I did the same, and kept them in sight to the borders of the county—I did not join the prosecutor till he called the other officer, and then we all crossed the road together—I suppose he was about twenty or thirty yards from me when I was walking after them—the prosecutor was nearest to the prisoners, and I behind him—the prosecutor told the officer he gave them in charge for knocking him down and robbing him—the prisoners crossed over towards the Walthamstow Coffee-house, and were just on the door step when we stopped them—Bridges then threw away a piece of money against the side of a house, and it fell down at my feet—I picked it up, and it was a bad shilling, which I produce—I searched Price, and found on him two sixpences, 2 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a duplicate—I was present when Bridges was searched, and saw a halfpenny, half a pennypiece which had been cut, and a medal stamped like a half-sovereign, found on him—I saw both prisoners strike Searing, and knock him down.</p>

            . In consequence of information, I went to Proud's lodging, in Augusta-court, Laurence-street, Chelsea, about eight or nine o'clock in the morning of the 10th December: he had been apprehended the day before - I was informed in the house that was his room, and I found some pieces of wood in a box, which his wife unlocked - I believe they are called beadings or mouldings; in the kitchen in which Cooper lived, I found some mahogany; in a cellar under the stairs I found a large quantity of wood chopped up for fire-wood - I found these three pieces in a closet in the parlour; Cooper was not at home, but I left word for him to come to Mr. Cubitt's - he came, I left word for him to come to Mr. Cuasked him about the property - he said he had the mahogany from a lodger of his, who owed him money; I think he mentioned the name, but I forget it - he said he had had it several months; I think he said nine months; he said he did not know how these pieces got in the closet, but there was a piece of oak cill there which he had from the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q.Why did not you bring the cill here? A.Because we had a great deal to bring; we have not ascertained that it was not Mr. Cubitt's - I think Cooper came in about four hours after I left word; it is a single round house - there is but one kitchen.</p>

            . I am in the service of Messrs. Cubitt's, the builders - Proud was in their service as a labourer, and Cooper was in their service till within three weeks or a month; I swear to these two pieces of mahogany, as belonging to Messrs. Cubitt's, and these two pieces of ash I can swear to; Proud said he never stole a bit of wood before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What are you? A. A clerk - I have nothing to do with manufacturing any wood; we did not miss any, but supposed wood to be stolen at different times - I can match these pieces of mahogany with some on the premises; I am certain that these pieces formed part of another plank cut from the same log as this plank - the whole log was in Mr. Cubitt's possession, and has not been cut four months.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TAPSON. I am in the employ of Messrs. Cubitt's - I make barrows. I know these pieces of ash they were in my possession; these form the leg of a navigator's barrow - these were one solid body at one time; this piece I have brought was taken out here - they match exactly.</p>

               <p>Prisoner PROUD. I know of nothing but the pieces of moulding, and the bits of ash - I took them to make hammer handles; they would not lend me their hammers. Witness. He never had leave to do that to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When had you seen them on the premises? A.Never, till they were found at the prisoner's- I never saw them at my master's.</p>
               <p>JOHN TIPPETT. I am a joiner, in the employ of Messrs. Cubitt's. I have some moulding planes, from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150098"></xptr>which I believe these pieces of moulding were formed - they fit exactly.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DENTRY. I am a sawyer to Messrs. Cubitt's. I sawed up this mahogany from a log on the 20th of August; these small pieces belonged to the same log as this plank does, I have no doubt.</p>

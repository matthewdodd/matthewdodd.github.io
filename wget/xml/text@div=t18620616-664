               <p>of horses' feet in front of me—shortly afterwards I saw the prisoner coming on horseback, driving another horse before him—I went up to him—he turned up a bye-lane opposite—I followed him, and stopped him—I asked him whose horses they were, and where they came from—he said, "Never mind; here I are"—I put the same question several times, and he made the same answer—I told him I was not satisfied, and he should not go any further till he satisfied me better—he then said he was going to take the horses to a public-house, Mr. Simpson's, at Edgware—I said I should go with him—he then jumped off the horse, and attempted to run away—I went after him, and took him—he began to cry, and said he was a d—d fool, he thought he should get away—he said if I would let him go, he would give me a shilling, and come to dinner with me on Sunday—on the way to the station he said he met a tall young man, who told him he had lost two horses, and if he found them, he would pay him—I asked him who the young man was—he said he did not know, nor where he came from—I asked him if he would tell me the truth—he then said that they belonged to Mr. Tomlin, of the Alma, at Harrow Weald—he was about a mile and a quarter from the Alma, coming from it—I gave the horses up to Mr. Oliver Tomlin, the son.</p>

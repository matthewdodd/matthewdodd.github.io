At a quarter to 12 o'clock on 28th April I went with Burchett, another constable, to Cranbrook Road, and there took the prisoner into custody for passing a counterfeit half-sovereign; on the way to the station his conduct was very violent—when, we got outside the station it required four men to take him in—he was placed in the dock—while he was in the dock I heard, Mrs. Dench call out "Knife, knife 1" and I saw this dagger (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the prisoner's hand; it was unsheathed—his hand was raised, and he said "The first man that touches me I will plunge this into his b——heart"—I went out then and saw nothing more.</p>

I accompanied Denton to the Cranbrook Koad—what he has stated with regard to the prisoner's conduct on his road to the station is true—he was placed in the dock—I heard Mrs. Dench call out "Knife I" and he drew a dagger and made a stab at me—I was right in front of him—he would have caught me in the middle of the chest if I had not stepped back—he said "You have had your way, I will have mine"—he then rushed at Simpson, another constable—he came out</p>

I was acting-sergeant at the station on 28th April—I assisted in taking the prisoner into the station—I did not see him draw the dagger—I heard the woman call out "Knife, knife!" and saw it in his hand, and he made a plunge at me; it would have caught me in the breast if I had not stepped back into the cell—before that I saw him make a stab at Burchett; how close he went to him I could not say, I was behind him—I heard him say "You have had your way, and I will have mine"—the stab was made with all his might.</p>

             sworn. - I am a carpenter; I work in the same neighbourhood; I had occasion to go to my master that I work for for some nails; as I was going past where the prosecutor was at work, I saw the prisoner at the bar go into the house; I knew him to be a suspicious character for years; I went a little way up the street, and made a stop; I kept my head towards him; I saw him come out of the house with the saws concealed under his coat, the handles were rather sticking out; I let him pass me, and then I ran into the house to see if any body was in the room where I saw him go into; seeing nobody in the room, I pursued him, and stopped him, and took the two saws from him, and brought him back to the house; an officer at the time was coming past, he was given in charge to the officer, but he would not take him in charge; he wanted us to use him ill and let him go about his business. I produce the saws, I have had them in my possession ever since. (The saws identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

            . I am a painter, and was employed by the prisoner at the prosecutor's. The prisoner gave me this picture in May last, and told me I might take and pawn it, or get what money I could on it, till he could get money from Mr. Phillips to pay my wages - I pawned that and two razors for 10s. close by where I lived; I redeemed it on the 13th of December, and took it to Mr. Bardingdon, in Wardour-street, where I offered it for sale for 2l. 10s.; I was taken the next day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know its value? A. No; I should not have thought it worth a quarter of what they say it is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Where did you receive the picture? A. At Mr. Phillips' door; I had no suspicion that it was stolen - I received it between six and seven o'clock in the morning, when I went to meet the prisoner; I never was in trouble before - I was taken on this charge, and confined forty days; as soon as I understood the picture was stolen, I told what I knew - I admit stating to the officer that I received the duplicate from the prisoner, but I did not know he was an officer; I thought there was something wrong, and I did not wish to bring the prisoner into trouble - I told the truth when I was taken into custody; I had a child by one Lambert; I was not brought up on account of forging a certificate of marriage - I did not produce to Lambert's mistress a printed from of a certificate of marriage; I was charged once with a rape, but I was not guilty.</p>

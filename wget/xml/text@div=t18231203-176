            . I live in Union-street, Somer's-town, and am out of employ. On the 5th of November, the prisoner came to me, and asked if I had sold my watch, for he could find me a customer; he took me to a public-house in <placeName id="t18231203-176-crimeloc964">Leicester-square</placeName>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 5th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner pawned this watch for 30 s., in the name of Weaver; he came in a great hurry, and said he was pulled up before the Magistrate, for driving furiously, and wanted the money to pay the penalty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an hotel keeper, in Annette-street, Minories, in the City of London—the prisoner has been in my employment—he was employed in the kitchen to clean knives—he left me without any notice on the 13th, I think; I cannot remember the date, it was two Saturdays ago—when he left me my cash-box was in his bedroom on the table—it had been taken from my drawers in the parlour—I had left the key in the drawers, by mistake—the box was broken open and the money gone, and a gold watch and key were gone—I think there had been about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I cannot tell exactly—there was also a gold pin, a revolver, and some razors in the drawers—I did not find them any more—I subsequently received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the prisoner—I have seen him write—I cannot say whether it is his writing—I have seen him writing, but I never looked particularly—I believe it to be his writing because it is the same as his talking; it is bad Italian—I saw him the night he was arrested, and when I went to take him he ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and reside at Aldgate-street, City—on last Monday fortnight, about 12 o'clock, I was at Mr. Maggi's house—I saw the prisoner there—he said to me, "Don't drink too much water, perhaps it will make you ill"—he spoke Italian—he said, "That vagabond, Mr. Maggi, he owes me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I can prove that; I have here a letter written, if he don't pay me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will shoot him with a pistol that I took from him"—he showed me the letter—I have seen it since—it was the one I saw at the Mansion-house—he said, "I will send this letter at 4 o'clock, and at 12 o'clock at night I will go to Mr. Maggi for the answer"—he said he would send one letter to Mr. Maggi and one to the cook—I was at Maggi's when he said that.</p>

I live at 3, Neptune-street, St. George's-in—the East—I saw the prisoner on Monday fortnight, in company with the last witness—the prisoner said that he had left Mr. Maggi's house, and that he had taken away a pistol, and had a letter which he would send to Mr. Maggi, and to the cook; and that Mr. Maggi was to pay him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if he did not pay him the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the pistol he had taken would serve him out, and should he be condemned in England he would lose nothing by it, because he had already been condemned by the authorities in France, in the galleys he showed me a letter—this is it—it is spotted over.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am an optician, of 44, Selby-street—on Monday fortnight, about 8 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner—he said, "Good morning!" and said that he had been robbing Mr. Maggi—I asked him of how much, and he said, "A pound, a shilling, and a brooch," and that he had pawned the brooch for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then went away to my work—I knew the prisoner before, as servant at Mr. Maggi's house (<hi rend="italic">A translation of the letter was here read as follows</hi>:—"To Mr. Maggi—You are aware that I am tired of you, because you kept me too much like your slave, and I have suffered too much from you. I have taken one pound and one shilling from you because 1 believe to be able to get more; therefore;</p>

               <p>my dear Maggi, if you value your own life, you must give 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the cook who will remit them to me, as I have merely given him a letter. He knows nothing about the matter; and if you do not have those 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me which must serve to my purpose in leaving London, it will cost you very dear, because you are an infamous fellow; and if you do not do what I tell you, you must know that a pistol of seven knots, a revolver, will be for you, and for your policeman, if you dare to bring and to send me to prison, knowing that I have fled from Cayenne, where I have been condemned twenty years; therefore if England gets me I do not lose very much, but have the satis<lb></lb>faction of having saved the world of a rogue, who is guilty of so much infamy to his wife and to his children. Give then those 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. quickly to the cook to take them to the place whence this was written; if not, I shall find you in the hotel or in the shop, and look out for you till I find you.".</p>

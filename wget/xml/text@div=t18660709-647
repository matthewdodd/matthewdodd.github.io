                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Ward, biscuit maker, Commercial Road—I live at 52, Dean Street, with my father—I remember a hogshead of sugar being delivered to my master—I cannot exactly say when, I think about five weeks ago—it was the day I went before the magistrate—some boys were scraping some fragments of sugar from the hogshead—the prisoner was there—I went out two or three times and</p>

               <p>told them to go away—the last time I went out prisoner ran a knife into my side—I cannot remember that he said anything before he stabbed me—I did not push him before—I did not fall down—I didn't know that I was stabbed at first—they took me to a chemist close by, and then to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—the prosecutor was brought to the hospital on 15th June—I examined him, and found a small punctured wound in the side—it was bleeding pretty freely—I did not examine any further—we never do wounds about the groin—he was confined to his bed for some days—I did not examine whether it was a deep wound—we should be afraid of injuring the parts—a small knife would do it—he is now perfectly recovered.</p>

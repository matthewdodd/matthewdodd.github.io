            ? - I have known her ever since I have been nine years of age. I see her yesterday and to day; she is here now. I was present on the 2d of March 1789, at White-chapel Church, where the prisoner and she were married, and I dined with them that day afterwards. She has been parted from him three years the 23d of next November.</p>
               <p>Q. But they lived together after their marriage, as man and wife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe the marriage was not a happy one on their part, they disagreed a great deal? - Very little till lately.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe she ran away with all the goods? - She did not go away with all the goods, with a few of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is this lady? - Sixty-five next May.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a very old man, turned of sixty? - I cannot say that; he was a very good looking man when she had him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a black-lead manufacturer. The prisoner was in my employ as a packer—on the 11th of March I sent him to Mr. March, for some labels—he was to pay for them—I gave him a sovereign and j written order to get them—on the following morning he produced the labels with this bill and receipt, with Mr. March's name to it—I should have required a similar receipt to this from him on his return.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner came to me, on the 11th of March, and brought an order from his master, in consequence of which I delivered him 15,000 labels—I did not receive any money from him fort hem—I knew him as the servant of Mr. Oakley, as he had been before—the upper part of this bill is mine, "15,000 bills, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." but this "Paid, J.

Q.</hi> I believe it was paid shortly afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the prisoner called on the 4th of April, and paid it—he has been in the habit of getting things before on three or four occasions, and on one occasion he paid for some goods which he had had when he gave orders for others.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

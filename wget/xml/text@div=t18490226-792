                  </hi>. I was in the employ of Frederick Meyer, a lard-refiner, at his warehouse in High-street, Camberwell. I swear to one of these bladders (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) by this little hole in the top—it is Mr. Meyer's property—they were safe on Saturday evening at half-past five o'clock when I left, and locked up the warehouse—I missed them on the Monday, also a keg of lard, which I have seen at the station—the place was broken open, and they had got over a wall.</p>

On Monday morning, about half-past six o'clock, I saw the prisoner stop in Nelson-street, Camberwell, to put something which he had on his back into a truck—I went up; he appeared to be going to make water against a wall—he instantly walked away—I looked into the truck, and saw a sack—I opened it, and saw a bladder of lard—the prisoner stood with his back in a doorway—I stopped at the corner, and in a minute or two he came back to the truck—I caught hold of him, and asked him where he was going—he said, to his work—I said, "Who is your matter?"—he said, "Mr. Smith"—I said, "Mr. Smith, the dustman?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I shall take you into custody, for stealing the sack"—he said, "What sack?"—I said, "That sack in the truck"—he said, "You can only take me on suspicion"—I took him to the station, and the sack, with the bladder of lard in it—the warehouse is in the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly an officer in the 100th and the 28th Regiments, and am now retired—I was acquainted with a Miss Amelia Beeston, an aged lady, who consulted me as to the manage<lb></lb>ment of her affairs—at the latter end of 1876 I saw the prisoner with reference to some claim that Miss Beeston had against a person named Edwards—in the month of November I sent a letter to the prisoner and told him that as I was conversant with the whole circumstances I would myself take out a summons in the County Court at Islington, and prepare the affidavit, that he might have no trouble in the case until it was called on for trial—I accordingly did take out a summons on behalf of Miss Beeston against Edwards for the sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which she alleged he retained in trust for her—I prepared the evidence in the case—<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., I traced the money, which Edwards denied having received from this old lady, to the account of a lady of the name of Edwards—I after<lb></lb>wards discovered that that lady was Edwards's mother, and so traced the money home to Edwards; which matter I communicated to the prisoner in writing—he was at that time carrying on business as a solicitor at 42, Barnard Street, Russell Square—there was no name on the door or any indication of business being carried on there—I instructed him in the matter of Beeston and Edwards, and he carried out my instructions—</p>

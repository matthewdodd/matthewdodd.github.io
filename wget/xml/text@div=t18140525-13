I saw through the window the prisoner take a ham. I catched him when he came outside of the door. I saw him go in the shop first; he had nothing with him then; he came out with the ham. I catched him by the collar, and asked him what he was going to do with the ham. He said nothing at all. I pushed him into the shop, and told him to put it back again.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you pushed him into the shop was there any body in the shop - A. Nobody at all. I called Mr. Hodgson. I live near Mr. Hodgson. Mr. Hodgson came into the shop from a parlour behind. When Mr. Hodgson came I told him this man had taken a ham. The man dropped the ham down; I picked it up. Mr. Hodgson sent for an officer; he was taken to the watchhouse. Mr. Hodgson had the ham. That is all I know. There was a lamp in the shop. I saw the prisoner take the ham from the left hand side of the shop.</p>

             HODGSON. I am a cheese-monger, the corner of Great Queen-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect this night when the witness called you out - A. Yes; I was in the back parlour; I was called out with a loud voice. When I came in the shop, I found the prisoner and Mr. Parsons; they were both standing in the shop. The prisoner must have come into the shop to get at the hams; they were on the stall board, or shelf, in the window near Drury-lane. I had seen the hams there a short time before. There were three hams in the window, and two were missing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much intoxicated; whether I knocked the ham down with my elbow, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

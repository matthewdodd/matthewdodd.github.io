I then caught hold of him with my right hand, and gave him a very hard blow on the head with my left hand; then another man (who I had not seen before) came up from the wall, and said</p>
               <p>"Bl - t. you we will have your money;" they then both caught hold of me and threw me down on my back. I am certain the prisoner is the man. I kicked at them, and beat at them as hard as I could. I saw another man standing on the edge of the pavement about five yards off, whether he was concerned I cannot say, but they all ran away together.</p>
               <p>Q. When they got you down, what did they do - A. Before they could get at my money, they hove me about, my apron string broke, and they got my money out of my pocket. I got up and missed my hat. I looked about for it, and before I could find it, they were gone with my hat, apron and all; they had dragged me along till my waistcoat was torn off. I had a half-crown, three shillings, four penny-pieces, and ten half-pence, in my pockets, they took it all. I lost my hat and apron, and handkerchief out of my inside coat pocket. I hallooed out murder twice - they then ran away; one said to the other</p>
               <p>"Come on, come on." I hallooed out when they were both on me; they gave me no blows, only knocked the skin off my back, by throwing me down; they caught hold of me and hove me up at arms length, and both came on me, the third man ran away with them; he is the man who said</p>
               <p>"Come along"; he said that when I cried out, and away they all ran in a moment. I lost sound of them before I could get up, or I should have followed them. I looked about a little, and told one or two watchmen of it; they said it was a wonder they had not heard or seen something of it. I lost them for that night, and on the Thursday morning following, I had been to the Borough-market to look after them, as they appeared men who lay about the markets, and about a quarter before seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner and two more sitting asleep in the first recess on London bridge, nearest to the Borough, on the right hand side; I walked backward, and forward, looking at them, and was almost a mind to take the hat off the prisoner's head myself, I got up by the side of him, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160024"></xptr>noticed the hat he had on, and knew it to be mine by a cut and a hole in front of it, I went to the bridge-keeper and described my hat, and he went up and took it off his head, and said in his presence,</p>
               <p>"This is your hat sure enough" and gave it into my hand; and the prisoner went to snatch it from me, and said he had bought it on the Thurs day before, in Rosemary-lane, of a Jew. I had not lost it then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the day - A. Yes, he said he bought it last Thursday, and this was on Thursday; I had not lost it till Sunday. I am certain he is the man, I should have known him if I had not found my hat on him, by his appearence, and a striped plaid jacket which he had on at the time, I firmly believe him to be the man; if I had not found my hat I should be of the same opinion; the other two made off directly. The bridge-keeper took the prisoner, and one of them was a little like one who was with him, but I was not certain of him, he had a black coat and waistcoat on, and was like the man who said " Bl - t. you I will have your money." I am convinced the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. If you had not found your hat, and met the prisoner at York, should you have said he was the man who robbed you - A. Yes; I saw his person by the light of the gas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear to him before the Magistrate from the hat and his jacket - A. Yes; and his person too. I have a perfect knowledge of him without the hat or jacket. I first said I knew him because of the hat and jacket. The Alderman asked if I should know him without them; I said Yes, I could swear to him because I saw him by the gas light, and had a good look at him.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were positive of him, why not say you knew his person - A. Because they did not ask me immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife talked to you about being out late on that night; did she not ask you to account for the money you should have brought home - A. No; I always gave her a sovereign, and had been home and given it to her at half-past seven o'clock. I went out afterwards to meet a young man who was coming from the country, but he did not come. I had 7 s. 9 d. I was to meet him at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you doing from that time till two o'clock - A. I had a pint or two of beer and some tobacco - I had four pints of beer in all that night. By his appearance I thought him a chap who lays about the markets.</p>

            . I am keeper of London-bridge. On Thursday morning, the 29th, about seven o'clock, the prosecutor came and gave me some information. I was at the south end of London-bridge, and saw four men and a woman in a recess; he pointed the prisoner out to me, and pointed to his hat, which I took off, but before that the prosecutor had described it particularly; and when I took it off he said it was his (the prosecutor's). The prisoner said he had bought it in Rosemary-lane eight or ten days before, for 1 s. - that is what he said at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say at the moment - A. He said he was sure it was not the prosecutor's. I said I must take him; he said he would go any where. The prosecutor said he was the man - he really believed he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prosecutor said the hat was his, what became of the two other men - A. They all went out of the recess, and were gone when I returned, but I did not see any of them run away. I cannot say whether they ran or went away leisurely. I have had the hat ever since - it is broken in several places, and has no lining.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He did not say he saw the man who robbed him, but he had seen a hat, which he thought was his, on a man on the Bridge - A. Yes, that is what he said. He spoke to the man's person at the watch-house. There is no maker's name in the hat, nor any marks but cuts and holes.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. When he came to you did he say there was a man who had his hat, or a man who had robbed him - A. He said there was a man who had got his hat, and he believed the same man who had robbed him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You swear to the hat - A. Yes; it had a yellow silk lining, and the maker's name in it when he lost it; they are out now, but I know it by a cut in the corner - I saw him cut it with one of his tools when he was at work. He came home without one, and with his waistcoat all torn. He does not generally stop out late, except when he is out all night, and he has not done that for the last two or three years.</p>

            . It is my hat, I cut it when I was at work on the floor, to make the door shut - my wife saw me do it; this hole was made by reaching it off the hook - it had a lining in it when I lost it, with the maker's name,</p>

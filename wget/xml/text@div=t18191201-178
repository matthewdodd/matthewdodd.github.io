On the 3d of November the prisoner called in the morning to know if we advanced money on woollen cloth? I said we did. He came about an hour or two after with two pieces of woollen cloth (as I thought) under his arm - the number of the cloth was on the paper, and the length marked - it was forty yards. I opened the paper, and unrolled it about a quarter of a yard, and examined the quality of the cloth. I asked him the quantity? he said about forty yards; that he himself was the manufacturer, that his name was

            , and his manufactory was at Frome. I asked him how much would answer his present purpose? he said about 6 l. would be quite sufficient - he warranted each to measure forty yards at least, and said he made and measured them. I did not measure them, as if they had been of that length they would have been worth more. I advanced him six 1 l. notes on the two pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of his coming again, had you occasion to examine these cloths - A. Yes. I unrolled a piece, and found the first four or five yards was cloth, then three yards of green baize, and under that a hollow wooden cylinder. The cloth and baize were worth 23 s. It had the appearance of a roll of cloth, list was fastened at each end to give it that appearance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. Do you advance money without measuring things - A. Frequently. He did not say he was sent by any one with it.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD stated to the Jury, that he was instructed to inform them that the prisoner had been made the dupe of another person, he being a stranger to the tricks of town.</p>

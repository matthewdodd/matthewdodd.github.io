I met the prisoner in Devonshire-mews, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening; I was with him till half past eleven, when I went into the public-house at the corner of the Mews. I had two 1l. notes when I met him - I changed one - We supped together; I spent 9s. 6d. - I was sober. I found it was too late to go home, the prisoner said I should sleep with him. I went with him to the Mews in Upper Montague-street, which belongs to the prisoner's father - He looked up, and said he could not get in - We agreed to lay in the stable. I fell asleep; I awoke at two o'clock, and found the prisoner's hand in my pocket-the half-guinea was wrapped in the 1l. note in the pocket. I laid hold of his hand; he made his escape with the money out of the window - I ran after him, but could not find him. About six weeks afterwards I met him - He said, if I would not mention it, he would get me the money by eight o'clock; I let him go; he did not bring it to me, and was taken up about eight weeks afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph William Snell, a wholesale boot and shoe maker, in Mount-terrace, Whitechapel. The prisoner was in my service for five days—I told her to go away, and saw her cording her box up to go away—I felt the weight of the box, and that excited my suspicion—I wished to open it—she said I had no business to open it without a police<lb></lb>man, that she was an honest servant—I said if she would not open it I would send for a policeman—she then opened it, and I saw a shift of mine, then a night gown of my daughter's, and two sheets cut up in pieces, and a pair of stockings—I sent for a policeman, and when he came, the prisoner said she wanted to go into the yard—I observed something bulky about her, and the policeman took this shawl from her person—these are all my husband's.</p>

I was called in by the pro<lb></lb>secutor—I observed something like a bundle behind the prisoner—the prisoner said she wanted to go into the yard—I said I would not allow her to go, but I turned her round and took this shawl from under her gown—she said she did not know how it came there.</p>

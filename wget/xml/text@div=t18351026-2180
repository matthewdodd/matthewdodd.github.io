                  </hi>. I am a poulterer, and live in Rupert-street. I lost a cart, on the 19th of October, from Fann-yard, Berwick-street, where I used to keep it—the prisoner was quite a stranger—I was told that it was him who took it—I saw him on Monday afternoon—the 19th was on saturday, I think—I asked him where the cart was that he took away—he said he Knew nothing about it—I gave him into custody, and then he said, if I would not be hard with him, the cart should come home the same night, it was only lent for a job—the policeman accompanied me over the water, to where he said the cart was—James Ball had it over the water, for a job—we went there and found it.</p>

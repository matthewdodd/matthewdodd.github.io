On the 23rd of June I lost three salt-spoons, which raised my suspicion; and on the 29th I went into the plate-room, and while I was counting the plate up the prisoner came down and told me he was very sorry, but he had taken twenty-two table-spoons and pawned them, and had the duplicates in his box, at the top of the house; while I was speaking to Mr. Fenton he went up, brought the duplicates down, and, in his confusion, dropped them - they were picked up and given to me.</p>

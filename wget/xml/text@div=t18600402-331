                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Weston, a stationer in Rathbone-place—On 3d March, the prisoner came to the shop—I served her with some note paper which came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; she gave me a sovereign—I gave her in change a half-sovereign, and some silver, and copper—I am sure the half-sovereign I gave her was good—I had examined it before I gave it her—when I put the money down she asked me the price of some pens which were in the window, and while I was turning round she said, "This half-sovereign is cracked"—I don't know whether the half-sovereign that I gave her was cracked or not, but it was good—the half-sovereign she gave me was light, and a bad colour—I observed that directly I told her it was bad—the half-sovereign I had given her was the proper weight, and it was of the average darkness of colour—I sent for my husband and gave him the half-sovereign—I had not been to the cash-box before I gave that half-sovereign to my husband—I had not put any other half-sovereign in.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—I was called into the shop by her on 3d March, and got from her a counterfeit half-sovereign—I saw the prisoner in the shop—my wife said that she had laid the change for a sovereign on the counter, and she had turned round to see for some pens and the prisoner said on her turning back with the pens</p>

               <p>"I don't like this half-sovereign"—I had the half-sovereign in my hand, and I said to the prisoner, "Where is the good half-sovereign that my wife gave you?"—the prisoner advanced towards me and said, "Let me look at it;" and she appeared very anxious to get it out of ray hand—I persisted in refusing to let her have it—I got a constable and gave him the half-sovereign—he took the prisoner in custody, and she succeeded in taking the half-sovereign from his hand—I had looked at the cash-box that day—it might have been an hour and a-half or two hours before—there were then three good half-sovereigns in the box; only three—I always examine money and test it in some way before I put it in my cash-box—only Mrs. Weston and myself had access to the cash-box—within the last two hours before this occurred, no half-sovereign had been put in or taken out of that cash-box.</p>

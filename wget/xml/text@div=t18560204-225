                  </hi>. I am a pianoforte maker, and live at No. 16, Stan<lb></lb>hope-street, Hampstead-road. On 26th Dec., between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was going home, along Little Charles-street—I had taken a little refreshment—I knew what I was about, I could walk very well—as I was going along, a party came behind me; I could not say who they were, there were six or seven of them; one jumped upon my back with his knees in my kidneys, and knocked my hat over my eyes—another seized me by the throat, and I felt fingers in my ears—I had a gold watch suspended by a gold chain—the chain was not round my neck, it was hung by my button<lb></lb>hole; the watch was in my waistcoat pocket—it was secure before these persons came up; I had this Macintosh on, buttoned up, and a button was torn off to get at the watch—they took the watch out of my pocket, and in taking it I grasped the chain; it was cut, and what they cut it with ran into my hand—I have part of the chain here—this small link remained in my hand in the blood—I have the mark in my hand now—my watch was taken away, I have never seen it since—I had seen both the prisoners in the King's Arms public house when I was there—I had been in the King's Arms, in Edward-street, New-road, or Regent's-park—it runs out of Osna<lb></lb>burg-street—it is within 300 yards of where this happened—I did not see from what part the persons came—I cannot say that the prisoners are two of them—I gave information at the police station that same evening—I afterwards saw Saunders at the station, and identified him as one of the men I had seen in the King's Arms about ten minutes before I was robbed—I was there about an hour—I could not say that they were there all that time; I cannot say how long I saw them there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Robinson Coppin, of No. 9, Munster-square, Regent's-park. On 26th Dec. last, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I saw from six to seven persons round the prosecutor, in Little Charles-street—the prisoners are two of them—I saw Everson jump on Mr. Walker's back, and I saw Saunders come away from Mr. Walker with part of a guard chain hanging through his fingers—I saw it, it looked like a gold watch chain; it was in his left hand—I said to him, "You have got that man's watch"—I repeated it three times—he made no answer, but turned his head on one side, and went round the square—I saw some of them, I can<lb></lb>not say which, knock the prosecutor's hat over his eyes; I should say there were full eight of them surrounding him—I had seen Saunders before in the neighbourhood—I am sure the prisoners are two of the men.</p>

               <p>part of a guard through his fingers as he drew his hand back—Mr. Walker's hat was knocked over his eyes, but I could not tell who did it—I have seen Saunders before, but do not remember seeing Everson till the day of the robbery—I am quite sure that they are two of the men.</p>

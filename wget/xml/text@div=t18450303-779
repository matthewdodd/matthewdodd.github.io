                  </hi>. I live with my father, in King's Bench-walk, South<lb></lb>fark. On the afternoon of the 11th of Feb., about three o'clock, I was at Lowroan's-pond, showing my watch to a boy—another boy, who was a stranger, and who is not here, came up to me, and said, "Is not that a pretty little watch?"—I said, "Yes"—he" said, "Come up stairs, and ibow it to my mate"—I went into the house, and up into a room there—Carter and the other three prisoners were there—I had not known either of them before—I showed my watch to Carter—I held the seal in my hand, and he had the watch—he gave it a pull, which pulled the seal from me—he gave the watch to Emery, she gave it to Duffield, and she gave it to Emery back again—I did not see any more of it, but another little boy said he saw her give it to Carter—I asked all the prisoners for the watch, and they all hallooed out that it was gone, and they all laughed—Carter came down, and 1 followed him—he went back to the house, and told the other little boy to come down—soon after, Carter came down, and 1 followed him to Rowland Hill's chapel, and there gave him in charge r-thia is my watch—I am sure of it.</p>

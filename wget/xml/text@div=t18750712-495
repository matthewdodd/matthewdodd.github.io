I keep the Prince Alfred, Haynes Street, Battersea—on Saturday, 5th June, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I saw the prisoner served with half a pint of id. ale; I stood by—he tendered a shilling—I took it up; it was bad—I gave him the change just to prove that it was passed, and then I said "I shall detain you for giving a bad shilling to see whether you have any more"—I fastened him in the compartment and sent for a constable—he said "Let me go; that is the only one I have, and I took it from my sick club"—I gave him into custody with the shilling, which I marked.</p>

On the 17th of October I was coming to town to attend the funeral of my son, and met the prisoner on the other side of Barnet - He was standing in the road, and said he was going to town - I said I was going there also, and we walked together. As we went along he pulled out a handkerchief, and offered it to me for 1s. - I bought it of him out of charity, as he said he was in distress. I pulled out my purse, which had 30s. in it, to pay him - He said I had got some money. On arriving at Barnet we had a pint of beer. When we got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280006"></xptr>through Whetstone, we came on the road towards Coneyhatch, he said there was a public-house down the road, that he knew the person, and we could have a good bed there-it was then between six and seven o'clock; he said it was the sign of the Orange-tree. I found it was a long way, and said we might as well have gone to Highgate - He said he knew a short road, which would take us to Highgate. When we got on Finchley Common, as I was getting over some rails I fell down and hurt myself, I fell backwards into a ditch - I was quite sober. He came to me - I thought he was going to help me up, but he rolled me over, and said, "Your money, or your life!" He held me down, unbuttoned my breeches-pocket, took out my purse, and ran away - He also took my stick, and left me his. I got up, got into the road as well as I could, and told the patrol what had happened, as well as I could, for I could hardly speak, and he went in search of the prisoner. In about an hour he brought the prisoner in custody to me at a public-house where I waited. They brought my stick to me, I knew it to be mine. They then took me into a room, and told me to shake hands with the man. I went up to him, and said, "Old friend, you did not think of seeing me again so soon." I knew him to be the man. When he was with me he had a smock-frock on, but it was off when he was brought to me. He had told me he was quite broken down.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol on the Finchley-road. The prosecutor came up the road, he appeared as if he could hardly speak. He gave me this account, and I went in pursuit of the man, who he said had taken 30s. and had taken his stick by mistake. I rode about a mile and a quarter, and met Ford. In consequence of information we went about a quarter of a mile, and overtook the prisoner just by the Wellington public-house, going towards town. I asked him where he came from? he said from St. Alban's. I asked him what he had done with his smock-frock? he said he had had none on. I asked him if he had been near Coney-hatch? he said No. I told him if he put his hand to his pocket I would shoot him. As I was taking him to the public-house he said he had a smock-frock. I asked him what he had under his arm? he said, they were his things-(it was the smock-frock.) I found a canvas bag on him, containing 31s. 6d. in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences. We fetched the prosecutor to the Wellington, public-house, and showed him a stick which the prisoner had, he claimed it immediately. I then took him into the room where the prosecutor was, with six other men, and told him to shake hands with the man who had robbed him - He immediately went up to the prisoner, and said, "Ah! is that you?"</p>

            . I am inspector of the patrol. I met Ford and Rice, and they told me what had happened. About a minute before I had seen a tall man, and told them where he went to. I went back with them, we stopped the prisoner, and took him back-they have spoken correctly.</p>
               <p>DAVID LITCHFIELD re-examined. My money consisted of half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences - I do not know how many there were of each. The bag in which the money was found is not mine. I cannot swear to the money-it is about the same sum as that which I lost, The stick is mine, I have had it above a year-there is a notch in it to mark a yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from St. Alban's to buy some goods-the patrols took me, and I said I was going to town. They asked me if I had not been to Colney-hatch? I said I had not. I told them there was a smock-frock in my bundle - They took my purse and money. I never saw the prosecutor.</p>

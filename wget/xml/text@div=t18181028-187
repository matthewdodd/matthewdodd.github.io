On the 19th of September, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was returning from my pay-table, I met the prisoner Jones, in Charles-street, and went with her to her lodgings. In about ten minutes I missed two 1l. notes out of my breeches-pocket, which were there when I went into the room-nobody but us were there. I called the watch, and the prisoner, Griffiths, came to the door, and tried to break it open-he said he was a watchman - I refused to let him in. He got in at the window, and opened the door for the girl to escape - He pulled her from me. We scuffled together, and all three fell. I saw his hand under me, taking something from her - He ran away; I gave the girl in charge. I have never recovered my notes.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard a noise, went to the house, and saw Griffiths come out; he said there was a man in the house who had been robbed - I found the prosecutor in the room, he gave Jones in charge, she denied it. I searched the room but found nothing.</p>

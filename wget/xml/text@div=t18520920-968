                  </hi>. I keep a public house at Deptford. It is my dwell<lb></lb>ing house, and is in the parish of St. Paul, Deptford—on 20th Sept the pri<lb></lb>soner and some other persons were in my skittle ground—when I cleared the skittle ground, about a quarter past 12 o'clock, they went away—I had seen the prisoner before: he left the house loitering behind, when the three young men who had been with him went away—after I had searched that no one was in the house, I went to bed—before I went to bed, I myself fastened the whole house, both doors and windows—about a quarter past 6 in the morn<lb></lb>ing, I was called up by my sister in law—she sleeps in the back room looking into the yard—I went to a back window which looks into a back yard—I saw the prisoner in the yard in the act of unbolting a door which leads into a smaller yard, and there is another door which leads from that smaller yard into a public passage, which leads into the street—I ran downstairs, and found the door open at the top of the cellar stairs which I had fastened the night before—I found five bottles, three of which were broken standing on the steps of the back door—one of the bottles was filled with gin—the pri<lb></lb>soner had opened the door leading to the public passage—I went after him, and overtook him—I asked him what he had been doing in my yard before my house was open—he appeared to be intoxicated, and said, "I have been tossing him for a pint"—I left him, and went back to my house, and saw besides the bottles of spirits that there was other property missing—I missed from the till about ten shillings—there was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in sixpences, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cop<lb></lb>per, and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in three packages of copper, from the mantelpiece in the bar parlour, and about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. loose, which stood on a hydrometer, I found the chief part of the hydrometer was gone, and some cigars, and two six<lb></lb>pences and a shilling from a desk—the house had been entered by a back</p>

On the morning of 20th September, about five minutes before 7 o'clock, I was on duty in the Broadway at Deptford—the prosecutor came to me, and I went with him to a public-house—I saw the prisoner, and told him to come with me to the station—he said he would—I took him to the station, and found these things on him—he said he knew nothing about the property; it was put in his pockets—he was not sober.</p>

                  </hi>. The prosecutor is my brother-in-law. I was awoke that morning by a noise, and I awoke my brother—it was about a quarter before 6 o'clock—I have a watch at my bed, and I looked at it, as I have to get up a little before 6 every morning—I am quite certain it was before 6 when I heard the noise—it was a noise as if some person had fallen from a window, as if he had got up, and fallen back from the window under mine—I heard some bottles break, and smelt some rum—I went to the window—I did not go to bed again, but I staid in the room five or ten minutes—I was too much frightened to go out immediately after I had seen a man in the yard—I waited about five minutes in the room before I went to my brother, not more—when I looked out, I saw the prisoner standing under the window, with his hands in his pockets, talking to himself; I then went to my brother—this is my signature to this deposition—it was read over to me.</p>

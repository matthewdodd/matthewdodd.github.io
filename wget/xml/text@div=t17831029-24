               <p>Court. What did you find? - We found a cutting engine and this instrument, I do not know what it was, it was fixed to the side of the cutting engine, there was a couple of bits of cork, and some scowering paper in this place that looked like a kitchen, I went to the house again on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Court. How long did you stay in the house that first time? - I suppose three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you all go away together? - No, Jealous, Carpmeal, and I, were sent to the house were we heard Wilson lodged, in another part of the town, Clarke staid; we went and found the woman that went for Mrs. Wilson, we asked for Mr. Wilson, she said, he was gone out, she did not know where.</p>
               <p>Where were these lodgings? - Somewhere near Brook's Market, I cannot tell the name of the street; we searched these apartments and found nothing in them; then we went back to the house in Tennis Court, and we found Wilson in custody of Clarke; then we got this cutting out press and the other things into a coach, and brought the prisoner to Bow-street, and the things to Clark's house, and Wilson was committed, this was on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Court. When you went out did you fasten the door? - It was locked I believe: On Monday we went to New Prison and found a man of the name of Rowe, in company with Mr. Wilson, and his wife in the gaol, we took Rowe into custody and brought him away, and went to the house, and he pointed out where the different things that were found in the house were.</p>
               <p>When you came to the house was the door locked? - I believe it was locked, for we were obliged to get a boy to get over and let us in.</p>
               <p>What things did you find there? - In the back parlour there were some bricks that had been taken out of some place in the house, and they were laid carelesly upon one another; Rowe said, take them bricks down and you will find some cecil, I did so, and found some cecil rolled up in this paper as it is now. (The cecil produced.) Then we went up into the two pair of stairs room, there is no garret, they call that the garret; he told us to stoop in under the chimney place and turn upon our left-hand, and upon a little jet out there, we should find a piece of linen cloth and something in it; I did so, and I found this cloth with this parcel of shillings in an unfinished state; there were these pliers, and this scowering paper, and cork.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the cellar? - Yes, I saw Carpmeal pull out a quantity of shillings that had been finished out of the wall, there was a place where there had been bricks taken out, and they were put into the wall, and some mortar laid on the front of them, Carpmeal has the shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Pray who is that Mr. Rowe? - I do not know, I never saw him till I saw him in New Prison.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath you never saw him before? - Upon my oath to my knowledge I did not.</p>
               <p>Did he take much intreating to go with you? - No, Sir, he did not.</p>
               <p>Every part of that house seemed to be known to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he conducted you to this hiding place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you any thing more at that time? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>When you, and Clark, and the rest, went to the house in this court, you say you broke open the house, and there was nobody in it? - No, Sir, not that I know of.</p>
               <p>You went to the lodging which you conceived belonging to the prisoner? - So I understood.</p>
               <p>And you searched that lodging and there you found nothing at all? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You was at this house in Tennis-court? - Yes, there was a press fixed.</p>
               <p>What do you call that press? - A cutting-out press, it is used by a fly, the use of it is to cut out round blanks in any thing.</p>
               <p>What instrument is this? - It is such an instrument as I never saw before in my life, when I first saw it fixed up, it appeared that whoever had made use of it, had been used to round the edges of something, there were two centers, and any thing put between it turned it round with it, and putting a file to the edge of that, it made it round, it all run round together, and holding the file to it, it took the rough edge off.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any thing to determine that this had been used in that manner? - There were some remains of filings.</p>
               <p>Was there enough of them to distinguish the metal? - There was not, they were swept all over the room that we could not take them up to produce them.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure they were filings? - I could be sure they had been made use of in that instrument by somebody, but who I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>In your judgement this is an instrument of which that use might be made? - Yes; this is called cecil, it is a composition of silver or metal, that is run down to a size in a flatting mill, and then it is put between them two instruments, and by turning the fly every time round so, it forces one of these pieces out.</p>
               <p>Court. That is the remains of the metal flatted, from which round blanks have been cut out? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What other things are there? - Here is sand paper, and cork, and here are some of these blanks, which are supposed to be shillings, and some unfinished.</p>
               <p>On those that are finished, is there any impression? - None at all, they are all round blanks, here is a pair of blank dies which I found in the cellar on the first day, I found them there while they were gone to the other house to search, here are two blank dies and two blank punches.</p>
               <p>Court. Of what use were they? - These dies appear to me to be for blank halfpence, and these punches are for this, after these round blanks have been cut out it makes them directly flat, the cutting them makes them a little round, after they have been cut out by the press; I staid at the house after the other two were gone, I saw the prisoner about a quarter of an hour after, he came to the door and I opened it, and took him into custody, and if I recollect<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290075"></xptr> right, he asked me if the carpenter was not at work, says I, Mr.

               <p>Do you remember seeing any body come with Wilson? - There is a man who is called his carpenter, I should know him again, I have frequently seen him, and drank with him and Mr. Wilson.</p>

               <p>Where did you leave them afterwards? - There was some in the garret chimney, and some in the cellar where the press was, them that were found in the garret chimney were left there till we came again to colour them, because we had taken as many as we wanted to colour at that time, to No. 55, Leather-lane, where we used to colour them, we did every thing but colouring them in Middle-row, and then took them to Leather-lane to colour.</p>

Who has persuaded you to give this evidence against the man at the bar? - I never was persuaded by any one, I was taken up, he sent for me to New Prison on the Saturday when he was taken into custody, and told me the best way was to get the things out of the house as fast as I could, I drank two pints of beer with him there, and two gentlemen came and took hold of me.</p>
               <p>Was there no persuasion made use of to you? - None at all, but as they took me to the Justice, I told them if they would admit me an evidence, I would tell them the whole truth.</p>
               <p>You have been at the house yourself? - I was there along with him.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect making any declarations of the innocence of this man to any body afterwards? do you know a man of the name of Thomas? - There was a man named Thomas, that was to repair the windows of this house.</p>
               <p>Have you had any conversation with any man since the prisoner was committed? - Wilson sent a man to me in Tothill Fields. I have not had any conversation with anybody about this business.</p>
               <p>Have you never declared to anybody that the officers of Justice persuaded you to make this kind of information? - No.</p>
               <p>Never said anything of that sort to anybody? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>You knew the consequence of the crime you had been committing? - I did not at first, when I came there the Justice told me the danger I was in.</p>
               <p>Therefore it was you gave the evidence against Wilson? - I told them I would tell the whole truth if they would admit me as an evidence.</p>
               <p>You have never declared the innocence of Wilson and your own guilt? - I never declared any thing to any body.</p>
               <p>I have the man here, young man? - I declared nothing to nobody.</p>
               <p>Court. You spoke of a man that Wilson sent to you, had you no conversation with him? - I had no conversation with any man but him.</p>

               <p>I am one of the moniers of the mint, these are all counterfeit shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What are they? - Bad ones.</p>
               <p>Are they like shillings? - There are a great many such.</p>
               <p>What would you call a shilling? - A shilling.</p>
               <p>But you call it so from bearing some impression on it? - There is no impression upon these.</p>
               <p>How is it possible you can say they are bad shillings then? - I cannot to be sure, I can say they were not made at the Tower.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290077"></xptr>I want to know of you how it is possible to say that flat piece of silver which passes as a good shilling, that that is like a shilling, you cannot furnish me with the example to which to compare it.</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution. Would that pass in currency? - Upon my word I cannot say, I should not take them in their present state, but I take many as bad when I do not look at them.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose whether they will pass or no depends on the degree of skill and knowledge of the subject, that a person happens to have to whom they are tendered? - Certainly, it is very difficult to say of those that have been in the mint, but it is easy to say of those that have not been in the mint, and these have not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Is it, or is it not, a familiar thing that the current coined shillings circulate till the impression is entirely defaced? - Very common, there are more so than are not I believe.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I never saw any thing done in that house in my life, and so that man knows if he speaks the truth.</p>
               <p>Court. Give the Jury any account for what purpose you rented that house? - I had not possession of the house three days, the key had not been delivered to me three days, there was a key, this man knows they could not find the right key to the house, and he could find no key that would fit the lock, the lock was obliged to be taken off, and no other man had possession of the house but Rowe; what he did I do not know; Rowe was to be a lodger of mine; and no other man had the possession but him, whatever was done there or carried there I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Give the Jury an account of your reasons for buying that cutting press? - Mr. Rowe asked me to buy a press of his mistress, he was a button-maker by trade, and he said, he could get his living genteelly; I parted with the press to Rowe, he was to give me so much a week for the use of it; and the rent of the room.</p>

               <p>You know the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know of his being in confinement on suspicion of this crime? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see a Mr. Rowe in consequence of that? - Yes, this man here.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with him as to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it? - A person called at my house, and I believe it was the Wednesday morning after Wilson was taken into custody. The person informed me that Wilson was taken up with another man on suspicion of coining. He thought they were at Tothill-fields: I went down there, thinking to see Wilson: I enquired, and the keeper told me there was a person there, and when I went in he shewed me this man here: I asked him where Wilson was; he told me in Clerkenwell: I asked him what he was in custody for; he told me on suspicion of coining, he and Wilson were taken up: I enquired into the affair, and this man told me all the particulars of it; he told me he had had taken apartments of Wilson, and he was a button-maker by trade, and the people that took Mr. Wilson and him up, took the implements that he made use of, and he could not do without them in his business: I enquired afterwards whether there was any thing else found; he told me there was nothing at all found in the house but these implements; but, says he, I had got some button-tops, and I took them and hid them in a wall, and put a brick before them, and nobody knew that they were there but myself; and he declared to me that Wilson never saw them; he told me afterwards, my Lord, that it was very hard with him, and that he was very poor, and had not a shilling in the world; but he says immediately, says he, I could have money plenty if I would turn evidence, and swear Wilson's life away; and that the people that took him offered him money at different times, and told him that if he did not turn evidence he would be hanged himself; but says he, God forbid I should take an innocent man's life away, for Wilson never saw them, nor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290078"></xptr> did not know where they were. Nothing else material passed, I believe this was on the Wednesday or Thursday.</p>

               <p>Where do you live yourself? - In Wych-street, near Temple-bar; I am a shoemaker.</p>
               <p>Council for the prosecution. At what number do you live? - At No. 46.</p>
               <p>How came you to go to Rowe, did you know him? - I never saw him before, nor he me.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mrs. Peake? - I believe I have seen her once or twice.</p>
               <p>Now recollect yourself. You have seen her since this man was taken up: What did you go there for? - I went on no particular business.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself: Do not be in a hurry. - I did not go there.</p>
               <p>Did not you go to desire her not to appear against the prisoner? - Upon my oath, my Lord, I did not; upon my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>You never desired her to say that, that press was not bought of her by the prisoner? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Who went along with you to her? - There was a person along with me that went by the name of Wilson, but the conversation was nothing at all to me.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear the conversation? - I heard nothing of that conversation.</p>
               <p>Then you never heard either Mrs. Wilson say, nor you yourself never desired this Mrs. Peake not to say, that the press was bought of her? - I never did. She might; I cannot tell; but I never did.</p>
               <p>Cannot you tell: Oh, I understand; it was here in the passage at the Old Bailey? - What, to-day Sir, did I say such a thing, this very day?</p>
               <p>Aye, this very day. - My Lord, I never did, upon my oath, say such a thing.</p>
               <p>You never did, to-day, desire Mrs. Peake to say that the prisoner did not buy the press of her? - Never.</p>
               <p>What could induce this man, Rowe, to tell you about the innocence of Wilson, if he did not know you? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Had you said any thing to him? - I asked, first of all, where Wilson was: he told me all as I have said. I never saw the man in my life before.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you he had described the place to the officers, and gone and shewn them where it was? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Then you did not know, at that time, that these people had got the possession of the things? - No.</p>
               <p>You do not know that buttons are the cant name for bad shillings? - I never saw any of them, so I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Did not you desire Rowe to take upon himself the bottom of the house? - I never did, because I did not know that Rowe lived in the house, nor that Wilson had a house; I knew he had lodgings.</p>
               <p>You mean to say, as you did just now, that you never desired Mrs. Peake not to say that the prisoner bought the cutting-press of her? - I did see her, but I did hardly speak to her. She said she had been in the Court, and came out; and that the person that was coming to speak against Wilson was there. I said I did not want to see him. That was all that passed.</p>
               <p>Who first told you that Wilson was in custody? - I believe his name is Burgess, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>When did you first see Mr. Wilson? - I believe it might be two or three days. Nobody desired me to go. I only heard it, and was sorry to hear it. I went of my own accord. I had seen

               <p>Then you did not tell him who was examining, or any thing of the matter? - No: he asked me if Mr. Wilson's trial was on, and I told him it was; he said he was subpoened for Wilson.</p>
               <p>And that was all that passed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Peake. What was there passed between you and him? - He said it was better for me not to say that I bought the press.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Somebody is talking to her.</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. My Lord, she says, she thought she had better not mention that now.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Peake. He said, I had better not say that I sold it to the prisoner, I said, I should not say any thing that was wrong; I did sell it to Wilson; I did not sell it to anybody else.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Why would not you tell the gentlemen so at first?</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not you tell us this before? - I forgot it.</p>
               <p>Who put you in mind of it? - A gentleman that stands here asked me if he did not mention the press.</p>
               <p>Who is that gentleman? - This.</p>
               <p>(Pointing to Carpmeal.)</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. My Lord, I saw her speaking to Thomas in the passage when he went away, and asked her what he had been saying to her, and she told me, and I told Mr. Vernon's clerk of it.</p>
               <p>What did you say to her now to make her recollect? - When she went down from speaking, I said to her, did not you tell me about the press? Oh Lord! says she, yes, but I thought it better not to mention it; several gentlemen about here heard her.</p>
               <p>Court to Rowe. You have heard what Thomas has said.</p>
               <p>Rowe. That gentleman came to me when I was in Tothill Fields, he asked me how I was for money, I told him, I had but little, says he, if you will say you took the lower apartments of Mr. Wilson you shall have money plenty, and if not you may stay here and starve, I cannot particularly say the day.</p>
               <p>Thomas. My Lord, so help me God, if I said any such thing,</p>
               <p>Rowe. He came in and asked for me, I asked him his business, he said, he was come to see me, I said. you are a stranger to me, says he, I am come from Mr. Wilson, do you want any money? I said, I had but very little, says he, if you will say you took the lower apartment; I will give you plenty, and if you will not you may stay here and starve.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the keeper of Tothill Fields Bridewell here? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Is any of his people here? - No.</p>
               <p>Thomas. My Lord, the keeper of the prison that shewed me in would directly contradict this man's evidence.</p>
               <p>Rowe. He called me to one corner of the prison to speak to me when he came in.</p>
               <p>Court to Rowe. Is it true that you told him, God for bid you should accuse an innocent man? - I told him that I had told the Justice the truth, and I would not tell any thing else.</p>
               <p>Thomas. He never mentioned the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. As to the objection of the Prisoner's Council about the impression on these pieces of metal, I am of opinion that a blank that is smoothed and made like a piece of legal coin, the impression of which is worn out, and yet it is suffered to remain in circulation, may be sufficiently to the similitude of the current coin of this realm to bring them within the statute; these pieces having some reasonable likeness and similitude to that coin which has been defaced, and yet passes in circulation. (The learned Judge then summed up the evidence on both sides and added.) The great question is, whether credit is due to this man (Rowe), who appears here in the light of an accomplice; and something will depend on his own manner of telling his story,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290080"></xptr> and I confess if it is a made up story, it is wonderfully well fabricated; and with respect to Rowe's being found with Wilson in New Prison, it staggers me to believe, that the man who was alone guilty of this transaction, after the house had been ran sacked, and many of the things found, should have chosen to go into the place where an innocent man was confined, in order to talk with him about it.</p>

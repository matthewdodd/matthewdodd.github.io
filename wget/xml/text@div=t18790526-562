(The letter was dated 23, Leicester Square, November 23, 1876, from J. C.

Seamer is a silk merchant in London—I do not know whether I owed him any more than 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it was to settle an account which I owed him—he has never asked me for it since, but I cannot recollect it because we have had other transactions with him since—I beg to remark also that the date has nothing at all corresponding to the order in November with the payment in February—this cash order was November—I saw Levy on 24th February when he came and brought the cheque, and asked me to give him the money—I said no doubt before the Magistrate "In February, 1877, the defendant called on me in Paris at our office; I do not recollect seeing him again since. I saw him again in May, when he said he did not come on our business, but he had other business to transact; at the interview in February Levy handed me certain sums of money. I have a list of those sums; the figures in the list produced were written from the books by M. Blancherdet in my presence:" but seeing this cheque causes me to make an explanation which I hope the Court will allow me to make—it is true that I saw him in May; very likely it was a slip of memory when I said that I did not—on 16th February he brought me the five sums which have been mentioned—on the 24th he came again and asked me to take the cheque and give him 1,000 francs for his travelling expenses, consequently that cheque has nothing to do with our account—he may have left Paris between the 16th and 24th and came back again—I did not see him between those dates—this cheque reminds me of the transaction, it was in exchange for money—there is no book here which will show that trans<lb></lb>action—Mr. Levy cannot prove the receipt of the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the large book would show the transaction of 16th February, but there is no book in existence which would show a transaction of this kind, which is only an exchange of money—M. Blancherdet never received money in the ordinary course of things, but in my absence from Paris payments would be made to him; but he would immediately certify me of it, and hand me the money over—all letters are filed and kept in the archive room.</p>

Worth gave him, and he produced a copy of another account which had been sent him with the questions—this is what I had to go by—among other entries here is "Nov. 16: Ch. Seamen <hi rend="italic">par M. Levy pour notre compt</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 325f."—I showed them all to him—next day, January 4, I wrote him this letter, and enclosed a copy of this' side of the account. (<hi rend="italic">This informed Mr. Levy that it was necessary to put in writing the exact position in which affairs stood, reminding him that Messrs. Andrews and Mason had been unable to obtain from him the particulars of his receipts and payments for Mr. Worth, who had therefore executed a power of attorney to Messrs. Hall, under which they demanded to know whether certain sums due to Mr. Worth had been collected or not, and the nature of all proceedings them pending</hi>.) I received the following</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was dated Jan.</hi> 7, 1878, <hi rend="italic">from the defendant to Benton and Hall, stating that his refusal to account was by Mr. Worth's admission untrue, and that he was about to take proceedings in Paris against Mr. Worth for his breach of agreement, and that his agent would be instructed to deliver to Mr. Worth direct particulars of the account, and stating that Fisher and Co. had not to his knowledge received any moneys for Mr. Worth except such as he (Levy) had sent to him, or such as would be credited to him in the account then being made out.</hi>) In consequence of that I made a communi<lb></lb>cation to Lord Dorchester, and received from him the cheque which has been produced to-day.</p>

Mantel was in the witness box—I don't know whether I was there the whole time—I believe Mr. Edward Lewis, the attorney, was defending Mr. Levy—I believe no promise was made that M. Mantel should come back again to be cross-examined—I believe, on the contrary, that an application was made that he should come back, and the Magistrate refused to grant it—Mr. Wontner was conducting the prosecution, and I was there to assist him—he has a letter from Mr. Levy to me of 2nd February, 1878.

The 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is included in that list, but I should prefer seeing the letter to which that is a reply—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at it</hi>) yes I presume Mrs. Carleton's or Lord Dor<lb></lb>chester's name was included in it—I received Lord Dorchester's cheque about 10th January, 1878—the letter is dated 9th January, from Coxail; the postmark is January 10—I had a long correspondence with Mr. Levy and received many letters from him in 1878—I thought the C. Worth on the cheque in question was not Mr. Worth's natural writing—I thought it was his writing, but what I did think was that it was the same name—it looked like an imitation of a French signature; it has a tail which the French generally put to their signatures, but which Mr. Worth only puts to a limited extent—I think it is Mr. Levy's writing—in July, 1878, I pro<lb></lb>ceeded in one of the Courts at Westminster and annexed this cheque to an affidavit—I know that in July or August Mr. Fisher died—I do not know when this charge was first preferred against Levy, but I presume it was shortly before Mr. Wontner communicated with me—I first saw in the papers that Mr. Levy had been charged with some other offence—I have never been charged with forgery—I have heard of Madame Valentine—you were my Counsel in that matter—I should like to explain—as solicitor I had in the course of the proceedings to put a document in in evidence; the solicitor on the other side, Montague Leverson, took the extraordinary course of giving me in charge and afterwards accusing me of tendering a document which was forged, not of forging it—the merits of the case were tried before the Lord Chief Justice for a whole week, and it was decided that the docu<lb></lb>ment was genuine—the prosecutor was first charged with the offence in October, I believe, and he was acquitted—I believe Mr. Montague Leverson was articled clerk to the prisoner—I was only tried on one indictment, but</p>

               <p>there were three—it was in the Queen's Bench—after a six days' trial the Jury were not out of the box 20 minutes—it was the 13th June, 1867—I wrote the letter of 4th January for the purpose of putting upon record what had taken place, because I knew what kind of man I had to deal with; and for the same reason I took the note which I have here, because I knew he was connected with Leverson—Leverson did not prosecute me; he had been the solicitor, but he absconded next day, and has never come back.</p>

Bayard, who is now in Paris—I don't think he gave evidence at the polioe-court—I know that it was in February. 1877, that Levy and I went to Worth's because my brother-in-law wrote to me and told me to go and see Mr. Levy at this hotel—I have not got my brother-in-law's letter, but I know it was in</p>

Worth, and my initials—I have some recollection of some matters of 'mine which I had to do on that day, that is how I remember it; having read the letter I called to mind the circumstances under which it was written—I called on that day at the office as usual, and I was instructed to write a letter; it was rather late and I was going away; I was called back when I was on the staircase, by the prisoner, who said "You must write another letter, and quick," and he gave me the substance of it, which I pencilled out, and wrote it at once and sent it off—it was not part of my duty to copy it, but he said "Will you copy it? which way are you going?"—I said "To Camberwell"—he said "Will you post it at Charing Cross?" and I did so—I copied it; I had some pressing business that evening at Camberwell, and not being used to the copying press, here are two or three words which, though it is my writing, I cannot read, because it is rather blotted, and that makes me remember I had to do it in a hurry—I have no interest in Mr. Levy or connection with him, I never saw him more than once after I left, there is no friendship between us—I am under a subpoena to prove this letter.

Mantel "6.30, Charing Cross," is my writing—this letter of 11th December to M.

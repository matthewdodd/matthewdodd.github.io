                  </hi>. I live in Two Kings-row, Horsleydown, and am a watch-man in the employ of Messrs. Courage and Donaldson. On the evening of the 20th of April, about nine o'clock, I was in the neighbourhood of Horsley-down-stairs—the prosecutor, Mr. Dunkin, had two or three barges lying of there—I met the prisoner and James Bennett, who has been convicted—Bennett had a sack of oats, and the prisoner had an empty sack under his arm, and a hat, which I believe was Bennett's—(Bennett had no hat on)—the prisoner was in front—I stopped Bennett—the prisoner turned back, and asked what I had to do with Bennett, and held up his fist to me—I called out, "Police"—the prisoner dropped his empty bag, and ran away—the sack that Bennett had, contained oats.</p>

He had some barges at Davis's-wharf, Horsleydown—there were eighty sacks of oats in one barge—at nine o'clock that night I received information, and missed one sack of oats—this is it—it had the same kind of oats in it that was in the barge; I had left the barge about half an hour.</p>

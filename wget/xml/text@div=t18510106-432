                  </hi>. I am a labourer in Mint-street, Borough. I have known the prisoner some time—on 7th Jan., I met her about eight o'clock in the morning at the Hand and Flower public-house in Gravel-lane—we had some drink, and remained together till about four in the afternoon, and in the evening we were going to the play, and on our way went into the Pear-Tree public-house—I felt rather sick—the prisoner came and put one hand round my head, and the other into my pocket—I had changed a half-crown, and had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out—I missed that, and asked her to give it me—she would not, and denied having it, and I gave her in charge—at the station she <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> down two shillings, and one halfpenny which she had in her hand—one of my halfpence was rather burnt—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

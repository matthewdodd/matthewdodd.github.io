            . I was walking in Hyde-park on Easter Monday, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoner came and took me by the collar, and demanded a guinea of me; I told him I had no such money; he forcibly took two King William's crown pieces from me; he frightened me, by telling me he would knock my soul out; I said I was no more than a <rs id="t17660409-26-viclabel154" type="occupation">journeyman carpenter</rs>

               <p>Webb. No, he had not; I saw nothing in his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Webb. I live in Berwick-street, and work with Mr. Medley, a builder.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I will tell the whole truth, he was along with a woman, doing things that he ought not to do.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I will not answer to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he demand a guinea of you because you had had familiarity with that woman?</p>

               <p>"Is there any sink in it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>"Is there any cupboard or door by that sink? - There is a door shuts in the sink that parts the kitchen and the sink; it is a sort of a closet.</p>
               <p>"Have you ever been down in the hole below the kitchen? - I never saw any thing of the like kind; the boards were nailed down.</p>
               <p>"When did you see it? - Three or four months ago.</p>

               <p>"In May or June? - I cannot say; it was before last term.</p>
               <p>"Have you any thing to do with the terms? - No, only I was here attending last term.</p>
               <p>"Last session you mean? - Yes.</p>
               <p>"Did you know this house in the month of March? - Yes, before that; I knew the house before Mr. Wilson was in it; a relation of mine lived in the house.</p>
               <p>"Was there any communication from the sink to this hole? - I never saw any thing like it.</p>
               <p>"Have you examined it enough to say there is no communication from this place to the kitchen? - I have.</p>
               <p>"There is no communication? - No.</p>
               <p>"You swear there was no communication in the month of March? - Yes; and I stand to it.</p>
               <p>"I asked you if you had been acquainted with the house before? - Yes; three years.</p>
               <p>"Have you examined the house sufficiently to swear to the situation of it in the month of March? - I have, and there was no communication from the sink to the hole that you speak of; I can speak within these three years, there has been no communication.</p>
               <p>"Was there any communication from any other part of the kitchen to this place? - I never saw any, I examined it thoroughly; I can say positively there was not.</p>
               <p>"Have you been in the hole since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>"Which way did you go in? - From the top of the house.</p>
               <p>"Jury. Do you call the sink the closet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>"There is a communication from this closet to the hole? - No, Mr. Wilson asked me to go down and examine the place, that was about a fortnight before last session; I have lain in the house several nights.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>"Where do you live? - At No. 7, Aldersgate-buildings.</p>
               <p>"When you went to this house you found it in the same situation as it was when you saw it before? - I did not see any difference.</p>
               <p>"The wainscoting was not pulled down, nor the cupboards altered at all? - I did not see any difference.</p>
               <p>"How came you to examine if there was any communication between the hole and the kitchen? - Mr. Wilson desired me, for he said there was a fellow would swear his life away, and he must be guarded against him, if possible; I know there was an affair happened in that house and I was surprised at it.</p>
               <p>"How did you get down into the hole? - From the top of the house, the top story.</p>
               <p>"Three pair of stairs? - I believe there is two pair of stairs besides the garrets, because I plaistered the garrets I went through.</p>
               <p>"This passage was from the garrets down to the hole? - Yes.</p>
               <p>"How deep was it? - About twenty-seven, or between twenty and thirty foot.</p>
               <p>"This hole did not exist then, nor upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100042"></xptr> your oath never did exist? - I do not know that it ever did exist; there never was a hole made in the sink to appearance.</p>
               <p>"Nor under the sink? - No.</p>
               <p>"Jury. Whether you saw that hole in the month of March? - I did not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You I believe went from Bow-street in the month of March to Wilson's house? - I did; when I went first there I was taking care of the back part of the house in Clerkenwell-close; I was outside. A man who went by the name of Nash jumped out of the back parlour window into the yard; he was taken into custody, and I got in at the window he came out of; after he was in custody the other officers who were in the front of the house entered the house; I knew nothing of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100043"></xptr> what they were doing, till I came forward; we searched some time but did not find any thing. Our information was so exact and strong that we knew coining must be carried on somewhere in and about the house. In a short time after that, a man whose name was West was found in the kitchen, but I was not present when he was first seen there; I saw him afterwards in the kitchen with one of his shoulders all over white; a little time after that, being satisfied he must have come from some concealed place, Prothero and I went up stairs; I saw Prothero pull up a board in a little room; the whole house is but one floor; it opened like a well into a closet. I immediately went down by a rope, and there were little pieces of wood nailed upon the wainscotting in order to make steps. Where I got down to the bottom I saw a complete apparatus for coining; the closet appeared to me to come into the kitchen where I had seen West. When I got down to a level with the kitchen, there was a square hole cut out of the floor, and that led to a hole which was dug in the ground. In that hole all the apparatus for coining was found; the passage I went down had been a closet in the kitchen, but it was nailed up and did not appear like a closet, but as wainscotting; there was no appearance in the kitchen of any communication. I then came up stairs again.</p>
               <p>Did you after that find out any other communication with the hole besides that from the one pair of stairs room? - Yes; the hole the presses came out was on a level with the kitchen; the presses were drawn from the places where they were fixed, and lifted up, and taken in at the hole of the kitchen; from the earth at the bottom of this hole, where the presses were fixed, it went up perpendicular to the first floor, but there was a hole by the side of the sink, through which the presses were taken out.</p>
               <p>Describe that second hole? - It was made larger for the presses to be drawn up through it; when I first saw it, it was big enough for any person to come out of.</p>
               <p>Did you see it before any of the presses were drawn through? - I did; it was then large enough for a man to go down.</p>

               <p>The presses are a very great weight and large? - Yes; they weigh half a ton.</p>
               <p>This hole was by the sink, was it under the sink? - By the side, or under, I will not say which; I think the hole came from underneath the sink but I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I understand you to say that you had such an information that you had no doubt of coining being carried on here? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Did your information extend to tell you what they were coining? - Yes; it did.</p>
               <p>Then you must know that this coining business could not be carried on without some large machines? - We know that well.</p>
               <p>Then consequently wherever these machines were, they must take up a pretty considerable space to work, including room for the workmen? - That depends upon the size of the fly.</p>
               <p>Who were the officers that went in at the front of the house? - Prothero was one; I believe Lebar was at the back with me.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect who you found in the kitchen? - I do not.</p>
               <p>I forget whether you said West was or not in the kitchen when you came in? - I am very sure he was not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether there was one door or two in this kitchen? - There were many doors and trap doors I really cannot tell how many.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect in the kitchen there is a door on the right hand that goes into a bedroom? - I believe there is.</p>
               <p>Beyond that door there is a pantry? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Then you come to the closet? - Where there had been a closet which was made up with wainscotting.</p>
               <p>Beyond this closet was the sink? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That ranged with the closet likewise? - I think it joined it.</p>
               <p>To that sink there is a door? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100044"></xptr>What may be the height of the sink from the ground? - I suppose pretty near three feet.</p>
               <p>Then the hole in question was under the sink as you think or by its side? - I think underneath.</p>
               <p>The hole you are speaking of, if it was underneath, it could not be higher than the sink. - I should think not.</p>
               <p>Was it stopped up with a fixed wainscot or moving wainscot or a door? - I did not take particular notice of that.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether that hole was in a position to have completed the partition between the hole where the machines were and the sink or not; you said you did not see it at first, but it was made larger? - I saw it in the same state before the presses were taken up.</p>
               <p>Where was you then, in the hole below or up stairs in the kitchen? - I came down stairs; I saw it first when I was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>How did you find that out, was it not by a knocking, by agreement some of the people were to knock that you might find out the place? - It was.</p>
               <p>You did not find this place out? - After they had knocked I came down stairs and one of the officers said here is the place West came out at. I was up stairs when the knocking was.</p>
               <p>This discovery of the hole was not made till you had been down the hole from above stairs? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>In order to take up the presses there was a great quantity of wainscoting removed? - There was.</p>
               <p>One of the other officer's found the loose boards and you went down, how long had you been in the house before you made that discovery? - I suppose twenty minutes or half an hour.</p>
               <p>One of your fellow officers swore upon the former trial that you had searched for the space of two hours, I believe, and could not find any implements for coining? - I do not think we were two hours searching, we were in the house three hours, but not searching so long for the place.</p>
               <p>Court. All this was, I understand, concealed to the eye? - Yes, it was. I was there with Mr. Vernon the day after we brought the things away; it was then as we left it.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing a pail and a quantity of coals under the sink? - I do not. I always make it a rule to go out of court when a trial comes on in which I am to be called as a witness, whether I am ordered so to do or not, therefore I cannot tell what any other person said.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You are one of the officers who went to Wilson's house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the kitchen when you first came in? - Yes, I was the first person who entered the kitchen.</p>
               <p>When did you see West? - I had been in the kitchen I believe five minutes before I saw him.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him? - In the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Was not you surprised at that? - I was.</p>
               <p>Which way did he come into the kitchen? - Under the sink.</p>
               <p>Describe the place from which he came? - When I went into the kitchen there was no person in the kitchen; I looked all round the room; I looked under the dresser where there were some coppers. I opened a drawer in the dresser in the kitchen, I there found some things which led me to be very certain coining was carried on there. Mrs. Wilson was in the kitchen. I spoke to her. I was coming out of the kitchen; I met another of the officers, Labar. He said we have catched a man who jumped out of the window. In a minute or less after that I was going to tell him what I had found in the drawer; I turned round, and West was behind my back. I said</p>
               <p>"Good God, where are you come from, out of the earth?" Said he, I was sitting by the fire. I replied,</p>
               <p>"it is impossible a cat should be there without my seeing it, for I have searched every place." I examined round the room to see if there was any door, at which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100045"></xptr> he could come in. I could not find any door to come into that room, besides the door I stood at myself, except one, and that was nailed up fast. We secured him, and after searching some time, we found behind the wainscoting, in a back place behind the kitchen, a private still at work, which was in a room behind the kitchen, where the door was fastened. After being there sometime, I went up into the one-pair-of-stairs room. I talked to some women who were there. One woman was washing. I went into a little room, and in the middle of the room I saw a crack between two boards which were greasy; I thought a board might be taken up by a knife. I took out my cutlass and ran it between the two boards and lifted them up. Mr. Clark went down first; I followed him. There were steps to go down, and two ropes to lay hold of. When we came even with the kitchen there was an hole cut in the ground which went a little side-ways where the presses were fixed; then I desired some of the officers to go into the kitchen, where I secured West, and I would knock below, that they might give me an answer, that we might find out the communication at which West had come out. I went down and knocked with an hammer, and they halloo'd out. I then, directed by the voice, came to the kitchen floor. I desired them to knock again. One of them knocked; and then I found the hole West came out of. I believe one of the officers came out through the hole directly, for there were coals under the sink, and I did not choose to dirty my clothes. I then went up into the one-pair-of-stairs room and came down into the kitchen. I took a pick-axe, and pulled down the wainscoting. When I had pulled down the wainscoting I perceived how he had come out. The sink was on the left-hand side of the wainscot where the hole was made to go down; and at the bottom of the sink, underneath the sink, there was a hole that led into the hole where the coining tools were.</p>
               <p>Was the hole under the sink visible? - Not till the place was opened; it was only at that time that I knew of it; it was impossible to see it.</p>
               <p>Was the place always open? - There was a peck and a half, or half a bushel, of coals under the sink, it was a sink where they washed dishes and such things.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the hole concealed with any thing? - There was a moveable slap.</p>
               <p>When it was shut then you could not see that there was a way down? - Not without searching for it.</p>
               <p>But when it was open there was an hole to go down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that hole big enough for a man to go down? - Yes. Big enough for me; and I am as big as most men.</p>
               <p>There were coals there? - Yes, for the use of the family.</p>
               <p>Was there an hole in the kitchen as well as upon a level with the kitchen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could a person live in the kitchen without seeing this? - They might without seeing it; but when I pulled the wainscot down a person could not go into the kitchen without seeing it.</p>

               <p>You were in the kitchen when West made his appearance? - Prothero's back was towards me; he was telling me what he had found in the drawers. We were standing at the kitchen door in Wilson's house; I saw West come out of the closet; he came up towards Prothero; Prothero turned about and said,</p>
               <p>"Good God, where could you come from?" He said he had been sitting at the the fire. Prothero said that was impossible.</p>
               <p>This place then was inside a closet? - Yes, it was. The sink was in the closet.</p>
               <p>Had you looked in the closet before you saw West come out of it? - I had, and there was not a person there that I could see; I saw the door move and saw him come out. I had before looked in the closet and had shut the door.</p>
               <p>You was examined before upon the trial? - Yes.</p>

               <p>When you heard this complaint you went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100046"></xptr> to Wilson's house with the officers? - The officers went into this house on the 29th of March. On the 7th of April the persons taken in the house were brought to Sir John Fielding's office for examination; it was my duty to attend upon that occasion, and the same account was given substantially as now. After the examination was over, they laid it was a curious contrivance to conceal the coining. I went with Clark and Prothero to look at this place. I there found it to be as it had been and is now described and that there was a cummunication just as it has been described. Take all the house together with the sliding wainscot and barricadoes, it was very curious.</p>

               <p>You have heard the evidence Clark, Prothero, and Labar have given to-day about this hole? - I have.</p>
               <p>Is it the same as they gave before you then as a juryman? - Literally the same.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the two defendants swearing there was no communication from the kitchen to the hole under ground? - Two or three of us went to view this place; it is as the witnesses have now represented it; they went down from the one-pair-of-stairs room behind the wainscot into about two feet below the level of the kitchen floor; the place in which they carried on the business of coining was not above four feet high; a man could not stand upright in it. They went along an aqueduct dug out of the ground. When they came to the level of the floor, into this place where the business was carried on, there was clearly a communication from out of this passage into the kitchen, but notwithstanding there had been I apprehend something of a moving door of communication, but that might be fastened when the officers were there, and no one might know how to open it but those more immediately concerned; but there was a door I am as clear as that I am here a living man. I was exceedingly particular in my observations whether there had been any nailing, for there were ledges there; I could not find out any nailing at all. I am firmly of opinion there had been a communication under the sink. It was like a closet with folding-doors. There was a partition between one part fastened up, the other part open with the sink; the sink stood about two feet three or six inches high; and the communication from under that sink was from under the right-hand side into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Do you think, that after having been told all the story you have heard, any person, going there with a view of seeing whether there was a communication or no, could possibly miss this, going for the purpose of observing it? - By no means.</p>

               <p>Did you examine the closet where the sink was? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you examine, or gone into the hole, where the coining business had been carried on? - I looked in, I did not go down; that was not under the sink, it was in the closet adjoining; there is a partition between the closet, or beaufet, and the closet were the sink was. I saw, up stairs, that one of the joists and the flooring was cut away; I looked up and down, and saw there had been a communication made from above, to the level with the kitchen floor, and there was no hole under the sink, but in the closet adjoining<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178101100047"></xptr> the sink; if there is any under the sink it is more than I know of.</p>
               <p>Did you examine under the sink? - I think, to the best of my recollection, there was no hole in the closet where the sink was.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the closet where the sink was? - I don't think there was room to go in; I stood by the door. I have here a copy of my survey. (The witness reads.)</p>
               <p>"My opinion is, there never was a way into the said cellar through the adjoining closet where the old sink is."</p>
               <p>Did you examine the sink? - I stood close by the sink.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the closet adjoining to the sink? - The hole was as big as the closet pretty near; there was no room for a person to stand inside</p>
               <p>"and further it appears to me that part of the old partition between said closet and beaufet has been forcibly broken away and that there was never any hatch door whatsoever under the said sink."</p>
               <p>Did you stand in such a position as to be able to examine whether there was or not? - I examined the adjoining closet more p articularly.</p>
               <p>Did you examine where the sink was? - I looked in and poked my stick into it; if there was a hole under the sink I do not think any man could get down between the bottom of the sink and the floor.</p>
               <p>Why did not you examine it with your hands? - There was not room for any person to go there.</p>

               <p>You did not go down this hole? - I only looked down it.</p>

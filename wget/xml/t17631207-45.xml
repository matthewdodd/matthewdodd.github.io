               <p>- Thompson. On the 30th of last month, between 10 and 11 at night, I saw a boat coming betwixt Shadwell-dock and Cole-stairs; there were two others in the wherry with me: they rowed along side of us; one of my brother officers (I belong to the merchants to look out for defrauds on the river) made a snatch at the boat, seeing her deep in the water, and immediately took hold on her. I step'd on board, and asked what they had got there? they made no answer; I found by my feet they had got coals: there were, I found afterwards, to the amount of about 18 bushels. I asked where they were going; they said to Greenwich. I said to where there? they said, they did not know: at last one of them said he was going on board a barge there. We took the boat up to Pelican-stairs, with the coals, and carried the prisoners to the watch-house, and the next day before Justice Berry, who committed them. Tull the evidence told me he would show me where they had taken some of them.</p>

            . On the 30th of last month, the prisoners and I went to Bank-side; we took a boat from the Bear-garden, and went up to Goat-stairs, and took some coals from a craft, and then row'd down as far as Horshoe-alley, and there took two or three bushels; we took them from Mr. Whiting's craft: then as the tide suited, we went through<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176312070037"></xptr> London-bridge, and towards Wapping side, and took some more out there, then we went to Shadwell, and was stopt by those three men.</p>

               <p>I belong to a ship that lies at Woolwich; I had some prize-money due to me; I asked liberty of my captain to come up to London. I came up, and was informed my money was not to be paid this fortnight; I was returning in that boat, but knew nothing of the coals being stolen.</p>

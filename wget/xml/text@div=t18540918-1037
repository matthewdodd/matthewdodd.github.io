                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Chambers, I knew the deceased William Davies; I lodged in his home in St. Ann's-road, Stepney. On 17th Aug., about 3 o'clock in the afternoon I was in the kitchen of the house, and heard Mr. Lye and Mr. Davies talking outside the street door—I heard Mr. Davies say, "I can't let you have them now, I have got some hills to set to rights, but you shall have them;" Mr. Lye was not talking in an angry tone—immediately after, I heard the street door open, and come with force against the wall—I came from the kitchen into the passage which is on the same level, and saw Mr. Davies lying in the passage on his hack—MR. Lye was by the side of him—Mrs. Davies was up stairs with her daughter—I called for her, she did not come—I called again, and in the meantime Mr. Lye took Mr. Davies by the coat and shook him—MR. Davies</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185409180090"></xptr>
               <p>then got up, and Mr. Lye took hold of him again by the coat and shook him, and threw him down upon the stairs—he was standing about half a yard from the stairs at the time—he fell from the violence of the throw, with his right side towards the banisters, and his head on the stairs; his heels were on the mat—he said, "Oh! oh my!"—his daughter, Mrs. Oram, came down immediately, and she took hold of Mr. Lye by the coat, and held him till such time as she got him out at the street door—he aimed three blows at her face while she was holding him, but one caught her on the cheek.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you at all connected with or related to Mr. Davies? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I am a married woman lodging in his house—my husband is a seafaring man—the first I heard was, Mr. Lye speaking at the door—he had not knocked at the door—he had come to Mr. Davies, and was speaking quietly—then I heard the door slam, and when I went I found Mr. Davies lying on the floor inside the door—I did not hear him speak after that—they had been outside the door talking—I think perhaps Mr. Davies was trying to come in, and Mr. Lye might have knocked him, but J do not know—MR. Davies was accountant to Mr. Lye, and Mr. Lye came for his accounts—MR. Davies was not ready with them—I cannot say whether or not he tried to push the door in Mr. Lye's face, or whether it was in that way that he tumbled—I do not know with what intentions Mr. Lye took hold of him, I was excited at the time at such an uproar—MR. Davies tried and struggled to get up in the best way he could, and then Mr. Lye took hold of him and shook him—he did not fall on the stairs; I saw Mr. Lye shake him very violently, and throw him down on the stairs—he was a very old, infirm man—I have known Mr. Lye before—he is very deaf—I never quarrelled with him—I am quite sure about that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of the deceased—he was seventy-four years old—I live in St. Ann's-road. On Thursday, 17th Aug., I heard Mrs. Chambers calling me down stairs—I went down, and saw my father in the passage—MR. Lye had hold of him, when I first saw him, about half a yard from the bottom stairs, and then he thrust him down on the stairs—I rushed down to the side of my father, and took Mr. Lye by the shoulder, and struggled with him to the parlour door—he tried to get from me—I still held him—he aimed three blows at me—one caught me under the chin, and he bruised my arm from the elbow to the wrist, in trying to get from me to get into the parlour to obtain the books—I did not hear anything said about the books—my father had the accounts to make out for Mr. Lye—I did not hear him say anything about the books at that time—his manner was more like a lion than anything else—I had seen my father that morning—he was then in his usual health, indeed he was better than he, had been for some years—he was infirm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What do you mean by his being like a lion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His manner was so rough and uncouth; he was not like a man at all—he got his face scratched—that my mother did—when she saw the situation I was placed in, she flew at him, and he struck her a blow over my shoulder, which felled her to the ground—what he did to my father was not to let him fall on the two bottom steps; he thrust him down on the two bottom steps—I am not aware that I have ever said that he let him fall on the two bottom steps—my father would not let Mr. Lye have the books, because he had a few little accounts, which he told him he wished to</p>

               <p>make out, and he should have them by the morning, at 8 o'clock—he did not receive money for Mr. Lye; he merely made up the accounts at so much a week—MR. Lye had been there the Saturday previous for the men's accounts, which my father gave him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Beaumont-street, Stepney. On Thursday, 17th Aug., I attended Mr. Davies, about 6 o'clock—I had never seen him before—I found him in bed, supported by pillows—his breathing was load, whistling, and short—I examined the chest, and found symptoms of fractured ribs—he seemed much agitated—there was pain beneath the right blade bone, increased by inspiration, by coughing and motion—he died about a quarter past 7 o'clock on Friday—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on Monday, 21st Aug.—J believe the cause of death to have been fracture of the ribs, producing a shook to the system of a man enfeebled by age and disease—he appeared to have suffered from asthma, as a symptom of a disease under which he laboured—I examined the lungs, and found them diseased, but there was nothing to account for death, except the broken ribs—it would not require considerable violence to produce the injury I saw, in a man of his age—it would require some violence—if he were thrown against the stairs that would in him be sufficient to produce what I saw—the bones are more brittle in advanced life—the ribs were broken on the right side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> In feet, in your opinion, he died from a shock to the system, occasioned by the tumble? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the violence—I did not perceive that the broken ribs pressed upon any vital part so as to occasion death—there was no laceration of the lungs—they were the inferior ribs that were broken, the lower ones—that would affect the lungs during the application of the violence, by inward pressure—I discovered the lung on the right side to be of a darker colour than the left—that would be from congestion.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 300). I apprehended the prisoner on the Friday night—I told him I was a police constable, and the old gentleman was dead—I was not aware at the time that he was deaf, and I repeated it to him, putting my mouth close to his ear—I said, "The old gentleman is dead; you must consider yourself in custody for causing his death"—he said, "My God I never touched him"—he appeared very much staggered, and shed tears; I had to hold him—he said, "If he was injured the women must have trod on him; they were like lions; I was obliged to strike the woman, but I did not mean to hurt her, poor thing; my dis<lb></lb>position is different to that"—he showed me his face—I saw some marks on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was his face much marked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, there were two long marks down the face—the deceased's wife had her lip cut—he appeared very much astonished when he heard that he was charged with killing the man—he staggered, and I fancy he might have fallen if I had not taken hold of him.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner received an excellent character from a number of witnesses.</hi>)</p>

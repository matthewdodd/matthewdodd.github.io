                  </hi> I am a shoemaker; I live in Bermondsey-street, Borough. On the 1st of Dec. I got intoxicated, and was taken to the watch-house—Iawoke about eight o'clock in the morning on the 2nd of Dec, and there werefour or five men in the cell—I missed my handkerchief and the collar off my neck—I asked the men there if they knew what had become of them—the prisoner was amongst them—they each said they did not—when I was brought out into the yard I told the policeman; and while I was waiting to go before the Magistrate, I saw the prisoner take my collar out of his pocket, and give it to a woman to pin round his neck—I went up and said, "Old fellow, that is mine"—he said, "You had better demand something more of me"—he had scarcely said the word when the policeman came and took his cap off his head, and in his cap was my handkerchief—I bad also lost a parse and a little money, but I cannot say who took that—I had not asked the prisoner in particular about my handkerchief and collar, but I had asked every one in the cell, and when I was called to have some breakfast, I called the prisoner, and gave him some.</p>

            . I live in Newgate market; last Monday was three weeks the prisoner washed for us, and some time after my wife met with the prisoner's daughter, and took her to my house, she had one of my wife's aprons on, I believe it was hers, but she can give a better account.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Blizard. The prisoner has washed for me upwards of two years, and out of every washing I missed some linen; upon missing my linen I discharged several of my servants, and the prisoner would make great protestations, so I did not suspect her; the last time I washed I looked over my aprons, and after that I missed three; on the Tuesday following I met the prisoner's daughter with one of my aprons before her; I asked her whose apron it was? she, with many oaths, said, it was her own, and that she bought it. I took her home and charged a constable with her, and took her before Mr. alderman Ladbrook, she there said she bought it in Rag-fair for one shilling and six-pence, but could not tell of whom.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you'ever found the other aprons?</p>
               <p>E. Blizard. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive the apron you produce was in the wash at that time?</p>
               <p>E. Blizard. Yes it was, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner intrusted to wash it?</p>
               <p>E. Blizard. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it?</p>
               <p>E. Blizard. It is worth two shillings.</p>

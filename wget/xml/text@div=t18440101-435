                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Howitt, linen<lb></lb>draper, High Holborn. On the 13th of Dec., in consequence of what my employer said, I went in pursuit of the prisoner who I had seen in the shop—I followed her about a minute after she left, and was attracted by some parties looking down a passage—I went down Gate-street, and saw the prisoner standing in a private yard, with this board in her hand, which had had the gimp on it—the gimp was in her pocket, or in her dress, partly concealed—I saw a part of it hanging out of her pocket, or out of a hole in her dress—I said she was a foolish woman—I took the board from her, and asked her to return to Mr. Howitt's—she made no answer—I took her back—she was given into custody—the gimp was worth about 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—we never sell gimp on the board—I had seen her drag this gimp out of the shop—there was a ticket on it—she trailed it out when she was leaving the shop—I am quite sure I had seen this identical piece of gimp in Mr. Howitt's hand.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this the first time you have ever said any thing about seeing the prisoner dragging or trailing it out of the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I mentioned it before, on my deposition being taken—I believe the prisoner had been in the habit of dealing with us for a long time—she had a parcel of things she purchased that day—she had bought two sheets of wadding—if she had wanted this gimp she would have had credit for it—I believe she bears a good character—she was not carrying the gimp loose in her hand—when she came back to the shop she took it from her pocket, and had it in her hand then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

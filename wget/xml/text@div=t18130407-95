               <p>Q. In February last do you know whether they had any Swedish timber on their premises - A. Yes, at Stangate-dock; that is on the Lambeth side of Westminster-bridge, they had a large quantity there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see these pieces of timber that were found upon Mr. Robinson's wharf - A. Yes, and I am sure they are my employers property. It was part of the timber that had been at Stangate.</p>

               <p>ROBERT HOPKINS. I am lighterman to Messrs. Brownings, and looked after the timber; I had about two hundred pieces of timber under my care at Stangate-dock. On the 4th of February, I examined it; it was all safe then. On the morning of the 6th I observed the ropes had been cut, and six pieces had been taken away; I made every enquiry, and that afternoon about five o'clock I went to Mr. Robinson's wharf at Brentford, and there I found five pieces of the timber marked B and a star; Mr. Brownings mark which, I had put on. The five pieces I found at Robinson's wharf were five out of six that were stolen.</p>

            . I am a wharfinger at Brentford. In February last I employed Mr. Watkins's barge to go to London; the prisoner navigated that barge, and Hoppey, a boy, was under him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect this timber that the last witness has described being brought there - A. Yes; the boy with the timber followed the barge, the boy brought the timber as a raft. I saw Hearn he was in the barge; Hearn said he had got some timber for me. I asked him for the delivery note, he said he had no note, the person would be there as soon as the barge arrived.</p>
               <p>JOHN HOPPEY. I belong to this barge. I work under Hearn.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect this timber that was owned at Robinson's wharf - A. Yes, it was brought to the barge by Whitefriars; our barge was laying by the New River wharf, delivering iron pipes, on the London side of the River; who brought that timber there I don't know; I was in the cabin, somebody called Hearn; he went out of the cabin to the man. I did not see the man that brought the timber until he was going away. Hearn came to me and said there was some timber. I said who is it for; he said it was going to Brentford with the barge, to go by Pool's boats. I asked Hearn if there was a note. Hearn said the note would be at Brentford as soon as the barge. We took it up to Brentford. I afterwards saw Honkins come and claim the timber.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Sharp Castle, and keep the Thistle and Crown, High-street, Wapping. The prisoner was our pot<lb></lb>boy for six weeks or two months, and on the 8th of March he asked for a pail to wash the yard—I told him when he had eaten his dinner to come up, and it would be at the top of the stairs—I then went up stairs to dress, came down, found the kitchen door open, and he was gone—I missed half-an-hour after 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which I had left in a drawer in the kitchen, which was not locked, but the door was shut when I went up stairs—the kitchen is on the first-floor—nobody but my family had access to it.</p>

On the 19th of April, between the hours of one and two in the morning the prisoner came with three or four more, they had a glass of gin each; they all went out; the prisoner turned back and asked me to serve her a slice of bread and cheese, I did so; I fell asleep, and awoke in about fifteen or twenty minutes, I found the prisoner gone. I looked in the till, I found all the silver gone, there was between two and three pound; there was one sixpence in particular that I knew, it had been in the till several days. On the next morning I went to the Wheatsheaf in Drury lane, I found the prisoner sitting in the tap-room, I had her taken in custody; she was searched, and a sixpence was found on her marked with the letter S.</p>

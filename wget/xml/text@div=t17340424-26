He said he had pawn'd one Ring in Hemings's Row, and had given 2 more to another Whore at a Bawdy-house in Princes-street; but we could not find her out. He had got 6 s. and 2 pence halfpenny left of all the Money that he robb'd me of, and I bid him keep that, for it might be of Service to him - He confessed that he broke one Lock, and took out my Goods and Money.</p>

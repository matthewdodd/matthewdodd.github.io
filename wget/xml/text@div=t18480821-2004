                  </hi>. I am a ainter, of Bath-place. On 23rd July, I went with Evans to Hampstead—we saw the prisoners in the "George"—as we came out Knight asked him the time—he told him—we went on to the Load of Hay, had some gin, came out, and, half-way down the hill, Evans cried out, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, he has got my watch!"—Evans was on the outside of Knight, we were all close together—he had not got the watch—he made a snatch at it, and they closed—Ward cried out, "Throw the b----, Bill; if you don't I will"—he laid down his umbrella and stick and was going up to help Knight, I stopped him, called "Police!" and gave him in charge—I saw the watch in Knight's hand as they fell the second time—Evans gave him in charge—he said, "I hope you will not give me in custody; it will get me into a deal of trouble"—I did not hear him say anything about a half-crown—they got away from the policeman—Knight fell over a stone, and was taken—I did not see Ward till next day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Tottenham Court-road, and am a shoe<lb></lb>maker—the prisoner was my errand-boy. On the 30th of January I re<lb></lb>marked, when he went out to breakfast, that one of his pockets appeared bulky—he had his great coat on—when he came back he put his great coat on a shelf, and about an hour before dinner-time I felt his great coat, and found in it something like boots or shoes—I then went and spoke to the policeman, the prisoner went out, and the policeman brought him back with these boots.</p>

I waited outside, and took the pri<lb></lb>soner as he was going to dinner—he was putting on his great coat as he came out—he walked from the door buttoning it up—I went to him and asked what he had got in his pocket—he said a pair of boots which he was going to take to Rathbone-place—I asked what house—he said, "No. 18"—I asked him the name of the person—he said he did not know—I asked if they were paid for—he said "Yes"—I asked how much—be said, "6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I asked if he had paid his master the money—he said "Yes"—I took" them from him, took him back to the shop, and asked Mr. Savage if he had given him a pair of boots to take to Rathbone-place, the prisoner then said, "No, I did not say so, I was going to take them to my mother."</p>

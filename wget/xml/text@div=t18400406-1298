On the 10th of March, about nine o'clock at night, I saw the two prisoners looking in at the shop window of Mr. M'Lallan, a jeweller in Broadway, Deptford—I am certain they are the persons—I had never seen either of them before—they left there, and went down High-street, and just before ten o'clock they were both brought to the station-house.</p>

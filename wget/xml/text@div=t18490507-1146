                  </hi> I am of no profession, and live at 498, New Oxford-street. I know the prisoner; I first became acquainted with him on board the steam-packet, when I came from Paris—he told me he did not know English, or where to go, and I told him if my house was not let I would wil<lb></lb>lingly give him a room—he represented himself as a watchmaker, and showed me two unfinished watches which he had—he accepted my offer, and on coming to the house, offered immediately if I had anything to do he would do it, as I was so kind to him—he said he would repair my watch; he did so, and gave it me back—on Wednesday, 25th April, he came and asked me if my watch did not retard—I told him I did not remember whether it gained or lost, because I did not wear it—it was on the chimney-piece—I gave it him and said, "You may look"—he took it up to his own room—I was after<lb></lb>wards going up-stairs and met him coming down—I asked him where he was going—he showed me the watch with the glass broken, and said he was going to get another glass, and went out—that was about half-past seven in the evening, and I never saw him again till he was in custody—I did not miss anything then, but when nine o'clock came I saw his clothes, tools, and watches, and everything was gone, and my wife's watch was gone also—he did not tell me that he was going—I found him on the Saturday following at Stauffers' the watchmakers in the City—I said nothing to him, but he said to me, "For God's sake save me, and I am willing to give you up what I have"—I had told him he had stolen the two watches and a small chain, and he said, "Yes, I did, and I am sorry for it"—he gave me the pawnbroker's tickets—I asked him about my wife's watch, and he said he had exchanged it with a Jew for clothes—I afterwards went with him to a house opposite St. Katherine's-docks; there I found my wife's watch—he showed me the house—I received this letter from him on the Thursday or the Friday (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—I know it to be his writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bar-maid at the White Swan, in Temple-street. I have seen the prisoner there, not as a customer, but coming in, and looking round, and inquiring for persons—I was induced to watch him—he came in about half-past nine o'clock in the morning of the 9th Dec.—he went into the tap-room, the door of which closes of itself—I went into the passage, and opened the door a little way—I saw him distinctly take a knife off the table,</p>

               <p>and put it out of sight behind him—I went into the room, and took hold of him—I said he should not leave the house; he said he would—he threw the knife down, and said he was not going to take the knife away—I called for Mr. Procter.</p>

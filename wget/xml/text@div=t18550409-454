                  </hi>. I am an army saddler, of No. 6, New Coventry street. On Thursday afternoon, 15th March, about 6 o'clock, the prisoner came into our warehouse, and said that he was appointed to the 12th Lancers, and required the necessary outfit—after asking him the necessary appointments, I gave him the order book, in which he wrote the name "Cyril White"—the book is not here—when he was about to go away, he said, "I beg your pardon, Mr. Gibson, but I was too late to get to my agent's, Mr. Collins, before they closed; will you have the kindness to change me a cheque?"—I said, "With a great deal of pleasure; how much do you require?—he said, "20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I gave him a piece of blank paper, and in my presence he wrote this cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "March 12th. Sir,—Please pay Mr. Gibson, or bearer, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which charge to my account. Cyril White, 12th Lancers. To S. Collins, Esq.")—I gave him the money for that on the faith of his being Cyril White, of the 12th Lancers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the detective police. On 27th March, I took the prisoner at No. 91, Norton-street—I told him I was a police officer, and he must consider himself in custody, on a charge of uttering a forged cheque at the shop of Mr. Gibson—he was in bed with a female—he asked me several times to allow him to go to Mr. Gibson, to see if he could settle it—I found some jewellery and other articles there—he gave the name of William Kelly.</p>

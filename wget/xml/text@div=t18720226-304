I am a dairyman, at Hamilton Road, Lower Norwood—Wright was in my employment for a week—I discharged him on 20th January—on 23rd January I saw him and about a dozen others near my place—I went out on Tuesday evening, and returned about 11 o'clock—I found the back door closed, but not securely—I locked it, and left the key in—I went to bed, and came down between 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning—I found the door unlocked and open—I missed a coat, some bread and cheese, and a gold chain from the mantelpiece, twelve order-books, and some meat—I have seen the order-books, and identify them—I was present when Adams was taken into custody—I had seen him the day before the robbery.</p>

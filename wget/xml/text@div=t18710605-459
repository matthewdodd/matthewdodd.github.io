                  </hi>. I was gate-man to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am manager of the firm, and am the son of one of the partners—on the morning of 28th April, between 3.15 and 3.45, I was returning home from a ball, and was going to sleep on the premises—I saw the packing room in a blaze, and the room over it—the flames came through the roof—in the packing room there were goods, previous to delivery, waiting for packing, and straw, and mats, and canvas—after that the fire extended to the mattrass shop and store—this red border represents the part which was nearly entirely consumed—there are two iron folding gates, under an archway, 20ft. high, in Francis Street; the gates only reach to 7 or 8 ft. from the top—the fire did not extend to the gates—anyone could very easily get access to the gates by climbing up the gateway; they would then get access to the yard; the premises generally are round at the yard, the packing room included—the entrance to the packing room is straight opposite anybody going down the gateway—when past the gates, there is no obstacle to getting to the packing room; the door is generally locked, but a person knowing the premises could get in; there is a swing window only hung, and there is also a doorway on the first floor, 9 or 10ft. from the ground, the door of which is generally open, where it is customary for men to go up and down; in fact, it is more natural for the men to go in that way than the other—a person being in the packing room and wishing to return to Alfred Mews would go up the steps and across an iron bridge, through a second little alley, and across the store rooms to the doorway overlooking Alfred Mews; that doorway is 10 ft., and the bottom of the window 2 or 3 ft.—the prisoner has worked for us five years—I had per<lb></lb>sonally no complaint to make of him—he had notice to leave a week before he went, and he left on the Thursday proceeding the fire, which would be the 20th or 21st—I think he went on the night of the 20th; it was Thursday, if Thursday was the 20th—persons were sleeping on the premises, and I should have slept in the dwelling marked on the plan.</p>

Heal &amp; Son's, Tottenham Court Road, last Friday week, 28th April. I got over the gate, and went into the packing-room, and set fire to the place with matches"—I said "Are you telling me the truth?"—he said "I am, man to man; I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, and I don't want anyone to suffer for what I have done myself; I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it, and will suffer for it. I done it because I thought it would make work"—he said all that at once, all at the same time—I again asked him if it was true, what he had told me, and he said that it was—I asked him why he had made the statement to me, and the reason he had not made it before—he said "Because I could not keep it to myself any longer"—I said "Why did you do it?"—he said "Because the Devil tempted me"—I asked him what time it was—he said "About 3.30 in the morning," and he said "I worked for the firm six years"—I took him to Old Street Station, and then to George Street Station, where he made a statement to the Inspector—I did not notice what he said then, but I made</p>

               <p>a memorandum of his statement to me four or fire minutes after I took him, and therefore I am quite certain that that was the substance of what he said—he had been drinking, but he was not drunk—I am quite certain he understood what I said; he seemed to reason with me on the subject very well.</p>

On 8th May, about 7.30 p.m., Simpson brought the prisoner to the station, and said in substance what he has now stated—I said to the prisoner, "Be careful what you say, because this is a very serious matter for any man to confess. You hare heard what the constable states to me: is that true?"—he said "Yes"—I asked his name—he said "George Broomfield," and that he had no certain home—I asked what he was; he said, a labourer, and he worked at Messrs. Heal's for five years, in Tottenham Court Road—I said "Do you still adhere to what you have said to the constable?"—he said "Yes"—I then asked him how he got into the premises—he said "I climbed over the gate in Francis Street, and went to the packing-room"—I asked him how he got from the premises afterwards—he said "I let myself down from the packing-room by a rope"—I said "I think you have been drinking"—he said "No, I have not"—I said "I am afraid you are labouring under some delusion"—he said "I am not"—I then repeated the first caution, and said "This is a very serious matter for any man to confess to"—he said "I know it is"—I then took the charge, and locked him up on his own confession of setting fire to Messrs. Heal's premises—when I first asked him his reason, he said that he did it to make work—I said "Oh, nonsense; Mr. Heal, no doubt, is insured to the full extent"—he then said "To prevent other people being accused"—he did not seem drunk at all; he seemed quite composed, and quite rational—I said that he had been drinking; that was from his general appearance, and his face appeared flushed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Messrs.

I am sorry to say it is entirely through drink; it was drink which caused me to give myself up, and my object in doing so was to get into a gaol to get away from drink, little thinking of the consequences, or what would become of me.

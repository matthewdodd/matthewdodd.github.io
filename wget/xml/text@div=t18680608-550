                  </hi>. I am a farmer, living at Lewisham—the two prisoners were labourers in my employment—on Thursday, the 7 th May last, I found the skin of a lamb under some bushes in a field where my lambs are kept—the prisoners live on the farm, and there is a cooking-house for the convenience of the men—there are cupboards in the cooking house—the prisoners have one cupboard between them—in consequence of some suspicion I went with a policeman, between 11 and 12 on the night of the 10th, to the cooking-house—there was a pot stewing on the fire, with two necks of lamb, and two ribs in it—in the prisoner's cupboard I found a leg of lamb cooked, and a shoulder uncooked—there was a basket hanging up with another shoulder in it—I then went home, and left two constables to watch—on the morning of the 11th the prisoners were taken into custody, and I charged them with stealing the lamb—Webb said he bought it at Bromley—Johnson said he found the lamb cast in a furrow, and had dressed it—I asked him what he had done with the skin—he said he had put it in a hedge near Strawberry-hill gate—I found it in an adjoining field, in a ditch some distance from where he told me—it was the skin of a lamb 10 or 11 weeks old—I know the skin to be mine—it had been recently killed—the lamb was worth about 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if he found the lamb cast in a furrow it would be his duty to bring it to me.</p>

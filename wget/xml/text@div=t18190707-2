             Castlereagh. On the 15th of June, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come out of the pantry, I caught him by the arm, asked him what he was doing there, and who he wanted to see? he said he had seen the gentleman inside the pantry. I asked him again, and he made the same answer. The under-butler called me, I let the prisoner go and went to him; on coming out again I missed a silver soup-plate off the pantry table, which I had put there just before. The prisoner was gone, I went in pursuit, and a person gave me information. I saw the prisoner go into Cleveland-yard, I followed as quick as I could, and on entering the yard Revell gave me information, and I found the prisoner behind the cistern in the yard - I collared him, and found the plate lying on his toes, on the pavement. He fell on his knees, begged pardon, asked me to beat him well, and said he would never do so again. I took him back, and gave him in charge of his Lordship's steward, who gave the prisoner and plate to Green.</p>

About a quarter before five o'clock I saw the prisoner running down Cleveland-yard, with the plate under his coat; I saw him take it out from under his coat, and go behind a cistern in the yard - M'Donald came up, I pointed him out, and he collared him. The prisoner pulled off his coat, fell on his knees, and begged he would give him a good flogging, and let him go, saying it was the first time.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the 15th of June M'Donald fetched me. I received the plate from the butler in the prisoner's presence - he fell on his knees, and begged of the butler to forgive him. His Lordship's house is in the parish of St. James, Westminster, in the liberty of the Dean and Chapter. The plate weighs twenty ounces and a half, and is worth about 5 l.</p>

               <p>As I was going home, on the 3d of April at night, the prisoner met me in East Smithfield, it was between ten and eleven; she asked me to go to her house, I went with her, and there was another woman in the room, and she went out directly; then the prisoner called her, and gave her some money to fetch some gin, while she was gone for gin, I felt the money in my right hand-breeches pocket; I had four guineas and an half, I am sure of that, and I had 4 s. 6 d. in my left hand pocket which was left.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you quite sober? - As sober as I am this minute; then the woman came back with the gin, and we drank it between us three, after we had drank it, we went to bed together, she and I did; the other went out of the room directly, as soon as we had drank the gin; then we come down stairs together, I went to go out of the passage, and the door was locked, I was not half an hour with her in all, and she went away directly, says she, I will go and fetch the key, and I put my hand in my pocket, and missed my money, and immediately ran after her, but she went into some corner or another, I could not find her, then I returned to the house, and the other woman, that was in the room whose name is

            , and the next evening she told where the prisoner could be found.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the other woman searched? Yes, Sir, we searched the bed where we was on, and nothing was found upon that woman, one of Mr. Green's runners was with me.</p>
               <p>How long was that after? - Not five minutes.</p>
               <p>Had you your cloaths on or off? - On.</p>
               <p>Where had you sat in the room, while<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178304300055"></xptr> you was drinking the gin? - In the room by the bed, the other woman stood up and emptied it out, and never was in the room while I came in only to bring the gin.</p>
               <p>Did you search the bed thoroughly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Examine every thing? - Examined every thing all round the room.</p>
               <p>The money could easily have dropped from your pocket in the situation you was? - If it had fell out, I should have found it on the bed.</p>
               <p>That is another matter, but you was in such a situation, that it might easily have fallen out? - I do not think it could have fallen out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Do not you? - No, I think it could not.</p>
               <p>What did you search the bed for then? To be at a certainty.</p>
               <p>Why certainly might not it very easily have fallen out of your pocket? - My pocket is very deep, I do not think it could very easily have fallen out.</p>
               <p>Was not your breeches unbuttoned, Sir? Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you find the prisoner? - On the Friday night, and she had some silver in her pocket, but she had new things on; she gave the man half-a-crown to speak to the Justice for her, she had new shoes on; she said, she was in the room with me, but she never had any of the money.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I met the man, and he had like to have stumbled up against me; says I, master, do not stumble over me; he said, where are you going, can I go with you, he went with me, and I went into the young woman's room, that was on the same floor with me, and he gave her sixpence to get a quartern of gin, I said, I am a misfortunate woman, what are you going to do says he, I do not want to do any thing; he stretched himself out backwards upon the bed; says he, I want to sleep with you all night, says I, I have let my bed out all night; says he, I will go with you, and pay for a bed; we came down stairs, there was some music, some organ, and a parcel of young girls, he went into the room among them, several of them come, and twisted their hands round him: Indeed, Sir, I have nobody in the world in London; my father and mother live in Tunbridge in Kent; so please God Almighty, that created me in the Kingdom of Heaven to bless you.</p>
               <p>Court. Is this true of this dancing? - I heard music, but it was not in the same house.</p>

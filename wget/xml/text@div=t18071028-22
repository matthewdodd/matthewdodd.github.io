               <p>Q. When did you miss these things. - A. On the 28th of September I missed them; on the 26th she came to ask me to buy a duplicate of a gown pledged at Mr. Morriss's in the Minories, I refused it, I did not like to do it; she said she had lately buried a child of five months old, and her husband was on board a ship, she was in great distress, she begged hard of me to let her have sixpence, she said she had not broke her fast that day; I gave her sixpence; she left me the duplicate. On the 28th she called, she asked me if I had been to take out the gown in pledge I told her I had not, I was very busy a sewing; I asked to stop a bit and help me to sew, which she did; I gave her tea and sixpence for helping me to sew from three o'clock till eight; after tea I went to put my children to bed and left her behind; while I was putting the children to bed she came up stairs to me and she brought up the quilt, which I set her to mend, and bid me good night; I did not follow her down stairs immediately; about a quarter of an hour after she was gone, another person came in with some work; with that I looked for a little coat and waistcoat that I had made to shew to the person, and then I missed it; as soon as the person went out, I made a search but could not find it; I missed my own articles as well. I went to two pawnbrokers the same night, she had not been there; they advised me to go early into the Minories, where the gown was pledged, that she brought me the duplicate of; when I went to the shop, she had not been there; then I was gone to another pawnbrokers a few doors of, in the mean time she came to Mr. Morriss's in the Minories; they stopped her and came to me at the next shop, as they knew I was gone there, when I came to Mr. Morriss's shop, she had got my things tied up in a large handkerchief, and the shawl on her neck; she was taken in custody; on the 29th the coat and waistcoat were found at another pawnbrokers.</p>

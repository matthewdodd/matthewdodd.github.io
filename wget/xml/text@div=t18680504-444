                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Maynard, Chalmer's Terrace, Stoke Newington—We had a lodger named Alfred Goldstone—on Saturday, 18th April, I went out with my husband, about 4 o'clock—I had locked the house up; as I went out at the front door I tried it—we returned about 11, and found the door was bolted on the inside—while we were there Mr. and Mrs. Goldstone came up, and they could not open it—my husband and Goldstone went round to the back of the house, and let us in—I helped to search the down stairs part of the house, as much as I was able—I was very much frightened, and I went out into the street to the front of the house—I saw the first floor window raised, and a man's head came out—the man was the prisoner; I am sure of that—he got across the window and dropped—as he fell I caught hold of his coat, but he got away—Mr. Goldstone came down at my screaming, and we ran after him—I saw him caught—I never lost sight of him—I lost half a sovereign and two rings.</p>

               <p>Saturday night I went out with my wife, a little before Mr. and Mrs. Maynard went out—I returned a little after 11, and found them at the door—Mr. Maynard and I went round to the back, and got in at a back window—we opened the door, and let the others in—I searched the ground floor, but found nothing there—I then went up stairs to the back room, and found a bag on the bed, full of clothes—in consequence of hearing cries of "Murder" and "Police," I ran down stairs, and saw the prisoner running away; I pursued him, and caught him—I never lost sight of him—he did not try to get away, but tried to make himself very strange—I took him to the station—I afterwards went back to the house, and missed my watch; it was on the mantelshelf when I went out—I found it at the police-station on the Sunday morning.</p>

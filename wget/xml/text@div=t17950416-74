My shopman came up to me and said there was a man below who wanted to give an other for a couple of gold watches, and he was recommended to me by one Mr. Goudge, I told him I was so ill I could not speak to him, and told him to take the order. He went down and came up again, and said I must come down and take the order, I was so ill I could not, I then desired him to come up to me.</p>


               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come up? - He did, and I desired him to take a chair and to sit down, and he gave me instructions for a couple of gold watches, for forty guineas a piece, and that they must be ready in three weeks a time, that the ship was ready to sad that he was to go in; I took the order after shewing him watches of different forms; I had a number hanging up in my room before he came up. After I had fully agreed with him of the form and size of the watches, I proposed to take down his direction; while I was standing, half standing and half sitting, he made a snatch at one of the gold watches, and he made away with it down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any when he made a snatch? - Yes, one of them; (I value it at thirty guineas. And immediately ran down stairs, my shopman came up at this time, and told me mere was a man down stairs that wanted me, to speak to me; I told him that the man that had come up stairs had taken a gold watch, and ran<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160198"></xptr>down stairs. He had given me his name as Thompson, and the watches were to be sent to Dice's Key.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man? - Perfectly sure</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before that? - Never before that time; I am perfectly sure he is the man; he snatched the watch, I looked immediately and the watch was gone; I was so ill at the time I could not follow him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this that you heard of this man being in custody? - I cannot say how long, I fancy it must be about three weeks, I think it is thereabouts, but the person who took him is a person belonging to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did you attend against him? - Once at Bow street, and once at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. How many examinations did he go through there? - Only them two I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you swear to him each time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - Perfectly sure.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance of time were the examinations from each other? - I cannot recollect that; it was the first time in Bow-street, and the second time in Guildhall; it was just at the time of the sessions breaking up, the sessions before this. The alderman wanted me to attend the grand jury, but I was told that the session was broke up that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your watch? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any bell near you? - I had, but I did not ring for fear of the servant not coming immediately, not knowing what I wanted.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you cry out? - I cried out stop, and he said I will call to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you so ill that you could not attend to the features of the person? - Not so ill as that, I attended to his features every part.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is in the business with you? - None, nobody but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were these watches from you at the time that the snatch was made at one of them? - It was three yards from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in bed at that time? - No. The watch was three yards from me, and he was standing at a right angle from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you nearer the door than he? - No, pretty near the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch taken? - I did not see the watch in his hand, I missed it and looked, and see the watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you make your own watches? Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these watches in the shop? - I was in the room up one pair of stairs, I have a shop below.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This is a base metal watch? - A gold watch, there was a stamp on it, both the cases were gold.</p>

I told him I did not think that we had any at present that were quite complete: he told me that he wanted some gold stop watches to take with him to India, and that he had been recommended to Mr. Jordan to make some for him I went up stairs to inform Mr. Jordan that there was a person wanted some watches; I came down and told the prisoner that we had none at present ready, and that we had some that would be ready in a short time,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160199"></xptr>had desired him to give me his address. He wrote his address "Mr. Thompson, at Dice Key, Thames-street," on a state which we had in the shop; he then desired me to go up again, and ask how long it would be before they were ready, as he should set fail in March; which I did, and came down, and desired him to walk up stairs; he went up stairs, and was with Mr. Jordan about the space of ten minutes, he then came down stairs, and went out in a hurry, as soon as he was gone, Mr. Jordan told me he stole a watch, he asked me to go and look after him, I did so, and came back and told him I could not find him, he sent me down to Mr. Bolt, the Wharfinger of Dice Key.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, of East Greenwich—on 1st Sep<lb></lb>tember I travelled from London Bridge to Cannon Street, in a South-Eastern Railway carriage—Alfred Brooker was with me—we took no ticket—I went up to the gate when the prisoner was stationed at Cannon Street, and paid him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for myself and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for my friend—that was from Greenwich to Cannon Street, as it is a rule of the Company to charge from the place from whence the train starts—he did not offer me any receipt—on 6th September I travelled from London Bridge to Cannon Street by South-eastern Railway in a Woolwich train—I left by the same gate where the prisoner was standing, and paid him 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me no receipt, nor did he offer to give me one—I did not ask for one.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a ticket inspector of the South-Eastern Railway at Cannon Street—the prisoner was a ticket collector, and it was his duty to receive excess fares from passengers and enter them in a small book—he ought to give receipts to the persons paying—it is my duty to collect from each ticket collector the money received on the previous day.</p>

It was his duty to ask the person paying if he will take a receipt; if not, he walks on—the person can send the receipt to the Company if he has been overcharged; if it is correct he can keep the receipt—the receipt is the counterpart of the check.</p>

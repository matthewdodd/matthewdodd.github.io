On Saturday, 1st February, I ap<lb></lb>prehended the prisoner in the Crescent-grove, Clapham-road, not on this charge—on searching him I found this certificate; I took it from him, and showed it to him—he said it was his discharge in 1859—(<hi rend="italic">This certified that sergeant William Brown, born at Cheltenham, was enlisted in the 59th regiment on ith May, 1847, at the age of eighteen; that he had served twelve years and two hundred and ten days, and was discharged, in comequence of disability, not being fit for further service; dated Table Bay, 14th October, 1859; character very good. Signed H. H. Graham</hi>)—I was in plain clothes at the time—when I endeavoured to take him he struck me in the chest; I still held to him; we both rolled together in the mud, and I had all my knuckles nearly knocked to pieces; he was very violent—I told him I was a police-constable, and I should take him into custody for begging of gentle<lb></lb>man—he said, "Do you think I am a b—fool; you have been watching me for some time"—in the struggle a gentleman came up, and asked what was the matter—I told him the prisoner had been begging—the prisoner said "I did not"—the gentleman said, "You did, for I am one of the</p>

I am a physician, in Abbey-road, St. John's-wood—about the end of June last, the prisoner came to me, my servant came and informed me that Sergeant Brown, of the 59th regiment, wished to see me—I immediately went to the outer door, and saw the prisoner—he stated that he was a discharged Sergeant Brown, and that he recognised me as the medical officer of the 59th rifles—I had a recollec<lb></lb>tion of most of the men, and I listened to him—he stated that he was in bad health, and could I afford him some assistance—I aaked how he came to leave the regiment, and asked him for his discharge—he produced this document, and, recognising the name of Colonel Graham, whom I personally knew, and the character being good, I sympathised with the man, and gave him a shilling, suggesting that he should go to Colonel Graham for further assistance; and I myself wrote to Colonel Graham—the prisoner came to me again in November—I asked him if he bad been to Colonel Graham—he said no, and I would not assist him further—I had previously received a communication from Colonel Graham—I gave the shilling on the strength of that certificate, the character being stated to be very good, and that he was a discharged soldier of the regiment that I had been in some degree associated with.</p>

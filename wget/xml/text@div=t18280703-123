There were six 5s. papers of halfpence on our counter, on the 9th of June, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; Thompson and Kent came in, and asked for 6d. worth of halfpence for a sixpence: I went to the till, and turned my back a little to them, while I counted the halfpence; they went out, and I missed the money from the counter; Penny came in immediately - I and our man went out about a quarter of a mile, and there took Thompson; several persons were with him, but I cannot say whether the other prisoners were among them; part of the copper was found in his pocket - I am certain Thompson and Kent are the lads who came in; the money was gone the moment they turned their backs.</p>

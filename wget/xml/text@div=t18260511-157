            . I am a watchman of Staines. On the 22d of January I returned home from my beat, and, in consequence of some suspicion, I changed my clothes, and went back to my beat, and saw the prisoner in a yard, with a sack on his shoulder; I asked what he had got - he said a sack of oats he had brought from Mr. Dexter's - I ran to see if any body was up at Dexter's, but they were all in bed; I returned and saw him putting the sack into a cart, and covering it with some hay - he then went away, and I took the oats to Mr. Dexter's, and he said he believed they were Mr. Jones', and grew at Longwood.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose oats did the prisoner say they were? A. Mr. Dexter's; I afterwards went to Mr. Jones', and saw the premises he had lost them from - here is a sample of the oats the prisoner had got.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you help the prisoner in with the oats? A. No; he did not say he believed they came from Mr. Dexter's. I have known him three or four years; I have never heard anything against him - I believe he gave himself up voluntarily.</p>

In September last I and Mr. Goring bought some oats, which were growing - there were twenty-nine quarters, and we divided them; I had fourteen quarters and a half - I missed some on Sunday, the 22d of January - the constable afterwards brought me a sample which I compared with what I had, and they appeared to be the same sort - I saw the sack, and have not the least doubt but is was mine - I had seen it on Saturday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many oats did you miss? A. From five to seven quarters at different times; I keep them in a loft over a cart house; I saw them on the Saturday night; they were in bulk - I saw the bulk had decreased about one sack from the Saturday night, and there was a hole where it had been taken from, and the sack which had been placed to keep them from rolling about was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you not a servant of the name of Ben Rush? A. Yes - he went away that evening - I had charged a constable with him, but he got away, and we have not heard of him since; there is a fence six feet high round my premises. The prisoner has been in my house on business from his uncle - I believe he was born at Staines, and I never heard anything against him - his brother came on Sunday morning, and told me if I had any charge against him, he would come and give himself up.</p>
               <p>COURT to JOSEPH GREENER. Q. What time in the morning did you see the prisoner? A. Between five and seven o'clock, about two hundred yards from Mr. Jones'.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you tried to find Ben Rush? A. Yes, but I could not.</p>

            . I live at Staines. I never entrusted the prisoner with the care of any oats - he has sometimes had a bushel for his uncle; he might have had some oats of me at the beginning of January, but never on a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I met the prosecutor's servant carrying a sack of oats - he asked me to carry them, which I did, and finding them heavy I put them over Mr. Seabrook's pailing; I found them gone, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110061"></xptr>watchman said they were Mr. Jones' - I went to his servant, and told him - he has absconded.</p>

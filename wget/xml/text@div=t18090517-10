             came in; they asked to drink with me, I said they might; after that we had a third pint, then I paid my shot, and returned out of the house, into the street. They immediately followed me out, and said if I would go with them, they would treat me with a pot of beer, as I had treated them. I went along with them, expecting I was going to a public house; they took me to a private house, and said they would not stop in the kitchen, I went up stairs with them, into a room on the right hand; immediately I got into the room, the servant girl of the house, demanded three shillings of me, for the use of the room. When I found where I was, I said I would pay it, if they would let me go; I gave the servant girl a five shilling piece, she gave me two shillings in change; I then wished to go; Wells said I should not go without paying them as for the room; I gave her a shilling, and begged to go; she said I should not go unless I gave her a seven shilling piece; I told her I had no money about me; she then struck me over my mouth and nose with her open hand, and downed me on the floor. I cried out murder; immediately a man entered the room, and said if I cried out any more, he would take me into custody; I told him I was robbed of all I had.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were down, did any body do any thing to you - A. I cannot possibly swear that I felt them take the money from me; but when I got up, I had none.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you in your pocket when you went into that house - A. I had five guineas; I felt it when I put my hand into my pocket to give the girl a five shilling piece. I came down stairs, there was a great crowd about the door; I told them all I was robbed, some person went for an officer; the officer was nearly two hours before he came. I did not stir from the door all that time; some woman came out of the house between the time of the officers coming, and the people at the door asked me if that was one of them, I said it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you lay down on the ground, after you were knocked down with this blow - A. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Now young man, you talk of drinking three or four pints of beer - what had you been drinking all the day - A. I had drank part of four or five pots of beer along with a friend; I was in liquor, but I very well knew what I did.</p>
               <p>Q.From this blow of a woman with her open hand,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170014"></xptr>how came you to lay on the ground so long as a quarter of an hour - A. Wells kept on the top of me, and Dix she bore a hand to help her to keep me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any bed in this room - A. I cannot tell; I never saw any bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you oath, had you used no familiarity with this woman, or either of them - A. None at all. I am a single man.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts was this house - A. In Shire-lane, up an alley.</p>
               <p>Dix. I would wish the prosecutor to say when we were in the wine vaults, whether or no I spoke to him - A. You did; you asked me which of you I would have; I told you I did not wish to have either of you.</p>

            , came into the house with this young man, on a Thursday in this month, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I cannot tell the day of the month. I followed them up stairs; they went into a first floor room, of the right hand side, there was a bed in it; Wells told the young man to pay for the room, he asked me what it was, I said three shillings, he gave me a five shilling piece, and I gave him two shillings in change; they shut the door, and I came down stairs; when I had been down stairs about two minutes, I heard a noise up stairs, as if they were disputing, and the cry of murder; I think three times; it was a man's voice, and loud enough for me to hear it very plain. When I went up stairs, I saw Wells strike him; they were both standing up then; I never saw him fall down; I said she had better let him alone, and let him go out of the house quietly; she insisted that he should not go away from the house. Dix was in the room, they were all three of them in the room together. Then I went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember some man in the house that went up stairs - A. There was a man in the house that ran up stairs the same as I did, to see what was the matter; he came in by chance, I had not seen him above three or four times; I understood he was a waiter. I believe he was a stranger to the prisoners; the prisoners neither of them lodged at our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Now young woman, you say you saw this man come in your house, and you saw him go out of the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he appear to you, to be drunk or sober - A. He did not appear to me to be intoxicated; as he was going down stairs on the landing place, I heard him say he had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners - A. I know them by sight; I saw Wells once in the house before; I do not know that ever I saw the other in house before. When the young man went out, he stood at the door a great while; there was a great mob about the door; I do not recollect any woman going out of the house while he stood at the door.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took charge of the two women, and the man that was with them. I searched Wells, there was only one shilling and two or three halfpence in her pocket; Dix had only a penny piece about her; they were both sitting in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the bed-room - A. No, they were not in the bed-room at the time I came in.</p>
               <p>Well's Defence. I went into this wine vaults, the young man was there; he immediately asked me to have some of his porter; he afterwards asked me to go with him; I went with him into the house, he cruelly ill-treated me; I resented it; he said he would not let me go out of the room, untill he had connection with me to his satisfaction; he said if I would not, he would do for me, if it cost him fifty pound. Then he accused me of robbing of him.</p>
               <p>Dix's Defence. I promiscuously met with this lady in Fleet-street; she asked me to take something to drink; I told her I could drink nothing but a small glass of wine; I went with her into the wine vaults; that young man was there, he asked her to drink, and she asked me to drink; I did not. He asked her to go with him, she went with him; I believe she would not have gone if she had not been a little elevated in liquor. I saw a bed in the room; I said, young man, you do not want two women. I went down to the landlady; there was a man sitting behind the door; shortly after that I heard a voice call out murder; I went to the stairs and said what is the matter, she said this man has very ill treated me; he immediately accused us of robbing him; he went to the door and called for a watchman; a mob came about the door, I would not quit the house until I was searched, the officer searched me and found a penny; they searched this lady and found a shilling.</p>

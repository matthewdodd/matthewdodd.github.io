                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter carriers, at the General Post-office—the prisoner was a letter sorter—I was on duty on Saturday 15th Sept—the prisoner was on duty—he was engaged that morning sort<lb></lb>ing letters—the sorting commences at 5 o'clock, and generally ends between 7 and 8 o'clock—the prisoner first sorted letters that morning in the Inland-office—my attention was not called to him in that office, but in the Letter Carriers'-office from about 20 minutes to half past 7 o'clock, and in consequence of that I desired a strict watch to be kept upon him—communica<lb></lb>tions were afterwards made to me, and the prisoner was brought into my private room by Robinson about 8 o'clock—Mr. Swift and See the officers were present—I told the prisoner I had reason to believe he had a letter or letters in his pocket, which did not belong to him—he said he had not—I asked him if he had any objection to be searched—he said, "No, but I changed my coat this morning"—he was searched, and the officer took two letters from his breast pocket inside his coat—one is addressed to Mr. Tuck, and bears the post mark of Fincham—the London stamp is dated the 15th Sept.—the other letter is to Mr. Toomer, and bears the same date, which shows they had been sorted that morning—they both contained coin—the prisoner might have sorted these letters—when they were taken out of hit pocket, he said he had changed his coat, he could not account for their being in his pocket, some one must have placed them there—when he said he had changed his coat, I said, "You know better than that; you have been working in that coat the whole of the morning"—I do not bow what he said to that—I gave him in charge to the officer—he had been working in that coat the whole morning—I believe it to be the same coat he has on now.</p>

                  </hi>. I was on duty in the General Post-office on Saturday morning, 15th Sept.—I saw the prisoner come at 5 o'clock—he went on duty in the Inland-office—I continued sorting letters these till 10 minutes or a quarter past 7 o'clock—the prisoner was there in the same employ—about a quarter past 7 o'clock he left the Inland-office for the Letter Carriers'-office—at that time he had some letters in his hand—the Letter Carriers'-office is at the top of the building—in consequence of instructions I had received from Mr. Clare, I watched the prisoner—I saw that he refused to ascend with any one else—he waited for an opportunity to go by himself—I observed the other men go up at the time he did—there was plenty of room for him to have gone up at the same time—he went up about a quarter past 7 o'clock—I went up by the next lift—I remained in the Letter Carriers'-office about forty minutes—the prisoner was there, retorting the letters—about 5 minutes before 8 o'clock I saw the prisoner again—I had not lost sight of him above five minutes—he took some letters, and went down by the machine again—I followed him by the next drop—he went as far as the Inland-office, and then returned, with the letters in his hand—they were the same letters that he brought down that he took up again—that is not regular; it is quite otherwise—I made a communication to Mr. Clare, and the prisoner was brought into Mr. Clare's office.</p>

               <p>Q.Who was in the shop at the time - A. Only a boy belonging to the shop, he is not here. I took out the box of handkerchiefs and shewed her some; she told me to cut her off two, she put her basket on the counter. I saw her basket go off the counter to the ground; a few minutes after I saw her putting a piece of handkerchiefs into her apron, upon which I ordered the boy to search her basket, he opened the cloth in the basket, the boy pulled out four silk handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before you observed her putting a piece of silk handkerchiefs into her apron - A. After.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you observe her put something into the cloth - A. No, into her apron, I did not suspect that she had got any thing until I saw the handkerchiefs go into her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she buy any thing - A. No, she had not money enough without calling again. These are the four handkerchiefs she had in the basket, they are worth a pound, five shillings a piece is the cost price, they are my master's property.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL THOMAS. I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to me at the watchouse, I searched her, and found nothing on her but a penny.</p>

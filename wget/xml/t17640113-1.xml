            . I am in partnership with Stafford Briscoe; the prisoner came to our shop, on the 10th of December, about noon, and wanted to look at some diamond rings; we could not agree; he went out without buying any. I immediately missed one of a particular pattern, worth 8 guineas: I went out to see for him, and found him in Mr. Townsend's shop. in St. Paul's Churchyard, offering to sell it. I took him before my Lord Mayor; there he acknowledged he did take it. (The ring produced, and deposed to).</p>

            . I am a goldsmith, and live in St. Paul's Church-yard. The prisoner at the bar came into my shop, on the 10th of December, about 12 o'clock, and offered this ring to sale, saying, it was a friend's of his, who gave 16 l. for it. I told him it was not worth above half that money. Mr. Morrison came in immediately, and charged him with stealing it. The prisoner acknowledged he took it from his shop.</p>

               <p>I happened to go into this shop; I wanted a ring; we could not agree; I went out with one upon my finger, not thinking I had it there; I went to the other gentleman's shop, where I had before bought some other goods. As soon as I was in the shop, I found this ring on my finger; I asked him what was the value of it? he said, how much do you ask for it? I said it is not mine. I intended to come back again with it. He told me it was not worth half the money.</p>
               <p>Q. to Townsend. Are you sure he wanted to sell it?</p>
               <p>Townsend. I am sure he said he wanted to sell it for his friend.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Translation of Letter marked A.</hi>—My Prince,—I permit myself once again to write to you these few lines. I had the honor to receive at my house a gentleman whom I had not the honor to know any more in Paris than in London; but from his conversation he proved to me that he was sent by you to know my intention to be useful to you. I have not told it to any one. I would only confide myself to you alone; but as it is so, I confess to you that which I beg of you not to make known to any one whatever, as you are often surrounded by persons who for money deceive you, but to you alone I confide myself, and without interest for me. My Prince,—Napoleon the Little, whom they call thus at Strasbourg, has given me the idea of an assassin, which he was My instruction was not to search deeply into politics, as I know them now; but at Boulogne, when I read his mode of acting, that man forced me to shut up in my heart an eternal hate. You, who exposed your days to go and fetch the ashes of his Uncle for the service of France, and whose property to-day he has dared to sell, which no king has done. He has acted as an assassin and a thief at the same time. You know it, my Prince, better than I, as you are the first victim. You are deprived of seeing your country, you and your dear family; you, who had exposed your life several times, you are more unfortunate than a workman who wanders from country to country. I do not seek to flatter you; believe it well; for if you knew me you would see it. You will believe, perhaps, that I do this out of interest. No; for I have been unfortunate in London, and I have never asked anything of anybody, but ten shillings which the French Society had the goodness to give me, from the moment that my wife had remained three months in bed; and I, I had no work; and it is Mr. Munier who forced me to make the request, which he supported. In fine, I cut it short. I am going to depart for Paris; my voyage is for you alone; I swear it upon the tomb of my mother and of my father. Life is to me a charge and a burden, to be no longer borne; I must utilize it, and you shall see it. My Prince, I have my wife, who is seventeen years old; I would place her under your protection. I have sought out a motive to her for the voyage: she consents to it; but the poor child, she will be the only victim of my project. But I sleep no more: <hi rend="italic">I alone I must change this base wretch; he and all who surround him must he blown up. It is a thing which oppresses me much to be an assassin; but it must be, though I should be forced to sell my last shirt.</hi> I write to you while my poor wife has gone out. I hasten to finish. Could you but read in my heart the sentiments that I have for you and your dear</p>

               <p>family. Adieu, my Prince; and all that I desire is that you should be soon on a throne, to render the people more happy than they are, and all France. I think to leave soon, and you will have news of me later in your name, which no one will know, I hope. <hi rend="smallCaps">RAYNAUD DE QUETEVILLE</hi>.

               <p>("<hi rend="italic">Translation of Letter marked B.</hi>—My Lord,—I permit myself to write to you these last lines before my departure. I have collected the little money that is due to me, but it is not sufficient for the idea I have, and which is infallible as to me alone; I charge myself to blow up the tyrant and his accomplices and all the persons around him. I am as sure of it as of the day I must die. My Lord, do not believe that I am seeking to deceive you, as I have no want of that, but I will give you the best guarantees for the advances you may make me. I leave my furniture, I leave my wife who has property of 12,000 francs, without that which comes back to her, and a good business which I have, I employ several workmen; in short, my Lord, it is money I want, not a large sum, I want 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I give right to whomever may see me in France, in another country, to stab me where he may find me, if I have not done that which I must do, to change the government of France; I swear it by all that I have dearest to me on earth; in short Monsieur, that which I do is for your family and your worthy mother, as she is so good to her countrymen; it is for you, you alone, you are capable of rendering the workman happy, and to make return your family. I am about to leave on Saturday, but I wait your reply. I have been to Claremont, but I was not able to get to you as they told me that you were out. I spent 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but what of that I rely upon you, I beg of you to send me your reply by your Secretary, if you consider desirable. I have arranged my affairs ready to depart. I send you my passport to letyousee that I am not proscribed nor a thief, and that I was established at Paris before the cursed Republic, which caused my misery and yours. In short, my Prince, I rely on your goodness, and you may rely on me as upon yourself. I beg of you to give me a reply, the soonest that may be possible to you, as I only wait for that to depart and to prove to you that I am not a man who bends with fear. I rely again on your discretion as I shall be sure to fall if it is known. My Lord, you will see if the Raynauds are cowards, and if they know how to keep a secret. I beg of you to believe me, your all devoted servant. <hi rend="smallCaps">RAYNAUD</hi>. Sherrard-place, No. 4, Golden-square. ")</p>

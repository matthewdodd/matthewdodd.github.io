               <p>GEORGE GRIGG. I am shopman to Mrs. Davis; I packed up the candles in a box, and weighed them, five dozen, and two dozen pound of moulds, that is eighty-four pounds. They were afterwards taken to the house of Mrs. Smith, 204, Tottenham-court-road. I directed the box for Miss West, Hampstead, to go by the Hampstead coach. I ordered them to be left at Mrs. Smith's, 204, Tottenham-court-road.</p>

            . I live with my mother, 204, Tottenham-court-road At our house we take in parcels to be taken by the Hampstead coach. I took in a box directed for Miss West of Hampstead; when the lad brought the box, I desired him to send somebody; in consequence of which Mrs. Davis came, and after that Grigg came; he went to a neighbour's house until I sent for him; in about half an hour after that, the prisoner came; he said I have come for those things for Miss West. I said to him, it is a box; he said it is a box; he asked me where it was; I said it was in the parlour, if he would come and take it. He came, and lifted the box up by the rope from where it was into the middle of the room, and at the time Grigg came into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he move it completely from the place where it was before - A. Yes, he moved it about a yard; I had sent for Gregory, and Gregory came in and laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never moved the box at all.</p>
               <p>MISS SMITH. I am sure he moved it full a yard from where it was before.</p>
               <p>Q. to Grigg. You were sent for by the last witness to come over - A. I took him; he confessed the two notes were written by him; I shewed him the two notes; he said they were his own writing; I took him into custody; he was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Davis. Do you know the prisoner's hand writing - A. I think the notes are his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these candles - A. Four pounds is an under value</p>

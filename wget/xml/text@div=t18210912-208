            . I am servant to Mr. Royer. On the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182109120104"></xptr>14th of September, between two and three o'clock, I was in the kitchen, my mistress said there was some woman gone out with something. I ran out, the prisoner was pointed out to me going up Portland-place. I went up and asked if she had not been in the poulterer's shop, she said Yes; she had made a mistake, and took the wrong coat, and was bringing it back, that she had left her own there for 1 s., then she said, she went in and saw this coat, and thinking it was hers, she took it. I said she took it without seeing any body; she said she saw the good lady. She had left no coat in our shop - I do not know her. It was taken from the parlour - it could not be seen without coming into the parlour behind the shop.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and took her in charge; she said she left her coat at a poulterer's for sixpence, and could not tell the shop. I went to several poulterer's, nobody knew her.</p>

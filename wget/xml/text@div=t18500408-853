                  </hi>. I am a cork-cutter by trade. On that occasion I was one of Mr. Lee's professional gentlemen—I was fighting combats—I had a sword—I was not in a combat then—we were about to commence a quadrille—that was part of the performance—we had female partners—we had had a combat—I was standing on the platform when the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> commenced by one of the soldiers striking a gentleman on the hat—he looked round, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185004080144"></xptr>
               <p>then another soldier struck him—the gentleman came over towards the plat<lb></lb>form, my master begged him to go away, and then they turned round upon my master, and began on him—one of them (Evans) struck me across the instep, and Jamieson struck at my master, but missed him—they then began throwing oyster-shells and other things at the lamps, and the people and things on the stage—I was struck on the face, and was very bad—as soon as I got the blow, I made the best of my way to get out—they were kicking up a disturbance on the Monday and Tuesday occasionally; but on Wednesday, 3rd April, it became dreadful—I noticed them meeting people, and striking them with a cane, and then laugh at it; and if any respectable young girls were going by, hitting them under the chin to make them bite their tongue, which I suppose they call a <hi rend="italic">lark.</hi>

                  </hi>. I was at the show—between six and seven o'clock it was my duty to come out, and play in the front—I came out—there was a disturbance between the soldiers and the civilians, and there was a general rush towards the stage—I sat down, and was kicked when down by O'Brien.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the commencement of the affair, it began about ten minutes before six o'clock—I saw a body of soldiers coming down the centre of the fair, driving all before them—there was a gentleman looking at our show, and he was struck over the hat; and before he could recover himself, he was struck with a stick by Grippen—the soldiers were determined to have a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—I had noticed them doing the same, two days before—they knew that a person could not resist such a body of them; but this gentleman recovered, and he thrashed the soldier who struck his hat—another came up, and he thrashed him—a third came up, and he began to thrash him; but a party came up, and Mr. Lee said, "Let him come up here"—then one of the soldiers said, "Let us pull his b—y show down"—that was Leraon—then another man said it—Mr. Lee wanted the people to bring the gentleman up to his show, to rescue him—Mr. Lee tried to pacify the soldiers, but they would not be pacified—they were exceedingly enraged against Mr. Lee, and Wedd cleared the whole of the civilians away from the front, and formed the soldiers into a square—they came up in a body, and filled up the whole of the sixty-feet frontage, and they endeavoured to rush up the steps—I saw Mrs. Lee, and I took her and the rest of the ladies down at the back—when I returned, the soldiers had got possession of the platform, and were demolish<lb></lb>ing everything before them—I saw two of them letting down the chandeliers; and the tall soldier broke a piece of iron off, and was striking away with it—they then turned on Mr. Lee, when I was torn away by some of the people.</p>

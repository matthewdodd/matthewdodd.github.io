On the 4th of August I had been at the White Horse in Drury-lane, with Mr. M'lntosh and Mr. Wilson. I came from the White Horse about half after eleven o'clock; I made what haste I could home; going by Leadenhall-market, the prisoner, Kingsland came from one of the archways and laid hold of my arm, and asked me to give her something to drink; she said she had not had any thing all day; I said go along with you, you b - h! Then Margaret Mann came up, and they followed me to <placeName id="t17790915-10-crimeloc54">the Ship in Leadenhall-street</placeName>

I had six guineas. I clapped my hand on my thigh, and saved two guineas out of the six, I lost four; they ran away immediately. They were taken afterwards separately. When Kingsland was taken she offered me fifteen shillings, and said that was all that was left; but I did not take it as I did not know how to act.</p>
               <p>When you took Mann did she acknow ledge she was concerned in robbing you? - No; she had hold of me while the other took the money.</p>
               <p>Was you in liquor that night? - I was not in liquor.</p>

               <p>We met him by Leadenhall-market; he asked us to drink some gin we told him we did not drink gin, if we had any thing we would have anniseed. There were four of us; he gave us half a pint, and we went out and went away, and I saw no more of him till he came to my lodging the next morning. I had eighteen shilling's which I had in change of a guinea. I never saw his money; he asked if I had any more; I told him I had left two guineas with Mr. Jones, a publican; he said he had lost four guineas, and if I did not give him the money he would send me to Newgate; he went to the publican and gave him a note not to hurt us if he would give him the two guineas.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any partner? A. No; I heard that he had offered his services to a Mr. Turner, a starch-man; I cannot say whether I heard that before or since he was taken; I know I had given instructions for the warrant before I heard of it; I am not aware that he could take any of my connexion away; he was in my employ about three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have taken him again if you had not had a good opinion of him? A. I thought his wife and family would be a sufficient guarantee, after I had once pardoned his robbing me. I do not know of his falling off a stage-coach - I once saw him with a swollen face.</p>

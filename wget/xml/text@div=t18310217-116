The prisoner had been in my service for upwards of two months - I put eight sovereigns into my drawer in my bed-room last Sunday morning, at half-past nine o'clock; one of them was particularly bright - there was an old shilling in the same drawer, but not with the sovereigns - I have had that shilling for years, and should know it again; the drawer was locked - I missed three of the sovereigns when I got up and dressed myself, at half-past five o'clock on the Monday morning - I did not miss the shilling then, but it was afterwards found in the prisoner's box, with the sovereign and a twopenny piece, which I firmly believe to be mine, as I had missed one - I suspected the prisoner, and sent for an officer.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was sent for on the Monday morning, and saw the prisoner; the prosecutor charged her with stealing three sovereigns, and told me he had searched her boxes, and every thing, with the exception of this work-box - I immediately asked her for the key of it; she said she had lost it on the Wednesday evening previous in going to her sister's - I forced it open, and in a division in the work-box I found these nine sovereigns and a half, which I took out, and counted in the presence of Mr. Upjohn, his wife, and the prisoner- I also found this old shilling, this twopenny piece, and these two old silver coins; I said, "You must have had a legacy left you;" she smiled, and said it was money she had saved while in the service of her half sister, at the Horse and Trumpeter public-house, in Jewry-street - the prosecutor's wife found the key of the work-box afterwards; the prosecutor recognized the shilling as his, and there is one very bright sovereign.</p>

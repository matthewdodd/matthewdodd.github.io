On the eighth of June, about half past three in the morning, I was alarmed by my maid. She came up and told me the fowls were all stolen. There were about ten lost. Among them two cocks and two hens. I think they were safe over night, I did not see them put up myself; I saw them some time the day before. About four o'clock I came to London, in order to find out who had taken them. I went to Leadenhall market, and found my two cocks and hens in a basket alive; there were nine in the basket. I asked the person that had it the price of them; he did not give me a direct answer about them: I looked several times: at last I said I was sure they were mine. The man then said, If they were mine, he knew nothing of them; he bought them at four in the morning at the Ship in Rosemary Lane, and said he would go with me there. I went with him. The two prisoners, with Parsons, were there; I took hold of him, but he got away from us. Upon going in, and Lucas being pointed out, we secured him. Eagles ran out at the back door. Lucas then informed us where to find Eagle. He was taken up on the other side of the water.</p>

            . I keep a green-stall in Rosemary-lane, and go to market to buy fowls, and carry them about to sell. I was going early to market between four and five o'clock on the eighth of June, to buy some fowls. As I was going by the Ship, I was called into that house, where I saw the two prisoners, and another person; I am sure they are two of the people that are there. I bought nine fowls of them at a shilling a fowl; I carried them into the market, there they were owned by the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Courtice, a hair-dresser, of 234, Strand—on 1st May, about 11 a.m., the prisoner came in for a cake of soap—I had seen her there three or four times before that on the previous week—she tendered a florin and I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—she said that she was employed in Thanet Place—immediately she left I found it was bad—it had not left my hand—there are two shops between there and Thanet Place—I ran up Thanet Place and was so quick after her, that I must haw seen her if she had been there, but she was not there—about 7.45 the same evening she came again for a small sponge to clean a lamp glass—it came to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., she gave me a half-crown—I said "This is bad"—she said, "Is it, I must take it back to my mistress, then"—I said, "I will make sure that it it bad first, and fetched a pair of pliers, broke it, handed her the two pieces, and she left—I watched to see if she went to Thanet Place, and she did not—I gave her in charge with the florin, and asked her what she had done with the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I gave her in the morning in change for the florin—she said, "I have not got it now," but did not say that she had not been there—she said that if I would let her go home to her mother and father she would tell us all about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not say that at the police-court, I was not asked, and I forgot it—it was daylight when I received the florin in the morning, and gaslight when I took the half-crown in the evening—the florin never left my hand till I found it was bad—I rang it on the glass case—I always keep the coin in my hand while I am giving the change—it is not easier in our shop to recognise a person by gaslight than by daylight—the lower part of the window is blocked up with plaits of hair, but there are aper<lb></lb>tures for the light to come through—there is more light from the door than from the window—she stood in the light from the shop door—I was sure the half-crown was bad before I broke it, and knowing that she was the same person I gave her in custody—the moment I saw her I made up my mind that she was the person who came in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 186). I saw the prisoner come out of shop about 8 p.m. and go towards the west, towards Dudley Street—the prosecutor came out, spoke to me, and I followed her about 20 yards, took back to the shop, and she gave me a bad half-crown in two pieces which had in her hand—she cried, and said, "I hope you will forgive me, and come home to my parents, and I will tell you all about it, I have a child depending on me"—the prosecutor gave her in custody with this florin, a said "The woman passed this 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. bit this morning, and I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of it;" she made no answer—she was searched at the station, and a florin, a shilling, eight sixpences, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze was found in her purse—Dudley street is about a mile west of the prosecutor's shop—I went there and saw father and mother—her father was examined at the police-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am sure she said nothing when the prosecutor said he had given her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change for a florin—I will not undertake to he did not say that she had not had it—I heard all that took place—not call it to mind—I have seen Mr. Prevost at the shop since I was examined at the police-court, but did not speak to him about the case, or tell him where Dudley Street was—I only told him to be here—I think the prisoner told me in Prevost's presence, on the night she was taken, that she 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from a gentleman—I left that out because she had no half-sovereign her, and because I did not think of it—I do not know that the half-crown in her hand and the money found on her make up exactly half-a-sovereign—the statement that she had "a child depending on her was not as an excuse for her taking money from a gentleman, that I swear—I cannot say whether she made that statement in the street or in the shop—the prisoner gave her address, 50, Dudley Street, which is correct, and she gave her correct name.</p>

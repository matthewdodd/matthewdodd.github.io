                  man was at the Delivery of the King's Gaol of Newgate, holden for the County of Middlesex, on Wednesday, the 14th of February last, convicted of feloniously stealing; he (the present prisoner,) well knowing the same to have been feloniously stolen

               <p>CHARLES CARRON. I produce the certificate of the conviction of Thomas Paxton, at the last sessions for this County.</p>

               <p>THOMAS CASTLE MEADOWS. I am a silk dyer, When this silk is sent to be dyed, it undergoes what we call the first process, which is its being steeped in ho soap-suds, so as to take the greater part of the yellow gum with which it is charged out. Then it undergoes a second process, in which it is boiled in frest soap-suds, and is thereby completely cleared of the gum; it is perfectly easy to distinguish between silk which has undergone the first process only, and that which has been completely cleared of the gum; it is not by any means a practice in the trade to sell silk after its having undergone that first process; it is impossible to be dyed in that second state. I should think that silk in that second state could not be in the hands of any one but a dyer. The processes are performed by dyers alone, and not by dealers in silk; it is impossible for a honest dyer to sell it 
               <persName id="t18160403-73-person634">al</persName>
             all. the silk is delivered to us by the manufacturers. In the course of the night of the 27th of January, our premises were robbed of silks, Orgazine,Italian, and China, to the amount of eighty pounds weight; the value of what we lost would be about two hundred pounds. Part of the Orgazine and Italian silk had only undergone the first process; some part of that silk Paxman was convicted of stealing. On Monday, the 29th, I saw a small parcel which Paxman had dropped. Paxman was taken up on Tuesday, the 30th. Mr. Deboos waited on me on the 21st of February, and shewed me one pound two ounces weight of Ogazine silk, which had undergone the first process only. I went to his house the next morning, and there he shewed me a small quantity of Italian silk, which had also undergone only the first process. In consequence of further information which I received from Mr. Deboos, I obtained a search warrant against the prisoner, and Armstrong and Gleed went with me to execute it. On searching his house, we found on the counter in the warehouse another parcel of silk, which had only undergone the first process; it was a much larger parcel than either of those Mr. Deboos had shewn me. There was a prodigious quantity of other silks there; but this third parcel was the first I took particular notice of. All the other silks were either entirely in the gum, or completely boiled. Upon this, the prisoner was taken before the magistrate. The tying of the silks in banks, enables a person to know them again, there is a thread round each knot.</p>

               <p>JOHN STEPHEN MARIGNAN. I am a servant to Mr. Deboos, who was a silk dyer, in Spitalfields. I received the two parcels of silk which Mr. Deboos shewed to Mr. Meadows, from the prisoner to be dyed in February last; one of the parcels the prisoner delivered with his own hands; in fact, I had them both from him personally; it was to be dyed drab. I informed Mr. Deboos of it. I did not see it again until I saw it at the police office.</p>

            . I have been a silk dyer in Spitalfields for some years. I remember the silk in question coming into our dye house, brought by the prisoner; one parcel came on the 19th of February; the other on the 22nd. The bills would denote that the silks had never been boiled, and that they were to be of the same colour. The second bill denoted that the second parcel was to be boiled; and there was a third parcel of four pounds, which came by itself, and which has been sent home. The two parcels which I shewed to Mr. Meadows have undergone the first process, and had so before they came to me; that is, the gum was taken off, but they were not boiled; that would at once be obvious to a person who knew his business well; they could not be dyed in the state they were sent to me; silk is never sold by silk dealers in the state in which this is, I have observed the manner in which these banks are tied, and they are not tied in the manner in which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030046"></xptr>a dyer would tie them; a dyer would never have sent them home in the way they are now. Knowing Mr. Meadows's loss, it struck me that this was the same sort of silk that he had lost; I had no other reason than that for shewing it to him.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence of considerable length, arguing upon the improbability of a man of his respectability and long standing in the trade, which subsequently appeared to be the fact, selling his reputation, his honour, and his liberty for such a paulty and inconsiderable profit, as such a fraudulent dealing would afford. He declared most solemnly his inocence, and stated that when he had small orders to complete in haste, he and his wife were some times under the necessity of washing silk themselves, because it was not worth the while of a dyer to light his copper fires, unless he could till Irts coppers.</p>

               <p>Several witnesses of respectability proved their selling silks of various kinds to the prisoner, and also gave him a most unblemished character.</p>

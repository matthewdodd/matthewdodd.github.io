             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Houlditch; I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Houlditch's warehouse with a load of carpeting upon his shoulder; I followed him into Drury-lane, there I lost sight of him; there were about thirty yards of it. The prisoner is <rs id="t17990508-34-deflabel204" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. How happened it that you did not stop him at the time? - A. He is a person that frequently worked at Mr. Houlditch's for his master, and as he was at work there, I did not suppose he took it away with an intention of stealing it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure you saw him take it away? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>- CROCKER sworn. - I went with Mr. Black to the prisoner's lodgings, where I found this coat, which Mr. Black said, in the presence of the prisoner, was the coat he had on when he took the carpeting away.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Houlditch.) Did you give any authority to the prisoner to take away that carpeting? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not go to work, nor I was not upon Mr. Houlditch's premises in the course of that day.</p>

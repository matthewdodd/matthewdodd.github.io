About six o'clock I heard the door open; the shop door was only fastened by a latch; when I heard the noise of the door opening, I instantly went forwards, I found the door open, and upon my missing a muff at the corner of the window by the door, I called out stop thief; I had seen the muff ten minutes before, and no body had been in the shop in the mean time; I staid in the shop; the prisoner was brought back in three minutes time.</p>

            . I live at 148, High Holborn, I am a cheesemonger. On Tuesday the 3d of January, about ten minutes past six, I was going up Holborn, I heard a woman say stop thief; I was about four or five yards from Mr. Schneider's door. I saw a man run from the door; I did not see any thing in his hand; he ran across the road as fast as he could; I followed him; he crossed over and came back again; I called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perceive that he dropped any thing - A. No; it was very dark; I should not have been able to see a muff if it had laid before me, without I had trod upon it; I caught him on the pavement; on his return there was a coach passed between us, then he slackened his pace.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the opportunity of particularly observing his person - A. I had not; I saw nobody else there. I never saw him before; I could not swear to the man that I took; only the person that I followed I brought back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from Pimlico; I had been to a house there two or three days. About two or three o'clock I came home to my wife and drank tea; when I came out of the court just by, I heard a cry of stop thief, I ran after the man, I missed him; a man came after me and said he believed I was the man. I said I did not know, I believed he was wrong. The master of the shop laid hold of my ears and wrong them well.</p>

            . My mother keeps the Sunderland Arms public-house, Sackville-street, Picadilly. Between seven and eight o'clock in the evening Hollis left two parcels with me, which appeared to contain books; he was to call for them - I do not recollect that he said when he would call; a person called for them between eight and nine o'clock that evening - I was busy at the time, and am not quite certain of the man, but think I had seen him before; he said, "I have called for those books," I told him to take them; he took one parcel away, and returned in a short time for the other; he returned a third time, and called for a pint of beer, which I told the servant to take him, and to see if he was the man who had left the books; he was a tall man: he went out, and did not have the beer.</p>

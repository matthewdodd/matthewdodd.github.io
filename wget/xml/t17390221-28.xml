               <p>Pomeroy. I was robbed of three Hats, this Day three Weeks, and heard nothing of them, till these People, ( Keeble, Crocket, and Huddle ) were taken. Then I went up to Justice Farmer, and Huddle told we, that he and the Prisoner had stole the Hats out of my Shop, and had pawned them to a Woman, who now keeps out of the Way.</p>
               <p>Huddle. About the Time the Gentleman mentions, we stole three Hats off the Compter. There were two Shutters to the Window of the Shop, and one of them was down, and the other was up. The Prisoner reach'd over and took them; I stood by him, but neither of us went into the Shop. <rs id="t17390221-28-verdict141" type="verdictDescription">

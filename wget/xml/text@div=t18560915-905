                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Bunce; I live at Ruislin, near Uxbridge. On Saturday, 6th Sept., I left my house to go to Uxbridge, at about half past 10 o'clock in the morning—at that time I had a small box, placed in a larger one, in my bed room, containing 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from it that morning—the large box was not locked, but the small one was—the coin was principally in gold—I returned home at about half past 2 o'clock the same day—I went up stairs at about 10 minutes to 3 o'clock, and it was then that I first missed my small box—I left my daughter at home when I went out—she is about fourteen years old—my house joins the prisoner Lavendar's, but the garden parts Collins's house from mine—there is a watercloset, common to both the houses of Lavendar and myself—before I went I saw Lavender, in the morning—she asked me if I was going to Uxbridge, and I asked her the same, and she said she was, and her nag would overtake mine, meaning her donkey cart—we both kept a donkey cart to go to market in—there was in the small box five bills, and a black purse, and two sovereigns were in the black purse—I saw the bills again on the Tuesday morning, a policeman brought them to my house—it was not</p>

               <p>at the same time that the lock and key were shown to me; that was on Monday—on Friday (the day before) I supplied Collins with coals—she did not pay for them—she asked me if I would trust her with half a quarter or a quarter of coals (that was worth 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.), for she had only half a sovereign towards paying her rent, which she did not wish to change—she paid me the 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Saturday at Uxbridge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Mary Ann Bunce. On Saturday, 6th Sept., when my mother went to Uxbridge, I was left at home to mind the house—after my mother left I saw the prisoners—I stood against the railings parting our yard from Mrs. Lavendar's yard, that is in front of the house—just after my mother had gone, Mrs. Collins come down and asked Mrs. Lavendar to hook her gown, and she said to her, "Make haste, I want to go to the closet," and she went to the closet through Mrs. Lavendar's house—she came from her own door to have her gown hooked—that is on one side, and Mrs. Lavendar's on the other—there is a closet belonging to Mrs. Collins went into Mrs. Lavendar's door—there is a way from Mrs. Lavendar's back premises to ours—it is a straight little yard—the back doors of the two houses open into the same yard—while Mrs. Collins was gone to the watercloset, Mrs. Lavendar stood against our door, and asked me for two pins to pin her bonnet on—that was while Mrs. Collins was gone to the closet—after Mrs. Lavendar had pinned her strings, Mrs. Collins came out, and got up on her cart and went off to Uxbridge—Mrs. Lavendar went with her—I remember when my mother returned—while she was absent, no one came near our house to my knowledge, except the prisoners, except two little children who came after some suckers—we sell sweetstuff—I served them—I went into my mother's bed room while she was absent—that was where the box was kept—my mother's shawl hung half out of the box, and her apron quite out—that was about half past 11 o'clock, about an hour after she had gone—I was standing by the railings about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before I went in.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a stationer's shop in the Broadway, Westminster—on Saturday, 4th July, about 2 o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop for a pennyworth of paper, and gave me half-a-sovereign—I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and he left—I put the half-sovereign in the drawer where there were three others—I put it in the middle of the other three—I noticed the position—a few minutes afterwards I went to the drawer and found it was bad—I then kept it by itself—about two days afterwards I saw the prisoner pass my shop—I knew him again, and sent somebody to bring him back—I showed him the half-sovereign, and told him that it was counterfeit—he said that he was not aware of it, and that his father gave it to him—he said his father was at a public-house, and my clerk went out with him to find his father—he did not return to my shop; he went to the station—I gave the half-sovereign to a police-constable.</p>

I received from the last witness this counterfeit half-sovereign—the prisoner said his father was in a public-house, and I said I would go and see where it was—I went with the prisoner to the White Horse, which he pointed out, but there was no one there who knew anything about him—I searched him, and in his right hand I found another counterfeit half-sovereign, which I also produce—he had no other money on him—I took him to the station—a person whom he called his brother accompanied us—we first met with him in Orchard-street—at the station the prisoner said that his brother gave him the money, and he gave his brother the change, and that his brother <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the note paper away—the brother said he knew nothing at all about it—the prisoner afterwards told me his father gave him the half-sovereign.</p>

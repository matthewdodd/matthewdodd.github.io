I took the prisoner on 9th March—being in plain clothes, I told him I was an officer, and had come to see him respecting some handles for umbrellas, which Sims said he had of him—I told him to do as he thought proper about saying anything to me or to Sims—he said, "They are all right; I can soon explain all about that"—I said he must go to the station, and explain to the inspector—on the way he said to Sims, "You know I left them with you as samples"—Sims said, "It is no use saying that; you know I bought them of you, and gave you a sovereign"—the prisoner at first denied having a sovereign, but afterwards said he had—I took him to the station.</p>

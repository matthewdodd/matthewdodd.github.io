                  </hi>. I am a solicitor's clerk. About eleven o'clock, on the 26th of March, I met the prisoner, and went to a public-house in the Mi<lb></lb>nories with her—I pulled out my money, and asked the landlord to take charge of it, but he refused—it was seven sovereigns and some silver—I then went home with her to her lodging in Essex-street, with the money in my pocket—the last time I remember having it was in the Minories—I went to bed about twelve o'clock—she got up in the morning about a quarter of an hour before me, and went down, stairs—I then found my money was gone—I do not remember seeing my money after I was in the Minories—she came back again, and I said to her, "What have you done with my money?"—she said, "I suppose you have left it with some of your friends in Whitechapel;" and she went with me to a house in White<lb></lb>chapel-road, where she said I had been drinking—I could not find it, and gave her in charge—the house was searched by the policeman, and seven sovereigns and sixpence found under a brick in the coal-cellar, in the parlour of the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He bought some pies for supper when I went home; we went to several public-houses, and at each house be tried to leave the money with the landlord, and went to a gambling-house; I asked him what be wanted to get rid of; and he said, a sovereign, which he wished to deposit in the landlord's hands; we went to several public-houses; I went up stairs to make the bed; and while I was up stairs, I think he must have hid it in the coal-cellar; he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. before he went to bed; he said "I will give you 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the morning;" in the morning I got up, and got breakfast ready; he said, "Do you know where my money is?" I said "No, unless you have left it with some of your friends, as you wished to do;" I went round with him to all the public-houses he had been to, but could not find—it; he then gave me into custody; they went to search my place, and he found the sovereigns himself in the coal-cellar; I never took the money, nor saw it till it was found. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I never was in the coal-cellar—I think I was sober enough to be certain of that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. After I searched the house all over, except the coal-cellar, I took her before a Magistrate—the prosecu<lb></lb>tor was not satisfied, and wished the house searched over again—the pro<lb></lb>secutor went first into the coal-cupboard—the prisoner then began to get very fidgetty, and walked about, and sighed very much—she prosecutor got a light, and she blew it out once—the prisoner shovelled the coals up in one spot—I thought it was there, and the prosecutor found it was there—he put his arm under a piece of brick, brought out one sovereign, and then brought out the other six.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I raked the coals about; but as to knowing the money was there, I did not.</p>

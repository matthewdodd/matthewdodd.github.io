                  </hi>. I am an engraver and smith—on 2nd February, I left my place of business in Glasshouse Street, about 5 o'clock in the evening, to go home—I saw the prisoner Standing in an opening of the name of Butler's Buildings—directly I got opposite to him he snatched my chain—I ran after him, but I did not catch him—I went directly to the police-station, and gave information of my loss—I saw the prisoner again about 11 o'clock that night, at the police-Station in Leman Street—I picked him out from seven others.</p>

I received information from the prosecutor about 5.30 on the evening of 2nd February, and apprehended the prisoner in the Commercial Road—he swore he would not go, and struggled very violently—I got the assistance of another constable, and took him to the Station—I saw him picked out of seven other men by the prosecutor.</p>

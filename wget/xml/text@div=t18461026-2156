                  </hi>. I am single, and live in George-street, Deptford, with Mr. Wegg, my uncle. The prisoner was in his service—I missed some stock<lb></lb>ings and two pocket-handkerchiefs—I have not seen them again—I told the prisoner of it—she said she had not seen them—I afterwards missed some cambric—I spoke to her—she said she had not seen that, and said I might look into her boxes—I went from home in the beginning of Sept., and left her in the house—I returned home, and on the 19th of Oct., when I had been at home a week, I missed four sovereigns, about 125. worth of fourpenny-pieces, and the other articles named, from a cupboard in my bed-room—the prisoner bad left on that day, before I missed them—the cupboard was kept locked, and I kept the key in the drawer in my bed-room—the drawer was locked, and 1 left the key of it in a book-case in the parlour down stairs, while I was from home, and when I was at home I kept it myself—I left 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold in that cupboard, and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in half-crowns and shillings—when I came back I found only 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the fourpenny-pieces which I missed were in a little tin box in the cupboard—I missed a bracelet, a silver vinegarette, and two spoons—some of the things are here—they are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, and live in Carlton Road, Old Kent Road, within three minutes' walk of the Prince Coburg—I was at that public-house on Saturday afternoon, December lst, at a few minutes to five—I saw the prisoner there and several others—some I knew, and I had a glass of gin and water with them—the prisoners and two others came from the taproom, and said, "Governor, will you treat us?"—I said "Yes; what will you have?"—one of then had some rum; what the others had I can't tell—I took out my purse to pay for it—I had 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it when I went into the house, and I changed a sovereign, which left me 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold in my purse—I came out of the house and went into the urinal, while there I felt some one seize me from behind—he threw his arm round my neck and held me back, at the same time I saw the prisoner unbutton my overcoat and take some silver from my waistcoat pocket, and I believe the man behind me took my purse out of my trousers pocket with his left hand—one of them said, "Don't hurt the gentleman"—I was immediately thrown forward with great violence, and there I lay for some time quite unconscious—I was away from business for nearly a week from the effects—on recovering my consciousness my purse and money were gone—I im<lb></lb>mediately went home—I could not go out that evening, being in such pain, but next morning I gave information to the police, and gave a description of the men who attacked me—on the Tuesday afternoon I was called to the station and picked out the prisoner from seven others as the one that unbuttoned my coat—I had had a little to drink on this night, but I knew what I was about, and was perfectly sensible—the prisoner and his companions were in front of the bar ten minutes.</p>

I am a carpenter—I was at the Prince Coburg on Saturday evening, December 1st, and saw the prosecutor there, the prisoner, and five or six in his company—the prosecutor was treating them, he was not drunk, but a little the worse for liquor, he appeared to know what he was about—when he left all the persons in the bar followed him out, I did not, as I was living there—the prisoner followed him with the others—about a</p>

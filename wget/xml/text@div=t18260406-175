On the morning of the 16th of March, I was sitting in my room, and heard a knock at the door of the next room; I went to the door and saw the prisoner there; she then came into my room, and asked if a person lived there who bound shoes; I said No; she then went away and I went, in a few minutes afterwards, to my cupboard, on the landing place, and missed four quartern loaves, and some other things - this was three or four o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoner was brought to me in the evening of the next day; I asked her if she had taken these things - she said No; the watchman told me to get my shawl and go to the watch-house, and as we were going along the prisoner said she had taken them, and if I would not prosecute her, her mother would make it up.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I took up the prisoner and took her to No. 1, Bird-street. As soon as Mrs. Hopkins saw her she said she was the person - she said she did not take it, but as we were going to the watch-house, she said she did take them, and if they would not prosecute her her mother would pay for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A woman, whom I met at the corner of Bird-street, sent me up to see if the old lady was at home, and said she could not take her caps to do - she then sent me to see if the shoe-binder was at home; I came down, with my hands under my apron - I know nothing about the bread - the watchman has many a night wanted me to go into his box, and to take liberties with me, and because I would not he owes me a spite.</p>

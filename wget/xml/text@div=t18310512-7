On the 29th of April I was called up by two Policemen, between two and three o'clock; I got up and went to my stable - I found a brown mare gone, and another standing in the ride, with a bridle on and a halter round its neck - I called my man up; he got on the mare, which stood on the ride, and went in search of the other towards Whitechapel; I got on another horse, and went towards Hampstead - I returned, and in consequence of information from a little boy, I went to Islington station-house about eight o'clock, and saw my mare in the yard of the station-house; it was the mare I had lost - I knew it; it was fired behind the near hind legs, and there had formerly been a pole run into her chest, which left a mark, and she had two broken knees.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 29th of April, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner riding a brown horse through Baron-street, Pentonville, going towards Holloway; I did not see whether it was a horse or mare - it had a bridle and halter on, but no saddle nor cloth that I perceived; I had no knowledge of him before, but I had a good look at him under the gas-light - he had on a blue coat; I saw him again in about an hour and a half, turning out of Barnsbury-mews, on foot - I knew it was the same person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. How long have you been a Policeman? A. Ten months - before that I was coachman to Mr. Gatten, of Marylebone-lane; I do not know what I left him for - I had no words with him; I was discharged at a minute's notice - I was standing within a yard and a half of the gas-lamp when I saw the prisoner; the lamp is in the centre of the street - I saw him some distance before he came to me, ten or twelve, or perhaps twenty yards; he was riding at a sharp trot, just out of a walk - he went very steadily; the horse had a winker bridle, and a flat headed halter, which is called web-headed, and brass on the front; I cannot tell what waistcoat the prisoner had on, but he had another coat on under his blue coat - I am not to have any thing on his conviction that I know of, and do not expect any; there was a reward of 5l. offered for a grey horse of Ings', which was found in the same stable with this, but I am not a witness on that business; I know of no reward being given at our office on a conviction of house-stealers - I never saw a table of rewards at our office; I never was charged with theft in my life.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the morning of the 29th of April, before four o'clock, I saw the prisoner riding along on a brown horse, at the top of Barnsbury-mews, Islington; I cannot say whether it was a horse or a mare - he went down the mews, and I went part of the way down, but did not see which stable he went into; I came back again, and went round my beat - I saw the serjeant of my section and an officer going up my beat; I ran and spoke to them - we three went to the mews and searched it, but found nothing; we got into one or two stables, but most of them were locked, and we could not examine them - I stopped at the top of the mews while the serjeant and officer went down, and I saw the prisoner come out of the mews; this was about an hour after I had seen him go in - I went, and caught hold of him by the arm; I knew him by his having a blue coat on, which hung down a about three inches below his other coat - I am certain he is the man; I asked what he had done with the horse he had taken down there - he said,"What horse?" I said, "Why, the one you have just rode down;" in the mean time the serjeant came up, and took hold of him by the arm, (he had not time to answer) and said, "You are my prisoner, what have you got in your pocket?" the serjeant said to me, "You go off to Gray's Inn-lane, where the horse is lost from, and let them know we have got the horse, and the man we suppose who took it;" I went, leaving him in care of the serjeant, and when I returned I saw at the station-house the same horse as I had seen the prisoner ride, I am certain, for I was not a yard from him when he passed me - I took particular notice of him, and the horse too.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been a Policeman? A.Twelve months - before that I lived in Barmondsey-square, and kept a broker's shop; not an old iron, but a furniture shop; I had a partner - he is not in the Police.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not several houses in this mews? A. I believe not - the back doors from some houses come into it; I have not spoken to Collins these three days - we have not talked about the prisoner's blue coat, or his under coat, or any thing of the kind; I did not speak to the prisoner when he was on the house - I followed him part of the way down the mews, but lost him, as it is crooked, and there was a lot of carts there; he was riding rather fast at first, but when he saw me he went very gently - he had no saddle, I am certain; it was between three and four o'clock in the morning; I do not know that any body lives in the mews - I stood watching at the top about an hour, then saw him come up the mews; he had not dressed the horse, for it was quite dirty - he came up to me; I turned round, and caught hold of him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HAVELL. I am a Police-serjeant. On the 29th of April I saw the prisoner running up Barnsburymews, and saw Pickett stop him - he afterwards left him with me; I took him to the station-house, and told him it was my duty to tell him not to say any thing to injure himself, for I should give it in evidence against him - I made him no threat or promise; I asked what he had been doing down the mews - he said he had not been down the mews; I asked if he had the key of the stable, and to give it to me to save further trouble - he said he had no key; on searching him I found a key in his pocket - I left him at the station, went to the mews, opened the lock of a stable door with that key, and found a brown mare there in the stable, and in the coach-house we found a grey horse - I took the brown mare to the station; Mr. Twight's ostler saw it there, and I believe Twight saw it there - I was present when he saw it at Hatton-garden; he claimed it - there was no saddle on it when I found it; Collins took this and the other horse to the station-house; I took a bridle and horse cloth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many Policemen were in the mews? A.Three - there had been four; the prisoner walked out of the mews, and Pickett laid hold of him - he told me he had not been down the mews at all; I asked him for the key of the stable - I did not say the stable where the horse was; I do not think I told him the horse was stolen - there may be a thousand keys like this, but it is not a very common one; I went with the horse to the station, and afterwards rode it to Hatton-garden, but I then fetched it from a livery-stable.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHEEHY. I am a constable, and live in Gray's Inn-lane. On the morning of the 29th of April, about three o'clock, I was at the Black Bull stable, between Liquorpond-street and Portpool-lane, and saw a man ride out of the gate of the Black Bull yard on a horse - I did not notice the colour of it; he wore a dark coat, and I saw the skirts of a white coat underneath it - he turned towards Holborn; I saw another man come out of the gate, and turn down a Portpool-lane - I came to the gate, and saw a horse with a halter about its neck, which the other man left there; I called the coachman, but nobody answered - I rand the bell, then got my comrade, and alarmed the master.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in the Police? A. About fifteen months - I was recommended from the army; I have not seen Collins since he has been examined - I have talked to him about coming down here against this man; we did not talk about a reward of 5l. -I do not recollect his saying a word about it; there was something in the Hue and Cry about a bay horse - he never told me about the prisoner's light coat or his blue one; Portpool-lane leads into Leather-lane, and then into Gray's Inn-lane - the stables are sometimes open from one to two o'clock in the morning, which made me not take notice till I saw this horse; people do not go in there at all hours - I do not know how the other man was dressed; I thought he was the coachman, and let him go on - it was ten or twelve minutes before I could get the people of the house up: I rang twice.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL WOOLFE. I am a wheelwright, and live at No. 11, White Conduit-terrace, Islington, and work in Barnsbury-mews. On the 21st of April two men came to me there - the prisoner was one of them; they asked if I knew of a stable to be let - I recommended them to a person at No. 25, Islington-row; they went together to hire the stable, and next morning I saw them both again - I asked if they had hired the stable; they said Yes - it was in Barnsbury-mews; the other man borrowed a hammer of me while the prisoner was in the stable - whethen he heard what he said I do not know; I was in the coach-house - I saw the prisoner several times after that; he attended the stable daily till he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you quite certain of his per<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120009"></xptr>son? A. I am certain - the other man was well dressed, and appeared to be the master.</p>
               <p>Q. A gentleman in appearance? A. Yes, a very good looking man, with several pock-marks in his face - I should know him again; he had a drab coat on, with a velvet collar.</p>

            . I am a hackney-coachman. in Twight's service. On the morning of the 29th of April I came home with my coach, about a quarter-past one o'clock, with two mares, one brown and the other black; they were put in the stalls in the first stable, under the gateway - I went home, leaving them safely locked in the stable; I went again about ten o'clock next morning, and the brown mare was gone - I did not see it again till it came home on the Thursday following; the black one remained.</p>
               <p>C. H. TWIGHT. I first saw my mare again on the 29th- I saw it at the station, and then at Hatton-garden; I do not think I saw the serjeant at the station - it was the mare I had lost, and I claimed it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw that brown mare - I went to Smithfield on the Friday; there was a gentleman who asked me to mind a horse and gig, which I did, and when he returned he asked if I was out of employ; I said Yes - he said he wanted a young man to look after a nag; I said I should be glad of it - he said he had sent a friend to the north end of the town, to look after some stables; I went with his friend, and saw this stable; the following day I went to it, and on this night I was taken and accused of stealing the mare, which I never saw - I have not seen my master since.</p>

               <p>My father's mare was lost from Bray-mead on Sunday night, the 12th of September. I saw it in the mead between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; the mead is near two miles from our house. I went in the morning between four and five o'clock to fetch her out of the mead; she was gone; the mead is a common field unenclosed. We did not hear of her again till Mr. Horne found his waggon and gave us intelligence of her, in consequence of which I went last Tuesday was a week to Southgate. I saw her on Wednesday morning in a pond; a man was watering her; he took her into Mr. Grove's stable again. I owned the mare immediately.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that was the mare you lost on the 12th of September? - I am.</p>

               <p>Do you know when this mare came to work for you? - I do not know particularly; they were changing their horses very often. I believe about Michaelmas; it was about the time of Holy-Bush fair, which is in September; she came into my stable in lieu of the waggon.</p>
               <p>About what time was it they parted? - About Michaelmas I believe; between Michaelmas and Christmas, I cannot be certain; Holloway has had the mare since; I was to allow Holloway sixteen shillings a week for the use of the two mares and to keep them; after they tossed up and parted, Davis has not been much at Southgate since.</p>
               <p>Do you know who brought this mare first to work with you? - I cannot say that;

             was the man who drove the team and first gave me an account of it. Robinson and his son saw the mare in my stable and told me at the Crown that it was not their mare; it went out to water on Wednesday morning and then they both said they knew the mare, and would prove that it was their property.</p>
               <p>Did you tell them how it came to you? - I told them I had it of Davis's father; the waggon was at work for me ever since June last. I bought it on the 6th of March; after I had bought it, it was owned; I said then it was the least they could do to leave the horses with me as security, but I supposed, as the waggon was owned they would be owned to.</p>

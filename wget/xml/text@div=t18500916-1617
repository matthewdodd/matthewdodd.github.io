                  </hi>. I am in service in Churton-steeet, Vauxhall-bridge-road. On Monday, 22nd July, 1 was in Vauxhall-bridge-road at five o'clock in the evening—I do not know the prisoner, I have seen him at the toll-gate, and knew him as the person living there—the toll-house is in the middle of the road, with a passage on each side for carriages—there are two gates—they open towards Vauxhall-bridge, and the ends of them, when open, are against the pavement—I saw the deceased child crossing the road with another child; they had hold of each other's hands—they passed by the back-part of the toll-house—there is a window at the back—I think I could reach it from the ground—the children passed I think about a yard or two yards from the toll-house; little Towers was the nearest to it—as he was passing, I saw some water come out of the little window and go over the boy—I should think</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185009160047"></xptr>
               <p>there was about a pint of water—the child screamed out very much—a female went up to him, and took him into Mr. hisides, the baker's shop—I did not go at I had some children with me—about three minutes afterwards I saw the prisoner come out of the toll-house—I did not hear him say anything—I am sure there was no one but him in the toll-house at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The toll-house is a small wooden building, is it not, nearly square? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the entrance is towards Pimlico, and the back is towards Vauxhall-bridge—one side of it is opposite Rochester-row, and the other faces Churton-street—there is a small square window at the back and front; one of them overlooks a sort of angle, which the toll-house forms; there is a projection on the left side; I do not know whether it is a privy; it is at the end looking towards Vauxhall-bridge—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a plan</hi>) I think there is some rubhish collected at that angle—the prisoner seemed sorry for what had happened—the spot where I saw the child is a part where every<lb></lb>body crosses that wants to come across to Churton-street—he did not stop at all, he only crossed—I do not know whether his back was to the window—I was looking over towards the toll-bar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk and surveyor of the Vauxhall-bridge Company. I prepared this plan: it is perfectly correct—the front of the toll-house is towards Pimlico—the length of the projection is about five feet—the window from which the water was thrown, is about three feet she inches from the ground—there is nothing between the toll-house and Churton-street but the road—at the time of the accident, the gate was open from the Vauxhall-bridge-road and across Cburton-street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The effect of that would be to shut off the passengers in Churton-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a person in the ordinary course of business would have no occasion to be near the window; it is but of the direct course—the father of the child resides in Churton-street—if the child was coming from his school in Rochester-row to his father's house, he was about thirty feet out of the direct line—a person of ordinary care and caution would not expect that anybody would be walking at that spot.</p>

PARNELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a person wanted to go from Rochester-row to Mr. hisicles' shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Then I think the course would be fronting the toll-house, towards Pimlico—a person coming from the south of Rochester-row to Mrs. hisicles' would come within four feet of the window, if they crossed close to the angle of the privy—there are not so many persons passing on that side of the toll-house as there are on the other—there are a good many persons pawing about; it is a thoroughfare, a good deal used, but not near the window—I think, if a person passed in a direct line from this mark south of Rochester-row to the corner of Churton-street, they would not be so near the window as that any water thrown from the window could have reached them—the window itself is but one pane of glass, and I think, at a distance of four feet, it would be difficult, out of so small a window, to throw a pint of water to do the mischief which seems to have been done; I think the water would have been distributed about, and a very small portion would have reached him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living in Regent-street, Westminster. On the afternoon of 22nd July I was called to the deceased, who I found in bed at his father's—he was suffering from a very extensive scald, covering the whole of the neck and back, in fact the whole of the body, except the arms and legs—the child suffered very severely, and, I consider, was never out of danger till its death—very extensive sloughs formed over the whole of the back, which separated about a week before death—it died from the scalding—there was nothing else to which I could attribute it—Dr. Lavies was called in—he agreed in the treatment.</p>

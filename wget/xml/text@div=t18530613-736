                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, carrying on business at No. 27, Claries-street, Piccadilly. On 21st May I saw the prisoner at my shop, between 1 and 2 o'clock—he was in front of the bar, or in the parlour, some time before he came to ask me for anything—he was walking from the parlour to the bar—he asked me for a pint of brandy—I asked him which he would have, pale or brown—he told me pale—he said he bought brandy of the former landlord, and paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pint—he had 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of cold gin and water—I believe he was drinking gin and water when I served him with the brandy—he took a bottle from his pocket, and I put the brandy into it—he asked me if I could change him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I told him I did not know whether I could or not, but I would ask my wife—my wife went up stairs to see after the change—she was in the bar at the time—when she came down I gave him the change—he gave me the note—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I sent my boy to a grocer's, fifty yards away, to get the note changed again—Mr. Barlow sent it back, and said he did not like the appearance of it—I took it to a banker—from the description I have heard of the forged notes, I can state that it is a forged one—the prisoner left with the brandy directly after he had paid for it—he said he was either lodging with Mr. James, or Mr. James with him—in consequence of that I went to the neighbourhood of Paddington to see Mr. James—it was some time between 5 and 6 o'clock; I could not say to half an hour what time it was—I saw Mr. James, who went and fetched the prisoner—when the prisoner came in I said, "Well, Mr. Guyenette, I have come concerning this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note you passed, which is bad"—he said, "So help me God! I never passed a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note with you"—he said he had not had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in his possession for six weeks—I said I was now convinced he was the person that passed the note, but I did not mean to say with a guilty knowledge—he persisted that he had not had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in his possession for six weeks—in consequence of some inquiry I gave him into custody on the following day—I am quite positive this is the person that patted the note—there were other</p>

               <p>persons in my shop whilst I was serving him with the brandy—I could not have made any mistake as to the identity, I had no other stranger in the house—I was talking to him five or seven minutes—I have been in the house a fortnight—I had been a butler in the establishment of Mr. George Henning fifteen years, and left him to take possession of the house—I never kept a public house before—I went to a publican of the name of Newstead—a message was sent to the prisoner, and he came to me—Mr. James knew what I wanted him about—the reason I did not give the prisoner into custody at once was, Mr. James said;" Be careful what you are about, there are serious consequences attending it, and if you cannot prove it, it may ruin you, just commencing business;" and I respected Mr. James very much—I said I would go back and ask my wife whether she could swear to the man as well as myself—the prisoner is the manager of an establishment called the Refuge for the Destitute—I never saw him in my life before—he had been in the habit of frequenting the house during the time of the former landlord, who was there only twelve months—I do not know how many people there were at the front of the bar, they were going and coming with jugs to fetch their dinner beer—a good many people came in and out—I knew them as my regular customers—I am quite sure the prisoner asked for brandy—when I went to Paddington he said he never had brandy—I am sure it was the person who had the brandy who passed the note—a search was made at his house; there was no bottle nor brandy found—I did not go to the Bank of England, I went to Farquhar's bank—I know that the Bank of England prosecute cases.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 18, Providence-place, Lisson-street; I am single; I know Mr. Guyenette very well by sighs. On Saturday, 21st May, between 1 and 2 o'clock, I saw him at Mr. Weet's, in Clarges-street—I had been to Mr. Nerton's, and on returning home went in there—Nerton was the former landlord—I heard Mr. Guyenette ask for a pint of brandy—he asked him whether he would take pale or brown.</p>

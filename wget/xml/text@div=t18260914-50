               <p>ALOYSIUS LAST. I live in Grove-street, with my parents. On the 24th of August, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, I was in <placeName id="t18260914-50-crimeloc297">Lisson-grove</placeName>

(Sturdy was not one of the men); they met us. The two men appeared as if they were walking on, but all of a sudden one struck me in the jaw, and the other under the eye; the two girls were then standing before me, and all four were in company; I did not answer the girls - the men had passed, and come behind me; the girls saw the blows given, and I immediately felt a tug at my watch, and it was taken out of my fob. - I am certain it was taken by one of the women, for I saw their hands moving, and saw it in one of their hands; the blow rather overpowered me, but in a moment I saw Parmenter before me; where the other three went I do not know; they were gone. I ran after Parmenter as hard as I could, as far as Lisson-street, which is about a quarter of a mile, and called Watch! - as I followed her she spoke to two boys; I could not hear what she said, but they went into a public-house, and fetched Sturdy out; in passing the public-house (which he came out of) in pursuit of Parmenter, he stopped me, and seized me round the waist; a great many people assembled, and released me - I ran after Parmenter again, having seen the road she took; I had not lost sight of her. Sturdy followed me, and when I got within three yards of Parmenter he overtook me, and knocked me down; I got up again, and ran after her; I pursued her into George-street, and there I thought she had turned into a house, but a man said she had turned down a corner; I lost sight of her. I stood a moment, inquiring where she had gone, and presently Sturdy came up, with a gang of boys, and again struck me several blows. I got away, and went home. I have not recovered my watch. I described the prisoners to Hewett and Webster - they were taken next morning, and I was certain they were the three, and am so now: I looked at them when they asked how I did, and am quite certain of them; it was twi-light - the lamps were not lighted. The public-house Sturdy came from is a quarter of a mile from where I was robbed.</p>

            . I live in Upper Lisson-street, where this public-house is, with my father, who is a grocer. On the 24th of August I was in doors, and heard a cry of Watch! I went out, and saw Sturdy holding Last round the waist; some people came up, and he let him go; he ran after the woman. I then saw Last on the ground - Sturdy had knocked him down - he got up, and ran into George-street, after the woman; who was Parmenter - I am sure of her; I had seen her before, and knew her well - I saw her run round the corner of George-street, but do not know where she went to at last. I saw Sturdy give Last several blows. Parmenter lived in the neighbourhood. I know Jarvis, but never saw them together.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received information of this robbery from Hewitt, and went with Webster and Last to where the prisoners lodged; I knew Parmenter and Sturdy before - they lived together as man and wife, in Lisson-street. Webster went up stairs to the room they occupied; Last and I opened the room door below, and Jarvis was sitting by the window; upon seeing Last she ran and hid herself behind the bed; he said, "That is one of them;" Sturdy sat at the further end of the same room, with nothing but his trousers on, with Parmenter on his knee - I said, "Now be very particular." Last said, "These are the parties - I am certain."</p>

               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. Between six and seven o'clock, on the 10th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure what you had seen a-stern? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go on shore in search of smuggled goods? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you and your boat's crew landed? - A. Sometime after seven o'clock when I landed with the first boat's crew, which consisted of six men, and afterwards when the other boat's crew landed I had sixteen men.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your landing did you discover any goods? - A. I did, just below high water mark.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these goods? - A. About an hundred ankers of brandy, rum, and gin, I saw at first.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened upon your going to take possession of these goods? - A. There were several musquets fired.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing the figure of any of the persons firing? - A. Not then.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it you saw any persons? - A. It might be about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people do you suppose there were that you could see without telling who they were? - A. There were several people come down off and on in the course of the evening.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You said, as you approached the beach there were several musquets fired? - A. Yes, after I had made seizure of the hundred ankers about eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the hundred ankers that were lying just below high water mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. When you had taken possession of these did any thing else happen? - A. I went up the beach with the cutter's crew and seized the remaining part of the seizure which were piled up on the quay.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at this quay, having seized the first part of the goods, describe to my Lord how far distant they were from the first? - A. They were at a little distance, the quay is close to the beach.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find there? - A. Three hundred ankers of spirits and some tobacco; I seized them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen to you or the crew at the time you were taking possession of them? - A. No, nothing; we were fired on just as we were going up the beach, we cleared the beach.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you call that nothing, attend to the question and do not give such strange answers; the question is, whether any thing happened to you? - A. We were fired on, and we drove the men away.</p>
               <p>Q. What men? - A. The smugglers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Did you see any men? - A. Yes, we saw some men behind the corners of houses in the village.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of them come down to you then? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You having seized these two parcels of goods, when was it that any interruption happened? - A. There was no interruption happened till one o'clock in the morning after the first part of the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with any body during the time after you had made the seizure and before the latter end of the night? - A. There was a man came down about ten o'clock after I had made the seizure on the quay.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak positively to the person of that man? - A. Not positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Look to the man at the bar and tell me whether you know his person or not? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe to me as particular as you can the dress, size, and appearance of the person who held this conversation with you? - A. I was standing on the wall on the quay close to the seizure, a man came up to me, I did not particularly look to his dress, but to the best of my recollection he was dressed in dark coloured clothes; I thought he had boots on and I believe he had a whip in his hand; he asked me to sell him twenty or thirty ankers of spirits or spare them, but to the best of my recollection it was to sell them, and then he would give me an order for ten more kegs; I asked him what he meant by an order; O, says he, you know very well, and then he made a kind of a laugh and jeer, or something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the only time you saw that person? - A. I will not be positive, there was another person came down, he left me; there was a man came down to me at half after twelve, he stood against the side of a door and I was on the other side, he talked with me a considerable time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100088"></xptr>Court. Q. What door? - A. There is a house built on the quay; he came and talked to me there, the whole conversation was wanting me to give up half the seizure; he said, to give and take, or words to that effect, he insinuated with me to give up half the seizure, he said, live and let live, give and take, or words to that effect.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words? - A. He said you have got a good seizure, you may as well give and take, live and let live, he did not say immediately will you give me up half the seizure, he only insinuated by those words.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Now the person that held that conversation with you was it the same person that held the conversation with you at ten o'clock? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you believe upon that occasion, do you think that it was or that it was not? - A. I think it was, it was just such another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more of that person, be he whom he might, in the course of that night? - A. Not afterwards, I saw him no more.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did you say to him when he said, live and let live, give and take? - A. I did not make him any answer; I told him that it was worth more than my commission to give up any part of the seizure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. What began then to be the conduct of any of the people there? - A. Soon afterwards they gave three cheers, the smugglers did I believe, it was in the village from a number of people assembled there, and there might be twenty or thirty people come down in a body immediately after the three cheers; then we were fired upon, and stones were thrown by some of these people.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this firing all at once or repeatedly? - A. It was repeatedly for an hour or upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the stones thrown once or the whole time? - A. The stones were kept continually throwing the whole of the time the firing was, for an hour or upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any part of your crew receive any injury? - A. They did, there were five of them wounded with slugs or swan shot with the firing.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon, tell as near as you can recollect when this sort of cheering and attack upon you was after this person left you - A. I cannot speak exactly, it was from five to ten minutes after the person left me that it began.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe which way the person went when he left you? - A. Yes, he went round the corner towards where the mob were.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this continued for upwards of an hour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more of that person with whom you had held that conversation after that? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a man there with the villagers, an inhabitant of that place, of the name of George? - A. There was; he had been with me, I first saw him about ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue with you from ten till the last time of the firing? - A. No; he went up and down very frequently, he did not stop a long time with us.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was George with you before the man came to you and had the conversation about the seizure? - A. He was; he came down to the place where I was and went up to the village several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go at any time to the place from whence the firing was? - A. Yes, he went away from me just before the firing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go amongst them? - A. He went towards them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any opportunity of seeing them? - A. I have every reason to believe he had, he went towards them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see George's wife? - A. I did; I saw her before I saw her husband, before ten o'clock, to the best of my recollection, she came down just before the mob, just before the twenty or thirty that came down in a body.</p>

               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Did you see her about at the time you were holding the conversation with the person you have described? - A. I do not recollect, I do not think that she was there, I cannot positively say.</p>

Mr. Parry sung out, young men, come here; I sung out to Mr. Parry, that there were three or four hundred kegs there, and Mr. Parry immediately came up and placed sentrys at each place, and told us that we should flash; the people of the jolly boat came to us, then we were fourteen in number; we then carried the goods that were on the beach up to the quay, and hauled our boats up out of the way of the surge, and kept sentrys over them.</p>

He is blind with one eye; I went down to Mr. Parry, and told him the country were going to rise upon him; then I saw the prisoner leaning his arm against the north-east side of the door, and Mr. Parry was close by him; the man called away Mr. Parry to speak to me, and then the prisoner turned his back; he went away from that place, and went northward and eastward to the places where the people were.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time of the night might that be? - A. To the best of my knowledge between eleven and twelve, I did not look at the clock.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time you saw him was about nine o'clock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing when he went away? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go towards where there were any other people assembled? - A. Yes, he went away to where the rest of the mob were.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that he went away towards them was there any disturbance? - A. Instantly three huzzas were made, and stones were thrown; I did not see the prisoner reach the men; they immediately took me as a prisoner; I did not see any thing more of the prisoner that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Your wife likewise was there? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew him before, have you any doubt? - A. I have no doubt, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did Mr. Parry take you as a prisoner? - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Surely he did not make such a mistake as to take you as a smuggler? - A. Perhaps he thought so at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You were quite astonished that he thought so of you? - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. He took you as a prisoner - why how near to the beach is your public-house? - A. About three quarters of a mile from Selin Cove.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how soon afterwards was it that you for the first time mentioned that Mr. Pollard was among the smugglers? - A. That night, to the best of my recollection; I spoke of it directly afterwards to many people; I told Mr. Arndle of it a few days afterwards, and I told Mr. Parry of it that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You told Mr. Parry that while you were a prisoner? - A. No, before I was a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Explain that? - A. Mr. Parry thought I was one of the combined parties of the mob; he kept me to tell who the people were, he thought I knew all the people that were there.</p>

               <p>Q. What time on that evening was it that you saw him first? - A. I do not remember seeing him more than once that evening, and that once I saw him it might be about twelve o'clock, but whether it might be before or after I cannot tell, I had no watch; he was then standing with his face towards

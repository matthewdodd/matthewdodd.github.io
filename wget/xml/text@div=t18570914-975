                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Lower Symons Street, Chelsea. The prisoner had a room in my house—a man named George Campbell lived with her as her husband—they lived there nine or ten weeks—she had lived in the street for some years—she had a child, whom I had heard called Jane Campbell—Campbell had left the prisoner on the Wednesday before this happened on the Saturday night—he had left her very much in debt—I thought that had an effect on the prisoner—on the Saturday night, 29th Aug., between 8 and 9 o'clock, I heard a great screaming as I was going up stairs—I went into my own bed room, and saw the prisoner there, with the child in her lap, twisting a rope as hard as she could round it's neck—it was struggling to get out of her lap—I called out loudly, and called Mrs. Quin—she came up, and took the child—she had got out of her mother's lap, and was making her way down stairs as fast as she could—I had taken the rope off her neck—she was bleeding very much from the nose and mouth—the prisoner looked to me as if she had been drinking, but are got perfectly sober afterwards—when she got to the station, she seemed quite sober—after I had taken the rope off the child, the prisoner said, "I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was drinking with her at 12 o'clock; she paid for a quarters of gin. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No such thing; I paid for a penny loaf and some beer—that was all you had of me at 12 o'clock in the day—I did not pay for another quartern of gin; I was not with you.</p>

We had been out together, and came home together—I was standing in the archway close to the private door, and heard a screaming—the last witness called me; I went up, and saw the rope round Jane Campbell's neck—the prisoner was lying on the bed, and Jane Campbell was in her lap—Mrs. Grady had got her own child, and she gave that to me, and I saw her take the rope from Jane Campbell's neck—I did not notice where the other end of the rope was.</p>

I heard a cry of "Police!" about half past 8 o'clock—I saw the prisoner in the street, and took her in custody—I said that it was for trying to make away with her child—she said, "I did it, I did it"—I saw the child before I saw the prisoner; it was bleeding from the nose and face—I took it to the workhouse—the prisoner was sober.</p>

About half past 8 o'clock on that Saturday night the prisoner was brought to the station, and the child, who was bleeding from the nose; there was a great quantity of blood on her pinafore and on the front of her neck—I found a mark round her neck such as would be produced by a cord like this—I went to the room where this had happened, and found the door locked; I forced it open, and found this rope—it was not tied, it was over the top of the bed post, and the noose hung down, so that it could be drawn up—I told the prisoner what she was charged with; she said, "I could not do it to myself, and leave the child behind me."</p>

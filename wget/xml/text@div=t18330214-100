            . I am clerk in Messrs. Foster's bank, at Carlisle. On the 5th of January, the Rev. William Mark came to our bank with a printed circular letter, and 10s. 6d. in silver - he gave it to me, and wished to have the money transmitted to London; this is the letter which he brought- the blank describing the nature of the enclosure, I filled up, and enclosed in the letter half a guinea in gold, I folded it up, and wafered it; I placed it in a drawer in the Bank where letters for the post are placed, and on the same evening I took it to the Post-office, and put it in, to go by the London mail that night - the direction to the letter was all printed "To the Secretary of State, Whitehall, on His Majesty's Service, Issue No."</p>
               <p>The letter was here read, stating that the half guinea was enclosed, being a collection in aid of the National Society, addressed to "Joshua Watson, Esq., <rs id="t18330214-100-viclabel554" type="occupation">Treasurer</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You put the half-guinea into the letter? Yes, I put nothing else into it.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. Was it loose in the letter, or enclosed in paper? A. It was closely folded in the inner half sheet - it was not likely to slip out.</p>
               <p>HENRY MEAUX. I am clerk in the Inland Post-office. The Carlisle mail bag of the 5th of January arrived at the Post-office, on Monday, the 7th of January - I opened it, and took out the letters; I put the franks on one side, and the other letters on my right - it is then the duty of the messenger to take the franked letters to the frank-table (looking at the letter); in the usual course of business this letter would be taken to the frank-table by the messenger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If a letter comes into the hands of an experienced person in the office, may they not discover whether it contains an enclosure? A. They may by the weight, or by holding it up to the light, or feeling it, they could tell this contained only one coin, but franks go to the table without being examined - an immense number of letters contain Bank notes; a great many of these letters came containing very small enclosures about that time - it was the prisoner's duty to stamp letters at the frank-table.</p>

            . On the 7th of January I was inspector of franks at the frank-table, and was on duty at the frank-table that morning; the prisoner was also <rs id="t18330214-100-deflabel555" type="occupation">employed at the frank-table</rs>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140051"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been in the office? A. Twenty-six years; there are water-closets for the clerks generally, but I do not know of any particular one for the messengers - there are four inspectors of stamps, but only two employed at one time; it is the duty of about seven messengers to be at the frank-table - I know Baker, a messenger; the frank-table receives all the franked-letters - we have nine or ten thousand in a morning; they are placed on the table indiscriminately at first - one messenger in particular sorts letters for the Secretary of State, and at one time that morning I saw the prisoner engaged in that duty - I cannot say who else sorted; I do not think I saw Baker there - little inaccuracies sometimes occur; there is nothing on the face of this to denote that it is a money-letter - coin is very commonly transmitted by franks; I never saw a particular Post-office stamp for money-letters - they are often endorsed "money-letter," but whether it is endorsed or not, if the messenger discovers it, his duty is to bring it to the inspector; it might easily escape his observation - the prisoner has been in the office seven or eight years, I believe; I understand his father was there a great many years before him; letters addressed to the principal officers of state are sorted inside the pound, which is the interior of the frank-table; a letter intended for the inside might, by mistake, he outside.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. Was the prisoner employed on both sides the pound that morning? A. He was; if he found a letter outside; his duty was to put it inside.</p>

            . I am an inspector of franks. I was on duty on the morning of the 7th of January; Leighton and I were the only inspectors employed - I observed the prisoner about three-quarters of an hour after; I had been there in the pound - I did not see him outside; I was there about six o'clock - he was in the pound about a quarter before seven; I did not observe him there long - I missed him about seven o'clock, or a quarter after, and sent a messenger to ascertain where he was - when persons employed in sorting letters discover a money-letter, they should bring it to the inspector of franks; it was the practice of Leighton and myself to keep the money-letters until the end of the morning - I always keep them to the end of the morning, and then give them to Mr. Leighton in a mass, and he would himself carry both mine and his own letters to the clerk of the money-book; the messengers are very seldom trusted to carry them to the clerk; I have known an instance of one single letter being carried by a messenger, but under pocidiar circumstances - it is not the practice; I am certain I did not send the prisoner with any that morning - it would not be his duty to do so without particular orders; it would be against his duty to take it without orders; we never send a letter to the clerk of the money-office unstamped - they are always stamped first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What letters do you and Leighton keep till the end of the morning? A. Letters containing coin - the duty would not end on Monday morning perhaps till eight o'clock, or a little after; I have sent a messenger with a money-letter to the clerk, but it is not the practice - our time is very precious, and we have not time to go there; business is done as quick as possible - inaccuracies sometimes occur without a criminal intent; the prisoner has been a messenger some time.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer, employed entirely by the Post-office. On the morning of the 7th of January, by direction, I placed myself in a watercloset, leading from the passage of the secretary's office in the Post-office - I believe there is only one watercloset on that floor; I went there about half-past six o'clock, and remained there nearly an hour - about half-past seven the prisoner came into the water-closet; I took hold of him, and told him he must come with me - if any body except the prisoner had come there I certainly should not have seized him; I told him I must search him - he said, "Allow me to go into the water-closet to ease myself;" I said, "No, Hodgson, I can't, you must come with me;" he endeavoured to prevail on me to allow him to go in - I said, "Hodgson. it is of no use, you must come with me;" I took him into the adjoining room in the passage - I searched his coat, and could find nothing there; I then searched his right-hand breeches pocket, and took out a purse, containing three sovereigns and a half - I then searched his left-hand trousers pocket; I was in the act of searching it, when he put his left-hand into that pocket, and said, "I will give you what I have got;" he took two letters out, and gave them to me - I took them from his hand; I then asked where he had got them from - he made no answer; I asked him again, and he made no answer - I said, "Hodgson, you are not bound to answer unless you think proper, but it is my duty to ask you where you got them from;" he then said, "I got them from the office;" I asked him from what part - he said from the frank-table; I then marked the two letters - these are them, here are my initials on them; I took the letters to the clerk in waiting, then took the prisoner to Bunhill-row station, and went to search his house in Hertford-place, Haggerston - I found his wife there, and six or seven children, and she was far gone in the family way; I mentioned very slightly to her that there was some little suspicion of dishonesty, and under those circumstances we had come to search the house (thinking it not proper to state the nature of the case) - I found eleven sovereigns; I left one with her, and brought away ten - I then returned to the prisoner at the station-house, and took him to Mr. Peacock, the solicitor to the Post-office - Mr. Austin, the inspector of letter-carriers, had accompanied me to the house with the prisoner; we went in a coach with him to the solicitor's office, and in the coach the prisoner asked how his wife felt; Austin replied that he did not tell her the whole nature of the case, but that she felt rather uneasy - the prisoner then gave a heavy sigh, fell backwards, and said, "Poor thing, she must know it;" I then went with him to Mr. Peacock's office - I took him into the office, and Mr. Peacock said,"Hodgson, I am sorry to see you in that situation;" the prisoner said, "There is no one so sorry as myself;" Mr. Peacock asked how long he had belonged to the office - he said about eight years; I rather think Mr. Peacock took his answers in writing, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>MR. PEACOCK. When I examined the prisoner I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140052"></xptr>not take his answers in writing - I made a memorandum of a particular reply which he made.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I take it for granted you cautioned him how he answered? A. I told him whatever answer he gave, might be used against him; I will send for the memorandum.</p>

             in continuation. Mr. Peacock said,"You well know the consequence of this thing, and you recollect what occurred this time twelve months"; the prisoner replied, "I hope it will not be so bad as that." Mr. Peacock then said, "You are not bound to answer questions unless you think proper - What explanation have you got to give of the letters, Hodgson?" (holding the letters in his hand) the prisoner replied, "What can I say, Sir?" I then took him to Bow-street; he was examined before the Magistrate - the Magistrate asked if he had any thing to say; he said No - I believe what he said was taken down; this was at the first examination - he was then remanded for a week; I attended the second examination, and what he said was taken down - (looking at two letters) these were marked by me, and are what the prisoner gave me; one was stamped and the other was not - the one directed to the Secretary of State is stamped; I have been employed by the Post-office nearly three years - there is one water-closet below appropriated to the messengers alone; there are others, but not near the messengers' - the clerks water-closet is nearest to the frank-table, but the messengers' is not a great distance, it is down a stair-case; he must go out of the office altogether, and along the hall to go to the Secretary's closet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you examine to see if the messengers' water-closet was engaged at the time? A. No; I should say he could not so well destroy a letter in other closets as in the Secretary's, because that has a spring lock to fasten the door inside, and he could fasten himself in, and prevent any one coming in - he did not tell me he had a violent pain in his stomach; he said, "Allow me to go in and ease myself" - he did not say he was in pain or any immediate pressing nature; there is a lock to the messengers' closet, but no spring fastening; the key is seldom inside the lock - I do not know whether it was in that morning, if so he could have locked himself in - I did not mean by what I said to convey to the Jury that there was no means of fastening the messengers' closet; if he went there and the key was not there, somebody might come in while he was destroying the letters - after I saw the letters he said, "Will you allow me now to go to the water-closet;" I said, "Certainly" - I had no motive in not stating that before; I did not think it important - he waited long enough to ease himself; I saw him undo his braces and sit down - the door was ajar - the letters were sealed when I took them from him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you were examined did you recollect his asking to go in again? A. I did not - if the question had been asked I should have told you.</p>
               <p>MR. PEACOCK. Here is the memorandum - I recollect, by looking at this paper, that he said he was facing franks part of the time, and sorting letters part of the time; the rest of the memorandum does not relate to this inquiry.</p>

             re-examined. At that hour in the morning every body is very busy - there is a large fire in the secretary's lobby; I do not know where the watercloset is.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Should you go into that lobby in going from the frank-table to the money-book office? A. No; I could have gone into the lobby if business took me there- I suppose I must have gone about business.</p>
               <p>MR. BOCKENHAM re-examined. I know the secretary's-lobby, where the fire is - there is a messenger to prevent persons going there who have not business, and to whom they must state that they have business; the messenger is forty or fifty feet from the water-closet - he sits in the outer lobby, near the fire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Does he sit at the fire? A. Yes, or else he is going from one office to another; most people at that hour are engaged in their different departments - I should not pass near the fire to go to the water-closet.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. To go from the frank-table to the moneybook-office, should you go to that lobby? A. No; it is in quite a different part of the building.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the morning in question I was at the Post-office by six o'clock, and was suddenly attacked with a violent pain in my bowels, and ran to the closet - I found the first occupied; I came back to the office again, and resumed my sorting - I went to the Ship-letter office to leave a letter, and in my hurry took up the two letters in question, and made the best of my way to another closet, where I met the officer, who took me into custody, and to whom I delivered the letters which I had in my hurry put into my pocket; and which I might have put into the fire in the lobby, if improperly disposed; I declare solemnly my innocence.</p>

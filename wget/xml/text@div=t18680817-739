                  </hi>. On Saturday night, 4th July, about 12 o'clock, I was near the Green Man, at Stratford, and saw Mr. Mclntyre trying to get in at the Green Man—Hennesey went and hustled him under the arms; he; led, and got away into the road—a horse and cart came along; they</p>

               <p>halloaed, and caused a confusion—Hennesey caught him by the waist, carried him on to the pavement, and said, "You silly man, you will be run over"—he went to Better's shop, a greengrocer's; the door was on the jar, and just before he got there they closed the door in his face—Hennesey caught him in his arms, turned him round, put his hands in his waistcoat pocket under his arms, took something out, and some money dropped on the pavement—I said, "You scamp, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to rob an old man like that"—I saw his watch chain hanging down—I have known the prisoner ever since his childhood; I am sure it was him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

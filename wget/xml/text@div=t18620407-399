                  </hi>. I live at 14, Buttesland-street, Hoxton—I worked for about eight weeks, up to the 22d of March, with Messrs. Oppenheim, of Cannon-street—about three weeks before Christmas I took two seal skins from my masters' premises, and thirty-six black musquash skins—I took them to Poehler—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for the musquash skins, and 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for the seal skins—I had previously taken some musquash skins to him, and he said if I had anything to sell I could bring it to him—I told him, we were some skins short at one time at the warehouse, and he told me they paid so little money in the warehouses that you must take some skins—I recollect taking twenty-six coloured musquash skins to him—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for them—I took him about 100 racoon tails—he gave me a halfpenny each for the first, and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the others—I took them to him at his own house, 28, High-street, Bloomsbury—no one else was present when I took them—I took them out of the warehouse—I know that some of the skins I took to Poehler were placed at Wagner's.</p>

Oppenheim's—I never stole any besides those I have mentioned—I never sold any to any one but Poehler—I took ten musquash skins to make a boa and muff of, and I sold those to another man, but he did not know they were stolen—I think I first began to steal from Messrs. Oppenheim in September; I cannot tell exactly—I got into their employment by working for Mr. Duck, of Tabernacle-walk—I heard that there was a place open at Messrs. Oppenheim's, and went there, and he said I might come to work—I referred them to Mr. Duck—I left him because he had no more work for me—he did not employ any one but myself—he had told me before he only had four week's work for me—he did not take on other workmen after I left—I afterwards went to Mr. Duck again—I took these skins in consequence of what the prisoner said to me; it was at his suggestion—I had never taken any skins prior to that—I am not doing anything now—I have got no work—I go to my friends at the West End to eat; Mr. Wagner and another gentleman.</p>

Oppenheim's—I saw Mr. Lillicrap, and he gave me these two seal skin muff borders, and these two pairs of cuffs—the prisoner was working for Mr. Lillicrap at that time—Mr. Lillicrap called him down—I showed him these skins, and told him that Mr. Lillicrap said he had bought them of him—I asked how he accounted for the possession of them—he said he bought them of some man—I asked him who—he said he did not know the man; he thought he was a Jew; he did not think he was in the trade—I asked where he lived—he said, "In High-street, Bloomsbury"—I left him in charge of Hancock, and went to his lodgings, 28, High-street—I after<lb></lb>wards went to Carnaby-street, and received from Wagner a parcel containing twenty-four musquash skins, which I produce.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my father's service on the 12th of May, and on the 13th, about four o'clock in the afternoon, this watch was missed; I had seen it on the morning of the 10th, which was Monday - I went to the prisoner's lodging, to inquire if he had my father's watch; it was kept generally in the shop - the prisoner was not at home; we found the watch from some hand-bills: it is worth 10l. - that is the cost price; it is worth more than that - my father's shop is part of the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How many persons had your father in his employ? A.Only one in the shop where the prisoner worked; but I believe there were four altogether - we had before this lost a watch and a chronometer, which we have never found: we had an officer, and searched Carter, the errand-boy, and all who were in the house - we suspected other persons, but not the prisoner; we found property which had been concealed by other persons; my father did not ascertain that Carter had taken this very watch - I take an active part in the business; it is customary to give work to the men to take home to clean, but this was not taken home - the prisoner worked for my father for six or seven years; he was very honest, and we always placed confidence in him.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WORLEY. I am a pawnbroker. In the consequence of the hand-bill I searched our watches, and found this one, which was pawned by the prisoner on the 12th of May, for 3l., and on the 13th he came and had 3s. more on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know him before? A. Yes, I have seen him three or four times.</p>
               <p>HENRY JOHN FRODSHAM. This is my father's watch; I gave it to the prisoner - I know the name and number.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not your father's name on every watch he makes? A. Yes; but this watch I have had so many times, I could tell it among ten thousand - I do not suppose he has made above one of this description, with a compound-balance, since I have been in the business; this is the watch I gave the prisoner on the 10th of May - I have looked at the book to see that the number corresponds, and it does; it had been sold, but came back to be altered.</p>
               <p>Witness for the Defence.</p>
               <p>JAMES HENRY. I am a calenderer. On Wednesday, the 12th of May, I saw the prisoner between half-past eight and nine o'clock in the evening, at No. 29, Half Moon-alley, where he lives.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WORLEY. Our shop is in Old-street - he was there at a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening of the 12th of May.</p>

            . I know Half Moonalley, and I know Mr. Worley's shop - I should think they are a mile and a half distant.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not leave the shop till considerably after eight o'clock, and when I came down, Mr. Frodsham requested me to go up again to work at a chronometer-bar, which had just come from a jeweller's.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE to MR. FRODSHAM. Q. At what time did the prisoner leave on the 12th of May? A.About eight o'clock - that is the time they generally leave; I do not remember desiring him to go to work on a chronometer-bar - they never leave before eight in the evening; his residence is about ten minutes' walk.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the watch entrusted to the prisoner? A. Not out of the house - he had it on the 10th of May, to make a trifling alteration; he might have taken it home, but he could have done it there in five minutes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

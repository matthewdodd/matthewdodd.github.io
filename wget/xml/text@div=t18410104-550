                  </hi>. I am in the employ of William Edgar, a silk-mercer, in Piccadilly. On the 23rd of December, the two female prisoners came into the shop—Rebecca asked for some sarsenet ribbons, and purchased three yards—I showed her several other things—she bought some—at last I showed her a box of lace—the lace was on cards—they both looked at them, and passed them from one to another—they both decided on one piece, and Rebecca told me to cut off 2 1/2 yards—she then chose another piece, and had one yard of that—I cut it off—they then looked at different pieces—Rebecca fixed on another piece, and I cut off 1 1/2 yard of that—she took up a card and asked the quantity—I said I would measure it for her—I did so—it was between three and four yards—I put the lace back again, as I thought—I asked them whether they wanted any thing else, and they bought a woollen handkerchief—I was going to make out the bill, and saw Mary Ann bad her hand under her shawl, as if doing something under the corner of it—I looked at her—she observed it, and said, "How very cold it is to-day," and shrugged up her hand closer—I made out the bill, and said it was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mary Ann then opened her hand, and I saw a sovereign and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—she said to her sister, "Then I have not got enough money"—Rebecca said, "We have not enough money, my sister will go and fetch more, and I will stop here—she has not far to go"—she said to her sister, "Be as quick as you can, you know where to find it, it is in that bag; you know where"—Mary Ann left the shop, and Re<lb></lb>becca remained—Mr. Hope requested her to walk into the counting-house, and she did so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of Mr. Edgar's shop—there are between sixty and seventy young men in the shop—I asked both the sisters to walk into the counting-house, and they did—I desired a constable to be sent for—previous to asking them to walk into the counting-house, I had seen Mary Ann leave the shop—I ran out of the warehouse-door, and at the corner I saw her in conversation with the prisoner Williams—at that time I sent for a constable—Mary Ann's hand was extended, and he was pulling his hand out of his pocket—I believe he had a purse in it—I told her to walk in, and desired Wetton to take Williams, which he did—Mary Ann went back to the shop, and went up to her sister, who was sitting in the shop, and said, "This gentleman says he wants to speak to me"—Rebecca said, "What does he want with you?"—I said, "I want to speak to you like-wise"—I told them both to walk into the counting-house—I said I had very good reason to believe that they had property about them not their</p>

               <p>own—I believe they both replied, "I hare not got any," and Mary Ann placed herself before me, and extended herself—I endeavoured to pay at<lb></lb>tention to Rebecca, and observed her hands were employed under her dress, and immediately a quantity of lace fell from her—the manner in which Mary Ann stood, would have concealed Rebecca in some degree from my view—I picked up seven cards of lace—I gave them to the policeman—(<hi rend="italic">examining it</hi>)—this is Mr. Edgar's property.</p>

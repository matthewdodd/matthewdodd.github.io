On the 6th of June, about six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner, and two other lads, in the Kent-road, going to London—I found these five cricket-balls, and other things, on the prisoner—I took him to the station, and said I would go and see if his father lived at Dockhead, as he had told me he did—he said, "It is no use, I have no father there, the balls were stolen by two other boys, and I was in their company"—I asked him how he came by the skittles—he said, "I stole them myself"—I said, "How did you come by the keys?"—he said, "I turned the tail of a gentleman's coat up, and took them."</p>

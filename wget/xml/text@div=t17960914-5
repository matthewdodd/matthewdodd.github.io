            , the person now deceased, was his grand nephew, the son of his nephew; he had, with a very affectionate attention, provided early in life for this young gentleman and educated him. Gentlemen, the lady now at the bar lived for seven or eight years, previous to the death of Mr. Yates, in a state of some intimacy, probably of some confidence with him. The nephew, Mr. Thomas Yates, came into the house of his late uncle, a few days after the funeral; he was received civilly and politely, I believe, by that lady, he conceiving that the politely, I believe, by that lady, he conceiving that the disposition of these effects made by his uncle was in his favour, and that he of course would have been immediately in possession, together with a sister in the same degree of relation with himself, to the late Mr. Richard Yates. However, some papers were produced, which caused offensive words between them, by which it appeared, that that lady was possessed of all the property, except a small annuity of 40l. per annum, and which gave rise to an enquiry and dissatisfaction on his part; he made that application to his friends which it was natural that he should, and he fell into the hands of friends who were not only willing but capable of advising him; a person whom we all know, who will be called to you, and by whose advice he lived afterwards on terms of civility and friendship with that lady in the house of his uncle; he lived there from the time of his uncle's death, till the end of the month of June, perfectly harmonious, except a few trifling differences, while they were alone, till other persons interfered. Mr. Yates went down to Bristol, where he staid a short time; when he returned, he found that by the interference of friends an accommodation was likely to be produced. It was then agreed, that as the house was a part of the property of the uncle, they should live in different parts of that house together, or that the house should be lett for their joint benefit, or the ultimate benefit of the survivor. Of late, I understand, they were not so good friends as formerly, and this likewise is attributed to the interference of others. In consequence of that, and finding that another person was introduced into the house by Miss Jones, namely, Mr. Sellers who now stands at the bar, for some purpose, and not knowing what purpose, he was sufficiently alarmed to send for a friend to ask his advice how he should conduct himself. The gentleman he had formerly applied to not being in the way, he sent to another; the parties met-an altercation and high words ensued between Mr. Yate, and a Mr. Beard, who it seems has been a very constant adviser upon this occasion, but afterwards Mr. Beard and Mr. Yates shook hands, and the following Monday was fixed for Mr. Beard to attend as the friend of Miss. Jones, when another person, a friend of Mr. Yates, should attend to determine finally whether they should keep the possession jointly, or whether they should lett the house for the advantage of both. On the Sunday preceding that Monday, another person, Mr. Footner, the other prisoner at the bar, came on a visit to Mr. Sellers, and, instead of returning at the close of the day, we are told by the examinations that were taken, that the gate of the Park was then shut, and that therefore he staid till the Monday morning; however, by some means yet unaccounted for by the prisoners, he did not go away on the Monday morning, but remained all day on Monday till the unfortunate circumstance took place. Previous to this, unknown to Mr. Yates, Mr. Sellers had been furnished with arms; you will find that he had a brace of pistols brought in a box, with ammunition in large quantities; that he had, besides that, a hanger, which was afterwards discovered in a place where I do not know whether it was meant to be secreted, but certainly to be kept out of sight, and with which Mr. Yates was certainly not acquainted. He, therefore, under all these circumstances, considered himself perfectly safe in the house, supposing notwithstanding any little altercation that might arise between him and the lady, that it was with her alone that he had a right to settle the business. His wife, who had joined him a few days after his late return from Bristol, was out on the Monday upon some occasion, and Mr. Yates dined alone. After his dinner, about five o'clock, he went into the garden for a short time; at that time, the servant says, Miss Jones came into the kitchen, as if to observe what was going forward; she asked her if she wanted her own servant, she made no answer. The servant went to the garden door and found it fastened; she went to the other back door, and found that bolted and the key taken away; she saw her master walking in the garden, and after that heard him pushing at the door through which he had gone into the garden, endeavouring to get in; she heard a window break, whether he broke the window, or whether it was by the shaking of the window, she does not know; however, the window was broke; the door was not opened, he then went down some stone steps into the area, and called his servant, who helped him up to the window, where he was getting in, but unfortunately being a corpulent man, and the bars not being wide enough, he could not get in; while she had hold of his arm assisting him, she heard something behind her, she turned round, and saw Mr. Sellers with a pistol in his hand; he said something, but what she cannot particularly tell; she was alarmed and said, "for God's sake don't shoot my master!" Mr. Yates was then near enough to put his hand and turn the muzzle of the pistol on one side, and said, "What are you about; you don't mean to shoot me?" She then saw him either put his thumb to the cock of the pistol, or the lock, for it is a lock pistol, and immediately discharged it within half a minute from the moment that he touched it; and it was not touched as if it went off by accident, but prepared in the mode that I have described. He being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140014"></xptr>higher than Mr. Sellers, and confined in this way, being unable to stir, the pistol went off as if it was intended so the head, though he was in that posture, for the ball went through the hat, entered at his breast, and out at the opposite side; he immediately cried out, "I am wounded, murder! murder!" but before he had got far in the garden he fell.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this being done coolly, as I have stated to you, the girl, seeming the only person alarmed in the house, cried out that her master was murdered; nothing passed between her and Mr. Sellers, she ran up stairs, she could not get out at the door, found every thing fastened, she returned down stairs, and got out at the front area, and over the iron rails, which appears an extraordinary exertion for such a girl. By her screams several persons were alarmed; Mr. Sellers was then got out at the door, and she said, that is the villain, or that is the rascal, that had shot her master, for God's sake secure him. Upon gaining access into the house, several persons went into the garden to the deceased; he described the person who had shot him, he said, "Mr. Sellers has shot me;" he described him as a man dressed in black, with light hair; Mr. Sellers was brought to him, and he said, "yes, that is the man that shot me, but (says he) Miss Jones has been the instigation of it." He was frequently asked questions relative to it, and repeatedly said, "that till Mr. Beard intermeddled with it all was harmony;" he was asked, whether he thought it was done designedly or not; he said, "yes, it was; and that Miss Jones was at the bottom of all." Gentlemen, after this, I believe, the lady was accosted, and told what he had said; she said,"it was very true, she had been accessary to the whole of it." Gentlemen, Mr. Graham going to him, and finding him not likely to recover, begged of him to say nothing about it, not even to mention their names from that hour, but turn his thoughts another way. Every thing of that sort tended only to aggravate his feelings.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen, the three persons at the bar are indicted equally for having been guilty of murder; they might, two of them, have been indicted as accessaries before the fact, but I will tell you, Gentlemen, why they were not so indicted; although they might not have been actually upon the spot at the time the pistol was discharged, yet, if they prepared the pistol, loaded it, assisted, handled, did any thing to produce that which was the cause of his death, they are equally guilty of murder in the eye of the law, as if they had been actually present.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, there is no way of accounting for this transaction, I apprehend, but in either of these three ways; the death of the party will be proved to you beyond contradiction, the hand from whom he received his death will be equally proved; it must, therefore, have taken place either from accident, from necessiry, or from malice aforethought. From accident it is hardly possible it should have happened, because, from the circumstances I have already stated, the girl saw Mr. Sellers come down from another room with a pistol in his hand, they having first taken measures to compel him to that situation in which he was to meet his death; they had given him no notice that he would be opposed, he felt himself in perfect security; they staid till he came to a window, where they knew he must resort, and there put him to death; if it was by accident, why was the pistol charged, why was it loaded, why was it presented, when the man could not get in, as evidently he could not? - I am sure I need not say any more to you upon that subject.</p>
               <p>Was it then of necessity? There was nothing to produce that necessity; admitting that he had nor a right there, had he been a trespasser, and the pistol had been wilfully fired, it would have been murder. The taking the pistol at all is a thing that cannot be justified, or even excused.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, then there is no other way of considering it but supposing that it was done from malice; and I confess, I am sorry to say, that there appears to me to be no doubt of this. It may be said it was intended to terrify him; an empty pistol would have terrified a man as well as a loaded one; if I wished to frighten a man with a loaded pistol, I would let him know that it was loaded; but here it is kept out of sight, there is no notice given of it, and he had no apprehension of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, if the prisoners can account for it in any other way I shall be exteremely happy; if, on the other hand, you should be of opinion that it was done wilfully, you will do your duty, however painful that duty may be.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell us what you observed, when Mr. Beard, Mr. Yates, and Miss Jones were together? - A. When all three were together in my presence -</p>
               <p>Q. When was this? - A. It must be shortly after the funeral of Mr.

               <p>Q. Mr. Beard is Miss Jones's proctor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now state what passed? - A. I saw no disposition on the part of Miss Jones or Mr. Yates to quarrel, but I did on the part of Mr. Beard, to step out of the line of an adviser, and appeared very much to irritate Mr. Yates.</p>


               <p>Q. Don't state to us in general what you observed as to disposition, but tell us what Mr. Beard said, that produced this idea in your mind? - A. I cannot immediately recollect the expressions, but I know the amount was this, that he, Mr. Yates, had no business there; that he, Mr.Beard, would turn him out of the house; that if he would not go quietly, he would certainly take some steps to get him out; and these expressions were uttered in a manner not at all pleasant to any man, and not such as could be received by Mr. Thomas Yates, in a manner that would induce him to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever might pass from other persons, there seemed the utmost harmony to prevail between Mr.

             and Miss Jones? - A. There really did to me; and I went so far as to say to Mr. Beard, that the parties themselves seemed very well satisfied with one another, and that I did think it would be better if he would confine himself to the strict line of his professional duty, as the adviser of Miss Jones, and would not take upon himself the act of the party.</p>
               <p>Q. He lived there from early in April, till late in June? - A. Yes; and then he went to Bristol, how long he staid there I cannot say; because, before his return, I went into Herefordshire, where I staid until within a few days of the death of Mr. Yates; the accident happened on the Monday; I think I must have returned about the Friday preceding.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the Monday, the day when this affair took place, Mr. Beard calling upon you? - A. About four o'clock on the same day, I think, on my return from the office in Hatton-Garden, at my house in Russel-street, Mr. Beard called upon me, he desired me to write a note to her, proposing to be up there in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he call upon you afterwards? - A. The same evening, at the office, after the accident; I think about a quarter after seven, to tell me of the accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he call upon you twice at your house? - A. No, only once.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the deceased? - A. I went from the office to Bow-street, where I did not stay a minute hardly, and then to Stafford-row, when I found Mr. Yates had been put to bed.</p>

               <p>Q. You were present at Mr. Yates's funeral? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Miss Jones had the ordering and disposition of that funeral? - A. I understood it was consented on the part of Miss Jones, that she and Mr. Yates might give such directions as should seem bell, and that the expences should come out of the property, that they had each that privilege.</p>
               <p>Q. But had she not the direction and management of the funeral? - A. That I don't know, because I only attended it.</p>
               <p>Q. There was, I believe, very soon after the death of Mr. Yates, a search made for papers, found in Mr. Yates's bureau, or possession? - A. There was; at my particular recommendation.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was the first that actually searched? - A. I did, myself; I turned over every paper.</p>

               <p>Q. Was his proctor there, when the papers were searched? - A. One of the clerks was.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take so active a part when the clerk of the proctor was there? - A. When he called upon me with the papers set up as testamentary papers, it struck me that it would be a matter of dispute indeed, he told me he had been advised to enter a caveat, and I pointed out to him the delays as well as the inconveniencies of the law, and therefore desired him not to go one step further, if he could come to a compromise with Miss Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. And you knew, at that time, that other persons were claiming as next of kin? - A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Yates had not told you that other persons were claiming as next of kin? - A. I don't recollect that he had.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole of this property is personal? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Yates, you have told us, was in this house, living in the house from April to June, and I think I understood you to say, that between that period of time, it was, that Mr. Beard had told Mr. Yates, he had no right in the house; was Miss Jones and Mr. Yates both present? - A. They were; when Mr. Beard the proctor told Mr. Yates he had no right to be in the house, is it at all necessary that I should state what reply I made?</p>

               <p>Court. Certainly.</p>
               <p>A. I said, that in my opinion, he was very well founded in his claim, as in the testamentary papers they themselves had set up, there was an annuity to him of 40l. a year; and we could get from them no account of any other property of Mr. Yates, and therefore no other part of the property he was to look to for the security of this annuity, but the house in which he was in possession, and which I had desired him to get into possession, and I do most perfectly remember my saying they were both in possession, they had a right to joint possession, and let them keep it jointly in God's name; and I would even, now the papers were locked up, advise Mr. Yates to go about his business, and leave Miss Jones in quiet possession, and Miss Jones acknowledged they were in joint possession; I said, as they were in joint possession, keep it amicably if you stay together, and she said she would; and if there was any quarrel between them, it should be Mr. Yates's fault not her's; he said he would not quarrel with her, and if Mr. Beard would let him alone, he should be perfectly satisfied.</p>
               <p>Q. This was before he went to Bath? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Yates returned from Bath, he brought his wife and family with him? - A. I was not in town when he returned.</p>
               <p>Q. But you now know that he did? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mr. Yates's wife ever been there previously to the time of Mr. Yates's going to Bath? A. She had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not now know, that when Mr. Yates returned from Bath, that that was objected to by Miss Jones? - A. I was not there, I have heard so, and I believe it to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. After the inventory was taken, I believe you proposed some accommodation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the answer to that, that Miss Jones desired to have the opinion of a Court of Justice upon the validity of these wills? - A. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that the answer given to the accommodation you proposed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it accepted? - A. It was not; I waited upon Miss Jones, I told her I waited upon her from Mr. Yates, to ask her if she was open to an accommodation, that I did not wish to take any advantage of her, that I wished her to have a friend of her's, and Mr. Yates a friend of his, and she said she would be guided by her proctor.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear from Miss Jones, that she wished to have the opinion of a Court of Justice? - A. She did not, because, in all the meetings I have had with Miss Jones, and Mr. Yates, and Mr. Beard, upon the subject of law, she was perfectly silent, leaving it entirely to her proctor to speak for her.</p>
               <p>Q. I think I understood you to say, that about four o'clock on the day of the accident, Mr. Beard came to your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were desired to go there? - A. Yes; but I did not go, it was my duty to attend the office in Hatton-Garden, and I could not.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she at any part of the time in town? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She certainly was not however at Miss Jones's house? - A. No; because I do recollect before Mr. Yates went out of town to Bath, I strongly recommended when he mentioned his intention once or twice, not to think of such a thing as bringing his wife into the house.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen have certainly a right to make use of any thing that they think will be of use, but in a case of this sort, I think the right of possession has nothing to do with the case. (Mr. Serjeant Shepherd made some observations to his Lordship, but in so low a voice that it could not be heard.)</p>
               <p>Q. When Mr. Beard called upon you at four, did not Mr. Beard show you a paper? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that paper? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then his request was confined to your going to the house? - A. Yes; upon looking at the account of the smith, and the keys, something does occur to me, but I think that was not from Mr. Beard, but what I was told after I got to the house; conscientiously speaking, I don't believe Mr. Beard did show me this.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke of his wife, had he any family? - A. Two children.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take them there? - A. He brought them to town, but I don't believe he carried them to the house.</p>

               <p>Q. But did you hear from any body else that he had destroyed any papers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stated to Miss Jones that Mr. Yates and she had joint possession of the house, what answer did she make? - A. I don't know that it was any answer in words, but a nod of assent, or something that plainly indicated her assent.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he go out at all? - A. I am not quite certain; I believe he did, and he returned again in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the accident happen? - A. About five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Yates at home at that time? - A. No; she was out.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on Monday, do you remember the day of the month? - A. The 21st of August, and he died the 22d about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the Monday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140018"></xptr>Q. Did Mr. Yates dine there? - A. In the morning Mr. Yates got up about eight o'clock, and he came down to breakfast, and he had not any breakfast that morning; he went and laid down on the bed; he got up again and dined by himself in the parlour about four o'clock; Mrs. Yates went out about one; we were locked in all day; Miss Jones had locked the door and kept the key in a cupboard in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that of your own knowledge? - A. I saw her take the key out of the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were all the doors locked? - A. No; only the street-door in the morning; and then she stopped in the passage and whispered with Mr. Sellers, but I could not hear what she said; I was going out of an errand, and I went and told Mr. Yates the door was locked; and he said, what was the reason that he was always to be locked in; we were locked in of a night; Mr. Sellers had the key then.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before the Monday morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he had the key? - A. I saw him take it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see the key in his possession on the Monday? - A. No; Miss Jones had it then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. How did Mr. Yates get out, or you go out of an errand? - A. Mr. Yates said to Mr. Sellers, what is the reason that I am always to be locked in?</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see Miss Jones put the key in the cupboard and lock it up? - A. No; but I saw her take it out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your master go out before you wanted to go out of an errand? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her with the key unlock the cupboard? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you apply to to get out? - A. I told my master, Mr. Yates, and Mr. Yates said to Mr. Sellers, what is the reason I am to be locked in always, and Miss Jones was standing by at the same time. Mr. Sellers said, that Miss Jones had got the key; Miss Jones turned herself round and said, she would let anybody out, but she would let nobody in.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - A. Between twelve and one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You went out before your mistress? - A. Yes; Mr. Sellers whispered to Miss Jones, and told her to let me out, I heard what he said.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did she let you out? - A. No; Mr. Sellers and Miss Jones went into the back parlour, and Mr. Footner, and I heard them whispering for about five minutes, and then Mr. Sellers came out of the back parlour with the key, and opened the door, and told me, when I came back, to knock, and he would let me in again; Mr. Yates then whispered to me, and told me to bring a smith in with me, they were in the parlour then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Miss Jones and Mr. Sellers hear that? - A. I don't think they heard, because they were in the parlour; I went out for about ten minutes, and I brought a smith with me to the door; I knocked at the door, and Miss Jones's servant maid looked out at the window, and saw there was a man with me, and I saw her go up stairs to them; Mr. Sellers came to the door, and saw the man with me, and smacked the door to again, and locked it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he let you in then? - A. No, he did not; Mr. Green, the smith, was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the father or the son? - A. The father. I then went to the next door, and got a chair, and Mr. Green got in at the front parlour window.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the parlour your master sat in? - A. Yes; and every body who came to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get in that way? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master there? - A. Yes, and Mrs. Yates likewise; I saw them both in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were you in the house again? - A. Mr. Green went to the street-door to take the lock off.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you get in? - A. Not till Mr. Green had taken the lock off the street-door, and opened it; there was rather a wrangle in the passage at the time on the inside, I could not hear what passed, except that I heard Mr. Yates come to the window, and called to me, and said, go call in the neighbours, they are going to murder me.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard nothing more particular? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe when you got into the house? - A. Nothing; only the lock taken off, and Mr. Sellers and Mr. Footner in the passage; my master and mistress were in the front parlour, Mr. Green was in the passage, and Mr. Footner and Mr. Sellers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what the lock was taken off for? - A. Yes; Mr. Yates said, he would have a key made to the street-door as well as they, as he could neither get in nor out.</p>
               <p>Q. And did they all hear that that was the purpose for which it was taken off? - A. Yes; he told Mr. Green in the passage, before them, to make a key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they agree to what passed? - A. Mr. Sellers said, that the lawyers must sight it out, that he had no business to take the lock off, that the lawyers were to meet that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Mr. Sellers said that? - A. Yes; I will say nothing but what I heard and saw; they desired him not to alter any of the springs of the lock, and Mr. Green promised them he would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Green went away? - A. Yes; and directly after that, my mistress sent me out for a coach for her, she was very ill; a coach came, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140019"></xptr>I fetched her bonnet and cloak down stairs, and she went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Green had then got the lock to make the key? - A. Yes; after that, as soon as my mistress was gone, Miss Jones sent her servant for a coach, and then Mr. Sellers, his wife and child, went away; that was between one and two o'clock at noon.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear any reason assigned why they went away? - A. No; I did not know what Mr. Sellers went away for, but I knew what Mrs. Yates went for.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed after that? - A. About an hour afterwards Mr. Green brought the lock home.</p>
               <p>Q. Were Miss Jones, Mr. Sellers, and Mr. Footner present when he brought it back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass? - A. No other than Mr. Sellers turned his back to the door, and said, he would not have the lock put on till the lawyers met.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it put on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about altering it? - A. Mr. Sellers asked him if he had altered any of the springs of it, and he said, no; and Mr. Green then put it on; this was about three o'clock, or a little after; while Mr. Green was putting the lock on, Miss Jones came out to the parlour-door, and said to Mr. Sellers, don't say any thing more, Mr. Sellers, it will all be decided to-night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the time that Mr. Sellers was saying any thing to Mr. Green? - A. Mr. Sellers had just spoke, and said, he would not have the lock put on till the evening; Mr. Sellers then went into the parlour, Mr. Green went away, and Mr. Yates went into the front parlour by himself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any thing happen between that and your master's dinner? - A. No; Mr. Yates sent me out for his dinner, and I left him sitting upon the stone steps behind the house that go down to the garden, and when I came back I found him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the doors fast then? - A. No; all the doors were open except the chamber doors; the street door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen till after dinner? - A. No; I got his dinner, and he dined about four o'clock in the front parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. All at this time was quiet? - A. Yes; I took his dinner up, and he sat down to dinner; he finished his dinner about half past four, I took the things away, and carried them down stairs into the front kitchen where Miss Jones's servant is.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you separate kitchens? - A. No; we lived together in the same kitchen.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You constantly use the same kitchen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the kitchen, do you know what became of your master? - A. I left him in the parlour; I sat still in the kitchen, and I heard my master go down the stairs into the garden; it was about a quarter before five, or it might be rather more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of Miss Jones, Mr. Sellers, or Mr. Footner after that? - A. I heard them; Miss Jones came down into the back kitchen, and then she came and just peeped into the front kitchen where I and Miss Jones's servant were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she speak to you, or you to her? - A. No; she went through the kitchen to a door that leads from the back kitchen into the area.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her do any thing there? - A. No; she went immediately up stairs; as soon as she was gone, I went out into the back area, and looked, and Mr. Yates was then in the garden walking towards the stone steps.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you next hear and see when the prisoners were up stairs? - A. All was quiet and still then up stairs; a little while after Miss Jones came down stairs again, and went into the back kitchen, looked there, and did not offer to come near the front kitchen, but went towards the back door that leads into the area.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she do any thing then? - A. As soon as she left the door I went to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the do any thing then? - A. I heard her shut the door; I went to it immediately as she left it, I thought it very odd of her shutting the door, and it was locked, and the key taken out, and bolted with two bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that door was open before? - A. Yes; I am sure of it, and all our doors were open; she went up stairs, and I heard her shoe heels go across the back parlour, and shut the shutter of one of the back parlour windows, the window next to the stone steps.</p>
               <p>Q. That window was next the stone steps so that any body might have got in there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you suppose it was Miss Jones that crossed the room? - A. Because I heard the shoe-heels go across the room as women's shoe-heels do; there was no other woman up stairs but herself.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened next? - A. I heard a kind of bustle in the passage from the back parlour door that leads to the stone steps of the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular? - A. As if two men were there, and I could not tell what they were doing; next the door-window was broke; the door had half glass and half wood.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard it break? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not tell who did it? - A. No; but I heard Mr. Yates pushing and calling at the outside of the door; then I immediately ran out of the front kitchen into the back kitchen; and as I passed the stairs I looked up, and observed two men at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140020"></xptr>the top of the kitchen stairs, which, upon looking round I perceived to be Mr. Sellers and Mr. Footner standing at the door that goes down the stone steps into the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the stairs so situated that you could see who was at that door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else there? - A. I heard Miss Jones in the passage, but I did not see her.</p>
               <p>Q. In the same passage? - A. No; in the passage from the front parlour to the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. These two men were standing at the garden door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What passage was it you heard Miss Jones in? - A. The passage from one parlour to the other; it leads strait down to the garden door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. It is in one line? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. But so far back that you could not see her? - A. Yes; I went into the back kitchen, and got upon the dresser, and from the dresser I got up to the window; I looked out, and saw Mr. Yates upon the top of the stone steps, and seeing me, he said, "open the window," I opened the window immediately, Mr. Yates came down the stone steps; the kitchen window had got three bars across the window, and he put his head between, his stomach leaning over one of the bars trying to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at this time? - A. I had got hold of his two shoulders helping to pull him in; and hearing somebody come down the kitchen stairs, I looked round, and saw Mr. Sellers with a pistol in his right hand; I immediately cried out, and said, "for God's sake don't shoot him!" and then I said, "for God's sake don't let it off!" Mr. Sellers said to me, "Mr. Yates must not come in;" and Mr. Yates immediately drew himself back, but being a lustly man, he was quite fixed in the window, that he could not get himself out; he drew himself back, and got all out but his head; and as he was drawing back, Mr. Sellers presented a pistol to him, and he held out his right hand to put the pistol away on one side, but he could not; immediately after he laid his hand down upon the iron bar, the hand that he had tried to put the pistol away with, as if to push himself out.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he do that after he had touched the pistol? - A. He had not touched it; he put his hand out to push it on one side, but he could not; he tried to get out, but he had got his hat upon his head, which stuck between the bars; Mr. Sellers had got his thumb at the top of the pistol, and his finger underneath.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see his thumb move? - A. I saw him lay his thumb upon the pistol, and his fingers move underneath, and it went off immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see his thumb move? - A. No.(

             produced a pistol, which was put into the hand of the witness, who described it that his thumb was behind the cock, and his fingers at the trigger.)</p>
               <p>Q. (To the Witness). How long after Mr. Yates had put his hand upon the bar was it that the pistol went off? - A. Not a minute.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he touch Mr. Sellers' hand? - A. No; he could not touch his hand.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. And the pistol in the same direction? - A. He held the pistol to Mr. Yates; he held it to him first when he began to draw back.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long might it be from the time he first came down to the time of firing the pistol? - A. It might be a couple of minutes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You say the pistol went off? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. And you saw Mr. Sellers at the time? - A. I was close to Mr. Sellers at the time; after he had let the pistol off, I screamed out, and Mr. Sellers said, "he is not hurt, he is not hurt."</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is that all that he said at the time? A. Yes; and he said nothing more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. What became of your master? - A. Mr. Yates said immediately, he was shot, I am wounded, murder three times; he got his head out of the window, his hat dropped off, and he ran to the garden wall with his two hands upon his wound, and cried murder three times; he said first he was wounded; I then went and alarmed the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get out? - A. I was close by Mr. Sellers in the corner, but I shoved myself away, and ran out of the back kitchen into the front kitchen; the front kitchen window had got bars over it, and I forced one of the bars away, and I cried,"murder, that my master was shot in the garden;" I got upon the rails, and a woman helped me over; Mr. Footner opened the front parlour window, and said, I was mad, there was nobody hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this while you were telling the mob of it? - A. Yes; he said, the girl was mad, that there was nobody shot in the house, nor yet in the garden; he went immediately away from the window, and Mr. Sellers went into the street and shut the door after him, and, as soon as he came out, I said, "that is the rascal that shot my master, lay hold of him," and immediately a man laid hold of him; as soon as I said he was the man that shot my master, Mr. Sellers said, he would deliver himself up before any Justice; and a man knocked at the door and said,"is there no entrance into this house, the man is here," they did not let him in, he went in at the next door, the man went round and got in some how, for he came and opened the street door, and let me in.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140021"></xptr>Q. When you went in what did you see? - A. I saw Miss Jones in the front parlour, and Mr. Footner in the back parlour, and I said to Miss Jones,"it is all through you that Mr. Yates is shot," and she said,"hush, hush," twice; she said no more, and then I went down into the garden, and there Mr. Yates was lying assisted by a good many people; he was lying in the garden on the second green - the garden was divided; I perceived his wound bleeding very much indeed, he laid upon his right side, and when he saw me, he laid hold of my hand, and said,"fetch your mistress," and then he said again,"send for her." He had been talking before to somebody else, but I did not hear what he said, and in about three quarters of an hour Mrs. Yates came in, he was lying then in the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the pistols, after that? - A. I went just before Mr. Yates came in, into the passage, right opposite the front parlour door, and I saw this pistol, or a pistol like it, lying under a mahogany table in the passage, opposite the front parlour door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take up the pistol when you saw it? - A. Some men were looking for some pistols, I cannot tell who they were, and I looked under the table, there were two chairs and two tables standing in the passage, and I looked and saw the pistol lie under the table, and I stooped down to take it up.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It did not lie in the back kitchen? - A. No, in the passage, opposite the front parlour door; I stooped to take it up, and Miss Jones, who was standing at the parlour door, said,"let it lie," and I let it lie, and a man came and took it up.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by the hat? - A. There was a kind of a bench by the window, where he was trying to get in, and I took it off the bench; he had this hat on when the pistol went off; this is the neckcloth he had on, and this is the waistcoat he had on, (the hat and waistcoat handed to the Jury). After the examination at Bow-street the first night, I came home and went into the front parlour first, and then into the back parlour, and the cupboard door was locked, which Miss Jones used to keep her glasses and salts in, and the key was in the door, it was locked; I unlocked it, and looked into the cupboard, and this cutlass was laid at the bottom of the cupboard,(produces it).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to have access to that cupboard before? - A. No; Miss Jones's servant was ill about a fortnight, and the closet was always kept open before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any arms there before? - A. I never saw any thing of the kind there before.</p>

               <p>Q. When were you examined the third time? - A. I was examined then on a Tuesday, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, young woman, tell me first where you have lived since this melancholy affair happened? - A. With Mrs. Yates ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any gentleman at all concerned in this prosecution since the time you were examined at Bow-street? - A. I don't know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen that gentleman, (pointing to the Solicitor) since you were examined at Bow-street? - A. Yes; I saw that gentleman yesterday; I cannot say I saw him any other time but when I was examined till yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. You came into this house where Miss Jones lived, on the Wednesday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known any thing of Miss Jones before that time? - A. Yes; I had been at Miss Jones's house for a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the Wednesday, when you came there as a servant of Mr. Yates? - Not quite a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you first acquaintance with Miss Jones, or with Mr. Yates, or with Mrs. Yates? - A. The first acquaintance that I had, my mother lived at Miss Jones's as a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been discharged from the place of Miss Jones? - A. No, she was very ill; and when I had just left my place, she had me to do for her; while she was ill; that was the first acquaintance I had with Miss Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it your mother left Miss Jones's place; how long was it before you went as a servant to Mrs. Yates? - A. She had not left her, she was in the place at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went on the Wednesday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She remained as the servant of Miss Jones in the house? - A. Yes, until the Sunday.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you aware of what the smith was intended for when you went in execution of this message? - A. Yes; because Mr. Yates said he would not be locked out so.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew at that time that it would be objected to by Mr. Sellers and Miss Jones? - A. I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Yates said to you in a whisper? - A. My mistress called to me first from the top of the stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you went out for this smith? - A. I did not go out on purpose for the smith, I went out of an errand to get some potatoes for dinner, and I was directed to bring the smith in with me.</p>

               <p>Q. And then you thought proper to get a chair, and the smith got in at the parlour window? - A. The servant maid looked out at the kitchen window, and saw a man was with me; and I heard her go and tell Mr. Sellers, and he opened the street-door and shut the door to again when he saw the man.</p>

               <p>Q. And then you got a chair, and the smith got in at the window? - A. I told him to get in.</p>

               <p>Q. Mr. Sellers objected to it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not know what Mrs. Sellers went out for? - A. No; but she went out in a coach, and her child with her.</p>
               <p>Q. During the course of this time there was nothing that passed as between Mr. Sellers and Mr. Yates that you have related? - A. No; no quarrelling between them at all; when the quarreling was, it was always brought on by Miss Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from what you had seen from Mr. Sellers being in the house, you never perceived any quarrelling between him and Mr. Yates? - A. No; Mr. Yates and Mr. Sellers were talking very freely indeed in the garden, Mr. Sellers at the back-parlour window, and Mr. Yates in the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Very samiliarly and good naturedly? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there quarrels between Miss Jones and Mr. Yates? - A. Yes; a quarrel on the Friday; Mrs. Yates had been very ill for a long time, and she had got my bed in her room, and Mr. Yates had got a gentleman come to see him; Miss Jones and Mr. Sellers went into Mrs. Yates's room, and took away the bed that I stept upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the quarrel carried to any length, did they use any hard language to one another? - A. No, no hard language at all.</p>

               <p>Q. On the Monday, at the time the smith came and was there any quarrel between Miss Jones and Mr. Yates then? - A. No; not before the lock was taken off.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Yates, although he would not go out it the front door went frequently into the garden? - A. Yes; very frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. You had learned from them all, that the lawyers were to be there in the evening? - A. Yes; from what I had heard say.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Sellers you know was gone at this time? - A. Yes; she had not returned, nor Mrs. Yates; when Mrs. Yates came in Mrs. Sellers returned at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Yates went down into the garden, and they shut the door to keep him in the garden? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In short all the place was so fast at the back of the house as to keep Mr. Yates out? - A. Yes; the first floor window upon the stairs had the shutters shut, and the back parlour window shutters were put to, and the sliding shutter upon the garden door was shut, and a little window to show light upon the stairs, and that shutter was shut to.</p>
               <p>Q. But so far as the doors went they were closed, so that it was impossible to force them? - A. Yes; it was impossible for any body to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. You were obliged to open the window to him when he called to you that he would come in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now be a little particular at this time; when Mr. Yates was out in the garden and wanted to come into the house through the window and called to you, you were in the kitchen in order to give all the assistance you could to such an intent? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140024"></xptr>Q. That was in the back kitchen? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Having called to you, how long was it that you might be there endeavouring to open the window? - A. He did not call to me till he saw me at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been at this window; did he call tolerably loud? - A. He called to me to open the window, any body might hear him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it about then that Mr. Sellers came from above stairs into the kitchen with the pistol? - A. When he called to me to open the window, he was upon the stone steps pushing against the door, then he saw me at the window, and he called to me to open the window, and came to me; he was down the steps in an instant.</p>
               <p>Q. And then it was that Mr. Sellers came from above stairs with a pistol in his hand? - A. Yes; when Mr. Yates was trying to get in at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Sellers then came down stairs by himself, and was there by himself with a pistol in his hand? - A. Yes; I did not see any body else, but I heard people in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. And he said to Mr. Yates, Mr. Yates, you must not come in? - A. Yes; and then Mr. Yates drew back-</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the pistol, were not you very much alarmed? - A. I was very much frightened indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out to your master? - A. I did not call to my master, as I supposed he saw the pistol, because he drew back immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Sellers did not fire the pistol immediately, but held up the pistol to frighten him? - A. He presented the pistol, and Mr. Yates drew himself back.</p>
               <p>Q. Try your recollection; you were examined the same evening, recollect the account that you gave then, as far as you can, about the hand of Mr. Yates being upon the pistol? - A. I said that night what I say now.</p>
               <p>Q. There are a great many people heard what you said, did you say or not, that he had hold of the pistol? - A. I said that he had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he, in fact, hold of the pistol? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as to the letting off the pistol, did not you say, that if the pistol had gone off at the time his hand was up, it must have shot him through the hand? - A. The gentleman asked me if I was sure the pistol did not go off at the time of his putting up his hand to it, and I said, no; if it had, it must have gone through his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, alarmed and frightened as you were, did you attend more to the situation of your master than that of Mr. Sellers who was standing with the pistol in his hand? - A. I looked at my master, and then I looked at Mr. Sellers, to see if his hand went so as to let it off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see a pistol fired before? - A No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you so collected, in this state of alarm, as to take notice of the thumb and finger, and your master, in that situation? - A. Yes; I took notice of all that I saw.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You looked at your master first, and then at Mr. Sellers, why did you look at Mr. Sellers? - A. I looked when I saw his hand go here; I thought it must be to fire the pistol, and then I said,"for God's sake don't shoot him, for God's sake don't fire it off."</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, when you were examined by the Magistrate, describing the thumb upon the lock, but not saying a word about the finger? - A. I said, that the thumb was here, but I did not say any thing about the finger; I was very much confused when I went to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. But do you recollect what you said about the melancholy situation of Miss Jones before the Magistrate after this accident, that Miss Jones appeared extremely melancholy? - A. I said, Miss Jones walked up and down the parlour when a great mob of people came in, she did not seem to mind it before, but after that, she walked up and down the parlour, and still kept laughing every now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. When you spoke to Miss Jones of this, that she was the occasion, that it was through her that your poor master had been shot, what answer did you give before the Magistrate? - A. I said to her, that he would not have been shot if it had not been for her; and she said, "hush, hush."</p>
               <p>Q. Now, why should you have conceived so? - A. Because she always seemed so spiteful to him; and to Mrs. Yates more so.</p>
               <p>Q. It was then from what you had observed before, that you conceived this had happened? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, immediately after the pistol was fired, you, of course, were then more alarmed than you were at first? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you immediately determined to alarm the neighbourhood, and get into the street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was what you intended to do? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Other matters could not press upon your attention, you were determined to get out? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know were your mother is at present? - A. Yes; she is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Where has she lived since this unfortunate affair? - A. No. 23, Pall-Mall.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the wages, about which there has been a quarrel, ever been paid, to your knowledge? - A. There was no quarrel about it; she has never had her wages of Miss Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say a syllable, notwithstanding you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140025"></xptr>were examined over and over again, did you say a syllable about Mr. Footner coming into the parlour, or saying a word to the people without doors, or any thing like it, at any of the examinations? - A. I did all but the first; I did not in the first.</p>
               <p>Court. I see she did not, but one of the other witnesses did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. I ask you again whether you said a syllable about that circumstance, relative to Mr. Footner, before the Magistrates? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time when this melancholy affair took place where was Mr. Sellers, in the kitchen by himself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had not been there, could your master have got in without your opening the window? - A. He could have opened the window outside.</p>
               <p>Q. But your assistance would have rendered it more easy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These bars, were there any difficulty in getting in between these bars? - A. Yes; for such a lusty man as Mr. Yates.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe, as particularly as you can, the situation in which Mr. Yates was at the instant the pistol went off? - A. He was laying over the bar, with his head down, and his hat on.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he standing with respect to his body? - A. Stooping.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Mr. Sellers placed, was Mr. Sellers's hand above or below Mr. Yates when he presented the pistol? - A. No; he presented the pistol to Mr. Yates.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Sellers close to the bar of the window? - A. There was a dresser, like a window-seat, that Mr. Sellers I don't think could reach him with his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were they together at the moment the pistol went off? - A. The pistol was about that near to him. (About half a yard).</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What part of Mr. Yates was next to the pistol? - A. His head.</p>
               <p>Q. And the pistol was within a foot and a half of his head? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. You have told me, that with respect even to Mr. Sellers and Mr. Yates, it appeared to be all amity, no ill will? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was not the least appearance of ill will, nor any conversation, hardly, between Mr. Footner and Mr. Yates? - A. No; Mr. Yates knew nothing at all about Mr. Footner.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. At which bar was he endeavouring to get in? - A. He was over the lower bar, he could not get over the second.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. How high was that bar from the ground? - A. The window was not very high from the ground.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Should you think his legs touched the ground? - A. I am not certain; to the best of my knowledge, I think he was kneeling down upon the bench close to the window.</p>

            , the maid servant of Mr. Yates, said,"that is the person that shot my master;" upon that, Mr. Jagger, a stone-mason, or carpenter, or whatever he is, seized that gentleman in black by the collar; and Mr. Sellers said,"he was willing to go before any Justice, or to send for a constable;" upon which Jagger said, "in such a case as that, he thought that any body was constable."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the parlour-window at this time? - A. At the same time, I observed Mr. Footner, the other gentleman, throw up the window, as the girl was making a noise to the populace in the street; what he said to her I cannot say, but I heard him use these words - "that there was nobody shot in the house, or in the garden."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any body else? - A. Fanny, a late maid of Miss Jones's, came to the window, and called to me to tell Mary, that if she would come to the door she would let her in, that was Mary Thompson, and I did so, by which means I got in myself;

               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Tell us the situation in which you found him? - A. I found him in the garden lying upon the grass-plat; I immediately observed that his would was mortal.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you say so to him? - A. I did; and to all the people about him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This was before the other surgeons came? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. What conversation had you with him, did you give him any advice? - A. I asked him who was the person that had done it; and the people pointed to Mr. Sellers; I went up to him, and asked Mr. Sellers what the pistol was loaded with? he said with balls; I asked him if there was more than one? he said, but one; I then returned to the deceased, and had him bled, and heard him say,"that Miss Jones was the cause of all."</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after you said it was mortal? - A. Yes; I advised him if he had any affairs to settle he would immediately set about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Loud enough for him to hear? - A. Yes; I was close by him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That was, when you first pronounced the wound mortal? - A. When I first saw the wound mortal.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Raine. Q. You were going to tell us what Mr. Yates said concerning Miss Jones? - A. Mr. Yates asked if Miss Jones was secured? Mr. Penny said she was; he said, "she bolted the first door against me."</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after that? - A. I was ordered by Mr. Penny to assist his servant to keep the mob out; I went to the front door, I stopped there to assist Jagger, and another man, to keep out the mob, and guard the door, to see that Mr. Footner nor Miss Jones might not come out.</p>
               <p>Q. Whilst you were guarding the door, did you see Miss Jones or Mr. Footner? - A. I saw them both, one standing on one side the front parlour door, and the other on the other.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Within the parlour? - A. They were standing with their backs against the door-stall; I heard Miss Jones say to Mr. Footner, that she could not have thought that he would have done it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear Mr. Footner say any thing? - A. I heard Mr. Footner, sometime after, and Mr. Johnson, I believe, was questioning him; he said, he was very sorry he had come into the house, the fault was not his; and Mr. Sellers said, say nothing, leave it all till you get to Bow-street. I don't know whether Miss Jones heard it or not, she was in the parlour just by.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. At the time you say that Mr. Footner made use of the expression you have stated to us, the mob were assembling about the house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And the mob were extremely ungovernable and riotous? - A. No; I saw that every body was very much composed.</p>
               <p>Q. However, there was a very large mob? - A. No; being an out-of-the-way place, as it were, there was no great mob; there was no rioting at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to Mr. Yates's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in? - A. I could not go in at the door, I went in at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you knock at the door first? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What window? - A. The back kitchen window.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get to the back kitchen door? A. Over two garden walls? when I got into Mr. Yates's garden I saw the wounded gentleman upon the grass plat.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the first that got there? - A. Yes; when I got into the garden I asked the gentleman if he was wounded, and he said he was; I asked him by whom; he said a person in black with light hair, by which I knew it was a person I met at the front door; I instantly left him, and ran up the stone steps to the back door belonging to the passage; that was fast; I returned from that, and went to the kitchen door, that was fast also; I went through the kitchen window and up the kitchen stair-case, and into the passage, when I saw the gentleman in the front parlour along with a lady.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who that gentleman was? - A. Yes; (paints to Footner) I opened the front door, and there was the other gentleman; he was saying he was willing to go before any Justice or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140027"></xptr>send for a constable; he wanted to go into the front parlour, I would not let him; I took him down to the gentleman and the maid upon the grass plat, and asked him if that was the gentleman that wounded him; he said, yes, that is the man that wounded me.</p>
               <p>Q. After he said that, did you see Footner with him? - A. No; I set off to fetch some surgeons, or any assistance I could get; there was plenty of people about him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Miss Jones and Mr. Footner were in the parlour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came down with Sellers to the grass plat, do you recollect any thing particular said by Mr. Sellers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing that he did? - A. No; only when I was leaving him he was willing to drop upon his right knee; but I left him in that situation.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did he appear willing to fall upon his right knee? - A. As if to Mr. Yates.</p>
               <p>STIKEMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Raine. Q. You live next door to the house of the late Mr. Yates? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the alarm you heard in the garden when you got upon the wall, tell us what passed? - A. I saw Mr. Yates upon one hand and on one knee; he called out to me as soon as I had got my hand upon the wall, for God's sake give me assistance; he said he was wounded; I asked him how; he said he was shut; by whom; by the people in the house; I went round instantly to the front door, and several people were got in; I made the best of my way down to the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body in the front parlour? - A. Several people in both parlours; at that moment I don't know who, for I made the best of my way down to the deceased; I found him in the hands of several persons I had given the alarm to in a carpenter's-yard; I immediately was going up for surgeon Brown, but finding somebody was gone for him, I went, in case he should not be at home, for a young man from the Westminster Infirmary; I went to get him some hartshorn and some cloths; the second or third time that I think I went for some cloths, I saw Mr. Sellers and Miss Jones in the back parlour; I afterwards missed Miss Jones, and saw Footner in the passage walking by himself, with nobody to guard him; he was walking a few paces to and fro in the passage; his appearance was collected enough; I asked him where Miss Jones was, he answered it was no business of mine, she was not going to run away; I said it was my business to see that nobody escaped from it a house; he said then, she was gone up stairs for some things, and I might go after her; I told him I should not go up to be the least indecent or incommode her, I should wait her coming down.</p>
               <p>Q. After this did you go into the garden? - A. Yes; I went into the garden with some linen to bind up Mr. Yates's arm after bleeding; and when I went down into the garden upon further business it was with Mr. Brown and myself, and Mr. Footner, by Mr. Brown's desire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take Mr. Footner to Mr. Yates? - A. Yes; he walked between us, and seemed very willing to submit to any thing that was asked of him; apparently to me, Mr. Brown asked Mr. Yates it he knew that man in brown, (Mr. Footner,) Mr. Yates said, yes, he was in the house at the time; Mr. Footner I believe made some reply to that, but I don't recollect exactly what it was; but however a second conversation took place upon that, which has passed my memory to ascertain immediately what it might be; Mr. Yates said, how came you here; he said, if I had not been sent for I had not been here, and I am very sorry for it; and I believe he was, he seemed to speak with that emphasis as though he spoke what he thought.</p>
               <p>Q. What said Mr. Yates to that? - A. Mr. Yates said, "he shut one door and you shut the other."</p>
               <p>Q. When he said you, who did he address himself to? - A. To Mr. Footner, and that was all that passed; we went away back again to the parlour, Mr. Sellers and Miss Jones were then in the front parlour; when Mr. Sellers came up into the parlour, Mr. Footner said to Mr. Sellers, "you know I know nothing of this business;" Mr. Sellers's answer then was, "we have no business to say any thing till we are at Bow-street;" that finished the conversation.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Abbott. Q. As to what Mr. Footner said to Mr. Yates, I will remind you of what you said at Bow-street; Mr. Footner said to Mr. Yates, I know nothing of the business? - A. I believe he did say he knew nothing of the business; he was very willing to go any where.</p>
               <p>Q. What you said at Bow-street was, that Mr. Footner said to Mr. Yates, I know nothing of the business? - A. I will not say that I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It was so that Mr. Footner said that to Mr. Yates? - A. I cannot take upon me to say that, those words were repeated if I said so, I dare say I was correct.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Const. I live in St. Martin's-court, I am an umbrella-maker; I was, by accident, at Pimlico, about five o'clock on Monday the 22d of August.</p>
               <p>Q. You, I believe, had a great deal of conversation with Mr. Yates? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know Mr. Yates before? - A. No, I did not know any of the parties;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140028"></xptr>what passed I committed to writing, at the desire of several persons; Mr. Sellers was in the garden before me; Mr. Brown, the bricklayer, desired me to put down what he said; I immediately got a pen and ink, and I asked Mr. Yates, Sir, "who shot you?" he immediately pointed his finger to Mr. Sellers, and said, "Mr. Sellers;" I said, "had Mr. Sellers and you any previous quarrel, or at the time the pistol went off, were you in the act of scuffling with Mr. Sellers," "No, no."</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was Mr. Sellers near enough to hear these questions? - A. Close to his right hand; I then immediately asked him, if he thought that Mr. Sellers shot him maliciously, and his reply was,"Yes, yes;" somebody then put the question to Mr. Yates, was Miss Jones accessary to any part of the transaction? immediately he replied, that she was accessary to every transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. During this time, was Mr. Sellers within hearing? - A. Yes; he was as close, as well as I can recollect, as I am to that gentleman, (a gentleman sitting immediately before the witness); he made no reply; sometime after, I withdrew into the parlour; some person there, whom I am not positive to, but, I believe, Mr. Sellers, said, "Miss, they say you have been accessary to every, or, this horrid transaction." and she said, "I have."</p>
               <p>Court. It cannot be supposed, that these persons, being ignorant of the law, would use the word accessary in its strict legal sense; it cannot be supposed that this woman meant to have confessed in that way that she was accessary to the murder.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the Witness). Q. This was after they had been in the garden some time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time this conversation took place, was Mr. Sellers in the parlour? - A. Yes, but I cannot say that Mr. Footner was; when Mr. Footner came in, he addressed Mr. Sellers, and said,"you know I was not in the kitchen at the time;" to which he made him no positive answer, but said, "hold your tongue, we have no occasion to say any thing here;" upon which Mr. Footner turned round, clapped his hand upon his breast, and seemed very much distressed in his mind, at not receiving an explicit answer; Mr. Footner was in such a situation, that he might easily have escaped; he furnished me with pen, ink, and paper, and was very willing to do all in his power to assist me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Shepherd. Q. I understand you now to say, that you asked whether the pistol went off in the act of scuffling? - A. I asked Mr. Yates if he had had any previous quarrel with Mr. Sellers, or, at the time, were you in the act of scuffling, that the pistol went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the conversation you stated, when you were first examined? - A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself, upon your oath, did you say one word about the act of scuffling, or the pistol going off? - A. Upon my oath I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say whether the pistol went off in a bustle? - A. Bustling and scuffling, I think, in my small capacity, refers to the same thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state the word act, at the time you were examined? - A. I asked him this simple question, whether he was in any act-yes, I did use the word act.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you read your examination before you signed it? - A. It was read to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that there was any thing read to you about the act of scuffling, or bustling? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say a word in that examination, about when the pistol went off? - A. When the accident happened, and whether the words were actually so or not, it was to the same purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you state to those gentlemen, that you stated one word to the Magistrates about pistols going off, either in the act of scuffling, or in the act of bustling? - A. The word pistol was not mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if I understand you, the question to Mr. Yates was this; whether there had been any previous quarrelling, or whether there was any act of bustling or scuffling at the time, but not when the pistol went off? - A. It was, whether at the time of the accident there was any act of scuffling or bustling; I must have meant to refer to the pistol, because there was no other accident which had happened; (produces the paper which he wrote at the time).</p>
               <p>Q. This is not a minute of the conversation, but only the result of it? - A. It is the result of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You were never acquainted with any of these parties? - A. No, and I wish I had not seen them now; (the case of pistols produced)</p>
               <p>Mr. GRAHAM called in again.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Raine. Q. After this catastrophe, you went to the house? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the pistols? - A. I found one of them in the back parlour upon the side board, in a case, it was in consequence of some bullets that lay about, that induced me to look for any other fire-arms, and as soon as I cast my eye upon that box, I concluded it was a case of pistols, which it was, and a powder-horn, with some powder in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You visited the deceased upon his death-bed? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. State to us any declarations he made, touching this transaction, while he was in that situation? - A. Upon my going into the room, I found him under the surgeon's hands in the act of dressing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140029"></xptr>him; when he saw me, he appeared much rejoiced, and held out his hand; Mr. Thomas was there, an assistant to Mr. Cruikshanks, I asked him, if the wound was mortal, he said, there were certainly at that time, some favourable symptoms; I asked him if it would be proper to speak to him upon the subject; he said, it would be improper; I sat down by him, and took him by the hand, and he mentioned the name of some of the persons, and I stopped him; I told him that his situation required him to dispose his thoughts in a very different manner; I wished him to say, that from his foul he forgave them; but I thought, in his situation, it was not proper, fearing he might not be, at that moment, so disposed; I asked him, in as simple a way as possible, if he had made a will; he desired me to make one for him; I went up stairs, and wrote a will; I read it over to him; Mr. Thomas read it, and signed it; Mr. Thomas witnessed it, and I believe that was all that passed.(The learned Judge recommended it to the Counsel for the prosecution, to call all the persons who were upon the back of the bill, in order to give the Counsel for the prisoners an opportunity of cross-examining them, which was agreed to.)</p>

               <p>SELLERS's defence.</p>
               <p>My Lords and Gentlemen of the Jury, however distressed my mind must have been, and ever will be, upon this unfortunate occasion, yet I owe it a duty to myself, to God, to Mr. Yates, and to my unfortunate friends, to relate truly the circumstances that occurred during my stay at this house. On the 14th of August, going up Hatton-Garden, I was over taken by Mr. Beard and Mr. Biggs, who told me, that they wanted me to take possession of a lady's house, to protect her from the insults of a gentleman, who had illegally got possession of her premisses; I objected, and said, I was engaged in a business of consequence, in Oxford-street; that was over-ruled, and I consented to meet them at a tavern, near Buckingham-gate; they told me I was also to send for Mrs. Sellers, that Miss Jones was a lady of respectability, and her character was not to be blasted by a man remaining in her house alone; when I got to Oxford-street, I called to a boy to go with me, and at six o'clock, Mr. Beard and Mr. Biggs came to me at this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140030"></xptr>public-house; they told me I must then go with them, and I took the boy with me; the boy remained in the passage; I was soon after introduced to Miss Jones in the drawing-room; she said, she had been very ill used by Mr. Yates, that he had taken a poker, and threatened to knock her down several times; she gave me the key, and an inventory of the goods; Mr. Biggs then said,"you are now in complete possession of this house, I hope you will not suffer Miss Jones to be ill treated, in any way, by Mr. Yates, or suffer him to make use of bad language to her;" I told him, I would certainly do all in my power to protect Miss Jones from any violence or insult that might be put upon her; Mr. Biggs, Mr. Beard, and Miss Jones drank tea together; and soon after tea, Mr. Biggs went down stairs; I went with him to the door, and I told him I did not exactly understand what he was upon; I asked, "if the will of Mr. Yates was made in favour of Miss Jones;" he said, it is a good will, as good as if I had made it myself, and I think you will not do your duty if you don't get him out, by shutting the doors when you get an opportunity of Mr. and Mrs. Yates both being out; this was on the Wednesday evening; when Mrs. Sellers came back with the boy that I sent to fetch her, Mr. Beard stopped that evening till Mrs. Sellers came, and that evening Mrs. Sellers slept with Miss Jones, and I slept in the drawing-room upon a sofa, son Mr. Yates had got possession of most of the beds in the house; I was given to understand, that Mr. Yates was a very violent man; but not being willing to breed a disturbance, I thought proper to tell him in the morning, my authority, and for what reason I came there; I heard him enquiring for the brush, I took one to him; I told him, I had found it in Miss Jones's room; he thanked me for it, and no further conversation ensued; some time after, Miss Jones informed me, that Mr. Yates had taken a bed out of her room, and put into his own room; very soon after, I heard Mr. Yates come up in a violent rage, and a boy after him; I desired him to let me speak to him before he used any violence; he said, "who are you, you have no business here?" says I, "I am here by the authority of Miss Jones, I dare say, I can satisfy you as to that, and every thing that is in my power to make things agreeable shall be done;" he replied to me, with foul language, and ordered the boy to break open the lock; I begged he would not; Miss Jones, at that time, put the key into her bed-chamber; he forced in, and began to be very violent; he shoved her down upon the bed; I begged her not to be alarmed, not to use any force to prevent the bed being taken away, only to leave it to me; he called her a number of names, whore, drunkard, strumpet, and that he would be revenged of her; I told him, it was unmanly to insult a woman in that way, and I would not suffer it any longer; I told him I would do any thing, if he would be but peaceable, and I dare say, Miss Jones would be the same; but he kept abusing her for near a quarter of an hour; but with what I said to him, he said, as I see you wish to be peaceable, I will drink with you, or do any thing else; I told him, I would drink with him, and should be very happy to remain in the house with him as friends; he then said, if that is the case, I have no animosity against you; we went down stairs, and I told him he must not put upon the ladies, nor take any thing they said as an affront; I was sure she did not mean to affront him. When I ressected upon the situation I was in, and his violence, I thought I was not safe, nor Miss Jones, unless I had the means of defending myself. Mr. Beard came that evening, and I told him I could not positively stay in the house unless he would send something to defend ourselves with; he promised he would, and the next day he brought arms to me, but previous to the arms being brought I thought it best to see Mr. Yates in the morning; I saw him walking in the garden; I went and told him I was extremely sorry he should be guilty of the ill conduct the night before. I offered him my hand, and begged of him not to make any more disturbance; he promised he would not; he said, he wanted a great number of things to make Mrs. Yates comfortable in the house, who was at that time ill; says he, "as for myself, I would remain in the garret, or any where, rather than make a disturbance with you." During this conversation he said he wanted sheets, blankets, and many other things; I told him, if he would only name them upon paper, and not take things slily as he had done, I would send to my own house for every thing he wanted; he replied he was very much obliged to me, and we were very friendly, and he said he would remain so as long as I staid in that house. On the Saturday I heard a grumbling up stairs, but he did not come down; on the Sunday he was swearing he would be damned if he would not have something; I enquired of the maid, and found it was a tea-board that Miss Jones had at breakfast; he took no further notice till twelve o'clock on Sunday, while I was playing with my little boy and talking to him in the garden, without the smallest animosity between us, as I could not possibly have any against him. We then heard that he was to have a large party the following day; Miss Jones said, for God's sake, if that is the case we must not be turned out of the house, and begged the door to be kept close, and that any person might go out but I thought it proper that nobody should come in. I told Mr. Footner, who had called accidentally, that if he would call the next day, not as it was stated that he was there all day on Sunday, for he dined in Oxford-street on the Sunday, and came late in the afternoon. Miss Jones said to Mr. Footner, be so good as stay here till Mr. Biggs and Mr. Beard come in the morning; and I was very anxious he should remain there till that time; he consented; he went home to Oxford-street; he went early enough to go through the Park; he did go through the Park, and got the keys of the two shops in Oxford-street. On the Monday morning Mr. Yates came to me in a great passion, for keeping the door locked; I told him he might go out if he pleased; he said he would bring an action against me; says he, "I want the girl to go out;" says Miss Jones "pray let the girl go out;" I had placed the key in the cupboard in the parlour; it was a heavy key, that I did not chuse to carry about in my pocket, and she went and fetched it, and I let the girl out; Miss Jones begged I would not let any strangers in, if the girl came to let her in; upon opening the door when the girl came back, I saw a man with her, whom I took to be a smith; I told her she must not come in unless she came alone; Mr. Yates came to me and knocked me down, and in the scuffle I threw the key along the passage towards Miss<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140031"></xptr>Jones; and he quitted me to go to Miss Jones, and sell upon her; he told me I was a rascal, a villain, and he would knock my liver out; I told him it was not a question of mine, it was a question of law entirely; for God's sake don't sight with me, but let the lawyers sight it out; he went into the room and called Miss Jones a whore, a strumpet, a prostitute, and that we were as bad, to come into that house to defend a common prostitute: I told him I would not offend him in any way in the world; Green came in, I told him on behalf of Miss Jones not to take the lock off her door: Mr. Yates said,"take it off;" I did not attempt to make use of any violence, I thought my duty led me to take notice of the transactions only that occurred in the house, and not use any violence; the lock was taken off, and he went away; I was very much alarmed, and sent Mrs. Sellers to Mr. Biggs and Mr. Beard, and begged they would come to me, for I would not upon any account stay and bear this usage; I told her to tell the coachman to drive fast; I asked the smith his name, and if he had altered the lock at all in any way."I have not (says he) altered one single ward;" says I, only recollect what has passed, because the circumstance requires investigation. Mr. Yates at that time was sitting upon the table; we were very friendly; then says he."I never saw a house so well fastened in my life;" I said it was very well fastened; Mr. Yates went to the back door, he never did go into the garden; he sat down at the back door, and it was observed to me that that was a good opportunity in following the instructions of Mr. Beard and Mr. Biggs, to shut Mr. Yates out, and Mrs. Yates had never been out till the afternoon; I thought it right to keep him till the attornies came, which I expected could not be long, and I thought that was right, I shut the door myself: Mr. Footner was in the passage, he was not at the door at all; the further door had been previously fastened. I went into the parlour, thinking to fasten the back parlour; I heard a noise below, and fearful of the consequences that might happen to myself, I threw down the case of pistols upon the slab, took one out, and upon the impulse of the moment ran-instantly down stairs without any consulation, and with no other intention in the world but to intimidate Mr. Yates; I had no idea of his forcing his way; I put my hand towards him, "Pray don't come in, you must not come in;" not my right hand, but my left, as the pistol was in my right; he drew it immediately down, and with his doing that the pistol went off, and I did not conceive from the position of the pistol being slanting, that he was wounded; I said he was not hart, because I did not believe he could be hurt till I saw him lying in the garden. I threw the pistol down, and went to the door, and cried for God's sake send for an officer, and let me be taken before a Magistrate.</p>

               <p>I immediately surrendered myself to Jagger; I was drawn into the garden, taken to Mr. Yates, but the moment I saw him I thought it my duty as a man of honour, to ask his forgiveness for the accident that happened; I went on my knee and said, "Mr. Yates, forgive me for the accident;" he said, "You are the person that shot me:" I begged to be removed, and a very genteel man said, it was very improper for him to remain here, take him on one side. A gentleman came up, I believe, Mr. Brown the surgeon; a pure principle of humanity, and knowing that it was necessary he should know what the pistol was loaded with, I told him one ball, because, I thought it better than for him to die mangled for want of a knowledge of what it was loaded with. I begged of the constable to take every thing out of my pocket, there were some things that did relate to this transaction, and others that did not; many people came asking me questions, I said, to Mr. Footner, this is not a place for the investigation of this charge, I said, let us go before the Magistrate, that we may be examined properly; and no man could suppose I should shoot a man I was in the habits of intimate friendship with. Upon the first examination before the Magistrates, the accounts were mutilated, which occasioned the public voice of the people to be much against me; upon the second examination, there was nothing said; and, upon the third, I believe, there was a little change in my favour. I do solemnly declare, upon my oath, and honour, I never had any intention to injure Mr. Yates in any manner whatever.</p>

               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury. I hope you will make some allowance for the agitation and distress of my mind, when nothing but a consciousness of my entire innocence could enable me at all to address you. I was introduced to the late Mr.

             told me, he had great reason to be displeased with the conduct of his nephew, and that of his sister; that he had meant to leave his fortune to the Theatrical Fund. Sometime after, Mr. Yates invited me to come into his family, that if I would consent to do that, he would consider me as his daughter, and after his intention of leaving it to the Fund. I consulted my friends upon Mr. Yates's offer; I went to his house soon after, I went to Birmingham at the beginning of the season, I went to the house of Mr. Thomas Yates.

             gave him some fresh cause of offence, and forbid him to enter his house; and from that time to the time of his death, he never did enter the house but once, and then he refused to see him. On the death of Mr. Yates, the 20th of last April, I wrote to an intimate friend of Mr. Yates, to ask his advice; he wrote to me he could not come to me himself, and sent me Mr. Ward, an attorney; Mr. Thomas Yates was at Bath; I sent to him that he might be at the inspection of his uncle's papers: Mr. Ward attended, and the papers were opened in his presence by Mr. Ward, Mr. Hollier, and Mr. Yates, a stationer; they were then sealed up by Mr. Ward, and superscribed by all the parties present. Mr. Ward, after he had sealed them up, gave them to me, and returned all the keys, and gave them to me. They all staid and dined with me; and, in the evening, Mr. Thomas Yates asked me if I would oblige him with a bed in the house, as he had no lodging in town; I excused myself for that night, and told him he should have one the next night; but before that night, it was settled I should have the ordering of the funeral; and Mr. Ward said, "he hoped we should not come into a Court, but hoped it would be settled by the interposition of friends." Mr. Ward promised he would see me the next day, and gave me all the advice in his power; he advised me to do nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140032"></xptr>in it till after the funeral. I heard soon after that Mr. Yates was very busy, and had employed a proctor; upon which I sent copies of the testamentary papers to him, and sent for Mr. Ward. Doctor Pitcairn saw me the same day I wrote to him; Mr. Ward took no notice of my application; Doctor Pitcairn said, "he thought the papers amounted to a will in my favour." The next day I received a letter from Doctor Pitcairn, that he had seen Mr. Beard, a Proctor. who was of opinion they amounted to a will in my favour, and wished to see the originals; I went to him with the papers; he told me he believed it was a very good will, and Dr. Lawrence told me the same, that they were; I was certain I was safe as to the possession of the property. The very day after, Mr. Graham, a friend of Mr. Yates, called upon me, and desired to know if I was inclined to accommodate the business; I told him, I could give no answer without consulting my friends, that I had given the original papers to a Proctor; he told me he did not come there to entrap me, that he was not a professional man, that he was a friend to Mr. Yates; but if he thought Mr. Yates was to act in any way dishonourable, he would discard him; that Mr. Yates had taken no step but by his advice; he asked who was my Proctor, I told him Mr. Beard; he said that was a very respectable name. Mr. Yates came to live with me the 28th of June, he lived entirely at my expence; on the 28th of June he went to Bristol; on the 2d of August he came back again without any notice, he apologized for not having written, by saying, he was not certain he should have come till the instant he did; I received him again in the same manner on the 30th of August; he asked me again if I was willing to compromise it; I said I could not say any thing, but by consulting my friends. On Sunday the 14th I saw Dr. Pitcairn, and I told him the conversation I had had with Mr. Yates, and he told me that he thought to save me any further trouble, I had better compromise it; I asked him how much he though it would be prudent for me to give up; I told him I believed there might be 9,000l. in the whole; he said I might give up 1,000l. if I thought proper; I told him I would voluntarily give as much to Mr. Yates and his sister-I never had an opportunity of conversing with Mr. Yates upon this. On the Sunday night he came home very late, and the same on Monday and Tuesday; on Tuesday about half past six in the evening I went down stairs into the kitchen, and saw the maid employed in making gruel, and things of that kind; I asked who was just come into the house, and I was told Mr. Yates; I desired her to ask him if he would have any tea, I was just going to have some; I sat till near seven, and he did not come; I called the maid and asked her what part of the house he was in, she said in the front parlour; I suspected he had some design of bringing somebody else into the house about eight o'clock. I saw a coach come to the door; Mr. Yates immediately rushed to the door, and helped two women out of the coach, and the coachman brought some trunks into house; I did not go down stairs as I did not chuse to have any words with him; the maid came up and told me Mrs. Yates was come, and desired I would let her have sheets for the white bed; I said, "I know nothing of Mrs. Yates;" that was all I said: He came up in a very threatening manner, and asked me why I did not let her have sheets; I said, I should not let her have any; he took up the poker and said, I had no right in the house, and it was his charity that made him let me stay there so long; he made use of very indecent abusive language; I told him I would neither let him have the linen nor the keys; he clinched his fist, and asked me once more if I would give him the keys; I told him I would not; he went away threatening to be revenged. I had said to Mr. Yates I expected some friends should come to me; he sneered, and said, he would take care no friends of mine should come there. There was a knock at the door, a young man asked for me, and I begged him to come up-it was a young man sent from the linen-draper that had a dress of mine, which he wanted to take back for alteration, I told him I could not do it. I forgot to observe that Mr. Yates went up stairs after I had locked myself into the drawing-room; he went up the second floor, and broke the door to pieces. I desired the young man to go to Mr. Hollier's to sent somebody to me: as soon as he was gone, I heard somebody knock at the door; I looked out at the window, and found it was Mr. Beard-I related to him what was the matter, he said he would speak to Mr. Yates, and he went down and spoke to Mr. Yates; Mr. Yates was in a violent passion; I said if they were once outside the door again, they should never come there again. Mrs. Yates said, they did not intend ever to go outside the door again, that the house was their's, and a great deal of abusive language both from Mr. and Mrs. Yates. While Mr. Beard was with me a person came to me from Mr. Hollier, in consequence of the message I had sent; he said, he had left the maid servant only in care of the shop, but as soon as his master came home, he should either come himself or send his master to me. Mr. Yates threatened that the next day I should be turned out of the house. The next day, I did not leave my own room till very late, I rung the bell, and

             took it into another room; Mr. Yates made use of very abusive language, he would break open every lock in the house, and turn me out; he desired the smith to go and fasten up the next room; he came down stairs the next morning about eight o'clock. Mr. Beard came and drank tea with us, and I was extremely ill with the agitation of my mind during the scene of the bed, I was not able to attend to what passed; but Mr. Sellers requested Mr. Beard for some means of defence. The next day between two and three, I went into the drawing-room, and saw Mr. Beard and Mr. Sellers with a paper parcel; I asked what it was, and they opened it; they opened a case, and I said "good God, what are those, pistols! and Mr. Beard said, "yes;" Mr. Sellers thinks it necessary he should have pistols; I immediately said, rather than any thing of that sort should be necessary I would leave the house; Mr. Sellers said you must not by any means leave the house; Mr. Beard and Mr. Higgs desire them to keep those things out of sight, that they only brought them in case of the greatest necessity; Mr. Sellers asked if the pistols were loaded, and he said, no; they were put under the table, and remained there till saturday morning; when Mr. Sellers brought them down and put them upon a shaving stand, Mrs. Sellers laid hold of them, and I begged she would not touch them, and they were put away again; from that time I never saw them, nor knew where they were; after Saturday morning I never saw them after; Mr. Sellers took the case of pistols up I never saw them; there was nothing very material passed on Saturday or Sunday; I saw Mr. Yates and Mr. Sellers conversing together very familiarly from the garden to the back parlour window; I heard them talking together in a very friendly manner; nothing very materially passed on Saturday or Sunday. On Monday morning I heard Mr. Yates threatening with violent oaths, he wanted something. I could not understand what; as soon as I had left the room in coming down stairs, I asked Mr. Sellers if Mr. Yates had been asking for any thing; he said he did not know what it could be, unless it was a tea-board; we heard no more of it. I forgot on Sunday night Mrs. Sellers informed me that

Mr. Sellers and I observed, that in order to prevent Mr. Yates introducing these people to turn us out by violence, that it would be the best way to keep the street-door locked till our friends came about one o'clock; Mr. and Mrs. Yates came down stairs, and soon after

Mr. Yates came in and seized Mr. Sellers with great violence, and struck him, and springing from Mr. Sellers, caught hold of me; Mr. Sellers, standing by the wall, stepped between, and gave me time to get into the back parlour, where I again locked up the key. In the mean time, the smith came in at the parlour window; Mr. Yates ordered him to take the lock off; Mr. Sellers said, "at your peril, take it off;" Mr. Yates insisted upon his taking it off, he did take it off, and then I heard Mr. Sellers say to the smith, "be so good as tell me your name;" I looked out at the back parlour door, and said," I know Mr. Green very well, you need not ask his name;" as the lock was off, Mrs. Yates went out in a coach, and I heard Mr. Yates say, "bring them with you as soon as possible;" we supposed it was the people that we understood were to come and turn us out; Mr. sellers sent a note by Mrs. Sellers, to Mr. Beard, to come either himself or Mr. Biggs; soon after, I believe, Mr. Yates dined in the front parlour; we were in that state of mind, that we did not think any thing about dinner; after dinner, Mr. Yates went to the back garden, and I saw him from my window; when I returned into the back parlour, where Mr. Sellers, and Mr. Footner were, they said to me, we are thinking, if Mr. Yates's friends come in first, what we shall do; I wish Mr. Yates would go near the door, I said, I would venture to shut the door upon him; I said, he is now near the garden door, will it be the same thing if you shut him out, there; he said, "that was a very good thought, we can keep him there till somebody comes to our assistance;" about five o'clock I went down stairs into the back kitchen to get some water for a little dog I had;

I remember some person, I cannot tell who, saying, Madam, are you a party concerned? I said, unfortunately I am too much concerned; I meant I was not an indifferent spectator of what had happened, not that I was concerned in the death of Mr. Yates; I meant to say, I belonged to the house, for there was such a number of people in the house, they did not know whether I was a stranger or belonged to the house. I believe I have nothing more to say, my Lord, that is material. I am perfectly innocent of this shocking transaction, and I believe there is no person more concerned at it than myself; I would have willingly given up every part of the disputed property to have preserved Mr. Yates's life; I was totally ignorant of it, and no ways consenting to it.</p>

             that Mr. Yates was going to have a quantity of men in the house in the morning; Fanny Batton related it to Mrs. Sellers, and I believe Mrs. Sellers to Miss Jones; Miss Jones, Mr. and Mrs. Sellers, seemed very much alarmed on account of it; Miss Jones, Mr. and Mrs. Sellers, asked me if I would stop there one night; I told them if I could be the least service in the world to them I would, but I must first go home and deliver some keys I had about me, that they would be wanted that night; I went home, delivered the keys, informing them I should not sleep at home that night, but should return as early as possible in the morning I delivered the keys and returned back to her house to supper; after supper, I retired upon the sofa the whole of the night; in the morning, Miss Jones, Mr. and Mrs. Sellers, seemed still much alarmed at these men coming into the house; Miss Jones had spoken to Mr. Sellers, I understood, about having the front door fastened, and thought it very necessary; the front door was locked; about one o'clock Mr. Yates came down stairs, and found the door fast, he was in a very great passion, and sent for a smith; Miss Jones gave the key to Mr. Sellers to let the girl out; in a short time, she returned with a smith, and knocked at the door; Mr. Sellers opening, and saw it was a stranger, and he immediately closed the door against him; Mr. Yates, I believe, came out of the front parlour, and seeing Mr. Sellers close the door, immediately fell upon him, and endeavouring to wrest the key from him, threw him down; Mr. Sellers, by some means, threw the key under him, and Miss Jones picked it up; the moment Mr. Yates saw the key thrown away, he let go Mr. Sellers, and endeavoured to get hold of Miss Jones; I immediately seeing his rage, stepped in between them, and was the occasion of his not doing her an injury; after that, I understood that Miss Jones had intimated to Mr. Sellers, that if Mr. Yates went out, he would shut the door against him; Mrs. Yates being out of the house at the time, Mr. Yates was gone down the garden; I was then in the passage, not far from Mr. Yates; after the door was shut, I went towards the front door, and I returned a few minutes afterwards; walking in the back parlour, I heard the report of a pistol, but whence it came I could not tell; I returned towards the front door, and saw Miss Jones, she said to me, for God's sake, what is the matter; I told her, I did not know what was the matter, but I believed some unfortunate circumstance had occurred; I told her afterwards, I thought Mr. Yates was shot; she replied, if it was so, she should never be happy as long as she lived. As I was walking up and down the passage, I remember a gentleman coming and informing me a gentleman wanted to speak to me in the garden; I told him I would go immediately with him, and I found it was Mr. Yates, they wanted to bring me before him, thinking I might be concerned in this unfortunate accident; the person asked if that was the person that was in the house at the time, Mr. Yates replied, "yes, it was; how came you here," says he, in a very great passion, I thought he spoke it in, says I, (I did not know what I said at the time, I was so much distressed), I said, I was sent here, and I am sorry I ever came.</p>

I did; I desired Miss Jones to go up stairs, she did; she sat down, and I thought she would have sainted away. I desired her to compose herself, and tell me what had happened; she told me, Mr. Yates had brought his family into the house; he came up stairs with great violence, and demanded the white bed; on her refusal, he threatened her with a poker, and held up his fist.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me intreat of you not to say any thing of what Miss Jones said to you; but in consequence of the impression made on your mind, what did you do? - A. I told her I would go down stairs and speak to Mr. Yates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recommend Mr. Sellers? - A. I spoke to Mr. Yates personally upon it first; I said, Mr. Yates, what is the meaning of all this violence? Mr. Yates, in great wrath, came out to me in the passage, and used personal abuse, both to me and Miss Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, did you think it necessary to put any body in the house? - A. I certainly thought it my duty. I told Miss Jones, it was necessary that some body should be put in to protect her, and her property, from violence, that the next morning I would apply to an attorney for the purpose. I made an application to Mr. Graham, for the purpose of apprizing him of the proceeding; I was told he was out of town; I called on Mr. Biggs, a friend of mine, he went with me to Miss Jones, and she told him the circumstance; I went with Mr. Biggs to Oxford-road, to call on Mr. Sellers, where he was, he was not in the way; on our return, Mr. Biggs saw him, he got out of the coach, and stopped him, and desired him to come, and bring his family; Mr. Sellers went in the evening and met Mr. Biggs and myself, that was on the Wednesday; previous to that, I had sent a message to request to speak to Mr. Yates; he sent answer, he would not speak to me till he had his Counsel. We had an interview with Mr. Yates, a great deal passed as to the proceedings of Mr. Yates; I mentioned I had been his friend, and saved him 500l. he replied very violently to me, and likewise to Mr. Biggs; I asked him why he had not apprized Miss Jones of his intention to bring his family? he said, "Yes, if he had, she would have taken care to prevent it."</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole, did his behaviour appear placid, or violent? - A. Very violent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave Mr. Sellers in possession on the Wednesday night? - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Miss Jones appear to be quieted from her alarm by the arrival of this gentleman? - A. Certainly she did, and I left Mr. Sellers in the house, and told him Miss Jones was a defenceless, unprotected woman, and I hoped he would not suffer her to be insulted; the key was presented to Mr. Sellers in the evening, to intimate he was in possession of the house; the key was delivered to Mr. Sellers; it was thought necessary to have an inventory; on the Thursday evening. I went, and was informed, that Mr. Yates had proceeded with great violence in the course of that day; I observed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140036"></xptr> that both Mr. Sellers and Miss Jones, appeared very much agitated and terrified at their situations, particularly as Mr. Yates had threatened to bring in four or five people, and, by force, turn them out; Mr. Sellers then applied to me, and said, he could keep his possession, or do his duty, unless he had not some means to defend himself; that he was threatening to break open every lock in the house; on the Wednesday, when we parted, Mr. Yates agreed to refer every thing to me and Mr. Bush, his proctor; on the Monday, I was much pleased with the apparent prospect of settling the business, and he shook hands and seemed very much pleased with it, and Miss Jones was very much satisfied with it.</p>

               <p>Q. Now go to the Thursday again, when Mr. Sellers expressed his uneasiness? - A. He said, he was not able to keep his possessions, and requested I would furnish him with weapons to defend himself; on Friday morning, I sent the unfortunate weapons, for which I can only say I am very sorry,(they are shewn to him); this was my case of pistols which I carried with me, and likewise a small hanger.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were they loaded? - A. They were not loaded.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Who was there when you went to Miss Jones with the pistols? - A. Mr. Fuller, my clerk, went with me, when I gave them to Mr. Sellers.</p>
               <p>Q. They were not loaded? - A. No; but the materials were all together as in every other case of pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you deliver the pistol and hanger? - A. They were put upon the table as for Mr. Sellers; I told him they were brought in consequence of their dread of their lives, for their personal protection.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Miss Jones in the room at the time you delivered them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Miss Jones know what they were? - A. Only from my mentioning what they were; my observation was, that I had brought them in consequence of his request for their personal protection, and if they insisted to break open the door, he should tell them he was prepared with fire-arms, and that he would fire through the door.</p>
               <p>Q. As Miss Jones came to know, from your conversation, that they were pistols, what was her behaviour? - A. Very much alarmed, and with an exclamation, cried, "Good God, why should you bring them, I had rather go out of the house and give up the property;" I answered, you must not quit your possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mrs. Sellers arriving at your house and seeing you any time on the Monday, to apprize you of what was going on? - A. Clearly; it has been mentioned by one of the witnesses, that I was there on the Sunday; I was not there on the Sunday; on the Saturday; evening I called there, and went to Dr. Pitcairn to speak to him upon the business, and that was the last time I was at the house.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time on Monday did Mrs. Sellers come to require you attendance on the spot? - A. I believe as near a quarter after three as could be; as soon as a coach could get from Pimlico to the office; in consequence of what had passed with Mr. Yates and myself, I had applied to Mr. Bush, to know if he had heard from Mr. Yates upon the subject, for I conceived on the Monday that we should have entered into an accommodation; Mr. Yates promised me he would apply to Mr. Bush for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. When Mrs. Sellers came to you at this time, apprizing you that your presence was immediately wanted, what did you do? - A. This paper was brought to me from Mr. Sellers, in consequence of an information Mr. Sellers gave me that force was expected to be brought into the house, requested that Mr. Biggs and myself would come up immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it possible if you had set out immediately from your house to have gone to Mr. Yates's house at Pimlico, how long would it have taken you? - A. I could not go in less than three quarters of an hour; I then went to Mr. Bush with the paper, and shewed it him; I requested Mr. Bush to write to Mr. Yates upon the subject.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of Mrs. Sellers being dispatched to you, and you had got the message, what did you do in order immediately to follow up the request of that note? - A. I went immediately to Mr. Graham's office in Hatton-garden; he was gone to his own house to dinner; I went immediately to Mr. Graham, and requested him to go with me immediately; Mr. Graham said he could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go? - A. No; I did not go myself, but sent the message by Mrs. Sellers.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear first of the unfortunate accident? - A. Half past six as near as could be at my own house; one of my clerk's came and apprized me of it, and I went immediately to the office, where I found a person waiting from Pimlico; I went immediately to Mr. Graham, and acquainted him with the unfortunate circumstance; and Mr. Graham went in the coach for the purpose of going to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You told Mr. Graham you were the unfortunate person who furnished these weapons? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140037"></xptr>Q. From what you know did you believe it necessary? - A. I did; and I should have thought I had not done my duty if I had not sent them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. You have told us you advised him in the line of your business as a proctor? - A. As an act of duty and prudence as I thought for the protection of persons lives; I don't call it advice proctorially, but I think any man of prudence would advise it.</p>
               <p>Court. You acted very ignorantly, because you should have advised them to go to Bow-street, and you would have prevented the man's life having been taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did not you know that Mrs. Yates was the only part of Mr. Yates's family? - A. No; only from having seen Mr. Yates.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Mrs. Yates was there? - A. Yes;</p>
               <p>Q. When you furnished these arms, did you inform Mr. Yates that there were such things? - A. I did not certainly; for I did not see him after that; I did not see him after we had shook hands and parted friends.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not apprized then that any such things were in the house? - A. Not by me of course.</p>
               <p>Q. In your conversation with Mr. Yates, you said you might have put him to 500l. expence; did not you very the language a little, and say you would do so? - A. No; I said I had been more his friend than he was aware of, for I could have put him to 500l. expence on account of his denying his consanguinity.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor he never complained of your making yourself a party in the business? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Monday was the day appointed for the lawyers to meet? - A. Yes; Monday was the day appointed for Mr. Biggs and myself to go.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the day of this unfortunate affair? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us you did not go? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give us any motive why you did not go? - A. Because Mr. Biggs was not in town, and I had totally given up the business into Mr. Biggs's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you informed any person that that was the case, either Mr. Yates or Miss Jones, or any body else, that you did not mean to come? - A. No; I was very much engaged in the morning, and did not send.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am an attorney, in Hatton-Garden; I was applied to by Mr. Beard, and on Wednesday preceding this unhappy business. Mr. Beard called upon me in the morning, and I went to Pimlico; I objected at first, however I did go, at two o'clock; he asked me first, if I could recommend any body, being conversant with persons who went into possession under bankruptcy; but, in going down, I rather recommended Mr. Beard to get a meeting of the friends of Mr. Yates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, however, recommend and procure Mr. Sellers? - A. Yes; about three o'clock I saw Miss Jones, and she related to me the situation she was in, and the treatment she had received; I wished to see Mr. Yates, I asked if he was in the house, they said he was; I said, Mr. Beard, I think we had better send down to Mr. Yates to speak to him; a message was sent down, and his answer was, "that he had not his Counsellor with him, and could not see us without;" Mr. Graham was his Counsellor. I enquired what servants there were in the house, and I found she had only one servant, who was going away; and I said, I thought she had better have some creditable person and his wife, and I recollected Mr. Sellers, who I knew had been in possession for some creditor in Oxford-road for some time, and he was a married man; I mentioned a young child, and thought that would be an objection to his wife coming; she said she should like it better, her mind was so agitated, it would be some relief to her; Mr. Beard wanted to go before a Magistrate, but from the representation of Mr. Beard and Miss Jones, I doubted whether it was not a permissive possession, and thought the Magistrates would not interfere, and that, perhaps, Mr. Yates would come back with greater violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Sellers was employed? - A. Yes; I went to his house in Oxford-road, he was not at home, and we met him accidentally as we went along in the coach; Mr. Sellers objected to go, as he was not discharged from Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You recommended Mr. Sellers; have you known him any time? - A. Yes, seventeen or eighteen years; he has been unfortunate from exportations to America. As to his disposition, he is a remarkably mild man, I have seen his disposition tried much in disputed partnerships; he was always remarkably mild.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Sellers, however, did agree to go? - A. Yes; and we were to meet that evening at Buckingham-gate; we returned to Miss Jones's, and I desired him to follow us, which he did, and he was introduced to Miss Jones, and I desired an inventory to be taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity then of seeing Mr. Yates personally? - A. Yes; we sent down to know if his friends were come; and shortly after, we saw Mr. Yates and Mr. Withey, Mr. Graham did not come; at first Mr. Yates was extremely vide it indeed, I think I never saw a man more so, for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did that continue? - A. For some time; and I endeavoured all I could to appease him, and so did Mr. Withey; I expostulated with him very much, I told him I understood very unpleasant things happened in the house; but, says I, I am<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140038"></xptr>come here to see if I cannot do something to arrange this matter between you; I mentioned some papers being lost, I told him it would hurt him much in his cause, as he was in respectable hands; his reply was, "I will destroy what I please in this house;" he put his hand upon the table, and said, "Major domo I am, and major domo I will be;" Mr. Beard said, he had been a friend to him; and he said "Damn your friendship, I want none of it." Mr. Sellers talked of bringing his wife; and I said, it was the last place in the world that I should bring a wife to; I said, suppose Miss Jones gave security to the two Proctors to give up the property; Mr. Withey said, "I think that is an offer that you ought to accept;" he said "he would see his Proctor, and if he advised it, he would consider of it."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then say any thing to Mr. Sellers about what he might do? - A. I told Mr. Sellers, if there was any further riot, the first time he got Mr. and Mrs. Yates out, I would lock them out, and then they would go before a Magistrate, and the possession would be determined; I told them that that was what I would do myself.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know when you were upon the premises again? - A. Not till since the accident happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Yates he was a trespasser? - A. Mr. Withey asked him if he had Miss Jones's permission to stop in the house? I told him, no; Miss JOnes could have given no such permission, he must consider himself as a trespasser; "but, Sir, (says I) you have seen enough of Miss Jones's disposition to shew you that you have nothing whatever to fear from her;" and he said, in reply, "You don't know that black woman's heart."</p>

               <p>Q. Were they carried in the way that Miss Jones could know first of all what they were? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When Miss Jones knew they were pistols, did she approve of the transaction, or disapprove of it? - A. She expressed herself desirous to know what was in the case at the time that Mr. Beard put it down upon the table, and upon being told that it was pistols, she said, "Good God, what are they for? I would rather go out of the house than any thing of that kind should be;" to which I believe I replied, "Madam, you must not leave the house, don't be alarmed, nothing is meant by it but your own protection as I understand;" Mr. Sellers then put them under the chair, and he says, there is no fear of it being necessary to use them, I think, because Mr. Yates and myself have been upon friendly terms this morning, and I hope we shall continue so.</p>

               <p>Court. He must stand in the eye of the Jury, as a man of a very humane, mild, and benevolent character, and I presume therefore, if you were to call two hundred more, they would not be more convinced of it.</p>
               <p>Summing up.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this is an indictment against the three prisoners,

             were, at the time of committing the murder, at the time of the killing, either actually, or by any rule of law, constructively present when he was so killed? In order to clear this case of any doubt in point of law, I shall first state to you what I take the law of the case to be, and then you will be better enabled to apply the facts to that law; I take it to be clear, that whoever had the title to this house, Mr. Yates, at this time, having been in the real joint possession, or permissive possession by himself, and his servant being there, to say nothing of the wife, if he took a walk in the garden, and they thought proper to bolt him out, if he attempted, by any force, of breaking the windows to get in again, he was justifiable in so doing, and if any person has want only shot him in that attempt, he is guilty of murder-that law I have not a doubt about; that Mr. Yates himself seems to have a right to come in-he had never quitted the whole premisses-was gone out to walk in the garden, and had (from being in what some of the witnesses call, a joint possession, and others speak of, as a permissive possession) a right to come into the house again when his servant assisted him; and if Sellers wilfully shot at him, he is guilty of murder. That is the principal point, and if you should think that Sellers has done an act, which either amounts to murder or manslaughter, then you will have to consider whether Jones or Footner were abetting Sellers at the time he committed the fact; now this I should hold to be abetting, that if they saw Mr. Yates coming into the house, and told Sellers to go down with a loaded pistol and shoot him, and don't let him come in, they being in the house, and telling him to do that, they would, in my opinion, be guilty as abettors, and would have a sufficient constructive presence to warrant their being found guilty upon the allegations of this indictment; this I state only as general law; it will be necessary for you now to attend to the facts, as the witnesses have proved them, and then it will be for you to see whether this pistol was fired wilfully or accidentally; if wilfully, it is murder, if accidentally it is manslaughter; and then you will have to pronounce how far Jones and Footner have been abettors in the killing.(Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence on both sides).</p>
               <p>This is the whole of the evidence on the one side and on the other, and now to apply that evidence to the cases of the different persons: Elizabeth Jones and Richard Footner are charged then with being present, aiding and abetting Sellers at the time he fired off this pistol; as to that there is no direct evidence of their being present, of their having counselled him, or having had any thing to do with him; on the contrary, there is very strong evidence in favour of both of them; there is evidence in favour of Jones, that at the very first fight of the pistols she said she would rather leave the house than they should be there; and that it was not till her attorney and Sellers had interposed, and assured her that she need not be alarmed, that she would consent to the pistols being suffered to stay; after that it seems Miss Jones and Footner expected that there would be persons come on the part of Mr. Yates into the house on Monday, and thought it necessary, together with Sellers, to keep those persons out, to prevent Mr. Yates from turning the tables upon them and turning them out, and they for that purpose locked all the doors with Sellers's assistance; there is no positive evidence as to what they did at the time this unhappy man, Mr. Yates, in endeavouring to get into the house, there being no positive evidence of that sort, and the story told by Mary Thompson not being that which warrants us in forming a rigid prejudice against Miss Jones and Footner, it appears but justice for us to say that they speak the truth in their defence, when they say, "they did not know the pistols were loaded;" and Footner, "that he knew nothing of the matter till he heard the pistol fired;" if you are of that opinion you cannot conclude that they were present either by legal construction, or actually at the time the pistol was fired; and therefore as to them it seems you will have very good ground to acquit them as being accessaries, aiding, and abetting in this act of shooting, and I think it best to dispose of them first, because then it will leave Sellers's case to be considered wholly by itself, subject to your judgments. I think you will do no injustice to your country, but rather justice, if you acquit them of being accessaries; there is hardly evidence to draw a conclusion that must affect their<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140040"></xptr>lives, if they are found guilty. Then as to Sellers, the great point is, whether this pistol went off by accident or design; he had no previous malice against the deceased most clearly; he knew nothing of the deceased till he was invited into the house of Mr. Yates, and Miss Jones by the recommendation of Mr. Beard and Mr. Biggs; and when he came into the house he tells you, that Mr. Yates behaved with a degree of great violence, and he was advised by those to whom he thought proper to refer, to have pistols for his defence; so far then it seems these arms were brought into the house to protect this man and Miss Jones, against any violence that Mr. Yates, whose temper was violent, might use against them; and that the pistols were brought in for that purpose, but the pistols are brought in unloaded; Sellers therefore at some time or other, and we are not informed when, must have loaded them, one of them is loaded at this hour; and he acknowledged it was loaded with ball; he knew therefore at the time he took that pistol up, that it was loaded with ball; we have no evidence to contradict him; as to his taking this pistol up upon the impulse of the moment; but when a man takes up so dreadful a weapon as that upon the impulse of the moment, without a provocation, it will not justify him in any improper use he may make of that pistol; he knew it was loaded, and he took it up upon the impulse of the moment, because he understood Mr. Yates was forcing his way into the house; he was advised, and they all agreed, if they could get Mr. Yates into the garden they would keep him there till the lawyers of both parties met, which was expected in the evening. Mr. Yates had clearly a right to come into that house again, and any person who stopped Mr. Yates from coming into that house was a trespasser, for he was only coming out of the garden, some saying it was a joint and others a permissive possession. Well then, this was a sort of possession the attorney had told them in point of policy they were to deprive them of; but the attorney was not so wise as not to advise them to detain him from that possession by the means of deadly weapons, but he takes up this weapon, and he comes down stairs, no provocation was given to him, he sees Mr. Yates in a very helpless state, endeavouring to get in at the window; he tells Mr. Yates "he must not come in;" Mr. Yates is frightened and retreated, and in the time of retreating the pistol goes off; it may be said in Sellers's favour, that he fired it upon a retreating and not upon an advancing man; that circumstance is in his favour; it is said by Mr. Sellers, that Mr. Yates touched the pistol, and so gave the jar; it is positively said by the girl, that Mr. Yates did not touch the pistol, nor could touch the pistol; and the conversation between Mr. Yates and Sellers in the garden, if you believe the witness, is, that he asked whether they were in the act of a scuffle at the time the pistol went off; he said, "no, no;" but when he asked him if he thought the pistol was fired off maliciously, Mr. Yates said, in that very awful moment, "yes, yes;" whether he would consider the turning aside a pistol a scuffle or not, is for you to turn in your own minds; you have heard what the girl says now, that he put forth his hand, and he could not touch the pistol; upon her deposition before the Coroner she says this, that Mr. Yates put out one of his hands to push away the pistol, when it immediately went off and shot him; she does not say in that, whether he touched the pistol or not; but before the Magistrate she says Mr. Yates put his hand towards the pistol to push it away, and did push it a little aside, and that then Sellers fired the pistol off; the girl therefore has varied in her testimony before the Magistrate from the testimony that she has given this day; she has said at one time that he did touch the pistol, and at another time that he did not; she says to-day he did not; it cannot be imputed to any thing but error and mistake in the girl; for she has told her story with great simplicity, but it may be that her recollection is not perfect; Mr. Yates has said that he was shot maliciously; on the other hand, Sellers says, that Mr. Yates touched the pistol, jarred it in his hand, and that was the occasion of its going off; if you are of opinion that that was really the case, and that the pistol went off by accident, then I think you ought to find Sellers guilty of manslaughter only; if you think it went off wilfully, I think it is a murder of an atrocious nature. There are a few circumstances to be observed upon exclusive of the act of the pistol itself, that where a pistol does go off by accident, it is natural for a person to say immediately, it went off by accident; but he only says, he is not hurt, he is not hurt, and does not seem to be aware that he has done any mischief, nor does he before the deceased in the garden say it was an accident, though he does say so to a witness afterwards; but he does not tell Mr. Yates so, he only asks him forgiveness; but the time to have observed that should have been the very instant, and that in the hearing of Mary Thompson; that being the case you will take that circumstance into your consideration and see low far it should weight in deciding upon his guilt; had not the girl stood contradicted by herself, upon the circumstance of the pistol not having been touched by Mr. Yates; she says one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140041"></xptr>time he did touch the pistol, at another time he did not touch the pistol; but I must observe this, that this pistol must have been extremely carelessly used by Sellers; he must have cocked it before he went down, unless he was cocking it at the time; if he carried it down cocked at the time, he ought to have been very careful not to have put that pistol so near Mr. Yates as to endanger his life; but that is a matter perhaps that will affect the degree of guilt as to the punishment, if you find him guilty of manslaughter; then here is a circumstance that will lead you to decide whether the pistol was fired off accidentally or wilfully. If upon the whole you think it was fired off wilfully, you will find Sellers guilty of the murder; if upon the other hand you think there is not evidence sufficient to lead you to say he fired off this pistol wilfully, but accidentally, there being no positive and direct proof that it was fired wilfully, you will find him guilty of manslaughter only; and you will remember this, that in a doubtful case, the character of a man ought always to weigh and stand him in good stead; and if a man has, during his whole life, as was stated by some of the witnesses ever since 1772, for 24 years; says another for 20 years; says another he has been uniformly marked for his humanity and the mildness of his disposition; it is a strong circumstance to weigh in a doubtful case in the man's fate; you will therefore say, under all there circumstances, whether you think there is evidence sufficient to believe he fired it wilfully; if you think so, you will find him guilty of a most serious murder; if you think he fired it accidentally, you will find him guilty of manslaughter, and less than that you cannot find him guilty of.</p>

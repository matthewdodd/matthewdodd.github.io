The Apprentice deposed, that he took the Carpets up within some Pallisadoes near his Master's House, supposing them to have been thrown there by the Prisoner. The Linnen Draper, who was with her all the time (being a Man of Credit) deposed, he did not perceive her either have or throw any thing away.

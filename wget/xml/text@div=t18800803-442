On Sunday, 27th June, at about 6.45 a.m, the prosecutor came to the station and gave information, and I went with him to his premises—there was no sign of a forcible entry—I then went with him to the prisoner's house and found him in bed, about 8.30—another officer, Davis, took up this flute (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which was on the side-board, and said, "How do you account for the possession of this flute t this answers the description of one stolen from Dale"—he said, "No, that is mine; you had better speak to my father on that' subject"—I said, "Smith, your friend, has met with a serious loss, and I am going to apprehend you on suspicion of having robbed him during the night"—he then asked me if I would allow him to speak to Smith in the passage—I did so, and cautioned Smith not to make any promises—the prisoner said in my hearing, "I know where the money is, and if you will promise me you will not prosecute, I will tell you where it is"—I said, "Make no promises, the case is in my hands"—I asked him for his keys, and said I should search his box—he said, "It is not necessary, I will give it you"—he unlocked a box in his room and handed out the concertina, and in succession three bags con<lb></lb>taining money—he said, "That is your money, Mr. Smith, as it was taken from your place"—Smith said, "Where is my black bag?"—he said, "In</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long has the prisoner lived with you? - A. About six months.</p>
               <p>Q. When you apprehended the prisoner had he not a key in his hand? - A. I rather think he had, he said he was going to get some wood to light the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. He was going to your casting-shop, in the stable-yard; had you told him, on any previous occasion, you would be glad if he would remove the lead to the work-shop? - A. I do not recollect that I had told him; I had told my apprentice. - (The property produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Steadman told me not to let the lead lie about; he told me to take it down to the work-shop in the morning; I was going to take it down, and bring some wood to light the accompting-house fire.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

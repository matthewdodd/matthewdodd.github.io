I took to the prisoner at the corner of Newgate Street—he opened it, read it, and said "I shall want you at 2.30, and it is rather late, here is a shilling for you, you had better go and get some refreshment and meet me at the Horse Shoe Hotel"—I met him there about 2.30, and he pave me a note and told me to take a cab and take it as quick as I could to Mr. Smith, in Lincoln's Inn Fields—I was to take the answer to him at the Stock Exchange, and inquire for Huntley, senior—he said that he was well known there—I got a verbal reply from Mr. Smith and went to the Stock Exchange, but did not find the prisoner—I did not see him again till he was at Bow Street—I was arrested the same afternoon, about 5 o'clock—I was charged at Bow Street, remanded for a week, and discharged—I recognise Mrs. Henten; I saw her as the housekeeper at Portland Road, Notting Hill, where I saw the prisoner.</p>

I wrote an answer to that, and in the after<lb></lb>noon Boosey brought me this letter: "Dear Sir,—I note contents of your favour to hand; please hand bearer your cheque for 657<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Please say what time it will be convenient to give me an interview on Monday, &amp;c., <hi rend="smallCaps">A. HUNTLEY</hi>"—I did not send a cheque and did not see him again.</p>

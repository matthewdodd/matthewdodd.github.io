               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in your shop - A. Yes, the prisoner with two others, came into my shop; one of the party, not the prisoner, asked for a halfpenny pickled cucumber; I served him with it; the same man asked for a halfpenny-worth of pepper; I served him with that; I had other customers in the shop at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that they all three came in together as companions - A. Yes. When they had the pepper and the cucumber, they looked at the window as they were going out, the bees-wax was in the front of the shop, and seeing them look at the window gave me suspicion. I looked at the window and missed the bees-wax immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons serving in the shop at the time - A. My wife and shopman. In consequence of missing the bees-wax, I immediately ran round the counter, and went into the street; I saw no other in the street than the prisoner; he had the beeswax rolled up in his apron. I laid hold of the prisoner, and brought him in; he scuffled to get away from me. He threw the wax from him. I then delivered him over to Wood; he has had the wax ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of the wax - A. Sixteen shillings; there was five pound and a half.</p>

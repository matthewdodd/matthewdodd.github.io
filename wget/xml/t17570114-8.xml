            . I am headborough. On the 7th of December the prisoner came to Mrs. Cockbell's to sell four tea spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Andrews. She told me so herself, and told me also that she asked such a low price for them that Mrs. Cockbell suspected they were stolen. Mrs. Cockbell sent for me to stop her the second time she came there. I went and took her in charge I asked her how she came by them. She said, she had stole them from Mrs. Levit in Shadwell-Market, and that there were five of them. I asked her where the other was. She said, she had pawn'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say she had pawn'd it?</p>
               <p>Andrews. I don't remember the place she named. (The spoons produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Andrews. Here is one of them which has a piece of cloth tied about it, which is the spoon she had pawn'd. (Taking it from amongst the rest.)</p>

            . I keep a cloaths shop. The prisoner brought four tea-spoons to me on the 1st of December, and offered to sell them for five-shillings. I imagined they were not her own, and told her so. She said they were her own, that her husband was pressed to sea, and she was obliged to sell them. I asked her several questions, as where she lived, and what her way of life was. She said, she lived in the Highway. I asked her who knew her there? She said, she had kept herself so retire that nobody knew her there. I said, I should keep the spoons till she fetch'd somebody to her character. She ask'd me if I could answer that. I said, I could keep the spoons and her too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop them?</p>
               <p>J. Cockbell. I did, and sent a person with her; but she found means to slip from that person, under a false pretence, so she did not return with the person again. After that the gentleman's kinsman that owned the spoons came and demanded them, and I delivered them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say how she came by the spoons?</p>
               <p>J. Cockbell. I believe she did, after she was taken up.</p>

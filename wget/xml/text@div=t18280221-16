               <p>Cross-examined by MR. COLERIDGE. Q. Did you know the members of her family? A. I cannot say that I did know them personally; I understood she had a son, named John: I had been informed by her, that he had taken sums of money at various times, which distressed her very much; I have given her money, which I understood she requested in consequence of the demands of her son - it was money I had to save for her; I understood he was in distress, and wanted money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You supplied her with money belonging to herself? A. Yes, money she had left in my hands; she requested it in consequence of his being in want; the only particular sum I recollect was two or three years ago: I never supplied her with money on any other occasion, except for the purposes of my house, and I gave her her wages; I understand her son has come to the house, but I never saw him. When she requested this money I represented to her the impropriety of parting with what might be of use to her in old age, without proper caution; it was only on one occasion that I spoke to her about it - it was in consequence of only one application, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been in care of the house alone on this occasion? A. I left the house for good in September, 1825, and went to live in Surrey, and from that time to the 31st of December last, she was constantly in care of the house; it is a large house, and has a great many rooms: I was there the evening after this took place, in consequence of information being sent to me; I had left a great many articles in the house, in her care - I am not aware of any plate being there; I really cannot say what was left there. I understand there were some spoons - there was an inventory of the things.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Robinson, upholdsters, of Great Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. - On the 1st of January I was directed by them to go to No. 11, Montague-place (I had been there before) - I went about four o'clock in the afternoon of the 1st of January; I rang the bell, but could not get admission; the shutters were shut: I then went through Mr. Sergeant Bosanquet's house, No. 12, and went to the back area with Alexander Bonnick (who is Mr. Robinson's porter), and Mr. Justice Holroyd's butler - I dropped down the back area of No. 11, and opened the back kitchen window, the shutters of which were put to, but not fastened; I got in, and then opened the front door to Mr. Justice Holroyd's butler(Hawkins) - he came in, and we all three proceeded up stairs; we examined every room in the house, but found nobody; the bed had not been used: there was only one bed prepared to sleep in - that had not been used; I turned it down myself - it was getting dark; a candlestick was produced, with a candle in it, on the drawing-room stairs - I sent Bonnick to get a light from the next house - we then proceeded down stairs, Bonnick going first with the light; we went into a little room in the front, which I understand is called the servant's hall - it looks into the front area, and has only one window; Bonnick saw the deceased laying on the floor - I took the candle out of his hand, and saw the body laying about four feet from the window; the head was nearest to the window, and further from the fire than the feet - she laid rather on her right side - her right arm was under her, and her other hand was clenched; her feet were planted straight on the floor, as if she had been standing on them, and her knees up; her throat was cut - she was dead; there was a great quantity of blood on the floor, in one particular part of the room; I do not think the body had been moved since the throat had been cut; the blood appeared to have flown from the wound; the blood was on the right side of the body, inclining to the fire-place: I observed a razor-case and a pair of scissors on the floor, near the body; the razor-case was on the right side, the same side as the blood, but it was not in the blood: I observed her left-hand pocket was outside her clothes - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210014"></xptr>cannot say whether it was turned inside out; I did not examine to see if anything was in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The scissors were on the floor? A. Yes; the razor-case laid on the right side, near the fire, perhaps two feet from the body, from that to three feet - it did not lay in the blood; the greatest part of the blood was congealed at that time. I lifted up her left-hand to see if I could observe any sharp instrument about her; I believe it was the left-hand - it was the one that was uppermost - I moved nothing else in the room; I observed a little work-box on the table, with thread and cotton in it, and things - part of them were thrown on the floor; I did not observe any paper; I looked at the table, but did not particularly notice it; there were two or three chairs in the room - one stood on one side of the table, and another on the other, as near as I can tell, as if two people had been sitting in them. I left the things exactly as I found them; this was the last room we went into - we had been into every room up stairs, I believe - I think we went into eight or nine, with the drawing-rooms; there might be six bed-rooms - we did not observe anything out of order in the bed-rooms the first time, as we did not notice, but after going to Bow-street we went up with the officers, and then observed it - this might be an hour after; I had left Bonnick and a gentleman's servant, who was going by, in charge of the house; when I returned with the officers to search, I believe there was something disturbed in each room; the drawers in the front bed-room, which were unlocked, were open - no locks were forced, to my knowledge; I found at least ten or twelve drawers open, I think- there did not appear to be things taken out of them, but the things were rifled over.</p>

               <p>Q. Were any cupboards in this room forced open? A. There was a closet between the front and back room - there was a wardrobe in the front room - I do not think that was forced open; the things in it had been rifled about- the things in the drawers consisted principally of gloves, gaiters, and wearing-apparel; in the cupboard between the front and back bed room, there were two or three boxes, with ladies' feathers - the boxes had been opened in some, and part of the feathers taken out, and laid on the floor - I know there was one chest of drawers in the back bed-room - the things in that were not carried away, but they were disturbed; they appeared to have been looked over. I believe in all the bed-rooms there were drawers open, and things turned over; there was a chest of drawers in the room in which the bed was made; I do not think they had been locked - there were gloves and things in them; I was not very particular myself in looking the things over, for I went to Mr. Lett's, at Dulwich, and left the officers there. It must have taken a good while to go over the drawers in all the rooms; there were several drawers open down in the back kitchen; there was a large press in the back kitchen - that appeared to have been rifled over; that was the room we first entered: I did not observe any food on the table; the fire was out, and there were two ridges of wood to light it with; I did not observe whether it had burnt out, but I think it had been scratched out. I saw nothing of a silver or plated mustard-pot, nor a spoon.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Your attention was not particularly called to the state of the rooms when you first went up stairs? A. No; I was looking for the deceased, not at the state of the rooms.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the scissors bloody or not? A. I did not observe; they were perhaps six or seven inches long from handle to point; I saw no scissor-case: I should think it would take half an hour to put the drawers in the state I found them. I think the deceased had been sitting at work at the table.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Robinson's employ. On the 1st of January I went with Dent to Mr. Lett's house - it was a little before four o'clock; Dent rang the bell: we went through the next house; Mr. Justice Holroyd's servant was on the leads, and a woman of the house No. 10; we got in at the back kitchen, went over the rooms up stairs, and came down; we at last all went into the room, and found the deceased laying on her right side, in the servant's hall; it was the body of Betty Jeffs - I knew her by working at the house; her legs were crooked a little - one hand was under her body; her left hand was rather bent. I found a razor-sheath close to the gore of blood, within fourteen or fifteen inches of the body; it was free from the blood where it lay - it was just away from the blood; the snuffers laid on the floor; an ale-house pewter pot laid just at her back, on its side, as if it had been thrown down - I cannot say whether any beer was in it: a pair of common scissors, about eight inches long, laid close to the body. I touched nothing; I believe Dent took up the razor-case, but laid it down in the same place again; the drawers in the different rooms were all open when we came to examine them - they were all drawn out; we waited till Salmon and Fergusson came before we examined them; Dent and Mr. Justice Holroyd's servant went for the officers; nothing was touched or moved from the time they left till the officers came, and took possession of the premises. There was a chair on each side of the table in the room the deceased laid in, as if two persons had been sitting together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you aware that you should be called as a witness to speak to the state of the house? A. No - I recollect every thing very well; the razor-case was free from blood, to the best of my knowledge - I think I saw Dent lift it up, and I said, "Let every thing lay as it is;" I am sure he put it down in the same place again. I think one person could not have done all that was done in the rooms under an hour, to pull out all the drawers, and look at the things; the drawers in the back kitchen were opened, and there was a silver mustard-pot, I think, standing on the dresser. It might have taken less than an hour to do all this - I cannot say: we were not ten minutes going over the house; we passed through from room to room; there was a work-box on the table, and things strewed about - I saw no paper there myself.</p>

            . I was sent to Mr. Robinson's, and to the Public-office, for assistance; I had been let into the house by Dent and Bonnick. On going into the room where the deceased lay I saw a razor-case laying between her right shoulder and the window, about two feet from the body - it was apart from the blood; it was the first thing I observed; this was before I went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210015"></xptr>the office; I think it could not have been moved by any one when I first saw it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the blood standing or flowing at all? A. It was in a thick clotted state, from the body to the fire-place; I saw the blood again afterwards - it covered the same space of ground. I did not see Dent lift the razor-case - I do not think anybody touched it till I went for Salmon; I heard Bonnick say, "Let every thing remain as it is;" he was very much alarmed on entering the room, and went back again; I should think he made that observation in less than five minutes after we entered the room; it was just before we left the room; I did not notice Dent lift the razor-case - he might do it without my observing it, but I do not think it was touched, till it was touched by Salmon; Dent informed me that he picked up the scissors, but I did not see him do so - I did not notice them at all on the floor - I saw some scissors on the table, but whether he had picked them up I cannot say; I observed nothing particular on them.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Giles', and live at the watch-house. On the 1st of January I was sent for to No. 11, Montague-place - I got there a little after six o'clock; I proceeded to examine the rooms in the house very particularly, with Gardener, Mr. Robinson, and Dent; I found Salmon and Gardener there - I went into the kitchen, and saw the dead body laying on its right side; I saw the lower part of a razor sheath on her right side - I lifted it up, and Salmon desired me to put it down- I placed it in the same situation as it was: Salmon did not take it up that night; he locked the door, and took the key himself, leaving the razor-case there, that the Coroner's Jury might see every thing just as it was; there was a quart pot near her head. I went through every room in the house - I saw some drawers open, and in a wash-hand-stand drawer on the first floor was several things disturbed; I found a glove in that drawer laying on the top of the other things, with a mark of fresh blood on it - the drawer was open; in a little drawer next to that, was part of a newspaper, which I produce - that is also stained with blood, which appeared fresh; I then went into the passage, to go to the back second floor room - there I saw some band-boxes disturbed, and some ladies' feathers out on the floor - that was in the passage, between the back and front rooms; I went to the second floor back room, and there saw a bundle; at that time I did not perceive any marks of blood on it, it being candle-light. After the rooms were all locked up, I left every thing exactly as when I first went into them, and I took possession of the keys till the Inquest, which was held on Thursday, the 3rd of January; a candle had been brought before I arrived. On the day of the Inquest I went up to the second floor front and back rooms, while the Jury were there; I produced the keys - the doors were opened in my presence, and I made some further observations, which I omitted to give in evidence; on searching the hand-boxes which had contained the feathers, there were several stains of blood, both on the feathers and on the papers which contained them; they were enclosed in separate papers, which are stained with blood, and some linen which was in the boxes had blood on it, which appeared fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by fresh? A. It appeared the same sort of blood as was on the glove; Mr. Robinson took possession of the keys after the Inquest. I went, in consequence of information, on Tuesday, the 8th of January, with Salmon and Gardener, to No. 35, Mitre-street, to look for a person named Jones; I did not find him there: in the course of our search there, we stated what we had come about; we went into the first floor back room, which was not then occupied; I saw Salmon take a shirt-collar off the bed, and in a table-drawer I found a razor, which I produce, exactly in the state in which I found it; there is one or two small notches made in it, and the edge appears to me turned; there is a stain or two on the blade, but of what it is impossible for me to say. I found a new umbrella in that room; there was no razor in the room besides the one produced - we searched every place; there was no sheath, nor part of a sheath there: we did not leave a single place unsearched. I continued some time searching after Jones, and found him on Sunday, the 13th of January, in the City Compter; he went there by the name of William Edwards; when he was brought out he came towards me - I asked what his name was; he said Edwards; I said, "Your name is Jones" - he said No, it was not, and then he said, "Yes it is," immediately after denying it. I laid hold of his left hand, looked at his left thumb, in consequence of something, and found he had got a cut on his left thumb, near the nail; I asked how long it had been done - he said five or six weeks; I looked at it again, and told him I thought it had not been done so long, for it appeared to me to be a fresh cut - I thought it had not been done so many weeks; I asked how he did it - he told me in cutting some wood with a knife: I then examined his clothes - he had a blue frock-coat on; he took off his coat, and said, "You see in what a situation I am in - I have not a shirt to my back;" I asked what he had done with his shirt - he said he had pawned it at Turner's, in Brydges-street, Strand, on the Thursday preceeding; I inquired, and found that was the case: his coat appeared to me to have been sponged, and that very recently; both the sleeves, inside and out, appeared to have been sponged between the hand and elbows, ten or twelve inches up from the wrist, and it appeared to have been sponged in the front, outside; he said the person he borrowed it of had sponged it - I think he said it was Mrs. Williams' son: he was left in possession of the coat till the examination on last Monday week - he had it on at every examination but that one; we left him at the Compter: I examined his trousers, but they were too dirty to notice anything - he had a waistcoat on, but it was candle light, and I could not observe anything. We fetched him to Bow-street on the Monday, and Salmon and I took him to the House of Correction on Monday, the 28th of January; he had undergone several examinations then; I examined the coloured waistcoat he had got on, and in the right-hand pocket I perceived a stain, but what it is I cannot say - I brought the waistcoat away with me, and have had it ever since - I produce it; the stain is outside the pocket.

            . I am governor of the House of Correction. The prisoner was in my custody; when he left the prison at his last examination the coat was left with one of the prisoner's in the Infirmary, where he had been;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210016"></xptr>I saw him every time he went up to the office, and have no doubt of it being his coat.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FURZEMAN. This is the coat I saw the prisoner wear, I am certain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In the early part of the business, I believe, you suspected somebody else? A. I did - it was Knight; he was examined: it might be three or four days after that, that suspicion fell on the prisoner; I commenced search after him three or four days after the murder; the first lodging I searched was in MItre-street - I did not at that time examine the inside of the handle of the razor; here is a dot and sort of streak on the blade, and if you took inside the handle you will find something of the same - it is just at the commencement of the blade; the spot looked to me as if the razor had been wiped; it appears to me that the handle has been washed - there is a stain inside: the impression on my mind is, that the handle has been washed inside; I cannot say whether the blade has been washed: washing and rubbing it would get a stain out - if it was washed carefully with soap and water it might be got off, I suppose: you will find a corresponding stain inside the handle - there is a something, what it is I cannot say; I have not broken the handle open - I have examined it very particularly; it was compared at Bow-street with some other razors. The stains of blood on the papers of feathers appeared the same as that on the glove.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there anything by which you draw that conclusion, except from finding them in the same house? A. Nothing. I think suspicion fell on the prisoner the same evening as the Jury sat - it was on Thursday or Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did your suspicions amount to a strong opinion? A. On the Tuesday; I beg pardon, we were in search of him previous to going to his lodgings; my suspicions were stronger on the 8th, before we went to Mitre-street: I had not then seen the razor, nor coat, waistcoat, or trowsers; nor had I seen the prisoner: In every thing I have done since, I have acted under that strong impression, of his guilt; that caused us to make more particular search after him. I pulled the cut in his thumb open, and in my judgment it had not been done above six or seven days - that was my firm opinion. I never said I made a remark on his waistcoat on first seeing him; I said it appeared to have been washed - but I made no remark respecting anything on it; it appeared clean, as if it had been washed within a few days - the stain is on the band of the pocket. I cannot say the trousers had not been sponged; one part of them appeared cleaner than the other; I think I have said they had been sponged, but I would not swear they had; I never swore so; he had a pair of boots on, with hardly any sole to them; the knees of his trousers were cleaner than the rest - the bottom was very muddy; I asked where he had been living, he told me at No. 35, Mitre-street, without hesitation; I asked who he had lived with - he said, a girl named Charlotte Bury; I think he said he had lived in Wootton-street; I found that correct; I think he mentioned Windmill-court to me - we found he had lived there: I have ascertained that he has passed by the name of Edwards for months; I have understood he had a reason for concealing his name - Charlotte Bury has been in my care at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you deny the prisoner's attorney access to her? A. When Mr. Hanson called there one evening, Mrs. Furzeman would not let him see her, but I left word, if Mr. Butler called, he was to see her; I had been desired to let no one see her.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When he said he lived in Mitre-street, did you know that before? A. Certainly; he did not know that I knew it; when I found blood on the glove I put it into my pocket, and wrapped it up; I produced it before the Coroner, and saw the marked papers there: I compared the blood on the glove with that on the papers - they appeared the same marks, and of the same standing: my suspicion of the prisoner made no impression on me, except to make me vigilant and particular in every circumstance I could collect; Knight was examined twice before the Magistrate, and then discharged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You examined all the drawers? A. I did; every drawer had been disturbed - I found no locks broken - I should think it would not take a person more than fourteen or fifteen minutes, or from that to twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>MR. LETT re-examined. This glove belonged to my son who is abroad; he left about the 8th of November; I had not seen the glove after he left - I know nothing about the feathers, and other articles myself; none of the members of my family have resided in the house since September, 1825; my son has occasionally been there; my daughters have not been there; Mrs. Lett was there repeatedly in the day time, but never slept there.</p>

            . I was directed to go to No. 11, Montague-place on the 1st of January; I saw the pair of scissors; I took them up - saw nothing on them, and put them down again; if there had been blood on them, I should have seen it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see any thing else on the ground? A. I saw a quart pot laying behind the deceased, and the lower part of a razor-sheath very near the body, about two feet from it - it laid partly in the blood, which was congealed. I took up the case - it was bloody; I laid it down again in the same place, I am quite positive, and it remained in the same situation till the Coroner sat; I then took it up, and washed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you wash it all over? A. I merely took a wet cloth, and wiped the blood off - there is no blood on it now; I found no difficulty in getting it off. I saw a candlestick on the second stair in the hall, going up stairs, and a small piece of candle in it; I did not notice any blood on it then, but when the Inquest sat, I observed a few spots of blood on it, outside; I do not think it is here; I washed the razor-case, as it was so bloody - I did not think proper to wrap it up in the blood; I left the candlestick in the house - it was made use of. I remained in the house two nights and two days - I cannot recollect in whose possession the candlestick was left; there was a small bit of paper on the table, with some writing on it - I gave it to Mr. Lett; I was present when Mr. Plumb, the surgeon, came; after the Inquest had sat, I saw five or six keys taken from the deceased's pocket, also a thimble, and 5 1/2d.; I did not see the keys tried to any locks; I should have said that a sovereign fell from her person when she was turned about; I have had possession of the razor-case ever since - it is a black one - I produce it; I took it into my possession when the Inquest sat, and washed it almost immediately after: I took it up as soon as the Inquest left the body - it was before my examination at Bow-street.</p>

Yes; I produce the shirt-collar, which I got off the bed on the first floor back room, in Mitre-street; and have had it ever since; I saw Furzeman find the razor; the collar is exactly in the same state as when I found it.</p>
               <p>MR. COLERIDGE. Q. Did the handle of the razor appear to have been washed? A. I did not notice; the shirt-collar was on the bed, which was unmade; a person might make that mark on it by shaving with a notched razor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You went all over the house? A. After the Inquest sat, not before; the drawers appeared much confused; I should think it would take a man at least half an hour to look them all over by himself.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Lett. I knew the deceased, and knew she had a plain silver watch, and two silver table-spoons; I have not seen them since her death - I think I saw her with her watch within a month of her death- she wore it regularly; I had not seen the spoons so lately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What makes you say you saw the watch a month before? A. She had observed to me that it did not go regularly; the spoons were marked "B. J." as well as I can recollect. I told Mr. Lett and Mr. Halls what the mark was; the watch had a paper of Mr. Allen's, watchmaker, Red Lion-passage; I informed Mr. Halls of that.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Great Russell-street, Bloomsbury. On the evening of the 1st of January, about six o'clock, I was sent for to No. 11, Montague-place, and saw the body laying in the small room below; she was laying on her back, with her head turned to the right side; I examined a cut in her neck; it extended from the back of her neck towards the front, and separated the whole of the large vessels, and the hemorrhage from those vessels, I have no doubt, caused her death; the windpipe was divided - I should think it not such a wound as a person could have inflicted on herself; her countenance had a strong expression of horror upon it - her eyes were open, and her hands hard clenched. I made no further observations, except on the lower part of her dress, which was pulled up above her knees, or nearly so; when I made a subsequent examination before the Coroner, I saw marks of apparently the knuckles of some person on the left collar-bone; there had been a great loss of blood; there appeared to be a mark of dirt on her left cheek - I thought it was occasioned by the outer edge of the sole of a dirty shoe; her neck handkerchief was thrust into the wound, by apparently the toe of the shoe - it was dirty, similar to the cheek - it was the same coloured dirt; I observed a slight finger-mark of blood on each thigh, also a single drop of blood on the left thigh; the wound in the throat, nor the blood flowing from it, could have occasioned either of these spots.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would it be possible for the blood from the throat to occasion either of those marks? A. I think it impossible; her thighs were covered with the clothes, but not the legs; I was obliged to move her clothes to ascertain if there were any marks; there was no appearance of the blood having trickled down internally, nor externally; I could not judge within a few hours how long she had been dead - it might have been twenty-four hours - the body was cold and stiff; the wound had not touched the spine, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if it was done with a razor, it had touched no bone? A. It had touched no bone, but had divided the cartilage - I think that would have turned the edge of a razor, so as to render it unfit for use as a razor; I could not tell which hand the knockle mark was of. I saw the prisoner at his first examination at Bow-street, and at the second, which was about the 21st. I saw his left thumb had been cut, but could not judge how long it had been done - it is difficult to say; if I had seen it a week after it had been done, I might be able to say whether it had been done a week or a fortnight, but not to be positive - I think I could not be deceived as to four or five weeks; I should have formed an opinion that it might have been done perhaps three weeks, or a month, when I saw it - I think I examined it at the request of the prisoner's solicitor, Mr. Butler. There was a little blood on the back of both the deceased's hands - it appeared to be the marks of another bloody hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Would cutting through these vessels produce an immediate gush of blood? A. It would, and that was likely to produce a considerable quantity of blood on the hands of the person by whom it was done: in my opinion, the cut was made from the right to the left.</p>
               <p>MR. LETT. I saw the deceased almost every week; latterly one of her arms was rather feeble, but I will not be positive which.</p>
               <p>MR. PLUMRE. I did not peceive any cut on the deceased's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this razor; would cutting through the windpipe produce such an effect as that on the edge? A. I should hardly think it would, to such an extent as this; it appears to me farther that, as I shut the razor, it comes in contact with the handle, and that might produce all the appearances on the edge - I think it possible and probable that it might produce the whole effect on the edge of this razor. The deceased had long sleeves on - I did not discover any blood upon them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SALMON re-examined by MR. COLERIDGE. I saw the prisoner's thumb examined at the Compter - it appeared to me to be recently done; I do not recollect making any remark of its festering - I said at Bow-street that it appeared to be in a festering state.</p>

               <p>GEORGE JAMES ROBINSON. I am an upholdster. I had had taken an inventory of the fixtures and furniture in Mr. Lett's house, but not of the spoons, nor any thing of that nature; I have been there when Mr. Lett was at lunch, and have seen some spoons and table-forks - that was three months ago; this cloth (looking at it), I have no doubt, is one I found in Mr. Lett's house, two or three days after the Inquest sat, when I examined the premises; I took it out because there were two marks of blood upon it, and gave it to Edmeads - it was not in the room where the body was found, but on the same floor; there were several articles which I did not put in my inventory.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Had you any thing to do with spoons or plate in your inventory? A.

On the last night in the year I was in Montague-place, about nine o'clock, and saw Mrs. Jeffs at Mr. Lett's door, talking to a man with a blue coat and white apron on - I was on the other side of the way; she called me over, and asked for a pint of beer, which I gave her in a quart pot - she generally had half a pint, but she had had none for three weeks or a fortnight; the man was in the hall, on the mat - they seemed talking together as I was crossing the road; when I delivered the beer to her I went away, and left them there - they did not shut the door while I staid; I afterwards saw the quart pot, when master brought it home - not before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are sure this was about nine o'clock? A. It might be a little after, but not much I know; I went out a little before nine with my beer - I did not see the man's face; the moon was nearly full, and there is a gas-light facing the door - I am certain he had a white apron on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his front, or his back? A. His front, but did not see his face; I do not know how he was dressed below his apron - I am sure he had a blue coat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sized man was he? A. A middling size; I cannot form any judgment whether it was the prisoner or not; he had not got a frock coat on - it was a tail coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it made so as to come forward over his hips? A. It was cut round here - it did not hang over his knees- it was buttoned over his apron.</p>

            . On the 31st of December I was in the cart with Evans. I recollect starting from Mr. Sergeant Bosanquet's door, about twenty minutes before ten, as near as possible; the horse went on of its own accord - Evans fell back on the seat, and at that moment I heard a dreadful scream - it appeared to come from the south side of the street; we had then got not quite past No. 10 - if we had, that was the outside: I looked round, but could see no one about; the voice seemed to come quite from the house, just opposite the side of the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You thought the dreadful scream was a boy in the street? A. I said so: I thought so then, but not afterwards: when Evans said "Lord have mercy me, what's that?" I said "Oh! it is only some boy in the street" - I thought no more about it that night; Evans said she thought it was a bad woman; I do not know that she told me so then - she has since.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Montague-place. On the night of the 31st of December, when I went to call half-past ten o'clock; I was coming down on the left hand side of the way, and when by No. 24, which is opposite No. 11, I saw a man and woman talking to Mrs. Jeffs, outside the door; she had the door half-way open in her right hand, and a candlestick in her left - I heard them bid her good night, and she bid them good night; they went down the street, and turned to the left, towards Bedford-square, I went on towards Russell-square, and saw Mrs. Jeffs shut the door; it was on a Monday night; I am a regular watchman there, but was not there the first night in the year; we come to the watch-house at half-past seven, and are on our beats before eight, and call the hour every half hour after; the man had a blue coat on - I did not observe any apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the length of your beat? A. From the end of Montague-street, to No. 1, Montague-place, and there is a mews I have to go down - if I walk quick I can go round my beat in ten minutes - but it generally takes a quarter of an hour: when I began to call half-past ten, I saw nobody near the house: I was coming back when I saw them - it might be nearly a quarter to eleven; my box is in the rails of Russell-square. I have known Mrs. Jeffs for some years; she held a candle in her hand. it was moonlight - almost as light as day; I am certain I saw the man and woman talking to her.</p>

             re-examined.

            . I am the son of John Knight. The prisoner went with me once to see my grandmother, in Montague-place - my sister Eliza went there to tea - and he went with me to take her; that was about July; and he went once with my father, after they went to Mr. Robinson's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went with your sister, did the prisoner go into the house? A. Yes; he staid about half an hour; he was sitting in the library with us - he did not go down stairs - I saw my grandmother on the 30th of December last, in good health and spirits.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he stay to tea when he went with your sister? A. No; he sat up stairs in the library- he was asked to stop tea, but did not.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a magistrate of Bow-street. The prisoner was examined before me several times on this charge; I, myself, took his examination down on the 14th of January, when he was first brought before me. The paper I hold in my hand contains my own note, in my own hand-writing, of the examination I then took. No threat, promise, menace, or inducement whatever, were held out to him; on the contrary I cautioned him.</p>
               <p>MR. COLERIDGE. Q. Was that paper, after you took it, read over to him? A. It was, by myself. It is not signed by him; he was repeatedly examined by me - my clerk did not take a note of his examination; I took it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, at his last examination, read over to him, a paper, purporting to be his examination? A. I had read over to him a verbatim copy of the paper I now hold in my hand; that was on Monday week; the copy was made in my presence, and afterward examined by myself, immediately after I wrote the examination; it was only his own statement; nothing more was read to him. I asked him to sign it at his last examination, and he declined; he said there were many inaccuracries in it - I asked if he would sign it subject to that remark; he declined signing it at all; and said though he had made that statement, there were several inaccuracies in it, which he declined explaining to me; he said he preferred giving the explanation to Mr. Butler, his solicitor, to be made use of at his trial.</p>
               <p>Q. In conducting this examination, did you take down the very words he said? A. I did - I left him to tell his own story in such parts as related to times and places, where he said he had been, occasionally putting questions to him; I suffered him to tell his own story in all material parts; I only put questions to him when I thought it necessary, to lead his attention to the particular subject.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the goodness to tell us, as well as you can, the very words in which he declined to sign the statement? A. I said, "This statement having been read over to you, will you sign it?" He said, "I decline signing it;" in the first instance he seemed preparing to sign it; Mr. Butler, his solicitor, then said, "Jones, if you sign that paper, understand you take it on your own responsibility;" he then said, "I decline signing it:" he had said there were inaccuracies in it before Mr. Butler spoke to him. I have returned to the Court the copy of what I hold in my hand; it is signed by myself, as the examination.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he explain what sort of inaccuracies he had to complain of? A. He refused to give any explanation, but admitted the statement was what he had made at the time - he said, "I have made such a statement, but it contains several inaccuracies;" I had taken it correct: he did not complain of my taking it inaccurately, when it was read over to him - I read it to him, in the first instance, on the 14th, when I took it, and asked if it was correct - he said it was correct; it was again read to him on last Monday week, and he refused to sign it. (Looking at the examinations returned to the Court) this is the paper read over to him on Monday week - it is a copy of what I took from him.(The examination was here read, as follows:)</p>
               <p>JAN. 14, 1828. - "It was about a fortnight ago that I first went to lodge at No. 35, Mitre-street, near the Cobourg Theatre, at the house of a person named Stapleton - I cannot precisely recollect the day; I did not take the lodgings myself, but rather think it was on a Friday, the last Friday in the year; the lodgings were taken by a female named Charlotte, whom I have lately lived with - I do not know her real name, but she usually goes by the name of Charlotte Bury - I have lived with her about seven or eight months, and saw her last on Saturday last, in the forenoon, about eleven o'clock, at a house in White Lion-passage, and I was to have met her in the evening again, at the top of Shire-lane; I first became acquainted with her accidentally in Fleet-street, she being at that time a girl upon the town. On the Monday evening, the 31st of December last, I went to the Adelphi Theatre, rather earlier than half-past seven - I went alone - I went into the gallery and paid 1s. for admittance; I saw part of Nelson, and the Married Batchelor, and the Pantomime - I went straight from home in Mitre-street, and went out with the intention of going; I went out quite alone and left Charlotte at home - she was alone when I left her; I came over Blackfriars-bridge and along Fleet-street to the Strand, and did not stop any where in my way till I got to the Theatre, nor did I meet any person I knew. I am not now quite sure I left Charlotte at home - she may have gone out before me, but I am quite sure she did not leave the house with me, for I remember I went out with the intention of going to the Adelphi by myself; I had I think not above 2s. in my pocket at the time I went to the Adelphi - I did not see any one I knew particularly at the Theatre - I did not expect it, as I so seldom go into the gallery, I staid through the whole of the performance, and did not go out at all - I think it was a little before twelve o'clock when I came out, and I went home by myself over Blackfriars-bridge again; I think I called in at the public-house next door to the Theatre, and had a glass of something, but am not positive of this. I think the landlord let me in at home - it was either him or his wife: upon recollection, I may possibly have gone home that night with Charlotte, as I was much used to meet her and go home with her - generally about Fleet-street, but I am sure I went out alone. I have no doubt the money I had about me was Charlotte's money; Charlotte paid the first week's lodging in Mitre-street; she paid it with her own money; she paid part on the Thursday, I think, and part on the Friday, the day when the week expired; I saw her go down stairs to pay it both times - I think she paid 4s. the first time, and 1s. remaining on the Friday, and she paid 1s. deposit on taking the lodging - all this was her own money, I am sure of this, for I have not given her any money lately, not for some weeks past. I do not think I have borrowed any money of any person since I have lodged in Mitre-street; I have had a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210020"></xptr>few shillings at a time since I have been there, of my own money, by selling one or two pawnbroker's tickets, at different times, about 3s. or 4s.; it was during the first week of our being in Mitre-street that I speak of; I sold the tickets to strangers, in public-houses - one was for a pair of Wellington boots, another for a pair of trousers and a handkerchief, and several other things together, and, I think, a coat, all in one ticket; I think I got 27s. or 28s. for the tickets altogether; the boots were pledged at Cameron's, in the Strand, for 7s., as were also the coat and trousers, for 1l. I cut my thumb about five or six weeks ago, or perhaps more - I cut it, splitting some wood, with a sharp knife, against my breast; it was in Wootten-street, where we lived before we went to Mitre-street; I rather think Charlotte was present when I cut it - it was in the forenoon, lateish, in our own room - I was cutting the wood to light the fire; it was with a case-knife belonging to the house - it was a long time healing; I applied nothing to it but a bit of rag at first, but soon left it off - I have worn nothing upon it since I have been in Mitre-street. I now recollect it was tied round with some tape, which was in our table drawer in Wootten-street, the landlady's table; Charlotte gave me the tape - perhaps it might have been in the table in Mitre-street, and my thumb might have been cut in Mitre-street. I was at the Olympic Theatre on Tuesday, the 1st of January, instant, with Charlotte, either on the Tuesday or the Wednesday, I rather think the former; the piece was Casco Bay, and Touch and Take, and the Pantomime; we went into the gallery - I paid 2s. for the two: it was my own money, out of that I had got by selling the tickets, which I believe she understood I borrowed, for I told her I had borrowed some of a friend. We went from our own lodgings over Waterloo-bridge, and went to the Adelphi first, for I had told her I had been there the night before, and she wished to see the same pieces, but we were told the house was full, and then we went to the Olympic. I was at home all the day on the Tuesday. I have got an umbrella, which is in Mitre-street - I bought it in the Westminster-road, just over Westminster-bridge, on the right-hand side, at a shop which I perfectly recollect, a small shop; I gave 4s. 6d. for it; I bought it during the first week while we were in Mitre-street, but do not recollect the precise day, about Tuesday or Wednesday - I believe a woman served me with it; it was a new one, I believe, when I bought it, it being outside for sale. I have seen the late Mrs. Jeffs twice - once in the presence of Mr. Knight, her son, and once in the presence of Mr. Knight's daughter - his eldest daughter, Mary; the last was in the front parlour in Montague-place; I went to meet them there, and my own sister was there at the time; this was when I met the daughter Mary there: at that time the daughter Mary was boarding and lodging with my mother; this was before I went to Mr. Duncombe's - it was before this that I went with Mr. Knight to see Mrs. Jeffs; I went with him about something concerning a situation - some writing in a counting-house that Mrs. Jeffs had obtained for her son; I was in the parlour with Mrs. Jeffs both times; I have not seen Mrs. Jeffs since I was there with the daughter Mary: I do not know whether my sister has since seen her; my sister's name is Georgiana - she is unmarried, and she lives in King-street, Bloomsbury, with my mother. I lodged myself with Knight a short time before he left the house over the water, in Anderson's-place, Cornwall-road, and a short time after he came to live in Cursitor-street, a few week's altogether - I cannot say how many. I saw Mrs. Jeffs once also at Mr. Knight's, in Cornwall-road - she did not stop there for any long time. I recollect that Knight pledged a picture in Holborn, in High Holborn, above the upper Turnstile - it was a landscape, in a frame, about three or four feet in length, and about a foot wide, I should think. The coat I have on I borrowed - it is not my own; I borrowed it of a Mrs. Williams, who was our landlady in Wootten-street; this was while we were with her, some weeks back. I pledged my own coat before I went to Mitre-street - it was a black coat, and is amongst the tickets in the possession of the officer. The shirt-collar now produced by Salmon, the officer, is mine; I do not know when I wore it last, or how it came bloody.</p>
               <p>Taken before me, the 14th day of January, 1828,</p>

             - she first lived with me in Wootten-street - she had one room furnished, for which she paid 10s. a week; the prisoner Jones lived with her - he also went by the name of Edwards: she took the lodging, but he came with her, and occupied it; they lived together as man and wife - they did not say whether they were married. They lived with me from the 29th of October till the 29th of December; I then moved - they also lived with me at No. 1, Windmill-street; we had two rooms, and lived together there; I paid 5s. a week myself- they paid nothing, they were in poor circumstances. I knew Charlotte used to go out of an evening; I have heard her say so, in his presence. I have three daughters - the eldest (Mary Ann) is fourteen years old; when the prisoner left me they went to live in Mitre-street - I think it was No. 35; they had a back room on the first floor; Stapleton kept the house - I used to visit them. I used to lend the prisoner razors when he lived with me in Wootten-street, and I lent him one when he lived in Mitre-street; I had four razors, two with black handles, and two tortoiseshell - the two black handled ones had a double case - one of the tortoiseshell had a single case, and the other had no case; I lent him a tortoiseshell one in a black case, with a top to it, for I have the two black handled ones now - I think I should know the razor-case again, and the razor too; (looking at the razor) I think this is something like the one I lent him - there is no mark on it - I only know it by its general appearance; I think I should know the case by its general appearance - there was no mark on it; it was a black case, and the upper part of the lower case was red - (looking at it) I believe this to be the case - it is something like it, if it is not it - I cannot swear to it; I lent him the razor and case on the 30th of December; my daughter Mary Ann carried them to him - they have never been returned to me; I saw him twice on the 30th of December, first at his own lodging, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning - he was then in bed with Charlotte, and said he wished I would send the razor up, and that I would lend him a silk neck handkerchief; he said he wanted the razor that was in the single case; Charlotte, who was in bed, asked me, in his presence, if I would let my little girl go and borrow a shilling or a sixpence for her, saying she had no fire, nor any victuals - I let my girl go to borrow a sixpence, and was there when she returned - she did not succeed; I afterwards sent the razor and handkerchief as desired; he, Charlotte, and my girl came home together, about five o'clock in the evening; they stopped about half an hour or less, and said they were go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210021"></xptr>ing into the City, I believe, but am not positive; they were not in the habit of going out of an evening while they were at my house, for the prisoner had no coat - if he wanted a coat he used to send to a person named Sells to borrow one - it was a largish drab coat, I think; I afterwards lent him a dark blue coat, which was given to my son - (looking at the coat produced) I rather think this is it - yes it is, for there is my work in the back seams.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner and Charlotte again on the 31st? A. Yes, in the morning; I went to their lodgings - I cannot be certain whether they were up; the prisoner said nothing about money then: I did not stop many minutes, and did not see them after on that day - I think my little girl went there. On the 1st of January I went to their lodgings in Mitre-street; they were both up - he was cleaning himself. and said he was going out to meet a friend who had promised to lend him some money; I wished him a happy new year, and he wished me the same - Charlotte said nothing to that; she said he was going to get a trifle of money: he was not in the habit of going out in the day time; he said he had seen a friend last night, and was going to that friend to lend him a little money, and if he succeeded Charlotte should give me a trifle. On the morning of the 2d, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I went to his lodging in Mitre-street - he was in bed; I asked how he was, and how Charlotte was; he said she was gone out, and said he had been to my house the night before; I said I found he had, for he had left me 2s., which my daughter had given me; when Charlotte came in she said she had been to get the newspaper, and could not get it, and said, "I suppose you won't believe it, but I have;" he said it was a lie: she then said, "If you want it, get up and get it yourself;" he did not say for what purpose he wanted it - they asked if I could get a newspaper - I asked what paper they wanted, and said, "Sunday's?" they said No, to-day's, if they could get it; they both hastily said that; they both pressed me to stay breakfast that morning, and while at breakfast they had words; Charlotte told me, in his hearing, that when she came home on the Tuesday, he was laying on the bed, crying - that she asked what it was about, and he said he had heard his father was dead - he said an intimate friend of his father's had told him so; they did not breakfast together, in consequence of having words; the prisoner had no coat on while he was at breakfast; I believe his coat laid in the chair, and a little while after breakfast it fell off the chair, and made a great rustling - Jones looked very anxiously at it - it sounded as if silver money was in it; a quartern and a half of gin was sent for - I fetched it; Jones produced the money for it - Charlotte would have none of it: I did not stop above three minutes after I fetched it. I did not go there again till Saturday, the 5th of January, between ten and eleven o'clock - nothing particular passed - I went again on Sunday, the 6th, and told him I understood the Bow-street officers were after a person of the name of Jones, and they said it was Mrs. Williams' lodger - (I had heard him say before that his name was Jones, but I did not believe it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us particularly every thing you said to him? - A. As well as I can recollect, I said I thought it was him, and Charlotte said he had committed no murder; I had said it was a charge of murder - Charlotte said, "Oh! he has not committed any murder - it is his friends who have sent after him;" Jones said nothing about the murder - he said he knew how it was - that his friends had sent the Bow-street officers after him; Charlotte said, "Well, Bill, you know you must go home now - you know your friends are in search of you:" I said, William Nicholas (my son) wanted his coat - he said, "You cannot have it now, till such time as I have been home to my friends, and set all things right," and so I left the coat with him; he said they did not wish me to stop - I said I did not want to stop: they desired me to be careful how I went out, that no one should watch me home; I believe I said I should be careful of that for my own sake; he said I was not to tell any one where he lived, and he was not to tell any one where I lived. I saw no more of him after that day till he was in custody - he did not tell me where his friends lived: I have heard him say he had a mother and brother, and, I think, sisters. The coat had been cleaned all over before I lent it to him; my son lives with a doctor - the coat was cleaned, as the person who gave it to him wore it when brewing, and it was stiff with sweet-wort; it was cleaned all over. I never took the razor out of the case after he himself had put it in at my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner came to lodge with you in October? A. I think it was then; he went by the name of Edwards then - he did not often go out of an evening: they were both strangers to me before. While he lived with me in Wootten-street he used to be at home all day, and seldom went out; I do not remember his going out before I lent him the blue coat, not half a dozen times, as he had no coat to wear; he said nothing more about the newspaper than I have mentioned, while I was there - nothing passed about it at breakfast. When he lived with me in Wootten-street I believe he sent for a paper once or twice, on a Sunday; I do not know how he employed himself - I was seldom in his apartment. I understood from him that his parents were respectable; he could read and write - I lent him a book or two. I had taken the coat in at the back and side seams, after it was cleaned - I cannot say how long ago that was; it was stiff with sweet-wort; my son cleaned it with a piece of blue cloth and water: it was his practice to sit in the house without a coat, as he had none to put on, and after I lent him one he used to sit at home without it; I observed nothing particular about his clothes on New-year's day - I did not particularly notice them. My son lives with Mr. Guest, over Blackfriars-bridge. My husband died on the 12th of January, 1827 - the razors belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Q. While the prisoner lived with you, had you received directions to deny him to any one? A. Not from him; Charlotte has told me to deny her if anybody came, and said then that would deny them both - she said that in his hearing. I never heard him say at that time that there were reasons for his keeping out of the way.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at the coat now, and tell us if you can say anything has been done to it since you lent it to him? A. I cannot say that I particularly noticed that; it is not in the same state now as when I lent it him - it is dirty: I cannot say whether it has been sponged at all; I never looked inside the sleeves.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old. My mother sent me to the prisoner with a razor, in a case, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210022"></xptr>a silk handkerchief, on a Sunday - I do not know on what Sunday - it was after Christmas, and before Newyear's-day; that was the only time I ever carried one - I gave it into his own hand - he was in bed, and Charlotte was up in the room; it was about four or five o'clock in the evening; it was a black-coloured case - I had often seen it and looked at it - I think I should know the case again - I did not know the razor - I saw the case before the Magistrate, and had seen it before - it was my father's(looking at it) - I believe this is it; I think it is, because it is very much like it in the shape and colour - there is no mark by which I know it; two or three parts of it are uneven; I had not observed whether my father's case was even or not; the part the top went over was red, and so is this; I often had my father's razor-case in my hand - I did not particularly notice it when I carried it to Jones; I had seen it about before; I believe this is the same razor-case, but I will not be certain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Why this razor was a play-thing of yours, I suppose? A. No, not often; my mother never gave it me to play with - I had it in my hands when I went to get it for my father to shave; he had been dead twelve months - I have not often seen it since then; I know it by no particular mark - the colour is black - it is very much like my father's razor; I had seen it the morning I took it to Mitre-street, and on Saturday night; I took it there about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon - it was candle-light; I did not look at it as I took it there.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Had you seen the razor that belonged to your father? A. Yes, I think he had such a razor as the one produced.</p>

            . I am twenty-one years old. I have gone by the name of Charlotte for the last two years - I never went by that name till I left my home; I have been acquainted with the prisoner for five months before he was taken up; I lived in the same lodging with him over the water, by the Cobourg Theatre; I lodged with him at Mrs. Williams' about two months, in Wootten-street; we then went to Windmill-court, and lived together, then she moved separately, and we moved; Jones lived with me all that time: he went by the name of Edwards - I used to be called Charlotte Edwards. On the 31st of December I went out, about seven o'clock in the evening, with Jones - we came over Blackfriars'-bridge; I parted with him in Bridge-street, about Bride-lane; we had neither hurried there, nor walked slow; he met me again about half-past twelve the same night, in Fleet-street; it was my practice to meet him there about eleven or twelve o'clock every night; I met him that night about Poppin's-court, a few yards from Fleet-market, on that side of the way - he came in a direction from the Strand - I had no money when we went out that evening, and I do not think he had any; he did not say where he was going; when I met him he told me he had been with a friend - that he had been with a young man, a friend, and had borrowed some money of him - he said it was 2s. or 3s.; he did not say where he met him, or where he had been with him; I had got no money then - a young woman was with me when I met him - we went with him to a wine-vaults, in Poppin's-court, and had some gin - he paid 6d. for it; we then went home; we got home about one o'clock; I think a female lodger up-stairs let us in; we lived then in Mitre-street, at Mrs. Stapleton's.</p>
               <p>Q. The following morning would be Tuesday (Newyear's-day) - do you remember any thing happening then? A. Mr. Jones got up; he had breakfast, and went out about eleven o'clock - he returned a little after three in the afternoon with some more money - he said he had been to borrow it of a friend - he did not tell me how much he had - he gave me 5s. - I got some of my wearing apparel out of pledge by his direction, with 3s.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he went out that morning did any thing happen? A. As we were sitting at breakfast he said he had cut his thumb - that was on New-year's-morning - he said he had cut it in cutting bread and butter - it was cut up by the nail; I looked at it - it was a deep cut, and looked very red, as if fresh done; he held it against his handkerchief, and asked me for some rag; I told him I had none, and he wrapped his handkerchief round it; it bled again in the afternoon, and he wrapped some white tape round it, which I afterwards put on a dress. which I afterwards pawned, and it was produced before the Magistrate; he did not dine at home that day - we went out that evening, and called in Wootten-street, at Mrs. Mills' - he sent her for some gin, and produced some silver to pay for it - I cannot say how much, for Mrs. Williams and I were talking together - the gin came to 6d. - we then went over Waterloo-bridge, to the Adelphi theatre, which was so full we could not get in, and we went to the Olympic; he had said he should like me to go to the Adelphi to see a play called Nelson - I had wished before to see it, and he wanted to take me there that night, but we could not get in; he said nothing more about it that night, but that he thought it was a good thing; we went to the Olympic, and when we came out we went into the Strand, and had some supper in a court there; he paid for every thing - I had no money - the theatre cost 2s., and the supper 1s. 4d. - after supper we met a friend in Fleet-street, and went to the same winevanlts, and had some gin again - we got home at one o'clock- it struck one as we were in the New-cut. Next morning I washed some things belonging to us both - there was a shirt of his, a collar, and the handkerchief which he held his thumb against, a waistcoat, and a pair of braces (looking at the waistcoat produced) - this is the one I washed; I did not observe any thing particular on it; I was in the habit of putting things in quick, into a little pan - I put the shirt and waistcoat in together, and observed no stain on them, except a stain on the shirt sleeve, which I had observed him make myself, with pickled cabbage; it was about here (pointing three or four inches below the elbow.)</p>
               <p>Q. This was on Wednesday morning, the 2d of January? A. Yes, that I washed; I had been out on the Tuesday afternoon, a little after three o'clock, and when I returned, a little after four, found him lying on the bed, on his back, crying - I asked what was the matter; he said he had heard bad news since he had been out - that his father was dead and buried on the Wednesday before; I asked who the friend was who told him of it; he said nobody that I knew; he did not say where his friend lived; Mrs. Williams came on Wednesday morning, and breakfasted with Mr. Jones; I had none myself - I had asked Mrs. Williams to come to the fire - she said No; I was offended, and had no breakfast - I had been out before she came, and she opened the door to me when I returned - this was about eleven o'clock; Jones had sent me to get a newspaper.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210023"></xptr>Q. What newspaper was it to be? A. Any but Sunday's, I believe; I did not get him one; he was displeased at that, and words passed between us, which was partly the cause of my taking offence. On Sunday morning Mrs. Williams came, and said something about people being after him; we remained at our lodging till that evening - I then went out first, and Mr. Jones came after me; I did not tell the people we were going away; Stapleton's little girl went out into the street to see if any one was watching after Jones - he knew that - this was before I went out - Stapleton did not know but I was going to return that night - I went on as far as the Surrey Theatre; Jones overtook me in about ten minutes; that is about as far from Mitre-street as Fleet-market is from the end of Wych-street; he left me; I walked about some time - he met me again, and I went with him to sleep at a house in the City - it was a house for the reception of women; Jones went out in the morning - I met him again on Monday night; he and I were together all that night in the streets, and on Wednesday night: I saw him on Saturday morning - he promised to meet me that night, but never came; I waited; a young man came, and I was taken up; Mrs. Williams used to come and see us after we left her house; she lent him a coat and handkerchief; it was a coat her son's master had given him; she lent him a razor; I did not see any case to it in Mitre-street, but I saw one in Wootten-street; the way I noticed the case was this - she took them up-stairs to him, and asked him to sharpen them, and told him to choose which he liked from them; they all went away together in Windmill-court, and at night he wanted a razor, and could not find one in the bustle of moving, and this was sent to him by the little girl; I was dressing when it was brought, and did not notice whether it came in a case; I do not recollect seeing the case any where but in Wootten-street; a case was shown to me at Bow-street; I recollected it again, by its being rather freckled and dark, and turned up a little at the small end of it; I thought I knew it again, and that it was the same I had seen in Wootten-street; Jones used to shave with the razor; I never knew him do any thing else with it (looking at the razor produced) - this is the one he had in Mitre-street; there were two alike.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the case, is it the case you saw before, at Wootton-street? A. By what I can recollect, Sir, Yes; I do not know it by any particular mark, but by its being freckled here (pointing to the narrow end); we stopped at home all day on the last Sunday in the year; we had no money to buy the necessaries of life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. COLERIDGE. Q. When you first became acquainted with the prisoner, did he go by the name of Edwards or Jones? A. Jones; we did not take the name of Edwards till we went to live in Wootten-street - we have always been called Edwards since; I heard him say there was a reason why he should go by a false name; he used to go out in the day-time at first, but not often, when we lived in Wootten-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met him the last night in the year, how do you know it was after twelve o'clock? A. Because the wine-vaults we went to were shut up; I do not think the bells were ringing when I first met him, but I do not know; I think I heard St. Bride's bells when I was going home, over Blackfriars'-bridge; that was after I had been into the wine-vaults; I believe they begin to ring at twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in Jones' manner when you met him? A. No; he seemed more cheerful than he had on other nights; I perceived no hurry or agitation in his manner; there was a light in the wine-vaults; he had no bandage round his had there; I saw nothing particular about his clothes; I saw him pull them off when he went to bed; I noticed nothing remarkable about them; nor in the morning - there was nothing about his hands; there was no stain at all till I saw his thumb at breakfast-time, when he said he cut it; I saw no spots of blood; as we sat at breakfast he was cutting bread and butter - he put down the loaf, and I saw his thumb directly; he had had the handkerchief before, but I saw his thumb quite red, as if it had been bleeding.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say when he had cut his thumb? - A. Cutting the bread and butter at that time; he wiped it with his handkerchief - it seemed as if it had been bleeding.</p>

               <p>MR. COLERIDGE. Q. Did you see him sponge his coat that day? A. No; he put it on to go out, after brushing it down with a shoe-brush - it had been sponged, but not by him - Mrs. Williams had sponged it for her son, before she lent it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. On New-year's night he wished you to go and see the performance at the theatre; what made him wish you to go? A. I had heard it was a good thing; he mentioned to me on the Thursday or Friday afterwards, that he had been there on the Monday night, and said he had seen Nelson and some Pantomime, and mentioned Mr. Yates, Mr. Watson, and several other persons, who were in it; the shirt and waistcoat which he wore, were what he had worn on the 31st; I washed twice a week, sometimes but once - that was my general day for washing; he was often in the habit of sending me for the newspaper while I lived with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he sent you on this day, did he tell you to get any particular paper? A. No; over the water they lend out newspapers at so much an hour, and he said, "Try and get a paper if you can, in the same way as they used to lend them in Wootten-street, for I must have something to read:" this was the first time he sent for one at that lodging, for we only went there on Friday, and had no money to spare before: as I could not get a paper, I got him a novel that day, at the corner of New-street, facing the Cobourg theatre; he read it all - it was not returned till the Saturday night; I have been kept at Mr. Furzeman's since, and nobody from Jones has been to see me; Mr. Williams and Mr. Henson came up the other evening - I did not know they came from him; Mrs. Furzeman and the servant-girl were present all the time - I think it was on Tuesday evening they came; Mr. Williams lives in the Old Bailey - he used to keep the Globe tavern; that is the way I knew him; Jones' friends are very respectable, from what I have heard him say; I remember hearing about the murder, and saying his friends had sent the officers after him; Mrs. Williams came up and said, "William, I have got bad news to tell you;" she said the Bow-street officers were after him: I said, "What for?" she said, they said Oh, they could break into any house for murder; I said, "No, he has done no murder - it is his friends after him:" I then said to him,"For God's sake go home, and stop them from sending after you;" he said he would go home, because we did not want Mrs. Williams to know any body was after him; I know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210024"></xptr>Mrs. Mills - I remember telling her about getting my things out of pawn, and what money he got for me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever see this umbrella before? A. Yes, in Mitre-street; Mr. Jones brought it there on Tuesday afternoon, the 1st of January; when he told me he had been to see the Pantomime, he said he was treated by the young man who lent him the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say whether he went with the young man or alone? A. No; I supposed he went with him, as he said he was treated - he did not say whether he waited till it was over; he told me who acted, and said the scenes were beautiful; it was half past twelve o'clock when I met him, for the wine-vaults were shut; the female knocked, and we got in.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that week, when he came home with more money than usual, did you pay for your lodging? A. Yes; I paid 3s. on the Tuesday afternoon when he came home, and 2s. on Friday. I had paid 1s. earnest when we went, as I had borrowed 2s. 6d. of Mrs. Williams; Jones gave me the 3s. to pay, and I pawned my frock for the 2s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you observed his thumb before he said he had cut it? A. No; I did not see him cut it; but while he was cutting bread he put down the loaf, and said he had cut it. I cannot be sure whether he did cut it then or not; it was red - I did not see blood come from it at that time, for he had it some time to the handkerchief; he put his thumb against the handkerchief, as soon as ever he said he had cut it, and, after some time, he shewed it to me, and I saw it was red; there was no mark in the bed as if it had been bleeding in the night.</p>

            . I live at No. 35, Mitre-street. The prisoner first came to lodge with me, on the 26th of December; the witness, Charlotte, took the lodging. On Monday evening, the 31st of December, I heard them go out together, as usual, between six and seven o'clock; I did not see them go out, but heard the feet of two persons; they left their candle on the stairs, as usual. I was in bed when they returned; my husband let them in - I think it was a little before two o'clock; it might be half-past one. Charlotte paid me 3s. on the Tuesday, and 2s. on Friday; she had paid 1s. when they took the room - it was let at 6s. a week. I saw the prisoner between twelve and one o'clock, on the 1st of January; he had and umbrella. On Sunday, the 6th of January, between four and five in the afternoon, Mills called and enquired for Mr. and Mrs. Jones; I knew nobody by that name, and said there was nobody in the house of that name. I heard a voice on the landing-place; I could not tell whose voice, but Charlotte came down; she wished me to send my little girl to look out to see if any one was standing round the street. I did so; she was to go from the top of the street to the bottom. Jones was at home at the time; he could not hear the conversation between me and Charlotte; I should think, Charlotte went away in about and hour. The child was sent out a second time by Charlotte's desire, and she wished me to look out also. Jones went away about ten minutes after Charlotte; when he came down, he asked if I would do him the same favour: Charlotte had asked me to look out the same for him. I said I would; the favor was to look out for him, and I did; I went to the door and said there was no one there but my neighbours: he told me not to speak so loud - before that he asked if Mrs. Edwards was gone out. I said Yes; I told him she was gone up towards the Crown public-house. I saw nothing more of either of them, till they were in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. While they lived with you, was it their practice to go out of an evening? A. Yes; they used to come home between eleven and twelve o'clock; I do not think I was in bed above one night when they came home; I was sitting up with sick children.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Were they ever so late as on the night of the 31st of December? A. No; they usually came home about eleven o'clock - between eleven and twelve.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear them come home on the night of the 31st of December? A. I heard them knock at the door; we had a sick child; I was sitting up in bed with a child I have ill.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the habit of letting them in? A. I let them in three times, and had to get out of bed; they generally came home after my hours.

            . I live at No. 31, Wootten-street. On Wednesday, the 2d of January, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, Charlotte and Jones called on me; they said they were going to the theatre, to see something about Lord Nelson performed; they asked me to have something to drink. I said No; I had rather not; upon that the prisoner threw a crown piece down on the table; my daughter fetched a quartern and a half of gin with it, and gave the prisoner the change. Charlotte said, "What a had job it has been for me, on account of pledging my friend's coat; he went out yesterday and got me 2l.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she mean? A. Jones, the prisoner, had got her 2l. and she said, I have got this gown, and this shawl. out of pledge, and paid my rent. I asked what rent it was. she said 6s. a-week, and she paid it before it came due, for fear she should not have it again. I called at Stapleton's, in Mitre-street, on Sunday, the 6th, about five o'clock, and asked if Mr. Jones lived there - I had heard his name was Jones, but nothing farther. Mrs. Stapleton called out, and asked if there was such a person there. I described Charlotte, and she said no such person lived there. I called again afterward, and they were gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When she said what a bad thing it was that she had pawned his coat, did she say any thing more? A. She said she had pawned it for 10s. to pay the washer-woman's bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say, "for he is not able to go out among his friends?" A. She did. I only saw 5s. produced.</p>

            . I am an attorney, and live in Clement's Inn. The prisoner was in my employ, as clerk, in July last. I know his hand-writing (looking at three letters.) This letter, marked A, is his writing; it begins,"My dear Charlotte;" this one, marked B, I believe to be his writing, from some part of it; it is not written in his usual hand, and I am not so positive of it; it is a feigned hand - I cannot he positive of any part of it, but I have a belief of its being his - the words, "Jones is not the murderer," is like his - I have a belief that there is a great similarity, and the name "Goodman" is his writing, but is not his usual character; it appears to be a disguised hand - I have a fixed belief of it being his writing. This third letter marked C, I can speak to from his signature - the second is not signed. I wish to be understood as not speaking decidedly to the second letter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I presume there is a considerable difference in the hand-writing? A. Certainly; some parts of the second letter, are so like his, that I believe it to be his, and no doubt it is all written by the same person. I believe it to be feigned, because some parts are not like his. I do not swear it is his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had received that letter in the ordinary way, should you have acted on it as Jones's letter? A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>The letter, Marked A, was here read, as follows:-</p>
               <p>"MY DEAR CHARLOTTE, Giltspur-street.</p>
               <p>"I embrace this opportunity of letting you know my situation, by a person who has offered to call for me. All I have to beg of you is, not to let a single soul know of it but yourself. I shall go up to the Hall to-morrow; I don't let a single soul know; if you come ask for Wm. Edwards."</p>
               <p>MR. PLUMBE re-examined. I saw the state in which the deceased's body lay; in my judgment she could not have come by her death by her own hands.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I feel confident of your attention and favourable consideration of the few words I have now to address to you. If now, for the first time, you learned the charge against me, my situation would be one sufficiently alarming - but how much more frightful is it in consequence of the spreading throughout the country of details which have excited universal indignation; I will mention only one instance of the misrepresentation with which my name has been associated; at the very time when the bill against me was before the Grand Jury, a man was engaged near the Sessions-house, proclaiming with a horn the infamous story that I had made a full confession of this murder, and had committed suicide in the House of Correction. I might complain also of the way in which every little circumstance has been turned to my prejudice, but that I am willing to believe that a desire for justice was a part of the actuating motive - and am firmly convinced you will lay aside every thing said out of Court. From the first moment when this charge was brought against me, I have denied it; would that I could with equal truth declare myself guiltless of all other offence, but I feel that I am obliged to make my own misconduct a part of my defence - whatever may have been my errors, however, the slightest thought of murder never crossed my mind. I owe it to an aged mother and other friends, whose minds have already bled too much for me, to declare that I am guiltless of this charge. Thrown amidst the temptations of the town at an early age, my life was wild and dissolute - dissipation led to crime, and at the time when the offence with which I am now charged was committed, I had not only other charges to fear, but knew that a charge of forgery had been made against me, and thus it was that I fled at the approach of the officers. With regard to my examination before the Magistrates, I beg to say that many questions were put to me; I admit, however, that I did make a statement before the Magistrate, but it is not true; and thus, in order to avoid suspicion of one crime, I was obliged to confess to others. One of the presumptions against me is, that I was intimately acquainted with the unfortunate deceased; I solemnly declare, however, that I saw Mrs. Jeffs but four times in my life: the first time I saw her was at the house of her son, Mr. Knight, in Anderson's-place, Cornwall-road - the second time was at his house in Cursitor-street, when she told me she had invited Mr. Knight's daughter and my sister to take tea with her, and she asked me to accompany them; the third time I saw Mrs. Jeffs was when I accompanied Knight's son and his sister to the house in Montague-place: the last time I called with Knight alone, and believe he alone went into the house. I never saw Mrs. Jeffs after the month of July last; Knight and I went together to Montague-place, when he went into the house, I believe, to ask for money - I saw her upon that occasion, which was some time in last July, and I never saw her after. I took the name of Edwards to avoid detection, knowing that I had unfortunately rendered myself liable to the law, in consequence of what I had done at Mr. Duncombe's; under such circumstances, I should have been more than insane to have gone to Montague-place, where most likely I should have been refused admittance. As to my dress, and the circumstances of suspicion attached to the coat, I am enabled, on the clearest proofs, to answer that part of the charge. Mrs. Williams has a son employed by a surgeon who resides in Blackfriars-road; that gentleman gave him a coat which was damaged, and the stains upon which were said to be occasioned by blood - in my distress I borrowed this coat, and unfortunately for me, the very worst construction was put upon a circumstance purely accidental; in the same way the blood upon the shirt-collar was made use of as a proof against me, and the waistcoat was said also to be stained with blood; as to the stain upon the collar, what becomes of it when it is proved in evidence that I cut my thumb, and tied it with tape, which is marked with blood? So little did the circumstance of cutting my thumb occupy my thoughts, that when I was questioned about it by the officers, I totally forgot how or when I did it, and said it was done cutting wood. With respect to the razor-sheath, I beg leave, my Lord and Gentlemen, to draw your particular attention - I trust you will examine this part of the evidence carefully, and say if any one could swear to a razor-sheath, of which there are hundreds, of a similar make and description, sold daily in the metropolis; it is a common razor-sheath, and has nothing whatever about it to mark as peculiar: with respect to the edge of it being notched, I can answer it - one day, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210026"></xptr>I was alone in Mitre-street, sitting in a state of melancholy, quite unconscious of what I did, I cut the razor-sheath bit by bit, with the razor, and flung them into the fire. I am most anxious to satisfy you as to where I was on the evening of the 31st of December - Mary Parker and I left home that night, and proceeded together to Blackfriars-bridge; I went to the gallery of the Adelphi Theatre in the Strand, and remained there till the performances were over - I then joined her in Poppin's-court, soon after twelve o'clock; the bells of St. Bride's were then ringing what they call the new year in. It has been said if I was at the Theatre I could prove the fact, but it was impossible for me to do so, situated as I then was. It is not pretended that I am a hardened murderer, and if not, is it likely I could be cheerful as usual, and have supported a falsehood by bringing Mary Parker to the Theatre? My possession of money, soon after the commission of the offence of which I am accused, is another charge against me - I am here obliged to remind you of my own delinquencies; I had by a criminal act obtained a supply for my pressing wants; and here, Gentlemen, I must do justice to the unhappy woman who lived with me, by declaring that she was totally unacquainted with many of my offences, and that I carefully concealed them from her. - There is one point I cannot pass unnoticed, I mean the letters said to be written by me in prison - the first letter I wrote - the second I know nothing about, and the third was written under these circumstances: - Mr. Vickery came to me in prison, and asked if I knew a Mr. Morris, who I understood had called at the prison; I recollected a person of that name, at the White Lion public-house, Wych-street, and under that impression I wrote the third letter. Gentlemen, without another remark, I leave my fate in your hands, under the impression that you will throw aside any prejudice that may have been excited in your minds against me. The man who is dishonest may not be cruel; the thief may shrink from the crime of murder, and I can with truth declare that this has always been the state of my mind; no propensity to cruelty, or desire to commit violence on any human being, ever entered my mind among the many evils I have committed. I do solemnly declare before God, that I am innocent of the crime of which I am now accused.</p>
               <p>JOHN SELLS. The prisoner and Charlotte came to lodge with me about the middle of August, and left the middle of October; they were nine weeks with me, and then went to Mrs. Williams'; while with me he had a newspaper nearly every morning, and was always anxious about it; my daughter generally fetched it for him.</p>

            . I am a chemist, and have a shop in Blackfriars-road. Nicholas Halford was in my employ; I gave him a blue frock-coat, which I had left off wearing some time, but my servant wore it when he brewed; it was stained with wort all over when I gave it to the boy - I am not aware of any other stains, but possibly there might be, for when I am in London I dissolve camphor myself; it was most likely stained with muriatic acid, used with spirits of wine in dissolving camphor, but I have so many coats which I use on that occasion, I cannot say whether this was one, but it frequently happens to my coats; the wort would make it feel very stiff and clammy, but it is easily washed out with soap and water; I have no doubt this is the coat - I can perceive, from the feel of it, that saccharum matter is now in the cloth.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long ago did your servant wear it to brew in? A. It has been worn in March and October, for the last two or three years: we did not brew last year till near Christmas, I think - he wore it then; I gave it to Halford within a few days of Christmas: saccharum matter does not stain - it gives it a clammy feel; muriatic acid stains: I cannot see any such marks on it now; camphorated muriatic acid would take out the colour entirely.</p>

            . I am Mrs. Williams' son, and live with Mr. Guest; he gave me a coat - there was no spots on it, to my knowledge, only beer; I sponged it all over about a fortnight before I lent it to the prisoner; I used a great deal of water, and rubbed it with a piece of blue cloth all over, all about the skirts and sleeves.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You rubbed it all over? A. Yes; I lent it to him about two months ago - I had had it a fortnight or three weeks.</p>

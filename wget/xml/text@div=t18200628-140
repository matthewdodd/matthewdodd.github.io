I asked if that was the lowest - he said he did not wish to be hard, and would take 11 s. I asked where he lived, and his business - he said he made them himself. I thought the price was lower than it ought to be. He gave me the name of</p>

He said he should be that way again in a few days - I paid him 11 s. and we parted. I knew the hand-writing on the paper which enclosed the goods, having dealt with the prosecutors. After receiving a second parcel of goods from him I went and informed the prosecutors.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police surveyor. Beechey gave the prisoner into my custody on the 30th of May. I asked where he got the horns which he sold Laurie, he said he had them from John, at Dickenson and Arnot's warehouse. I asked how he came to go to their premises, after being ordered by Mr. Dickenson not to go - he said he should not have gone if John had not called to him - that John called him out of Allhallow's-lane, and he waited in the warehouse while John went and got the horns. I then asked how he came to give Mr.

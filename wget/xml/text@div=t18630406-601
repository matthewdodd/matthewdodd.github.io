I am in the employment of Mr. James Jarvis, a shoe<lb></lb>maker, of 12, Church-road, Stoke Newington—on Friday, 27th February, about a quarter to 11 in the morning, Price came into my master's shop, and said he wanted some boots sent to Mr. Young's, Lion Cottage, and that; Mr. Young was in a hurry, and wanted them sent off directly—he then left, and my master gave me four pairs of boots, and sent me with them—I went towards the address given, across a place called Thirty-acre field, and saw both the prisoners there leaning on a post—they then went on before me, and just after they got to the engine-house they asked me if I was not the lad who was going to Mr. Young's—I said, "Yes," and Knapton said he</p>

               <p>was going right past there, and he would show me where it was—I then went on with them; they took me up a turning, and said that would be the nearest way round—they took me to a place called Cut Throat-lane, and then Price turned round and asked me for my bag—I said I would not give it to him, and I began to holloa, and Price said if I did not hold my tongue they would run a knife through me, and he asked Knapton for the knife—they showed me the knife—both of them struck me three times—I held the bag, but they snatched it away from me, knocked me down, and then ran away—I got up, holloaed, and ran away—I saw a policeman, and told him what had occurred—these two pairs of boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the boots I had—I know them by the mark, and the French nails in the heels.</p>

I gave the prisoner an account of freight to deliver to them - this is it (looking at it); he afterwards went to receive it; it was his duty to receive a cheque from the house, and bring it to me, or to Brumwell or Dare, my clerks, in my absence; they receive all monies from the other clerks in my absence; but if I was in town, which was the case, he should deliver it to me; he did not bring me a cheque for this account; it was his duty to do so before he went home; every clerk, except two, made their accounts up nightly; he remained with me till the 6th of June, and then absconded; I had two sets of bills printed to have him apprehended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You would have been satisfied if he had brought the money home? A. Yes; but his duty was not to present a cheque for payment - he has not brought this amount to account.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he generally account to you? A. Not for the Hamboro' wharf concern, he never paid me money for that concern.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLSON re-examined. I have two places of business where he might account, Hamboro' wharf is where he should have brought this cheque, my other place of business in Mill-lane, Tooley-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not employed by both concerns? A. Sometimes. He went from Tooley-street that day, and was at both places most days; he generally accounted for monies at Tooley-street, but not always, I think.</p>

            . I am constable of Ramsgate. I apprehended the prisoner there on the 15th of July, at his lodgings. I said, "Well, Master Richards, what brings you here?" He said, "Are you an officer from London." I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150081"></xptr>said, "I am an officer, but not from London, and that I took him for robbing his master" - (he was passing by the name of Smith, and told me his name was not Richards.) I cautioned him to say nothing, but he said, "I shall feel relief in stating to you the whole transaction;" he stated the kindness of his employer, and the bad company he had been led into, and said he was extremely sorry, and asked what would be the end of it? but he wished to unburthen his mind; that he had robbed his master, and whether he said it was under 100 l. or 120 l., I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Horsemonger-lane Prison, July 18, 1825.</p>
               <p>DEAR HENRY, - This comes with all my kind love to you. I hope you are well: since the unfortunate day I left, your house is in my sight; and when I was in it I little thought it would be my doom to be one of them; but I hope you have never stopped out one night since. If I had my time to come over again I would never stop out another night: there would be a difference in my character; but it is now too late for me to repent, for I am sure Mr. Wilson will prosecute to the utmost extent of the law: why should he not, because I have robbed him of money to a great extent: but if I should not be prosecuted I shall pay him by instalments. I have had several fits since I was taken, but am happy to what I was before I was taken. For God's sake I hope they will not prosecute for my family sake, for I am the first who was ever inside a prison. The portion is bread and water, but I cannot smell it - the very sight makes my blood turn again; but I don't want, thank God; but I ought not to mention his name. If I had taken my dear grandmother's advice, and that gentleman, whom I have robbed to that great extent, I should be as happy as the day is long, but now to be shut within a cell, fast bolted up, and high walls well secured, and when I saw Mr. Willson and Mr. Davis, I never felt such a sensation before; I sweat blood from the arm-pits. I wish I could recall my time again and alter my conduct, and if I should get off, that will be a warning to me, and I will warrant you I would never do what is wrong again. If you will call on me between twelve and two o'clock, or write to me, and tell me whether he intends to prosecute. I desire, Henry, don't look at my spelling, for I have been in such a dreadful sensation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a compositor, and live in Furnival's-inn-court, Holborn. On the 14th of June, I and a witness met the prisoners in a house in Drury-lane—we went home with them—I had a sovereign, two half-crowns, and one shilling—there was a sort of closet in the room, to which I went with Ellery—Sullivan was sitting outside in the room with Jones—I had before that sent Sullivan for some ale and wine—I had taken a glass of ale—I do not recollect taking any wine—I was sober—I staid in the closet with Ellery about ten minutes, and then Jones sent Sullivan a second time for wine, and he went with her—during their absence I dis<lb></lb>covered I had been robbed of a sovereign and a half-crown—I went to the door to wait for Jones and Sullivan to return—when they returned I did not say any thing to them, but waited till the policeman went by, and I gave Ellery in charge—she denied it—I said, "If you give it up there shall be nothing said about it"—she cried, and said she had taken the money and given it to Sullivan—the sovereign was picked off the ground by the policeman, where it appears Sullivan threw it, and the half-crown Ellery gave up in the station-house, with a shilling and some copper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was called in, and Hickey gave Ellery in charge for robbing him of a sovereign—he said nothing about the half-crown there—Ellery said, "All the money you gave me I gave to Sullivan"—Sullivan then said, "Perhaps it is on the bed, I will go and look"—I went in and got the quilt and sheet off the bed—I then heard a chink—I looked and found a sovereign, which I believe came from Sullivan's hand—I saw her hand move—at the station-house Ellery gave up a half-crown, a shilling, and some half-pence.</p>

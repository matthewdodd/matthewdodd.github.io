Mr. Peacock frequently missed several sacks of flour, and at last suspecting the clerks intrusted in sending out flour and keeping the accounts of it, he taxed them with the defraud, upon which they confessed very plainly to him, that they had for sometime been in the habit of sending flour out of his house, and selling it under price to the prisoner: upon this they went before a justice of the peace, where the two clerks, Gilbertson and Wareham, confessed these facts, Gilbertson was admitted an evidence, and bound over to prosecute Wareham for the felony, and also to prosecute Smith the prisoner at the bar as an accessary to that felony in receiving the goods. Upon the trial of that indictment in Surry, Wareham was convicted, and Mr. Peacock now comes here to have that justice done against Mr. Smith, which has already been done upon Wareham. This case, now before you, being for receiving goods knowing them to be stolen, it is not necessary in the trial of an accessary to state all those facts over again which were proved on the conviction of the former prisoner; yet this case is so very particular, that you must have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100068"></xptr> the same facts told you that were told on the former trial in Surry; but although this case depends on circumstances, and on the guilt confessed by the parties, yet, those circumstances and that guilt are so explicit, that there can, I think, remain very little doubt in your minds that the prisoner is guilty. The fact, among many others which I shall select for your consideration, in order to fix upon the prisoner the offence with which he is charged is this: I shall prove to you, that on the 1st of August last, six sacks of flour were taken in Mr. Peacock's cart by Mr. Peacock's man to Mr. Smith's house in <placeName id="t17831210-36-crimeloc204">White-Chapel</placeName>

I shall prove that by the evidence of the man who carried it, and also by the person who assisted him in the delivery; I shall also prove by Mr. Peacock, that there was no entry in his book of such sacks being issued from his warehouse, which is the usual way when the trade is a fair one, and conducted by clerks, not for their own benefit, but that of their masters. I think when these facts are proved by Gilbertson the clerk, and that the prisoner who dealt with Peacock paid but half the value for these sacks of flour, you can have no doubt but the prisoner bought this flour knowing it to be stolen, and that it was not flour he bought of Mr. Peacock in the common way of trade.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>You live in the Borough I believe, Mr. Peacock, and deal very largely in flour, and keep a large wharf for other people, as well as yourself? - Yes, in the latter end of June, July, and August I was kept in doors with the gout, and in the course of that time, I lost about 140 sacks of flour; some was my own, and some what I had as a factor; I began to be very uneasy when I got about again, I accused my two clerks, Gilbertson and Wareham, and they confessed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Council. You must not tell us what they said, unless this prisoner was present. - The prisoner was present at the time when they confessed it; I took them into the parlour, and as soon as ever they confessed they had sold this flour to Smith, I went with a friend and brought Smith to my own house, he denied it at first, but afterwards he owned it, and said he was willing to pay for it. They owned to selling Smith about 18 sacks of flour, or thereabouts, and after the prisoner heard what they said, he then said he was very willing to pay his share; that he had bought the flour at a guinea a sack, the same flour that cost me two guineas, and that he was very ready to pay his share of the money back again. He paid me two guineas a sack himself for some that I sold him in a fair way.</p>
               <p>Have you looked at your books, and seen whether there is or is not an entry of any flour delivered to Mr. Smith the first of August? - There is a memorandum I gave that gentleman just now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. That paper cannot be evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reeve. No, I offer it only that he may look at it, and refresh his memory.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. This circumstance cannot affect the man at the bar, it may affect the clerk, who should have made the entry.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not think it evidence to go to the jury, the jury must judge only from facts that are within his knowledge; you may leave it to the jury whether they will presume this was a fair sale at a guinea, when he bought the same sort of Mr. Peacock at two guineas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reeve. Then I am not to ask him whether there is an entry on the first of August.</p>
               <p>Court. You may ask him as to his knowledge of it. - I know of none after the 26th of July; he then bought five sacks the first of August, he charged one sack.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I know you are in very great business Mr. Peacock, very great indeed, therefore your business is not conducted by yourself, but by your clerks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100069"></xptr>You was ill ten weeks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then that flour was sold, was not sold by you, but by your servants? - I sold some.</p>
               <p>Therefore you have no: knowledge of any corn of any flour sold by yourself after the 26th of July? - No.</p>
               <p>They might have sold it and not made an entry you could not tell you know? - No.</p>
               <p>While you was ill you was obliged to trust to your servants. - There was none booked much after that time.</p>
               <p>Your clerks, though they have turned out bad, yet they have dealt and sold to a great many people. - Not to a great many.</p>
               <p>They have not always entered what they have sold fairly. - I do not find any misentries.</p>
               <p>There have been some sold to others, I suppose? - I cannot find where the flour is gone.</p>
               <p>Gilbertson himself had the power of selling your flour, and receiving your money for you. - Certainly.</p>
               <p>What was Wareham? - He was the clerk that used to look after the carts and keep the books.</p>
               <p>They were both concerned in a fair way of trade, in selling your property and receiving your money. - Wareham seldom did.</p>
               <p>Now who should I have applied to if I had come and you was ill, I should have applied to your servant, to your clerk? - The general rule was, they used to come in to me.</p>
               <p>But suppose I had met him at the market? - He would have sold it.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Silvester. Your way of examining would be very good, if the prisoner was indicted with the man who stole, because, if you could shew it was not felony in the principal, it certainly would not be felony in the accessary; but in this case here is a conviction of the principal; and is not a conviction conclusive evidence?</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I believe I, as councel, may controvert that conviction; there is a noted case in Foster, the case of Daniel and Egan.</p>
               <p>Court. I wish to see it; it is a nice and subtle distinction, because it is a general principle of law not to permit evidence to be given against a record. (Looks at the case.) I see the authority goes the full length of what you say; I am satisfied with it; it is an exception to a general rule of law, and the reason is very accurately given by Mr. Justice Foster, because the record is conclusive only against the party to that record: therefore you may certainly go on with this examination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. My Lord, I have got the fact I wanted, that these are both clerks intrusted by Mr. Peacock to sell his property and receive the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reeve to Mr. Peacock. You say Wareham had not that authority which Gilbertson had. - He very seldom received money, and had no authority to send goods out of the yard.</p>
               <p>Court. Wareham and Gilbertson were both in your employ, Gilbertson was clerk and book-keeper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was Wareham's particular employ? - To look after the carts, and take the orders in, and send the goods out.</p>
               <p>He was in fact principal carman, that was his particular province. - He has some times received little sums, but it was not a part of his business, his business was entirely to look after the carts, and manage the wharf business.</p>
               <p>Had Wareham any authority to sell things out of your warehouses? - Yes, to common customers.</p>
               <p>Then he was so far intrusted, that if customers sent and Gilbertson or you was out of the way he might sell? - Yes, he has many and many times to pastry-cooks and others, little orders.</p>
               <p>Now Gilbertson during your absence conducted the business land had authority to sell? - Yes; when I am well I always go to market myself.</p>
               <p>Court. If these goods were stolen by any body, it is very strong evidence that this man received them knowing them to be stolen; and I am of opinion, and it has been ruled over and over again, and is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100070"></xptr> every day practice; that for and through in with the custody of his master's property, and to whom it is intrusted for custody only; or for carridge, or for any other special purpose disposing of that is felony; the trust or posed in the servant does not take it out of the principal trust, the property rerfle us; unaffected but that vase seems to be very materially by different from this where a servant is entrusted to sell, and then contrary to that trust sells at an inferior price, and does not carry the money to account.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. It is a gross fradd to be sure.</p>
               <p>Court. What is become of Gilbertson? - He is admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. Why he is the most guilty man of the three.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reeve. He was admitted an evidence to convict the other clerk.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, I am very sorry in this case, though a gross fraud, that the law cannot reach this defendent upon this indictment, as an accessary to that fraud; That no desire of bringing offenders to justice must induce us to transgress the principles of Law.</p>

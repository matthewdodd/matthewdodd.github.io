                  </hi>. I am 12 years old, and live with my father at 3, Caxton Place, Regent's Park—two or three weeks ago the prisoner met me between 6 and 7 p. m., and asked if I knew Cooke's, the wine and spirit merchant—I said "Yes"—he said "Can you take a message?"—I said "Yes"—he gave me a penny and this piece of paper, and said "Don't go up Albany Street way, go down Portland Street;"</p>

I am a greengrocer—a little boy brought this paper to my shop—I sent the goods by our lad Daley about 8. 30—he came back and made a statement, in consequence of which I communicated with the police and with Messrs. Bruce and Farr—we often execute orders by procuration in that way—I asked no question.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by Mr. Cooke—Bruce and Farr have been our customers five or six years, having the same articles—on 2nd January, between 8 and 9 p. m., Mr. Cooke gave me some brandy and wine in a basket to take to Bruce and Farr's—I met the prisoner—he said "Are you from Cooke's?"—I said "Yes"—he said "Are you going to Bruce and Farr's?"—I said "Yes"—he said "They are waiting for the wine, they have sent me down for it"—I said "Have you got anything to carry it in?"—he said "No"—I lent him the basket, and asked him when he would bring it back; he said "In the morning"—I did not know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. It was dark when I gave up the basket—you came in an opposite direction—Mr. Cooke sells apples, oranges, and biscuits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I walked from York to London, and was hungry—I met a friend who promised me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a meal, lodgings, and a situation—he asked me to take the note, saying it was for provisions. I opened it, and seeing nothing about provisions I felt suspicious and gave the boy the same instructions as I received, and waited for the answer, which was that the shopkeeper would send them. I took the answer to my friend, who gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some bread and cheese. After waiting 10 minutes, he said he would go to the shop himself, and he went in that direction. I have always borne a good character.</p>

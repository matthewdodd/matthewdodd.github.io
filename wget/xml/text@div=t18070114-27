               <p>THOMAS HOLDING. I live at No. 16, Church street, Islington, my wife is a laundress, she washed for a family in Pater noster row. On the 2nd of December I brought this basket of linen from my house and left it in <placeName id="t18070114-27-crimeloc179">Half-moon street, Bishopsgate street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18070114-27-crimeloc179" type="placeName" value="Half-moon street, Bishopsgate street"></interp>

I returned, and took the basket from Half-moon street to Pater noster row; when the linen was taken out there was a shirt and a sheet missing; the bill was in the basket. I returned to my wife, I asked her if she was sure that she had sent all the linen, she said she had; I told the person in Half-moon street that I had lost a shirt and a sheet during the time that I left the linen there, and suspicion fell upon the prisoner at the bar; she was nursing the person's wife in Half-moon street where I left the parcel. I challenged the prisoner with it, she denied it, I traced the pawnbrokers and could not find it; I was obliged to pay for it one pound twelve shillings. On the 29th the prisoner was taken up for another robbery, she was in the Poultry counter; I went to her there, she confessed that she took them, and that the duplicates were in the lining of her stays at her lodgings. I went to her lodgings, and found the duplicates as she told me. I went to the pawnbroker's and found my property.</p>

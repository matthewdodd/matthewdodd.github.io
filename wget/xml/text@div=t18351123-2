On the 15th of Oc<lb></lb>tober, I was there last, and saw my property safe—when I am not there, the house is locked up—on the 15th of October I locked the house up myself, and kept the key in my own possession—the win<lb></lb>dows and every thing were secured—on the 30th of October, in con<lb></lb>sequence of information, I went to the cottage and found a pane of glass, or part of one, taken out of the parlour window, the shutters un<lb></lb>fastened, and the kitchen door open (that is an outer door at the back of the house)—the shutters were merely unscrewed, not broken—I am certain</p>

In consequence of information, which I received, I went on Saturday the 31st of October, to a house at Windsor—the prisoner Prior came in with a bag in his hand. at a quarter before three o'clock—Buckland was with a cart at the door, I had seen Prior take the bag from the cart—Buckland was in the cart—there were two baskets standing in the shop—It was a silversmith's and jeweller's shop—I asked Prior if the baskets were his—he said they were—I went to the door and made a motion to my brother constable, Sims, who was with me, to take Buckland, and I took charge of Prior's—I asked him where he got the things—he said he bought them at Uxbridge mar<lb></lb>ket—I have some of the property here—Prior's direction was on the cart in chalk, "Thomas Prior, Iver, Buckinghamshire"—I went to Uxbridge to make inquiry, and then I went to a house at Iver, and there saw church—he opened the door to me—I saw a woman there, whom I understood to be Prior's wife—I had seen Church in company with the others, that morn<lb></lb>ing, before this occurred—Iver is seven miles form windsor—I took all the three prisoners into custody—I heard what they stated to the Magis<lb></lb>trate—It was taken down in writing.</p>

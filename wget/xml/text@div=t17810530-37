On Sunday last I had three guineas and an half, a gold ring, and some silver; the gold ring was put into my purse with my money. I had four guineas which were left me by a relation: I changed one, and had three and an half left, and some silver. I took a hackney-coach in St. Paul's church-yard to go to Shadwell: the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300037"></xptr> was in company with me. I went to Paget's, a spunging-house, the sign of <placeName id="t17810530-37-crimeloc173">the Three Tuns, in New Gravel-lane</placeName>

I was not very sober: I was a little asleep in the coach. When I awoke, I found the prisoner putting my purse into my pocket. When I came home, I missed my watch: the watch was returned to me by the prisoner; he said he had taken care of it for me. When I came home, I examined my purse; and my money was gone. When I charged the prisoner with taking the money, he said he would enter an action against me for scandling him.</p>

On Sunday night the 27th of September, about eight o'clock, I was coming from Mill Hill, coming through the Hale to Edgware; I called at the Green Man at the Hule, and the prisoner was there and another man in company with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before. - A. Yes, many years. I did not know the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. But you said another man was in his company at the Green Man. - A. I did not notice that then; there was another man with him when I was knocked down. The prisoner saw me pull out my money to pay the reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any talk with him while you were with him. - A. Very little talk, I was there only a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you liquor there at the Green Man. - A. I had part of two pots of beer amongst two or three, that is all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one that drank with you. - A. He did drink out of the pot.</p>
               <p>Q. What liquor had you had before you came to the Green Man. - A. I left the public house at Mill Hill at two o'clock. I had a little beer there, nothing to hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in your opinion - what quantity of ale may you have drank there. - A. I cannot rightly tell, I was not disguised in liquor but what I knew the person that knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you left the Green Man. - A. Near eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when this happened to you. - A. At a place called the <placeName id="t18071028-16-crimeloc78">Gravel Path field, between the Hale and Edgware</placeName>

               <p>Q. Is there a public road through that field. - A. A public foot path.</p>
               <p>Q. You were by yourself, was you. - A. Yes; when I was walking in this field the prisoner came behind me and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him before he knocked you down. - A. No, I did not see him till I was knocked down; there was another man with him, I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he knocked you down. - A. I knew the prisoner, I did not know the other.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see the person that struck you till you were knocked down. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done to you when you were knocked down. - A. The prisoner bound my arms down while the other picked my pocket while I was on the ground. They never spoke; they took three pounds fifteen shillings out of my pocket; I had taken the money not all of one man, but at different places; I had two one pound notes, three seven shilling pieces, four half crowns, and four shillings; I had not long taken it that day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were so robbed what became of the men. - A. The prisoner ran away back the same way he came; I saw him run; the other ran behind me; I screamed out murder, I was very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did the other man go. - A. I never saw the other man go away; he was behind; I never saw him go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure your money was in your purse when you left the public house. - A. The notes were loose in my pocket, and the money in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the gold and silver were in one pocket, and the notes in the other. - A. There was one seven shilling piece wrapped up in a one pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when you found yourself robbed. - A. I went home directly to Edgware.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not turn back after the prisoner. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the Hale at this time, from where you were robbed. - A. I do not think it was half a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go back after the prisoner when it was so nigh. - A. I was so nigh home as I was to the Hale; he lived at the Hale, he was a farming man. The next morning I gave information to the patrol; I went to the justice at Edgware the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him that you knew the man that had robbed you. - A. I did, the same night; I knew his name and his person.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner again. - A. When I took him. The patrol and I took him on the same spot where he did the robbery; he was coming through the same field.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched when he was apprehended. - A. He was searched in the Crane at Edgware; a half crown and some halfpence was only found on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you knew nothing of that money. - A. No; the notes were not found nor the gold.</p>
               <p>Q. This you say was about eight o'clock at night - what sort of a night was it. - A. It was a kind of star light night, not moon light; I could see his face so as to be sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the blow that knocked you down stunned you. - A. No, I was not stunned.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you was quite sober when this happened. - A. I was a little fresh, I was not drunk; I am quite sure he is the man that knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood. When you went from the Green Man you acknowledged you was a little fresh. - A. Yes; I was not drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. When he met you coming across the field, did not he tell you that he heard you had accused him of the robbery, and he was coming to you. - A. He said he heard that I had swore the robbery against him, and I had not; I told him he was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect telling him this - No, Davey it is not you; I thought so last night, but now I know it is not. - A. I said no such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a man of the name of Budge with him. - A. No; there was a man of the name of Blake going by.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect telling him that the ostler at Mill Hill was the person that robbed you. - A. I did not say no such thing; there was another man brought up; I told them to let him go, I had no suspicions of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect saying that a man of the name of Hurst robbed you. - A. No; they brought that person up; I saw Hurst at the Plough; I told them to let him go, he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you said any thing relating to Hurst that had caused the suspicion of his being one of the men. - A. I had mentioned it by his colouring so at the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before he was brought to you. A. Yes, I saw him at the Three Hammers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. You know there is a share of forty pounds if this man be convicted. - A. I do not know any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard so. - A. Yes; I did not take him for the sake of that.</p>

            ; he told me the prisoner's name that robbed him; we went up to the Hale; as we were going we met the prisoner in the Gravel Walk field. Fenn told me he was the person; I took him in custody. We went to the Hale in the first place, from there we went to Mill Hill; the prisoner was searched at Edgware.</p>
               <p>Q. What took you to Mill Hill. - A. Fenn said he thought the ostler at Mill Hill was the other man. When we went to Mill Hill it was not the man he expected; the man was out, but they gave sufficient proof where he was the over night; he afterwards saw another man, he said he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. He first mentioned that he thought the other man was the ostler at the King's head; then he mentioned another man; than man was brought, he said it was not him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He never expressed any doubt about the prisoner. - A. No; I searched the prisoner; I found only two shillings and six pence in silver, and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood. Did you see a man of the name of Lake. - A. Yes, he met us in the field, before we met the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Then he had an opportunity of hearing, little or much. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect hearing the prisoner say, I hear you have charged me with a robbery. - A. He mentioned some words about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prosecutor replying something in this manner - I thought so last night, but I do not think so now. - A. I do not recollect these words.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drinking in the public house with these men, at the sign of the Green Man; there were four men drinking with me before the prosecutor came in with another man; they called for a pot of beer, they asked me to drink out of it; I did; the prosecutor pulled out sixpence and paid for it; when the pot was out he called for another and paid for that; before the pot was out the company all went away but one man that lodges in the house; after they were gone I drank once out of that pot, and then I went home to my father, who has been bad this half year; I carried him to bed and sat down by the fire till near nine o'clock. When I came out of the public house, I left the prosecutor in the public house; the landlady and he was having some words. As I was setting by my mother's fire she asked me to fetch her some beer; I fetched a pint and a half from the Green Man; the prosecutor was gone, I did not see him any more then On the next morning going to my work I met a man of the name of Budge, he said I was the man he wanted to see; he said Fenn was robbed last night, he had been to the justice last night, and said it was me; I said I was innocent. I immediately strikes off to Edgware to meet the prosecutor; I met him and the patrol together, and a man of the name of Lake; I said Mr. Fenn I hear you charge me with robbing of you last night, he replied he thought it was me, but he knowed it was not now, but he could swear to the ostler at the Kings head, by his leading him down the lane, to shew him the footpath to his home; after meeting of them in the fields. we went to the Green Man we had two pots of beer; there was a man of the name of Hiams there. We were telling him of the circumstance; Hiams asked him whether I was the man, I immediately told him he had charged me with the robberry; Fenn heard me; he told me to say no more about it, I was not the man. We went to Mill Hill to the man as he said, led him down the the lane to shew him the path, and that had robbed him; we called in at the Three Hammers. Hurst was in the Hammers eating his breakfast; when we went into the house, the prosecutor says, I think Hurst is one by his countenance; he did not say any thing to Hurst then, but went to Mill Hill and enquired for the man that took him down the lane. When we came to the King's Head the man was not at home; he then said that Hurst must be the man. Hurst was brought to the Plough, the landlady of the Plough at Mill Hill said Hurst was not out of the house from seven o'clock till ten. They brought me from the Plough to the Crane at Edgware, where they searched me; they found but two shillings and sixpence in my pocket, and a shilling of that I had borrowed of my sister; the patrol knowed that.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did any body shew you the foot path leading to your home. - A. The prisoner did; he came down the lane with me, he said keep along the foot path, that will take you to Edgware; I said, I know that.</p>

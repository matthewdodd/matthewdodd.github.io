On the 24th of August, while I was up stairs, I heard my wife cry out murther; I ran down and saw all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them,) lie on the floor in the shop; my wife informed me that a man who was running away without a hat had robbed her; for he had left his hat in the shop; I pursued him as far as Beech lane; he turned and looked at me; I knew his face; I had seen him before; when he came to Beech-lane I lost sight of him; I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>On the 24th of August about eleven o'clock I went to the next door to get change for a shilling; I had my eye on my own shop all the time; when I returned to my door the prisoner was coming out with a bundle of things under his arm; I asked him what he had to do with my things, he said d - n you you b - h they are none of yours; I said they were mine and hawled them into the shop, he knocked me down and said he would do for me; we both fell on the floor, his hat fell off, he got up and ran off without it.</p>

               <p>To Mrs. Clarke. How long might the scuffle between you and the prisoner last? - Ten minutes; I knew him well before; there were many people about the door; I asked why they did not stop him, they said they thought it was my husband and me quarrelling.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman E</hi> 707). On the 10th April I was with two other detective constables in plain clothes in Cheapside when my attention was attracted to Hills, who was in charge of a barrow loaded with shirts—we followed him to several warehouses—he is in the employ of a shirt dresser and so collects goods from the warehouses he goes to—I fol<lb></lb>lowed till he got to Silver Street, when he left the barrow in charge of a boy. took his bag out of the barrow as" it is (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and went to Alder<lb></lb>manbury, Messrs. Lecky's, linen manufacturer—he stayed a few minutes.—when he came out he had something in the bag, which he placed in the front part of the barrow—we followed them to Ely Place, Kingsland Road, where Saunders lived, No. 4—the boy then left the other prisoner, Hills, and went into 4, Ely Place; Saunders came out with the boy and spoke to Hills—the boy was taken into custody at the time but was discharged at the police-court—Saunders came straight up to the barrow, Hills was standing on the barrow; they had some conversation—for-somd-minutes—Bowman was standing near, a few yards off at the time—he was not actually in conversation; the two men were in conversation by themselves—during the conversation Saunders continued to look up and down the road—I saw Hills lift up something in the front part of the barrow, which no doubt was the sack, and take out this parcel, a blue paper parcel, which turned out after<lb></lb>wards to be this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and hand it to Sauuders—Saunders placed it under his coat and hurried into Ely Place—I did not see where he went; I did not see what house he went into; the other officer followed him—there are several marks on this parcel—Hills was taken into custody and Bowman, the boy; he was afterwards discharged.</p>

I was with Westwood and Child, and I saw what happened—i saw Hills give Saunders the parcel, he stooped down, shoved it under his coat and ran into No. 4 with it—there is no truth in the suggestion that he put it in his apron—we went to the top of the court when Sauuders left his door and came up to me—he said "Holloa gov'ner!"—I said "Bill, where is that parcel that you just received of this man here"—he hesitated some time—I said "Iknow you have got it, for I saw you take it of this man"—he said "Come along gov'ner I will show you"—I took the key out of his pocket unlocked the door, and I went in and looked round the room and said "Where is it"—he pointed to a coal cup<lb></lb>board which was shut—I unfastened the cupboard door, and in the cupboard lay this parcel—there was nothing in the house like this—there might have been a very few coals in the cupboard, perhaps a peck or a few more—I asked him how he accounted for possession of the parcel—he said "Igot it of Hills"—I then told him he would bo charged with receiving that parcel well knowing it to be stolen"—he said "Idid'nt know it was stolen."</p>

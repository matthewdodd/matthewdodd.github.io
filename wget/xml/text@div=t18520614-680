                  </hi>. I live at Oxford-street, Islington. On 15th May I was at a public house at Blackheath, playing at bowls with two friends, from 4 o'clock to 7 or 8—when I began to play I took ray coat off, and laid it on a seat at the bottom of the bowling green—about two hours after I began playing, Dixie, a flyman, came in, and said something to me—we left about half past 8, in Dixie's fly, and I left my coat behind—I did not look for it before I left—the prisoner went on the box of the fly with the driver, and I and my friends inside—when we had gone about 300 yards I missed my great coat—I told Dixie I had left it behind, and he said he would drive us back—the prisoner could hear that, and when we got back he said, "Don't trouble yourself about it to-day, you had better come down on Monday and look for it"—I went into the bowling green with Dixie, but could not find my coat—we left the prisoner on the fly box, and when we came back he was gone—I then gave information at the police station, went to the railway station, and while there a police sergeant came to me—I went with him to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stand, near the station, where Dixie's fly was, and the coat was found in my presence in the sword case—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I had then left the fly a quarter of an hour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What time did I come into your company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say precisely, it was between 6 and 7 o'clock—I did not see you go out of the ground before we left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am horsekeeper at the Sun public house, where Syms was playing at bowls. Between 7 and 8 o'clock I saw the prisoner bring out the coat, and put it in the sword case of Dixie's fly.</p>

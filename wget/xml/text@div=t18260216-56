            . I am the prosecutor's son. I remember seeing these skins, all safe, about eight o'clock the night before - there were at least thirty dozen; I went there again next morning, and nearly all of them were gone - the wall was broken through between the loft and Mr. Austin's - we went to him, and he said he knew nothing about them, but he would ask his boy - my father and I, and Austin's boy, went in search for the prisoners - we found them together a little way from the house; they appeared to be quite intoxicated - Mr. Austin's boy said,"They are the two;" my father took hold of one, and I the other - we brought them back to Mr. Austin, who accused them of taking the skins - Edwards said, "Yes, we have taken them;" he then asked them where they had sold them - they said they would show us, and took us to a Mr. Joseph's, in Petticoat-lane - we found him there, and asked if he had bought any skins - he said he had not, but he did not know whether his son had, he would call him down - the son said he had bought some skins of the prisoner that morning, but he did not say at what price - Edwards said he had taken one lot first, for which he had given him 16s., and sixpence for himself - and he told him he would fetch him some more, which he did, and received for them 22s.; this was said in presence of the other prisoner; Mr. Joseph said, "I can't say any thing to it, you must talk with my father," and went up stairs again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Peppercorn, and keep his books. The prisoner was in his employment—it was his duty to account to me or Mr. Peppercorn for the moneys he received the same day—I make out the invoices; it was not part of the prisoner's duty to make them out—this</p>

               <p>second invoice of 28th March is the prisoner's writing—goods were never sent out without an invoice, and the invoices were always made out by myself—I did not deliver the invoices to the prisoner personally; they were given to him with the goods—I did not receive 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the prisoner on 14th March, and I therefore debited Mr. Cordwell with that amount in the invoice that I made out on 28th March—the prisoner never accounted to me for either of the three sums in question—on Friday, 30th June, I was out in the back premises in the evening, and the prisoner came and asked me if I could do a little job for him—I asked him what it was—he said, "You know the amount of Mr. Cordwell's bill, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and some<lb></lb>thing; I have been unfortunate enough to lose it, cannot you manage to put 'Paid' to it in the book, and take it of me at so much per week?"—I said, "No," I would not do anything of the kind; I told him if he had lost the money, he had better tell Mr. Peppercorn—the following day I asked the prisoner if he had spoken to Mr. Peppercorn about it—he said "No," he had not, and I directly went and told him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer and cheesemonger, at Deptford. The prisoner was in my service eight or nine months—it was his duty to take out goods, and if the customers paid, to receive the money and account for it on his return, either to me or my young man Davies—he did not account to me for these three sums—on Saturday evening, 1st July, Davies informed me of something; I made some inquiries, and after having satisfied myself I gave instructions to the police to apprehend the prisoner—he had then left me—I discharged him as soon as I found out that he had robbed me.</p>

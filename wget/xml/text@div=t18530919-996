                  </hi>. I am a publisher, carrying on business at Nos. 97 and 100, St. John-street, Smith field. Parker was in my service about two years—Sadlier was a canvasser—Parker was clerk to superintend the canvassers—he had been a canvasser himself, but was promoted—his duty was to give the canvassers certain districts to go over, to obtain orders for various publications, and when obtained to enter them in the order book, and re-enter them in the delivery book, so that the deliverers might go to the parties, ascertain that they had given such orders, make checks on Saturday night, and hand to the canvassers, which they presented to the cashier in the counting-house—they then received the money, and we supposed they were receiving the money for <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> orders—they received a commission, which varied according to the extent of the work—the canvassers reported the orders to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185309190040"></xptr>
               <p>Parker—he entered them in the order book, transferred them into the delivery book, and sent the deliverers to the persons who were supposed to have given orders, to ascertain whether they had been given; and on their reporting that they were genuine orders, it was Parker's duty to make out checks for the commission, when a portion of the goods had been delivered, or the parties had said that they were genuine orders—the goods are delivered periodically as published—the checks were presented to the cashier—it was Parker's duty to enter the orders in the order book, then in the rough delivery book, and then in the permanent delivery book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were not entered there till it was ascertained that the orders were genuine—it would not have been in the course of business that any check for the commission should be given till the names had been entered by Parker in the permanent delivery book—from something I had heard, I gave Parker into custody; I believe it was on 18th June—I saw him searched, and this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was found upon him—it is Parker's writing—this other paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) has initials in Parker's writing signed at the bottom of it—it is a copy of the other paper, in a different writing, but the initials to it are Parker's—the body of this other paper is in Parker's writing; it is a check, dated 17th June, for 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is the commission for these other two papers—it is payable to Sadlier, and signed by R. Sadlier, as having received it—this other check (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Parker's writing; it is on 28th May, and the initials to the list are his—here is another, the same; the body of the check is Parker's writing, and the initials to the list—here is another, the 6th May; another, the 23rd April; another, the 30th; another, the 23rd; another, the 15th; and another the 9th April—they are all the same.</p>

The first of these lists of names produced is in Parker's writing; all the others are in Sadlier's—these are the names of persons who are supposed to have given him orders, and on which he was entitled to receive commission—the lists were handed to Parker, and it was his duty to give a check for the commission—here are about fifty-three names in these lists—I have searched through the rough delivery book, and the permanent delivery book—there are three names out of the fifty-three entered in the delivery books—they are entered in the order book as if they were real orders—they all appear there, and are marked; up in that book as genuine orders, the persons having received a certain part of them—all orders are entered first, as the canvassers give them in, but afterwards they appear in the order book; and supposing them to be delivered, they should be entered in the delivery book—I find these are ticked off by Parker, as if they were entered in the delivery book—I am correct in saying that there are only three of them entered in the delivery book—they all appear in the order book, and are all ticked, as if they were entered in the delivery book—I have referred to the rough delivery book as well as the permanent delivery book, and there are only three of them in either of those books.</p>

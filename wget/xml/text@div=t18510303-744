                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, at Amelia-place, Fulham-road. Last Saturday night, about eleven o'clock, I had four hands, three loins, three legs, and two heads of pork, on my stall-board, outside my shop—I laid them straight, went and called the boy from the other end of the shop, and afterwards went out again, and saw the prisoner there, and she asked me the price of the loins—I told her, turned to speak to a man behind the</p>

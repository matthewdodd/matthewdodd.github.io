                  </hi>. I am a custom house officer at Stepney, On Sunday morning, 3rd Sept., I was on duty at the bottom of Irongate-stairs—there was a steamboat; there was a barge beside the steamer—the prisoner was on the deck of the steam ship—he had a right to be there—my attention was drawn to the prisoner, who had conversation with the mate—I searched the prisoner—the mate asked him where he had been; he said he had been buying some stockings—I searched and found eleven combs in his pocket—these are them—also in another pocket, three boxes, and one in another—I do not feel certain about other things—I received these things from the policeman—there was a shaving box in his pocket—He said he had bought them—I went on board the barge—I found a port<lb></lb>manteau, and by it a package, broken open; it had been sealed and strapped; there was the name of Gosnell on the portmanteau.</p>

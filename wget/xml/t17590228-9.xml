               <p>Mr. Dodkill. I am concerned for my Lady Torrington. I was inform'd her house had been robb'd at <placeName id="t17590228-9-crimeloc54">Hendon</placeName>

There were two silver spoons missing, which is all relating to my Lady; the servants lost other things which they will speak to.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the spoons ever found again?</p>
               <p>Dodkill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell where they were taken from?</p>
               <p>Dodkill. The other witness can speak best to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live near my Lady's house?</p>
               <p>Dodkill. She knew the house very well; her sister had been house-maid to my Lady, but she is married away.</p>

            . I live servant in Lady Torrington's house; I lost a red cardinal, and a mahogany tea-chest, and a tea-spoon and cannisters belonging to it in it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them?</p>
               <p>Brett. On the 30th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they taken from?</p>
               <p>Brett. From out of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way do you imagine they got into the kitchen?</p>
               <p>Brett. I believe they got in at a window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your things again?</p>
               <p>Brett. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Brett. We suspected her, because her hat was found next morning on the lead that was just by the window at which she got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window in such a situation that she could get up to it?</p>
               <p>Brett. Yes, there is carv'd work on which she could set her feet and so get up to it; and she knew the house very well and bears a very bad character.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she live at the time ?</p>
               <p>Brett. I do not know.</p>

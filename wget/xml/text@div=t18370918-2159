                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and lodge at Mrs. Harker's. I received some money, and went to a public house when I came ashore from my ship with some shipmates—the prisoner came into the public house—I was holding a sovereign in my hand to get the change of the waiter, but he did not come in, and the prisoner said, "Hand here, I will go and get change for you"—he took it out of my hand and went out—I never saw him before, and never saw any more of him till about eight days after, when I charged him with it, and told him, if he would give me the sovereign, I would not say any thing about it—he said, a girl stole it from him when he went out—he never went to the bar to get the change, as I thought he was going to do.</p>

I am a shipmate of the prosecutor, and was with him at the public house—I was playing at billiards—the prisoner and prosecutor were playing also—we played for sixpence or a shilling—the prosecutor wanted change for a sovereign, and called for the waiter—the prisoner said, "Hand here, I will go and get change for you"—he took it out of his hand, went out with it, and never returned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner in charge—he said it was very hard for one shipmate to do such a thing to another; and at the station-house he said he knew nothing of the prosecutor, and that he never saw him before in his life.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 105). A few minutes before two o'clock in the morning on 28th May, I was in Holies-street, Marylebone—I passed the Rose and Shamrock public-house—I found the lower half door was ajar—I pushed it open, went in, and found the prisoner—he had got a light and had this paper of tobacco in his hand—I knew him before—I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Dan</hi>, what are you doing there?"—he said, "What is that to you?"—the light was put out, and the paper of tobacco was dropped—I went behind the bar where he was, and secured him—he made great resistance—I called the prosecutor, and the prisoner said to him, "Richard, you don't mean to give me into custody; I came here for half a gallon of beer"—the prisoner had neither coat, nor waistcoat, nor shoes on—I found behind the bar a piece of candle, and part of a lucifer match—I had seen the premises safe about ten minutes before—I had tried them.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the premises in Harris-street, in the parish of St. Marylebone—I know the prisoner—I was called up about two o'clock that morning by the officer—I had shut up the house that night at a quarter-past twelve—I was the last person up, to my knowledge—when I was called I found the prisoner and the policeman in front of the bar—they seemed to be very angry with one another, and were struggling—there was some tobacco left in the bar that night from filling some pipes—this tobacco produced is the same sort as that I left, and is about the same quantity—here may be an ounce—it is worth 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce.</p>

               <p>—he may have cleaned pots—I saw the prisoner outside the door at a quarter past twelve o'clock—he was the worse for liquor when he left my house, and he went to another house and got more—he was worse when I saw him again in my house—the top part of my door was locked, and the bottom part has a bolt and a latch, which cannot be opened on the outside—I shut the door in the usual manner—I did not notice it particularly—I did not observe any marks of violence on it, or any straining of the bolt at the bottom—the prisoner had not got this tobacco when I saw him—he was struggling with the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

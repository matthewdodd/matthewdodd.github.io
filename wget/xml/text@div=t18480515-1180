                  </hi> I lodge at Tottenham. On 25th April, about seven o'clock in the evening, I went to my lodging, and heard the prisoner, who lodged in the same house, abusing me, and saying he would do me an injury before he went away—I said nothing till his wife said, "That b—y Edward Cox"—I then said, "My good woman, do not say that"—in a little while I was knocked down, and was taken to a doctor, and examined—the blood came from my ear—the woman hit me twice—a policeman took her to the station, and the prisoner stopped behind, and waylaid me, and when I came out of the station he began kicking me, and said, "Now, you b—, I mean to finish you"—a gentleman jumped off the omnibus, and the prisoner ran away—I did not see him again till he was brought to the station, while I was having my head washed—I believe he was a little drunk—I had summoned him for an assault, and he had not paid for that—I believe he is an Irishman.</p>

                  </hi> I live at Stafford. On the evening of 25th April I was on an omnibus at Tottenham, about 200 yards from where this took place, and heard a cry of "Murder!" four or five times—I jumped down—the prisoner and another had got Cox down, and were kicking him about the body and face—I saw seven or eight kicks—he was covered with blood, and seemed insensible—they ran away—I took the prisoner in a garden, 600 or</p>

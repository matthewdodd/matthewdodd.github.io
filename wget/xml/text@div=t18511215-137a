                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife. I had lived with him between Stonehouse and Hastings—I had left that place and came to town—I took a room at Mr. Wickers, 7 Straits-mouth, Greenwich—I had lived there two or three weeks before 26th Nov.—I lived with a man there—on 26th Nov., between 12 and 1 o'clock, I came from my own room into Mr. Wickers' shop—while I was there my husband came in—I had not seen him from the time I had left Hastings—when he came in he said, "Here you are, are you, you b w?"—I said, "Don't make a noise here, let's go up-stairs and talk"—I went up-stairs, and my husband followed me into my room, the back room on the first floor—when he got in, he locked the door, took me round the waist and threw roe down, and bit a piece off my nose while I was on the ground—he then said he would serve me out for what I had done—he pulled me up by the hair of my head—he hurt me by pulling me up—he pulled me up altogether, by one hand—he took the poker from the fireplace, and gave me six blows across the head with it—he cut my head in six places—I tried to get out of the door—I did</p>

               <p>not scream out at first: I did at the last blow—the blows were in succession, one after the other—while I was trying to unlock the door, he kept giving me blows with the poker across my legs—he had said, while he was hitting me on my back, that he would break my legs—he hit me on the back after he had fait me on the head and before he hit me on the legs—I managed to get out of the room, for the lock was only put on temporarily, and I broke it off by force—I ran down-stairs and into the next house, and out into the yard—there is a fence in the yard—I do not think I got quite over the fence—that fence is adjoining to a lane—my head was bleeding—I saw a police-man, and he took me into Mr. Wickers' kitchen—the doctor was sent for, and he examined my wounds—my husband was sober—I had not struck him at all before he threw me down, I had not any chance to do it—I had not taken up the poker before he struck me with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Nelson-street, Green<lb></lb>wich. I was sent for to Mr. Wickers' on 26th Nov.—I examined Mrs. Sandford's head;—it was covered with blood; and on cleansing it, and washing the blood away, I found two wounds on the fore part of the head, and two on the hinder part—they were cut wounds, and were bleeding—one of them was large, about two inches long; one a very small one, and the other two a middling size—the long wound was on the fore part; it was not very deep—the wounds had been inflicted with a blunt instrument—I think they could have been inflicted with a poker—her left eye was bruised, from a blow of some sort—a small portion of the tip of her nose was bitten or torn off—I think that had ceased bleeding—it was a flesh wound—the wounds on the head were ordinary flesh wounds—flesh wounds are not dangerous under ordinary circumstances,, but they might become so from what might happen afterwards—there were marks of bruises on both her legs—I could not tell with what they had been inflicted—they appeared to have been recently done—there were several bruises on both legs, near the shins—perhaps the largest was about the size of a half-crown—they were the result of severe blows near the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would a fall do it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; there will always be a scar or a mark on the nose—it will always be observed—some part of it has been made good, and it may be made better—the wounds on the head were flesh wounds; the smallest was about half an inch—there were no par<lb></lb>ticular circumstances in this case to make them dangerous—the bruises on the legs were numerous, but not large—a small wound might produce a large flow of blood.</p>

            . I am a watchman of North Audley-street. I have seen the prisoner about the prosecutor's premises; Rolls let me into his house on the night in question - I had seen the prisoner in the early part of the night in Oxford-street, but not near the premises; he went up Oxford-street, came down North-row, and there I lost him; he and another person with a young woman before them - they might be about 20 yards from the prosecutor's; I knocked at Rolls window, and told him I had seen a man about - and went down to the cellar; that is all I know.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was taken up for this offence, but was not concerned in it; the prisoner came to me on Friday the 25th of April, and he came again on Sunday - he said he had been into Rolls' house the night before, and opened the cellar door, and went down; that he got up into the tap-room, and discovered a cloth before the parlour door window; that he lifted it up, and saw Mr. Rolls sitting in the parlour - he then made the best of his way out; that he took nothing that night.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to tell you this? A. I had met him in Oxford-street, I was in the habit of using this house - I did not mention this till I was taken up, I drive a horse and cart for Mr. Silvester a bricklayer; I left him on Easter Sunday, and have had no work since. I am now in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 2nd of May Mr. Rolls desired me to look for Lorter, I apprehended him at Lisson-grove; I went to see the prisoner in Tothill-fields in company with the prosecutor, and told him that Lorter had told me all about it - and about the handkerchiefs being taken, he said he had taken two handkerchiefs on the 25th; and pawned one in St. Giles' he took them out of the bar, he did not say how he got into the house - he said Lorter knew as much about it as he did, he mentioned nothing about the Saturday night.</p>

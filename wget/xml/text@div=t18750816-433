                  </hi>. I am a mason, and live at 31, Romney Street, West<lb></lb>minster—on the 7th July, about 11 a.m. I went to see my brother off from Waterloo Station, and I did not go to work that day—after that I went to Kew, with Mr. Young, the landlord, of the Brown Bear, Millbank Street—we got back from there about 10 p.m., and I and my wife, and some other friends remained at the Brown Bear till they closed, at 12.30, we then went outside and were standing having a few minutes' conversation, when the prisoner 391 B, came up and said "Clear the corner"—he was in uniform and on duty—I said "You will give us time to say Good night," and I had no sooner said so, than he up with his fist, struck me on the eye and knocked me down—my face was cut and I got up and went to the station, at Rochester Row, and reported him to the acting sergeant, whose name I believe is Geary—I have heard it since—I wrote my report on paper at a desk outside, and handed it to Geary—that was I should think three quarters of an hour after I was struck—Mrs. Barrow, my sister-in-law was there when I was struck, and my wife, and Mrs. Hallom and Mr. Washing<lb></lb>ton, I do not know the others—when I received the blow, three constables were standing on the opposite side of the street, by the White Hart, the prisoner had been with them—he left them to come across—none of my party were the worse for liquor—there were six or seven of us standing at the corner of the Brown Bear, but there was no disturbance whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no disturbance, no noise, and no screaming of women—we were standing there perfectly quietly, and without the smallest provocation he came up and struck me, he being in uniform at the time—my wife is not related to a man named Hicks—I have heard since that Hicks has been in custody for assaulting the police—my wife is a witness against a constable named Heavingham in reference to a series of assaults later on, she is actually prosecuting a police sergeant for assaulting her at a later hour in the neighbourhood of Vincent Square—I first went to the Brown Bear at 8.30 in the morning—I did not go to work at all that day, I stayed at the Brown Bear for two hours till between 10 and 11 o'clock—I was drinking during that time, I had a glass of ale—I then went to Waterloo station and from there to Kew and came back and went to the Brown Bear between 1 and 2 o'clock and remained there about an hour and a half—I also had some ale on that occasion, I cannot say how much—I then took a boat up the river to Kew—we only went into one public-house at Kew, but we stopped at one before we got to Kew—I had drink at both those public-houses—we got back at 10 o'clock and I then paid my third visit to the Brown Bear, but I went home first—I had beer again, I cannot say how much—I have said "I had been drinking during the day I cannot say how many glasses, not twenty I think," or something to that effect—I</p>

               <p>was perfectly sober—I am not in the habit of drinking twenty glasses every day—all the people with me were as sober as I was—I did not hear the pri<lb></lb>soner request the people not to make such a noise but to disperse quietly—I did not say to him "Mind your b----y business, you are only a youngster in the service, nothing of the kind; I only heard him say "Clear the women"—I did not say "I shall go when I like"—I did not see a lot of women crowd round the defendant and push him into a doorway, there was not a lot of women there, nor did I see them push him into a doorway—I did not see him trying to push through the women to get out of the doorway—when I was knocked down I felt inclined to return the blow, but they persuaded me to go the station and report him instead—I did not say "I want to get at the b----"—I said nothing to the prisoner when I was struck—it was a smartish blow, it cut my eye and knocked me down, but I never said a single word to him, I went direct to the station—my wife came into the Brown Bear about 10.30, but she did not stay, she came in and out; she did not ask me to go home, she came about twice—I did not say before the Magistrate-" It was a temperate day with me, I can almost swear I did not take twenty glasses," but it was a temperate day with me, I was not drunk—I used no offensive words to the constable—I know Hannah Brown, she is the wife of a cabdriver in Horseferry Road—I attended five times at Westminster—my solicitor is named Sampson and so is theirs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I heard last night that the Grand Jury have thrown out the bill against Hicks for the assault—the charge against Heavingham, was after I had made my report at the station—I was not present at the assault of which Heavingham is accused—I began to drink at 8.30, and the twenty glasses of ale extended right through the day—I took my ordi<lb></lb>nary meals and I include what I had with them—I did not take anything, with my meals in the boat—I do not think the glasses would come to twenty.</p>

I went to the Brown Bear, about 10.30 p.m., and remained till the closing of the house at 12.30, when we all came out together, and were standing at the corner wishing one another good night—there were three or four policemen opposite, and one of them came across towards Pizey, and said "Now then clear this here corner"—Pizey said "Allow us to wish one another good night" and he up with his fist and knocked him down—I advised Pizey to report the case at the station, instead of getting into any bother with the prisoner, and I went there with him and saw him write the report—he was sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was perfectly sober—this is the first time I have given my evidence in this matter—I went to Rochester Row twice, when the Magistrate was sitting, and was in court once, but was not called—I was with Pizey all day; I joined him about 9 a.m., and went with him to the Brown Bear, with a brother of his who was going to Fareham, and we saw him off—we drank at intervals; I may have have had three or four glasses, or four or five during the day, it was a long way from twenty or thirty glasses—I can't say whether I had as much as Pizey—I might have missed a turn—we were not on the spree, we went for an excursion on the river, not for the purpose of getting drunk—I mean, to say that there was no screaming, no noise, and no disturbance of any kind—the women were quiet.</p>

I keep the Brown Bear—I was one of the party that pulled up to Kew—there were five of us 'altogether, Pizey, Gill, Hallom, Washington, and myself—when we started none of us were the worse for the liquor we had taken—we called at one house going, and went to one at Kew, but called at none coming back—we may have had two or three pots of beer between the five of us, but for myself I had a little whiskey—the whole party then remained at my house—I cannot give any idea how much was supplied to them before we closed, but when I called "Time" at 12.25 they all left sober—I then heard a woman scream, and a wrangling at the same time.</p>

I have been in the force nine<lb></lb>teen years next Christmas—I was acting inspector at the station on the 7th and was there at 12.45 when Pizey came there—he was drunk—he said that he came to make a complaint against 391—I told him he could make his complaint if he liked—he walked into the office, staggered, and threw himself on the desk—I gave him a piece of paper and a pen, and in about a quarter of an hour he brought this statement back—he was excited and drunk and there was a streak of dry blood on his face—there was no wound from which blood was pouring, it was just a scratch, and the blood had run down about an inch; there was no sign whatever of a black eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said to the Magistrate "He fell across the desk at which I was sitting; I perceived he was drunk directly from his speech and manner; he spoke incoherently"—he could not if he pleased have written the paper where I was; I was sitting at the desk and I have only one desk—there is another room at the station with a desk and gas, he could have written it there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The defendant has been three or four years in that division—I have always found him temperate and quiet.</p>

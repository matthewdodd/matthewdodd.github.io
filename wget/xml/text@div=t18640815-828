                  </hi>. I am a carriage-builder, in High-road, Tottenham, and in partnership with my brothers—on 28th April the prisoner came to me and said he wanted a carriage—he selected a phaeton, and asked his man, who was with him, if he thought it would do for his little horse—the follow<lb></lb>ing day he sent a note by this man to let him have his chaise—he was to pay four guineas a me nth for it—I let the man have it, and about a fort<lb></lb>night afterwards they both called and asked about the price of the phaeton—they were driving in the phaeton at the time—I told him the price of it—up to that time I had received no money whatever for it—I have never received any money—it was worth twenty guineas—I saw nothing of the prisoner after that till he was in custody—I saw my chaise again about 20th July last, nearly three months afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a broker, in Horsemonger-lane—about the latter end of June last the prisoner brought me a chaise—a man named Shirley came with him, and said, "A friend of mine wants to borrow four sovereigns on a chaise; I know him to be a respectable man"—I said, "Is it his own chaise?"—he said "Yes"—the prisoner was the respectable man—I said I would not lend the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unless they gave me a receipt of the buying of it, the agreement being for a week or a fortnight—I said, "If you are in difficulties I will give you three weeks"—he was then to pay 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to me, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the standing of the chaise—he said it cost him 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the chaise was afterwards brought to me by the prisoner—Shirley said, "My friend has to meet a bill to-day, and he is deficient of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the prisoner said he was short of money—on that understanding I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I had a receipt drawn up afterwards—on 21st July the prosecutor saw the chaise at my stable.</p>

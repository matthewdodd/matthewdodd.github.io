I saw the prisoner and Coakley at work together at seven o'clock in the morning. I went to where they worked again at half-past seven o'clock - Coakley was blowing the forge fire; the prisoner took two pieces of iron out of the fire with a pair of tongs, which were to be welted together, they were six or seven inches long, he had them in his hand; the deceased came to strike them with the hammer to welt them - I heard no quarrelling between them. I then observed the prisoner poke one piece of iron at him. I cannot say whether it struck him or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to do it angrily or in a jest - A. I saw no appearance of anger, my Lord; the deceased was close by the anvil. A skirmish immediately ensued, and they fell, the prisoner undermost; I do not know what became of the iron. They both got up, and I separated them - I saw no blows pass then; I did not hear Coakley complain. After I had separated them the prisoner struck him with his fist, they then had another scuffle, and both fell on a chest under the bellows. I went away to work in another part of the premises, and left them scuffling - I thought they might fight it out. I returned in about five minutes, and saw Povey talking to Coakley. I told the prisoner I thought it very wrong to push the hot iron at him - he made no answer. I did not then hear the deceased complain.</p>

            , JUN. I worked at the manufactory. Between seven and eight o'clock in the morning a lad about thirteen years old came to me, and said Rothery and Coakley were fighting. I followed the lad, and saw them laying on a box under the bellows; the deceased then lay on the prisoner - his hands were under the prisoner's neck. I lifted the deceased off, and advised them in a peaceable manner to leave off.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any iron instruments about them then - A. The prisoner had his hand over a box which had old iron in it. Near the place where they fell there is an iron rod about three feet high, which is drove into the ground with a branch standing out, which has a point to it to hold a lamp on; this was bent nearly double. I supposed they had fell on it and bent it. Coakley did not complain of being hurt then. I left them sitting together.</p>

            . A little after six o'clock in the morning, I went into the smiths' shop; the deceased was then smoaking his pipe - the prisoner had a good deal of work to do, and could not get him to assist. I remonstrated with him on the impropriety of his conduct, and said if he did not assist he should go about his business; he then began to blow the bellows, and I went into the adjoining shop. The boy ran and said they were fighting. I rather thought it was a fit, as the deceased was subject to fits every week, and the prisoner had a great deal of trouble in rendering him assistance in these fits. I went, and found my son parting them; the prisoner was underneath on a box, with his head hanging over the box; the deceased was on the top of him, and appeared to be holding him by the throat. My son pulled him off; he took no notice of his being hurt. I tried all I could to persuade him to go to work, instead of which he went up into the hayloft. I was in the yard about half an hour after, and he came out of the loft. I asked him why he did not go to work or go home? he immediately went home; I took no notice of any thing being the matter then, except a bruise on the nose, which might be occasioned by the fall. I went into the shop to the prisoner, and saw that he had a black eye; he worked two years for my master, and was very attentive to the prisoner when he had fits: He was the most sober and the most humane man I ever knew.</p>

            . I am a student, and practice as a surgeon at the London Hospital. On the 1st of February the deceased was brought to the hospital. I found him sitting on the bed, stripped him, and examined his wound, which was above the groin; it appeared like a burn, as if it had been done with a hot instrument, about a quarter of an inch broad - he died next day. I opened him; the wound had passed quite into the cavity of the abdomen, and through two portions of the intestines. The inflamation produced by it was sufficient to occasion death; an inflamation took place in the bowels. The external wound appeared very slight.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you trace the progress of the wound into the bowels - A. Yes my Lord, it appeared to have been done with a blunt instrument; I did not observe his clothes or his shirt. If they had been burnt I think it would have struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. All the internal symptoms were those of inflamation, which might be occasioned by cold as well as heat - A. Yes my Lord, but there was the appearance of a dreadful burning; the part where it had penetrated was quite destroyed.</p>
               <p>Q. If a person received a wound of that sort, do you consider it possible for him to stand for hours on his legs, and struggle with his antagonist - A. It does not appear to me possible that he could stand.</p>

            . I am an officer of Shadwell. I apprehended the prisoner on the morning of the 2d of February at work. I told him I had come to fetch him, for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170009"></xptr>young man he had burnt the day previous was dead; he appeared a good deal affected. I took up a poker, and asked him if he stabbed him with that? He moved several pieces of iron which lay on the forge, picked out two pieces, which I produce, and said it was with a piece similar to those.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I do not know that I burnt him; I attempted to frighten him away because he would not work - I do not think I touched him with the iron. He hit me on the arm with his hammer, and I struck him.</p>

            ; we have been in the habit of losing large quantities of Spanish wool from those warehouses; the prisoner has been in my service, on and off, some time; he was in my service at the time he was taken; he was employed in the warehouse the best part of that day; we have lost to the amount of two or 300l. in two years and a half, or three years; he has been in our service nearly the whole of that time.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examination, he said, there is a warehouse in Hart-street, opposite Seething-lane, and another in Tower-street, that takes in Spanish wool; that they lock up the warehouse as soon as it is dark, except they are taking in goods; that it was locked up that evening about six o'clock; that he was there that evening about five or six o'clock, that he supposed the gate was shut that evening about half after five, or a quarter before six o'clock; that if a person had carried out a large parcel of wool at that time, he must have been observed; but that there are other ways of getting it out, through the windows that look into the street.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, in the city; I know the prisoner; On last Thursday evening, the 28th, between five and six o'clock, I was in Crutched-friars; I saw the prisoner come out of Seething-lane, with a pack at his back; he was between a run and a walk; he went across the road into London-street, and up the steps into another London-street; I suspected by his running he had got something he had not come lawfully by; Charles Phillips and I followed him: In London-street I observed another man going close to him; they turned down Fenchurch-street, towards Whitechapel; at the corner of Jewry-street, Aldgate, the prisoner pitched the bundle on the post, the other man then came close up to him; I crossed them, and went across Jewry-street, that turns down to Crutched-friars; again the prisoner took up the bundle, and went down Jewry-street, towards Tower-hill; about half way down the man that was with him went up to him, and said something, what I could not hear; then they immediately crossed Jewry-street into George-street, that leads into the Minories; I was on the right-hand side of George-street, and the prisoner on the left; the man who was with him came on the right-hand side; I crossed him, and looked him full in the face; he then went off, and we saw no more of him; the prisoner then went down the Minories, and crossed into Swan-street, which leads into Prescot-street, Goodman's-fields, about half way down, there is a dyer's there; the prisoner slung the bundle down, and we came up to him, and asked him what he had there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he knew that you were following, before he threw the bundle down? - A. I cannot say; he said he had got a bundle that a person gave him at the corner of London-street, and he was to have 28d. for carrying it; he did not say where he was to carry it to; I asked him what the bundle contained, he said he could not tell; I took him into custody; I then took a piece out, and said it was cotton.</p>

            Then if it had been given him at London-street, you must have seen it? - A. Yes; he had it before he came to London-street; he said he was to carry it to Church-lane; that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179512020070"></xptr>man that gave him the bundle was to meet him there, and give him 1s. 6d. and begged I would go there with him; we went with him to Church-lane; he pitched the bundle, and said, he was to wait till the person came for it; we waited about a quarter of an hour, to the best of my knowledge, and nobody came.</p>

            Whereabout was the weight of this load? - A. It appeared to be above fifty pounds weight; the way he went from Seething-lane to Church-street is, I suppose, half a mile about.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examination he said, he did not know that the other man was in company with the prisoner, till he saw him speak to him at Jewry-street; that he first saw the prisoner in Seething-lane, close upon London-street; that there were many persons passing when he pitched the bundle in Aldgate-street; that he did not know the man that was with the prisoner; that he was a constable, and had been sworn in about a month; that he did belong to the Police-office, but had left it; that the reason of his leaving it was, he had taken half-a-guinea of a black, who had been ill-used on board of ship; and that he had been ordered before the magistrate, and refused to go; that the prisoner went very readily with him when he took him.</p>

               <p>Pearson. - It is impossible to swear to wool; there is no mark, and it is impossible to speak to the matting in which it is packed; as to the wool, we never pack found wool in that way, only damaged wool.</p>

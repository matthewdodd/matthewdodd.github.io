The prisoner was employed as charwoman there—in Con<lb></lb>sequence of circumstances, I gave direction to a person to watch her; I received a signal from him, sent for an officer, and gave the prisoner in charge—she said she was innocent—she was taken to Bow Lane station—nothing was found on her—she gave her address in Leman Street, White<lb></lb>chapel; I went there with the officer, and found this two yards and a half of doeskin; it is worth 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I can positively swear to this being my master's property; I had recently cut from it—I had missed it on the Monday, and this was on the Friday—I also found this yard and a half of cord, and some other articles, which I believe to be my master's property.</p>

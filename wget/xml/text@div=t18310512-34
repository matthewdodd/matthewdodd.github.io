            . The prisoner Gibson was in my employ for eight weeks - he came to me about March; in consequence of information I examined my wine cellar and missed some port wine from a bin - there was a hole in the bin, which communicated to the ale-cellar - it was large enough for a person to put an arm through, and draw a bottle of wine out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What are you? A. A <rs id="t18310512-34-viclabel216" type="occupation">licensed victualler</rs>

               <p>MARK PEACOCK. I lodge at the Tallow Chandlers' Arms, kept by the prosecutor. A few weeks before the 9th of May I saw Gibson in my room - he brought up a bottle of wine, and Smith received it of him; Gibson took out part of the cork and left the other in - they drank part of it; they asked if I would have a drop of wine - they poured some into a tea-cup; I took half a tea-cup full Gibson then went down; I asked Smith how he came by the wine - he said there was a rat hole in the cellar, and they could put their arm through and take a bottle of wine out; I said, "You are robbing Mr. Smith of this wine" - he said, "Never mind, he is a d - d old rogue;" that was all I saw done that day, but I saw four bottles of wine brought up at different times - I told the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What day was this bottle of wine brought up, of which you say you partook? A. I cannot tell, it was about three weeks ago - Smith said it belonged to the prosecutor; I do not deny partaking of that, but I did not of the four bottles - I went before the Magistrate against these prisoners, but I was not charged with stealing the wine; I told the prosecutor of it about three weeks after I had partaken of it - seeing more wine coming into the room, I thought it my duty to acquaint him; I had talked to Smith, and advised him not to take it - it was red port wine; I do not know of my own knowledge where it came from - they did not say whether it was paid for.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any conversation with Gibson, as to where it came from? A. No further than hearing him speak in the room, and say it came from Mr. Smith's cellar - I am quite clear both he and Smith said that; it was after we had partaken of the wine - Gibson made no secret of it; he said in the room that he was going away very soon, and he would have a bottle or two more.</p>
               <p>GEORGE AVIS. I took the two prisoner into custody; as I was taking Smith before the Magistrate in the morning, he said he had received the wine from Gibson, the pot-boy, and the old man (Peacock) was worse than he was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was that in Gibson's absence? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Gibson's Defence. Peacock made me drunk two or three times, to get the wine - I kept telling him my master would miss it; he said, "Never mind, you are going away- it won't be missed; and if it is you will not be here to answer for it."</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. Peacock charges me for not correcting Gibson, when an old man like him did not correct him, but kept giving him liquor and money to get the wine.</p>
               <p>The prisoners received good characters, and one witness engaged to take Smith into his employ.</p>

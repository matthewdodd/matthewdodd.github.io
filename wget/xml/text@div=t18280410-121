I have dealt with the prisoner for years; he used to bring hats to us for sale. On the 29th of March, about five o'clock in the afternoon, he came and brought three hats which were ordered; my brother told me something, and I watched the prisoner; he put down the hats which were ordered, and I saw another hat out of paper, by the side of his box; I went forward, and saw him put the hat into his box - I went and tried to open the box, but he placed both his hands on it; I broke the lid of the box. and opened it; I took the hat out, and he said, "That is a good hat - what would you like to give for a dozen of them?" I said it bore the appearance of one of those which came in in the morning from a maker named Horn; I took one of those hats out of the paper, and compared the lining and every thing, and they appeared to be the same; the prisoner said it was his hat, and I sent for Mr. Horn; I will swear I took this hat from the box, and I saw him put it into it; the paper was partly on it, but in comparing the hats the paper vanished.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What became of the paper? A. I do not know - we searched for it; I was not further from him than I am from you; the constable searched him, but he could not find the paper - our mark was on it; I do not know what he could do with it: I took off the paper, and put it on the counter while I compared the hats, and while I did so it was gone; it was vellum paper. I swear the prisoner did not bring a fourth hat in with him; he brought an empty box in, which has been his custom; the lid was on the box: he put the three hats on the counter, then took this hat from the counter, and put it into the box; I had seen the hat safe ten minutes before he came in; I compared it with the other hats to convince him, for there was no mark upon it - he appeared to have been drinking.</p>

On the 1st of March I sold some hats to him; on the 29th I seal him six hats, and this is one of them, to the best of my knowledge; it is my manufacture - the initials of my name are in it; I do manufacture for other persons, but I can say I manufactured this for Mr. Pope; it had been previously ordered by him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many hats of that kind have you made in the course of your life? A. I cannot tell; I put my initials in those I make, and to the best of my knowledge it is one of those I carried in on the 1st, or on the 29th of March; I never sold one to the prisoner.</p>

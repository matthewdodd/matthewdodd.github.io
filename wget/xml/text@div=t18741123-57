                  </hi>. I am attached to the Missing Letter Branch of the General Post Office—on 16th November I addressed a letter to "Mr. John Latrielle, 99, Lorrimore Street, Walworth, Surrey"—I placed ninety postage stamps in that letter and put them in an envelope in the usual way—I sealed it with gum and also with sealing wax—I posted the letter about 12.15 at the South Eastern District Office, having previously drawn the attention of the inspector to the letter—that letter should have been deli<lb></lb>vered by the prisoner in Lorrimore Street between 2 and 3 o'clock the same afternoon—at that time I went to Mr. Latrielle's house and waited behind the door—about 3 o'clock the prisoner knocked at the door and 1 saw him place some letters in the hands of Mr. Latrielle's sister—I immediately took possession of them—I examined them, but the letter which I had addressed to Mr. Latrielle was not there—I came out into the street shortly after and saw police constable Butler, and after waiting twenty-five minutes I saw the prisoner come down the street—we walked in the direction he was going and followed him home to 24, Cardigan Street, Kennington Lane—I went and knocked at the door—it was immediately opened and I walked in—he was sitting at the table—I said "I think your name is Meads"—he said "Yes"—I said "I am attached to the Post Office; I wish to ask you two or three questions; have you finished your delivery?" <hi rend="italic">V</hi>—he replied "Yes"—I said "Have you delivered the whole of your letters?"—he said "Yes, with the exception of two or three which I can't deliver" he gave me four letters from his breast pocket—Mr. Latrielle's letter was not amongst those—he explained his reasons for the non-delivery of the four letters, the first was an unoccupied house, the next was not known as directed, the third was addressed 49 or 59, Lorrimore Lane and the party was not known at either place, and the fourth one was at Camden Town—I said "A letter addressed to Mr. John Latreille, 99, Lorrimore Street, is missing; do you know any<lb></lb>thing about it?"—he replied "No"—I said "Have you got it about you?"—he said "No"—I then directed the officer to search him, and I saw him take from his trousers' pocket a pocket handkerchief, and underneath that was the letter which I had been speaking to him about, crumpled up, doubled into three—I said "That is the letter that is missing; how came it in your pocket?"—he said "I don't know; it must have dropped there,—he was then taken into custody—the letter was opened before the magis<lb></lb>trate, and the stamps were found in it—Mr. Latrielle advertises recipes to</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate there was no difficulty in feeling the stamps in the letter, and there would not have been—I enclosed a written letter, and put the stamps inside the sheet of note paper—I have learnt since the prisoner has been in custody that he has been in the army in India about eighteen years—he would not have been employed by the Post-office unless he was of good character—I have not heard of any accident that he had in India, or that he fell from a camel and injured his head—I have got three of the letters which he accounted for not deliver<lb></lb>ing, the fourth was re-directed—I don't attach any fault to him for the non-delivery of those letters—there was nothing in the pocket the letter was taken from but his handkerchief—he made no difficulty about being searched—he seemed to be. a little nervous.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Inspector of letter carriers at the South-Eastern District office—on 16th November I took this letter from the letter box at 12.15—I stamped it with the date stamp at the back, and placed it with about fifty letters, which were tied up and placed in the Walworth letter bag, and that bag was tied up and placed in the Kennington bag, which was tied and sealed—I saw the bag despatched.</p>

I am overseer at the Kennington Branch Post-office—the prisoner was a letter carrier in that office—on the afternoon of the 16th of this month he was on duty for mid-day delivery—he would take the letters out received at the Kennington office at 12.45, and take them out for delivery about 1.15—if he had any letters which he could not deliver, it would be his duty to endorse at the back the reason why he could not dispose of them, and then tie them up together and post them in a pillar box, or take them to a receiving-house for a further trial—he would know that as postman.</p>

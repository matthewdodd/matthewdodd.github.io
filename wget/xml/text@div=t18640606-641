                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Admiral Tyrrell public-house, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey—the prisoner came in in April for a glass of sixpenny ale, which came to three-halfpence—he gave me a florin; I put it in the till, where there was no other florin, gave him the change, and he left—I went to the till about ten minutes afterwards; nobody else had been serving, and there was no other florin there—I found the florin was bad, and threw it on the fire; it melted immediately—on 26th April, which was about a fortnight afterwards, the prisoner came again for a glass of sixpenny ale—I recognised him as soon as he came to the door, but was serving other people at the time—he offered me a half-crown; I broke it in two in the detector, and said, "This is just what I expected of you; I thought I should see you again; you are the man that passed a bad two-shilling piece on me"—he said that he had never been in the house before—I said I was certain he was the man, and gave him in charge—he paid for the beer with a good half-crown while the officer was being sent for.</p>

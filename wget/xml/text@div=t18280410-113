On Tuesday morning a little after eight o'clock, I was induced, from information, to look into his coat pocket; I took from thence seven copy-books - I put them in again and let him go out to breakfast; when he got out I called him back and asked what he had got in his pocket - he said "Nothing;" I said that would not do for me - he then said he had a few copy-books, and I took from his coat pocket five copybooks with this wrapper, which had contained the dozen; I then looked in his other coat pocket and found these seven, which I had seen before - he said he had taken them to show his boy to see which he liked best.</p>

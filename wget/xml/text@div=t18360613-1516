                  </hi>. I am the wife of Philip Hitching, a broker of Golden-lane. About six o'clock in the evening of the 2nd of June, the prisoner came and asked me if the truck was in—I did not know him before—I said it would be in in half an hour—he came again, and it was then at the door—he had hold of it—I asked him where it was going—he said to Samuel's, a caner, in Whitecross-street—I asked him how long it would be—he said about two hours—I had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour for it—I did not see it again, nor see him till the Thursday, after my husband had give him in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not give charge of a man on Tower-hill, of the name of Granger? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I gave a description of a man, and Granger was taken, I went and said, "He is not the man".</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> They then went away, and the next morning her husband came down to him, and Granger said, "I know a man that goes portering about", (meaning me,) and he told me, if I saw it they would give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am sister to Jane Hitching. On the 2nd of June, the prisoner came to hire her truck—I have no doubt he is the man—I am quite sure he is the man—he was dressed in the jacket and trowsers he has now—he had dirty apron on, and his shoes were cut as if he had corns.</p>

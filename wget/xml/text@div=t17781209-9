               <p>(The shirt was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>On the 29th of October, I had been at work at Whitechapel; I returned at night to my lodging, in Gray's-Inn-lane . I heard of a place at Hampstead; but the man that drives the Hampstead coach, having somebody on the box, he could not take me up, but desired me to walk on before; I went as far as Pancras, there I met with the carrier, he asked me if I was going to Hampstead, I said yes; he asked me if I would ride, I told him I could not give him any more than a pint of beer; he said never mind that, if you can drive, for he was very drunk. I got up into the cart; going along I got down to ease myself; a gentleman came up and asked me the nearest way to Islington; I went back to show him the way, and met two men with bundles; they asked me to carry one of the bundles to Gray's-Inn-lane, which I did; then they wanted me to take it to Houndsditch; I told them I could not; they were to give me two shillings; they said they had no money, and one of them pulled the shirt out of his pocket and gave me, and asked if that would satisfy me.</p>

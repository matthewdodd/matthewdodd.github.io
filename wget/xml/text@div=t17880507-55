               <p>I know the prisoner; the last time I was in company with her, she robbed me of 8 s. and a part of buckles; as nigh as I can guess, it was the 11th of April; she and I was together that night at her lodgings, and when I got up in the morning she was gone, and left me there; I am sure I had the money and the buckles over night, because I changed half-a-guinea when she and me were going together; I gave her half-a-crown for herself, and the rest of the money I put in my pocket, and my buckles were in my shoes; I took the prisoner in about half an hour after I awoke in the morning, the constable took her up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you leave me in the room about eight? - No, she was gone.</p>

               <p>This very night it will be four weeks; this Mr. Ward (I have known him ever since I was a baby; I had not seen him, I dare for five or six years) he came into a public house where I was, and some more of his ship-mates with him; and they were pretty merry with drinking; at last he spred me out; he knew me, and asked me to drink; I drank with him several times, and sat down by the side of him; we sat from two in the day till past nine; his shipmates left him with me, and some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070067"></xptr>more girls that was in our company drinking; he said, he was rather belated, and asked me, to take him to any place; I said, I had no room of my own; says he, I have not much cash about me, and he pulled out thirteen pence halfpenny; but, says he, I have something about me that will pledge; says I, you must pay for a bed, and he sent me to pledge his buckles; it was too late; I came back with the buckles, and returned them to him; says he, cannot you leave them with a friend for four or five shillings; I bethought myself, I had five shillings and twopence in my pocket; I asked the landlord, and he would lend me no money on them; I said, I have some money of my own I can lend you; well, says he, put the buckles in your pocket, and you can pledge them in the morning; I gave him five shillings out of my pocket, and put the buckles into my pocket; I went from that public-house, to another public-house; there we sat and drank, and it was past three o'clock before we reached any room at all; the money I had lent him was all gone, and he was as backward of money as ever; I took a handkerchief off my own neck, and left it for eighteen pence for a bed; with that, we both of us went to bed together; I slept with him the whole time, and never parted with him till the morning; in the morning about eight he got up, and he had a pair of yellow buckles in his pocket, and he put them in his shoes; he never said any thing about his silver buckles; then I got up, and pledged these buckles, and took a gown out for five shillings, which was what I lent him, and went to redeem my handkerchief, it came to eighteen pence, then I had just three shillings and sixpence; in the morning he came to the public-house where we were drinking; he drank to me; says he, have you done any thing with that? yes, says I, here is the duplicate; he took it in his hand; says he, where is the money? says I, there was five shillings borrowed out of my pocket; I redeemed that; says he, have you, you had better have given me my buckles; says I, there is but three shillings and sixpence left, and that is little enough for me to stay with you; he said, if you do not give me the money, I will be revenged against you; I thought he meant to beat me or use me ill; he left me in the public-house; I never stirred; he chucked down the duplicate, and I picked it up, and put it into my nutmeg-grater, among some more; then the prosecutor returned with the constable, and took me; he took three shillings out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Is this true? - Such words never passed; I never saw her till the constable found her for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Thompson's service. On 14th Feb. I missed some paper from a stack in the office—it had been damaged by fire—I found some slips of paper—I asked the prisoners if they knew anything about it, and M'Sweeney said he had sold the paper to Mr. Wright, in Black more-street; that Mr. Wright gave 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for it—I know Mr. Wright—I have compared the cuttings with the paper found, and they correspond in every way—Gibbard said he would not have done it if it had not been for M'Sweeney—M'Sweeney said he cut the edges, and that Gibbard had helped him to do so—I asked how he came to cut the edges, and he said Mr. Wright would not buy them unless the edges had been cut, that Mr. Wright told him to bring more, and be would buy as much as he liked to bring.</p>

It is in the parish of St. Dunstan's, Stebonheath. My house was broke open, I think it was on the 13th of March. I went to bed at about eleven o'clock at night before; my servant and myself went to bed at the same time; no one was up after we went to bed. I did not examine the window before I went to bed; but my servant will be better able to speak to that, than I am. I am sure the sashes were not up. I rose about five in the morning; I had a house repairing within a few houses, and I went to see the workmen. It was day-light then, I think. I took no sort of notice of the state of my premises; for I went strait to the house I have mentioned. In about half an hour after, my servant,

             gave me some information, in consequence of which I returned to my house, and looked at my property, to see if any thing was missing; and I missed three silver tea spoons; I saw them at the watch-house about nine in the morning. I went to the watch-house; the prisoner was then in custody; I also saw two table cloths and three aprons, and also many other things that are not in the indictment, but which were found, The prisoner is well known in our neighborhood. I know his person well; he has occasionally come into the shop to ask questions.</p>

            . I went to bed at about eleven o'clock on the night of the 12th of March. I am servant to Mr. Lovett; when I went to bed, the doors, the windows, and the house were all s-cure. I got up at about half past five in the morning; my master had got up before me. I went down into the kitchen and found my things were all thrown about. It was day-light when I got up. I had left the things in their proper places when I went to bed. There was no other person inhabiting the house, but myself and my master. I missed three silver teaspoons, three table cloths, two shawls, two aprons, three caps, one pocket handkerchief, a pair of gloves, and one pair of worsted stockings. The teaspoons had been on the dresser, the over night. Immediately after I went and informed my master. The next time I saw the things was on the 13th, at Shadwell office, between six and seven in the evening; the prisoner was then in custody. I could not see how the person who had broken into the house had got in. But, I think, by raising the sash of the kitchen window next the back yard, which back yard is fenced by a high brick wail; none of these things were locked up. The moment a person got into the kitchen, he might sweep those things off the dresser, and out of the drawers in a very short time.</p>

               <p>Richard Lovett. A person must have got over three walls to got into my yard; the window was secured by a sash screw generally, and something must have been put in between the two sashes, and the screw forced back; one of the walls which a person must have got over is about twelve feet high, and the other two are each between seven and eight feet.</p>

            . I am a baker; at the time this happened, I lived at No. 88, Broad-street, Ratciiffe. On the morning of the 13th, about four o'clock, day had not broken, it was moon light; coming down stairs, I heard the dog barking very much in the yard; I opened the door to see what was the matter, and the dog ran up to me, and then ran<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030023"></xptr>back to the prisoner; the prisoner was then in my yard; I collared him; it was dark where he was standing, owing to the shade of the house. I asked him what he wanted there. He must have got into our yard first, and then into my next door neighbour's and then into Mr. Lovett's; he could get into my yard from the side alley which runs down. He said he had been to sleep, when I asked him what he did there. One wall is twelve feet high, and the other two are seven or eight at the lowest. I did not search the prisoner until after I had done my business; I kept him about an hour in the bake-house; I then opened the door, and called the watch, and delivered him over to Mr. Taylor, the watchman. I took the things from his pocket myself, all the articles named in the indictment; they were all about his person; some in his jacket pocket, and some in his waistcoat, and hat. Mr. Taylor took him to the watchhouse.</p>

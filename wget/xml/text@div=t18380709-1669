Between one and half-past one o'clock in the morning, on the 7th of July, I saw the prisoner opposite the Park, in Clarendon-street—he had a carcase of mutton on his shoulder—I asked him what he had got—he said the man who was with him in conversation was a police-constable in private clothes, and I had no busi<lb></lb>ness to interfere—I said he must go with me—he said he was travelling with a drove of sheep from Aylesbury, and if one was taken ill he had authority to kill it—I took him to the station-house—I made inquiry, and found the prosecutor—I found on the prisoner this steel buckled round his waist, which belonged to another man on the prosecutor's premises in Elm-street.</p>

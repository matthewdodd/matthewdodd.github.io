                  </hi>. I am a detective officer. On 5th Jan. I went to No. 16, Princes Square, St. George's in the East, with Mr. Sheffield—I found the prisoner there—I said to him, "My name is Brett, I am a police officer; I have come to see you respecting five cases that you obtained from the West India Docks on Christmas eve, by means of a forged order"—he said, "Shut the door, do not make a noise, I will tell you all about it; I am in a dreadful fix, if I had not been hard up I should not have done it: I have just left a respectable situation"—I said, "Are the boxes here?"—he said, "Yes," and he took from his trousers pocket which he was putting on, a key; he unlocked a large cupboard, pointed to three boxes, and said, "These are Captain Lloyd's, and there are the contents, pointing to different things which were in the cupboard and in the room; they were ladies' dresses, jewellery, a soda-water apparatus, and other things—I took the things up one by one, and he said of one, "That is mine," and of another thing he said, "That is Cap<lb></lb>tain Lloyd's"—I came to a musical box, which was standing on the drawers, and said, "Is that Captain Lloyd's?"—he said, "No, that is mine"—he took another key from his pocket, unlocked the box, and took out eight dupli<lb></lb>cates, which he handed to Mr. Sheffield; he said, "Four belong to property of my own, and these four," selecting them out, "belong to property belong<lb></lb>ing to Captain Lloyd; I wish to retract what I have said with respect to the musical box; that is Captain Lloyd's also"—I then removed him to Arbour Square Station, searched him, and found on him four shillings, a purse, a ring, and in his shirt three studs—I took them from him, and he said, "These belong to Captain Lloyd"—I went back to his room afterwards, and found there two papers; one is a note from the wharfinger: "I deliver this day to your order, five packages; the order is for six, but I have received but five"—the other is a shipping bill, and on the back is an indorsement, "James Barber and Co., per ship <hi rend="italic">Rangoon</hi>, four small chests of wearing apparel, Nos. 1 to 4, and two cases."</p>

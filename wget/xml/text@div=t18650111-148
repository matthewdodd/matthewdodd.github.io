                  </hi>. I live at 27, Charl ton-street, Fitzroy-square, and am a carman—on 23rd December, about half-past twelve in the morning, I was delivering some goods in the Vassal-road, Brixton—the prisoner came into the side-door of the house where I was, and said, "Carman, will you oblige me with change for half-a-crown"—I immediately emptied my purse into my hand and gave him three sixpences and a shilling for the half-crown—he then said, "I see you have some smaller change, will you oblige me with that, "at the same time he made a pretence of dropping the three six-pences and the shilling back into my hand—he put his hand over mine and made the money jingle—I counted out some threepenny and fourpenny <hi rend="italic">bits</hi> and put them in his hand—directly he had them, he ran out of the garden, jumped up into a cart which was there, and was driven away—I followed him out, and saw him being driven away as fast as the horse could go, it was a light gig cart—another party was in the cart, I did not see his face.</p>

               <p>after, and on the day afterwards, I came down to the police-court, saw the prisoner in the dock, and identified him—I gave no description of him to any one before I saw him—I spoke to no policeman about it—the man had dark clothes on, no moustache or beard—I can't say that he has the same clothes on now—I had him under my eye about two or three minutes; I looked up at him when I gave him the change, and I saw him run away—I did not say anything to alarm him before he ran away—I can't say how much I had in my hand altogether, I had been taking money all the morning, it might have been 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

             respecting the prisoner, and I got up the next morning between four and five o'clock, and at five o'clock the prisoner came and rattled at my door, at the latch, he was a stranger to me, then I did not know him, he came to the shop door; I have only one door, and then I asked of my boy if he had not sold some things out of the shop? I did not meddle with the prisoner that morning; the Monday morning following he came again; on the 4th, I see him there, I was in the street on the opposite side of the way, and when I came nigh the door, I heard him say to my boy, there is your master. On Monday morning the 18th, I had two officers ready to apprehend him, he was apprehended in my shop; he rattled at the door, and we opened the door, it was at five o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him rattle at the door yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him? - I asked him how he came to buy any thing out of my shop? he said he had only bought some rags; I called my apprentice and asked him if that was the man that he sold the harateen furniture to? he said it was; he said this in the presence of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to that? - He did not say any thing particular.</p>

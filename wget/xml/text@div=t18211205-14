I saw three men on my right, and two on my left hand - one man on my left hand called out "Now," and pointed to my reticule, when two of the three on my right caught hold of my bag, it was twisted round my hand; I pulled it towards me, and then the prisoner pushed me back and struck the back of my hand with his fist; it was a violent blow, and made me quit my hold - I am quite sure of his person. I let go of the reticule, the two men pulled it and broke the string, which they left round my hand. Mr. Johnson struck the prisoner over the head with a stick, which made him reel against the wall; Mr. Johnson then seized him, he tried to get from him, but he held him till the officer came and took him - the reticule was a black silk bag, worth 1 s., it contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

            . I am a surgeon in the East India Company's service, and live in Ratcliff-highway. I was walking with the prosecutrix in Brick-lane, about seven o'clock, and at the end of Thomas-street, I saw the prisoner and two others on the right, and two on the left by a post; but as we came up, one of the three on the right snatched at her reticule - I struck one of them with my stick, I saw the prisoner strike the prosecutrix on the back of her hand as she was struggling for her reticule. I immediately struck the prisoner several blows on the head which made him reel against the wall, and I secured him. On his recovery, he said he had nothing to do with it, that he was merely passing by and he would run after the others, but I seized him by the breast and held him till the officer came - I am sure he is one of the three.</p>

About the beginning of last November I sent the prisoner to Mr. Hatchard, bookseller, Piccadily, to require the payment of one pound sixteen shillings; he brought me back word that they could not pay it, that there was a mistake in the ledger, in the entry of the name, it being credited to one Mr. Swan, the printer, instead of myself; I immediately sent him back to inform them that Mr. Swan was the printer, but not the seller; he brought back word that when they saw Mr. Swan and ascertained that it was right, they would settle with me; from that time till the 8th of May I have sent the prisoner more than a dozen times. On the 12th of May I went myself; I found that the bid had been settled on the 12th of December last, and that the prisoner had received the money.</p>

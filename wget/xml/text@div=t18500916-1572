I carry on business at 22, Turnmill-street, in partnership with my brother, Auguste Nicholas Davenes—we are provision-dealers—we sell pigeons—we have a customer, Jennings and Co., in Newgate-street—Elderfield was our carman; I sometimes sent him out with goods to sell, but never with pigeons—I know some pigeons were sent, on 2nd Sept., to Mr. Jennings—Talbot is in my employ—it was Talbot's duty to count the pigeons before they went out—I saw twenty-one pigeons before the Magistrate; they were mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Davenes—I counted the pigeons that were sent to Mr. Jennings on 2nd Sept.—I saw them put into the box—there were 120—I gave the box to Elderfield, at six o'clock in the morning—his cart was down the yard—it was put on the cart, and I saw it driven away.</p>

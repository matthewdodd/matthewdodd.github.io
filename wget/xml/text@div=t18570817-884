                  </hi>. I am a seaman. I had come home in an American ship—on the night of 19th June I was walking with a young woman, near to Neptune Street, about 10 minutes past 12 o'clock—I saw Bishop staggering and falling—I walked on a few yards, and I felt a blow from behind me—I had not said anything to the prisoner—I had said to Bishop, "Good night"—it was the prisoner who struck me—I turned round, and tried to catch him—I saw a knife in his hand, and I received a second blow with the knife under the left arm—I tried to hold the prisoner, but I could not—he ran away, and round the corner, into Williams's house—I saw the policeman enter the house after him, and saw him taken—I have no doubt the prisoner is the man who stabbed me—Dr. Comley came to the station, and I went to the hospital the next morning—I was there a fortnight and four days—the knife I saw was similar to this one—it was a sharp knife.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 198). On the night in question I heard a cry of "Murder!" and saw the prisoner running; he went into Williams's house—I went in, went up stairs, and found the door of the room locked—I broke it open, and saw the prisoner sitting on the bed—I took him into custody—I immediately afterwards found this knife by the door of the room—there was no blood on it—it appeared to have been fresh sharpened.</p>

I attended the prosecutor—I found he had a wound, an inch and a half long, on his left side, and one on the shoulder, where the knife had gone through a very thick coat—no doubt this knife might have made such wounds—the wound on the shoulder was superficial—the wound in the ribs was a deep one.</p>

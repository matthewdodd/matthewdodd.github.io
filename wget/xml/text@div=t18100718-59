               <p>Q. Do you keep the house yourself - A. I do, it is my house; I have a niece that lives with me, I am the housekeeper.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 8th of May, was your niece gone out at night - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she with her your two men servants, the coachman and footman - A. She had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of your female servants at home - A. There were none.</p>
               <p>Q. Between eleven and twelve on that night were you writing in your parlour - A. I was writing, it was within a quarter of twelve at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to tell us what drew your attention towards the parlour door - A. I heard something as I thought, turning the latch of the door, but very low, gently the door opened, and a man presented himself; I looked at him steadily, he did not say one word to me; nor I to him. The first of his actions was saying burr, he was pointing to the fire where I was sitting, he took a second step with making the same noise, then he was pointing to the back parlour door saying burr, he directly began to lay hold of me, and drew me into the parlour; I made some opposition to it, and by the way of giving him some counter action there was a card table that stood by the fire place in the parlour, on which I had been writing, I had really forgot to put the feet up, I laid the whole weight of my body on the table, the table of course fell on me, and cut my skin a good deal. At that time I was quite clear what he had in view was the iron chest.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that the table fell upon you, were you in the front parlour or in the back parlour - A. I was in the back parlour, pretty near the iron chest.</p>
               <p>Q. You were now down upon the floor - A. The table having fallen upon me, and there was a small box between my feet. It is a room full of papers and boxes. He was up, the table did not fall upon him. I had not been long in that situation when he gave me a blow on my stomach, and I fell on my back. In that situation I was, I found both his hands at once one in each pocket, in my left hand pocket, I had one hundred pound in small bank notes in my right hand, there was my pocket book, as soon as he took these out he thrust his hand into my side pocket, and took the key of the iron chest and opened the iron chest with all the ease imaginable, and he began to rifle the chest; but he only rifled the chest with one hand, he was afraid of my getting up; I was in that situation I could not get up, he held me fast, I of course endeavoured to free myself from him, which I could not do on account of the embarrassment of the card table, and the box between my feet, and there he had me; he took every thing from the iron chest, he took gold boxes, diamond rings, chains, and watches, part of them are here, I have not them all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all them things in the iron chest - A. No, part of them were, some were in the drawer, he took the things out of the cases they were in, and this snuff box had a case. After being on my back, I turned about, I said, I wanted to sit down, he said, burr; I said, I wanted to sit down on one of them little boxes, he resisted my attempt by making the same noise, that is the only noise he made the whole time. I endeavouring, or wanting to get out of his hands, crept about two or three yards to the parlour door, he pursued me, and there he got upon the top of me, and gave me a violent blow upon my head which gushed out blood.</p>
               <p>Court. He gave you a violent blow with what - A. With his fist, what, said I, do you intend to murder me, these were the only words that passed between us; I suppose that blow must have stunned me, I spoke no more. When this was done, he had done every thing, he had rifled the chest, he took the candle out of the parlour that I had, he took that in his hand, I remember his going away, he went out of the door into the front parlour, turned the key of the door, and there he left me, there I was three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Do you mean that he locked you in the back parlour - A. Yes, I was left in the dark laying on the ground; I was not able to get up till some little time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he leave this candle that you have been speaking of - A. I think he left it in the inside room, but there was a candle which is a remarkable thing, I found a candle which he had thrown in the corner, how the house escaped fire I know not; since the candle was broken in two or three pieces, the tallow had run all about the floor, and the wick went out; it was a most wonderful thing how it went out, he dashed it in the corner as he went out, the waistcoat is signed.</p>
               <p>A. From whom had you the bank notes that you had in your pocket - A. I wanted to pay some tradesmen, I had them from Mr. Antrobus, the teaman, in the Strand, I intended to pay them away the day after I had them in; there were others that I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the young man at the bar - A. I do, perfectly well; he was six months in my service, he had left me about three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person that committed the violence upon you about the size and height of that man - A. I believe he was; he had a black gauze over his face, of course that made his features appear larger to me, he looked more robust then, and in the features of his face having the gauze over it, I thought I knew his voice; I really and truly did think that it must be the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180041"></xptr>Court. You did not hear his voice did you - A. No, only burr, from the manner of the voice. I really believed it to be the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you mean that your opinion is found upon the observations that you made at the moment or from the knowledge that you have since acquired with the; information of Humphrey's - A. It is not from subsequent information at all, I think so at least.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you told me that the face of the man through the black gauze appeared larger - A. No doubt it did.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you stated that the person appeared larger in bulk than the prisoner - A. Certainly, I thought so, I do not think that he exceeded in height.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street In consequence of information on the 25th of June, I went to Mrs. Temple, No. 15, Little Barlow-street, Marylebone, I found the prisoner there about five o'clock in the afternoon, there are two rooms on the first floor; I rapped at the door, I went in, the prisoner was drinking tea with Mrs. Temple, and a soldier belonging to the life guards; I said Mr. Towers how do you do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. No, he arose from his chair and said, how do you do sir, I have not the pleasure of knowing you, I told him I knew him very well, and that I had called two or three days before, and left my address, he said, I have your address in my pocket; I said, how was it you did not call upon me, he replied, he only came to town last night, I told him I understood he had an inclination to go to India, he said, he had; I said, I should wish to speak to him in private, he said by all means, we went into the back room, me and the prisoner only, then I noticed the chain and seals of his watch, I said, you have got a curious seal, a very pretty one, he said, it was; I laid hold of one of the seals, and observed the lion rampart upon it; I then said, will you have the goodness to let me look at the watch in your pocket, he said, yes, I will, he took the watch out of his pocket and gave it me in my hand, I said, they were nice seals, and the watch appeared to be a French one; he said, he did not know about it being a French watch, I told him I believe I had some knowledge of the seals, and also of the watch, he said, he believed not; it was a watch that was left to him by his uncle a very rich farmer in the country that had died lately. I said, you lived with Mr. Bryen once, he said, he did; I asked him if he thought Mr. Bryen would give him a character, he said, he had been living with a gentleman in the country since he left Mr. Bryen; I told him my name was Humphreys, I am a Bow-street officer, if this is your watch which your uncle left you, you will have no objection to go with me to Mr. Bryen, he said, he would not go, then I took my staff out of my pocket that I would not deceive him, and told him he should go; then I asked him if the trunk and box in the room was his; he said, no, it was the soldiers whom he slept with, I told him he had better go quiet and easy, and say no more about it, if it was all right he would soon return again. I got him down stairs, then he wanted to speak to his landlady, I told him no, I took him by the arm and led him out of the yard into the street. We went together till we came to the corner of Manchester-street, he had occasion to stop there, we proceeded to Mr. Bryen's door, and as I put my hand to the door he attempted to make his escape, he ran some distance before I catched him, nearly a mile, I stopped him, took him into Oxford-street, before I could get a coach, I then tied his hands, and put him into a coach, I attempted to search him, he seemed very ticklish he did not like it. In what I am going to relate, I neither promised him any thing nor threatened him, I put my hand into his breeches pocket, there I found a gold snuff box, he said, you are right, it is of no use for me to deny it any longer, take care of that box for in it there is seven and thirty pounds, this is the snuff box, he then said, keep all you find about me, and I will not split, that is he would not say any thing about it, I told him I should keep all I had got a short time, but I should split; I then asked him what he had done with the remainder of the old gentleman's property that he had taken, he replied, that he had sold it to a jew, he should not know him again if he saw him, he had not pledged it, and I might depend upon it that every thing that I found upon him was the whole that was left, I took him to Bow-street, locked him up, and took another coach and went back to his lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that snuff box and watch - A. The gold snuff box is mine, the gold watch, seals, chain, and key are mine.</p>
               <p>Humphries. When I got to the lodging, I found a trunk and box there, in the trunk I found a gold repeating watch, a gold snuff box, part of a tortoise shell box, an ivory box set in gold, a pearl box, a large gold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180042"></xptr>ring, and three other gold rings; here is gold chains and other inkets, and topaz broaches.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The are all my property, they were all in the strong box.</p>
               <p>Humphrey's. There were linen in the other box, I believe, what he owned, there is two five guinea pieces and some double joes.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost two double joes, and three five guinea pieces.</p>

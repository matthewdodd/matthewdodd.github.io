            . I live in Brook-street, Ratcliff. Johnson called me into this house - I got half-way down the stairs and saw the prisoner with her arms round the deceased's neck, trying to lift him - they were at the bottom of the stairs - it was dark - I asked for a light - then went down, and heard her saying "My dear William, do get up" - I went down and found him laying at the bottom of the stairs, which are very steep and dangerous, and at the bottom is a long flag stone - the continuation of the passage is covered with oyster shells; I found he had been bleeding at the nose and head, by the right ear; I sent for a surgeon - he was taken into his own room - he breathed but there was no appearance of life - I found a large wound on the lower part of his head; I could almost lay my finger in it; the prisoner held the candle to us; I told her it was hinted that she had thrown him down stairs - she denied it, but said "If I did not throw him down I gave him a precious good squeeze;" the surgeon did not come, and I requested her to fetch one; she treated it very light, and said he had better lay there till morning, and it would do him good to let a little of his mad blood out of him; I went and got an order for the parish doctor to attend him, and on Monday morning I saw him at the hospital - he was then dead; when I gave her the order for the parish doctor, she was desirous of letting it be, and said he had taken the bed tick to pawn and got drunk with the money; that she found him in Limehouse causeway, followed him home, and was determined to get in doors before him. She told me next morning that she had been to the hospital, and told the gentlemen she had thrown him down stairs.</p>

            . I am a surgeon of the hospital, and was called to see the deceased. He was quite dead - he had a considerable swelling at the back of his head, and blood issued from the ears; there was an extensive fracture of the skull, and considerable extravasation of blood on the brain, which caused his death - it might have proceeded from a fall down stairs.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the deceased had treated her very ill - that, on the day in question, he pawned her bed, and came home drunk; she was afraid to go down stairs before him, as he often beat her, and that instead of pushing him down she placed her arms out, to prevent his falling, the stairs being very steep, and he had often fallen down - she slipped and was obliged to let go of him, and he fell - that she had done all she could to obtain him medical assistance.</p>

            , who lives at No. 47. Old Bethlem. On the 16th of January last, my brother, whose name is Sherrard, and I took a coach at <placeName id="t17720603-9-crimeloc47">Temple Bar</placeName>

I soon fainted by their pulling me about; then they got me up on the seat. When I came to myself, I found one of them standing by my side, one sitting opposite me, and the other was doing with me as my husband did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which that was?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; two of them had to do with me, or else one of them twice, I can't tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Where his private parts in yours?</p>

               <p>Smith. Yes; I took hold of it with my hand; I screamed, and one of them said he would cut my throat if I was not quiet; I was in such confusion I can't tell which; they cut my apron string.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing come from the man that was using you so?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he actual carnal knowledge of you?</p>
               <p>Smith. He had indeed. I put my head out of the window as soon as I could, and cried out murder! the men kept hollowing and hooting inside and outside the coach; a brother of one in the coach was upon the box with the coachman, and there were some more behind the coach; they kept pulling me into the coach; I did not know where I was; I believe the coachman did not drive up the main street. They hauled me up and down, and pulled me about as they chose. I did not know whether they were men or boys; I said if you have fathers or mothers or wives, if you are men, have humanity towards me, for I have just lain in; they said they would lye in with me; they kept cursing, swearing and hallowing; they made no particular answer to any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was lain with twice: when was the second time?</p>
               <p>Smith. Some time after the first.</p>
               <p>Q. And in the same manner?</p>
               <p>Smith. It was not quite so plain; I found they had hold of me, and had lain with me, but I cannot be so punctual to that as the other. I am a married woman; I am sure of it from circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they entered your body?</p>
               <p>Smith. I am sure they had the first time, and I had reason to believe they had the second time; the coach was stopt at Aldgate at twelve o'clock by the mob upon my screaming, where they had drove me during that time I can't say; a person came up to the coach; they told him. I was a woman of the town and was in liquor; there was a clergyman asked me where I lived, I told him; he ordered the coachman to drive me home. The men jumped out of the coach window, and a man came into the coach to see me home; I was afraid that man was as bad as themselves. The coachman was taken into custody; he gave us the names of the men and told us where we might find them, and they were accordingly taken that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the three men?</p>
               <p>Smith. They owned they were before my Lord Mayor, and confessed all but the fact.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear these are the three men that were in the coach?</p>
               <p>Smith. I can't tell, it was dark; they owned they were.</p>
               <p>On her cross examination, she said,</p>
               <p>"that her husband had kept a public house, but was now out of employment; that she had been married three years; that she had been informed her husband was an officer of the marshall's court, before her marriage; that she spent the evening of the 16th of January with her brother, at the Golden Cross, Charing Cross, where they supped, and had a bowl of punch with Mr. Hargrave, one of the proprietors of the stage coaches; that they took the coach about half after ten; that she was quite sober; that her brother put her into the coach, and was himself getting in when the coachman came out of the house; that they did not desire her to get out of the coach, but rushed in immediately; that her brother wanted her to get out of the coach, but they would not let her."</p>

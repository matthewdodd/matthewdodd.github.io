               <p>Q. When had you seen it last? - A. I do not know that I had seen it for a week before; it was laying there with five more; the prisoner lives at Walton on Thames, about a mile and a half off; I got a search-warrant on the 25th of June; the constable went to the prisoner's house, and in less than five minutes it was taken out of his shop; I saw the plank, and knew it was mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where you live is in Middlesex? - A. Yes; and Walton is in Surry.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not attend the search-warrant yourself? - A. I attended it myself, but I was a little distance off.</p>
               <p>Q. It very often happens that planks are carried away by the tide - the tide very often overflows the banks entirely? - A. They were all fastened together; I had ten more.</p>
               <p>Court. If there had been any flood, it must have carried away the other planks.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable; I went to the prisoner's premises on the 25th of June with a search-warrant; I found the plank in his work-shop; he was not at home; it had been cut since it had been taken from the water-side.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there much more plank in the workshop? - A. None at all, only pieces of chips; soon after I took the prisoner before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what was the cause of your apprehending him? - A. Yes; he said he wished me to read the warrant; he acknowledged that he had used some of it where he had been at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account how he got it? - A. He said he had been hauling some grigs in still water, between three and four o'clock in the morning, and two men followed him in the Thames, and asked him if he would buy the plank; he went and looked at it; they asked him two guineas for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040040"></xptr>the whole plank, upon which he gave them two pounds in Bank-notes, and two shillings; to the best of my remembrance that is the account he gave the Magistrate; he said they called him by name, but he did not know them, and did not ask where they lived; it was taken down in writing, and it was read over to him before the Magistrate, and he said it was right.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The account which I gave before the Magistrate is true.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner's deposition before the Magistrate read in Court, which is the same as stated by the witness.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Harley.) Q. You say you found this timber in his work-shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other pieces of timber in the shop? - A. What do you call timber.</p>
               <p>Q. I am no carpenter, you are not to expect technical words from me - was there any other wood in the place? - A. There might be chips and shavings; it had the appearance of a work-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) You have no mark upon it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have no doubt of it's being your property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. I have valued it at thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What could you buy a plank of that size for? - A. Five pounds.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Are you aware of the value of that sort of timber - you surely could buy it at four or five shillings a foot? - A. The value of it is about forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you think it could be got for forty shillings? - A. Yes, it might.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say it could not be got for less than five pounds? - A. It is stuff that I do not understand so much.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

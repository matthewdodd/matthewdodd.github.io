                  </hi>. I live at 12, Boswwell Court, Bloomsbury, and am a blind-maker—on Saturday morning, 10th January, between 5 and 10 minutes past 10, I went to the Italian Church, Hatton Garden—after I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188002090037"></xptr>
               <p>been ther about ten minutes I saw the prisoner—I did not know him before—I went into the church to worship—I was kneeling—the prisoner entered from the Clerkenwell Road entrance—he had his hat on—he did not take it off—he looked sound booth sides—he then looked round the top pillar on that side towards the altar to see if the priest was there—he then went towards the middle of the altar, turned round to the people and said. "All you go away," or "go out"—he was just before the center of the opening, below the steps—I then saw him fire a pistol—Father Bakanowaki was the pries standing at the altar—he was standing in the middle of the altar, with his face toward it, and his back to the prisoner—I saw the pistol in the prisoner's hand, and saw the smoke come out of it—he pre<lb></lb>sented the pistol at the priest—from the front of the altar where he stood to where the priest was, I should say was from 16 to 18 feet—he then went up the steps of the altar and fired again in the same direction, to the altar or the priest, only slightly towards the right-hand side—he was siming at the altar or the priest when he fired the second shot—he then fired a third shor, but where he was then, at what distance from the altar, I can't tell—Irushed up to the rail, looked round to see whether I could see the priest—the priest had moved from there—I did not see him on the altar, but looking round I saw him escape on the left-hand side—I did not go up to the altar—I went up to the rail by the pillar, and looking towards the altar I saw the priest turn round to the left-hand side and he ran down the steps towards the door—I then saw the prisoner on the altar steps close to the altar, standing in front of it, fire again towards the direction of the door by which the priest escaped—that is the Back Hill door—The priest was still visible when the shot was fired—he was escapring through the door—I turned my head towards the door in Clerkenwell Road to call for assistance, and I heard another shot—I did not see that fired—I then heard a noise as if there was a hammering, and I went back to the church after hallooing at the door, and saw the prisoner trying to break in the tabernsele door, and I saw him throw the candlesticks and candles about, and he put his hand in the tabernacle and threw something on his right-hand side, what, I could not see—there were two candlesticks alight on the altar—the chalice and the Host are kept in the tabernsele—I did not see what he did at the tabernacle—the first three shots were fired almost instantly, one after the other—the other two might have been about a minute afterwards, they were fired almost instantly, the one after the other—I than saw the prisoner go as if to jump on the altar with his knee so as to get a rise, to pull down the things—I then ran to the door, and screamed for help—on coming back I saw the prisoner by the side of the altar—I looked round the church to see if I could find anything to hit him with, or to aim at him, but not finding anything I went and hallooed at him to came down—I wa then about 18 feet from him—I was standing by the altar rail—he turned round and held the pistol at me, and said, "You go away"—he said that in English—he seemed to aim towards me, as I thought, and I ran to the Clerkenwell door—I then saw that he had a dagger in his left hand—them were two police and some bystanders, labourers and others, coming through the opening of the door—I pointed him out on the altar—we retired a few steps back beyond the pillar, when we saw the prisoner come down the steps from the altra into the middle of the body of the church</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188002090038"></xptr>
               <p>and go along, and syddenly he stopped before a gentleman, who I did not notice before, and the gentleman suddenly laid hold of him, and then there was a rush made, and he was seized—I saw the pistol and dagger wrenched from him—he struggled hard to hold the dagger—I never saw him before that morning—I could not tell whether he was sober—he seemed sober from the manner in which he spoke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw him enter the door of the church with his hat on—he looked round, and walked deliberately enough and quietly—I was certainly very much surprised to see him walk into the church with his hat on—I did not see the pistol in his hand at that time—the first shot was fired almost within the middle of the altar—I certainly was under the impression that he did not fire at the priest I don't know what he fired at—it was not partly my impression that he fired to frighten people, without intending to do any harm—when the second shot was fired the prisoner was standing on the steps of the altar, inside the rail; I mean the sanctary steps, the steps leading up to the altar rails—I did not see the priest come down the steps and pass the prisoner—I take it the prisoner was behind the altar when the priest escaped, as I did not see the prisoner was behind the the priest, he might have followed him—I did not see the priest go round the altar; I saw him come from the left-hand side—in order to get behind the altar the prisoner must have passed the place where the priest was standing at the time he was fired at first—I did not see the priest when the third shot was fired.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Gloucester Street, Bloomsbury—I am not in any business—on Saturday morning, 10th January, I was at the Italian Church, Hatton Garden; I was there at the 9 o'clock service, and I waited for the 10 o'clock service—I saw the prisoner there; he came to round at the altar a few seconds; he did not come into the church; he was in at the door, and he looked round at the altar and round the church; he looked retired, and I did not see him for a quarter of an hour—I did not see where he went—there was no service going on at that time, and no prient at the altar—I was about the centre of the church—in about five minutes Father Bakanowski came to the altar, and commenced the service; after the service had been going on about 10 minutes the prisoner again came to the same door, and looked in in the same manner as before, to the alter and round the church; he then came in with his hat on, came scross by the altar rail, and ascended to steps in front of the high altar, and fired at the priest, who was on the altar, with his back towards him—Father baks<lb></lb>nowski was the only priest there—I saw the pistol in the prisoner's hand, and I saw him point it direct at him at the top of the steps—he was about six or seven yards from him, perhaps it might not be quite so much, it is merely a rough guess—the priest did not turn round instantaneously; he turned round in about a few seconds, and saw the prisoner coming towards him with the pistol in his hand; he came down the steps to go round the back the prisoner fired again at him—the priest went round the back of the altar to the right, and there the prisoner fired again, but I did not see that shot fired; I heard it—the priest then came round to the other end of the</p>

               <p>alter, the left, and crossed over in front of the alter, and then the prisoner fired again at him—I saw that shot fired; I saw Nos. 1, 2, and 4, but not 3; I think there was a fifth shot, but I won't be certain of that; the priest was then crossing the front of the alter, and he went into the sacristy; That was the last shot I saw fired—I should not think it was above a minute or a minute and a half from the time the first shot was fired to the priest making his exit into the sacristy—than saw the prisoner ascend the alter where the priest had been officiating, and take one of the candlesticks off the altar, and light one end of the altar cloth, and then go to the other and light the other—he then went with the candlestick reversed in his hand, went to the tabernacle door and broke it in—I then left the church for assistance, and when I came back he was in the hands of the police—I did not see the prisoner before that morning—he seemed to come along rationally enough, only he seemed to forget himself, coming with his hat on—I did not see anything more particular about him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the priests of the Italian Church, Hatton Garden—on Saturday morning, 10th January, I was in a room over the sacristy—some time after 10 I heard several shots fired and a ringing of the bell—I did not come down at once because I did not understand the meaning of the ringing of the bell—shortly affterwards some men came up, and I went down and went through the sacristy door into the church: that was two or three minutes after I heard the shots fired, perhaps less—as I came into the church I met the prisoner coming towards me on the sanc<lb></lb>turary—I did not notice anything in his hand immediately, because he kept his hands down—when he got within 4 feet of me he presented a revolver in my face; I reppidly bent my head and sprang over the altar rail and made my way into the centre of the church, and on turning round I saw the altar cloth in flames, and the prisoner throwing right and left the candelabras and candlesticks and the decorations of the alter, and shouting to himself—he them made his way behind the altar, ascended some steps behind the altar,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188002090040"></xptr>
               <p>and threw down one of the large iron candlesticks, smashing it to pieces, and the golden throne or stand to put the Host on for benediction—I cried out to a body of ten or twelve men and two policemen standing inside the Clerkenwell Road door—I called out to them to go in a body to put out the flames to save the church—they did not stir—when the prisoner threw down the massive iron candlestick and the throne, it made a gap in the decorations so that he could see in the body of the church, so he must have seen me standing alone in the church—he at once left the work of demolition and made his way to me, holding something in both his hands—I went forward to meet him, and on a nearer approach I saw the revolver in his right hand, but the black handle of the knife being held downwards I thought it might be another revolver—the blade was up the sleeve—I went forward, and when I got within about 2 feet of him I seized him by both wrists, and afterwards I saw the knife—he struggled very violently with the left hand, which held the knife—I held his cuffs—a woman, the housekeeper, came to my assistance—I could scarcely hold him any longer—she caught his arm and screamed, and then the crowd came forward, and the prisoner was secured, and the revolver and dagger were taken from him—I had never seen him before.</p>

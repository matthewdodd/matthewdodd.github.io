               <p>MRS. MARY RAMSDEN. On the 29th of May, I took a coach, which the prisoner drove. I set a friend down at the corner of <placeName id="t18180617-7-crimeloc32">Newgate-street</placeName>

I called to him to stop, as I had lost my bag, he then got down, and looked about the chariot, but could not find it. I walked back to where I set my friend down, but could see nothing of it. I returned to the chariot, and called for a light at the wine vaults, but could not find the ridicule. I took the number of the chariot, and said I would go to my friend at the Chapter Coffee-house, thinking it might have clung to her dress. I could not find it. We then went back with the waiter to the chariot, and gave the prisoner in charge. The bag was found by the chariot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I took the chariot in Aldermanbury. It set my friend down at the top of Ivy-lane, and was to take me home. I had my ridicule in my hand when I set my friend down.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Chapter Coffee-house. Mrs. Ramsden came and enquired for Miss Court, and said she had lost her bag. I got a candle, searched the chariot, but found nothing; I returned, got my hat, went back, and told the prisoner if he knew nothing of it he could not object to be searched, and to turn his horses round and drive to the watch-house. He was taken to the watch-house-nothing was found on him. I went out to the chariot, and got there as soon as the prisoner. I saw him go to the boot, and take out a handful of hay, as if to feed his horses; he went round to them, staid a little time, and came round again; I went round to where he stood, and found the ridicule at the horses' feet. The chariot then stood by the passage which leads to Dolly's chop-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. It was not the place where the lady was set down - A. No.</p>

I asked him what I was to stand for them, and he said, the old price, half and half. I told him, I had no objection, provided they were good ones. He then produced these half dozen, for which I gave him a three-shilling bank token. I looked at those he gave me, and said, I had seen better ones than those; I told him I wanted a larger quantity, and he said, he would endeavour to alter them.</p>

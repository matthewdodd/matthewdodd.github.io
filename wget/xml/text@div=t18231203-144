            . I am an officer, and was at the fire; saw the prisoner and another boy following Joyce - the other boy took hold of Joyce's left hand coat pocket; they turned round, looked me in the face, but did not know me; they followed him about ten yards; the other boy put his hand into Joyce's pocket, took out two handkerchiefs, and handed them to the prisoner; and the moment I seized the prisoner I found them on the ground.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me touch them - A. I did not see them in his hand.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw them till the gentleman took hold of me; the other boy took them, and threw them down at my feet. I was running after the engine.</p>
               <p>JOYCE re-examined. The prisoner was nearest to me when I turned round, by which I concluded that he took them; he was conveying them to another boy.</p>

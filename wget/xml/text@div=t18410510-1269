                  </hi>. I live at Richmond. On the 27th of January the prisoner James brought me this saddle, and said it was one his son had made while out of employ, and wished me to give him what 1 considered a fair price—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I had previously redeemed six gig saddles, and three hunting saddles, the tickets of which I had from him—he also said his son had made them when out of employment.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw this saddle some time at the latter end of January—I was out at the time my father bought it, but on my return the same evening I found it on the premises—this is the one that was delivered to the officer—we had others of the same description, but this has a piece put into the lining of the flap, to make it long enough.</p>

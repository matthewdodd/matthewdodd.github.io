               <p>Q. Did you ever employ the prisoner on board that craft? - He came down on the 17th of July, with a recommendation from Mr. Bristol; I took him on board the 23d, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue in your service? - From that time till he was taken up, the 23d or 24th of October. It was my intention to engage him as a navigating captain; we made no agreement what I was to give him, for I wished to try him some time before I made an agreement. The person who sent him me informed me that he would be content with fifteen shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time the prisoner was on board this craft, did you miss any thing? - On board that vessel I missed a great number of things.</p>
               <p>Q. Articles of wearing apparel? - Yes. I often enquired about my things, and he used to say that Sinclair had taken them, or some one else. On the 11th of October I went down to the Nore; on the Sunday I returned, but on the same day, Sunday, we took on board a boy, who is a witness. Having some thing to do on board, I stayed off Greenwich a whole week. On Saturday, the 18th of October, (I had slept there every day from the preceding Saturday) I went on shore to the Ship Tavern to get my dinner, and returned again to sleep at night, and returned to town, by the stage, the next day; when I returned again, my servant had put up a fine pair of silk stockings I saw, I suspected he might take these stockings, and before I went out I put them in such a position in the drawer, that they should not be moved without my knowing of it; I told him that I should put up every thing that I had in the vessel, and come to town; I told all that were there so; I also signified a wish that if I could be on board in time, I might see my things put up myself; when I returned from my dinner and got on board, there was a large basket, and my things were piled up in it; I asked where my cloaths were? he said they were all in that basket; and I went down into the cabbin, and my brother and he followed me; I had been down previous and looked over my drawers before, and finding no silk stockings in any drawers, I went on deck and prepared to go to town; I then asked him if every thing was there that belonged to me? they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080155"></xptr>said every thing was gone to town except these things. When I got to town, I unpacked the things, and we took the things out of the basket, spread them on the floor, and examined them; some of the articles occured to me, particularly a pair of stockings and a pair of breeches, in short I missed all the things in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you lose these articles from? - From the vessel Tilberina.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the vessel laying when you lost them? - At Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she laying when you saw her again? - In dock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I think you say, that it was on the 18th of October that you missed these things? - On Saturday, the 18th of October, I left these stockings in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them? - I missed the stockings particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed the other things before? - Yes, but I had not missed the nankeen breeches; I had missed the iron vice before, and the cheese; I then missed the woollen cloth breeches, and the linen breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe this gentleman has seen better days before now? - I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you was very intimate with him, and he frequently dined with you at your table? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us of a boy being turned away by him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That gave you great displeasure? - It certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the 19th of October that you directed a warrant to be taken out against this man? - It was on Monday night, which was the day after the Sunday, I found this miserable boy looking about the street, wanting to find my house, and I took him in, and the next day I ordered a warrant to be made out against this man.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a warrant for an assault against this boy? - It was; and I ordered a search warrant at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you execute the search warrant till the warrant for the assault on the boy was first disposed of? - I certainly did; I wanted to have him in custody at all events.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether this person's wife did not wash for you? - She did once. I left some linen foul, on board, and she took them home and washed them, and when he acquainted me with it, I said, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, I think, that you had bargained with him for about fifteen shillings a week? - No, I did not make any bargain with him; but I understood he would be satisfied with that.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you paid him a very different sum? - At the time that I was at Greenwich, this very Sunday, I had left in his hands a ten pounds note, and a guinea, over and above that account that we had settled, and he had cut out a leaf of the book in which the account was; that was produced before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever swear, Mr. Fitzgerald, that you owed him nothing? - I have said that I owed him nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you swear that? - If I was asked to swear it I would have sworn it, if it had been asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many messages were sent to you to attend on this charge against this man from the office? - I have got the messages here. I was taken extremely ill; afterwards I received a message from the office, on the 25th of October, and I then attended the magistrate with some witnesses, and these articles, not all of them, but a great many were produced before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. He was discharged on his first examination? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he discharged at all? - He was discharged by permission of the justice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080156"></xptr>; he was not discharged in point of law.</p>

               <p>Q. We don't want the point of law, we want the point of fact. - I will give you the point of fact. Before the justice I attended, and as I could not swear to the silk stockings, I produced the person who I bought them off, and the prisoner owned that the stockings were mine, but that they were taken by mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he discharged then? - No, a week afterwards, and I will tell you why -</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us why? - At this time, after my property was so proved, he had made an attempt to say that his wife was washing them; I said, what washing new stockings! new breeches! and then he said that his wife had packed them up by mistake.</p>
               <p>Court. Cannot you confine yourself to a little detail of the evidence? you are inexcusable going into these extranious matters, because you know what evidence is; you know that that is nothing at all to the case. I am very glad that every prosecutor is not a barrister.</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald. The magistrate wished me to be merciful on account of his age; after considering sometime, I said, I am very angry now and I will not determine in anger, I will take time to consider of it; but he shall not be sent to prison; but let him be kept at the constable's house, at my expence, till I am determined in my own mind whether I will prosecute him or no.</p>
               <p>Q. After being kept at the constable's house some time, was not he discharged out of custody? - He certainly was discharged by Mr. Staples.</p>
               <p>Q. To shew what state of mind you was in you wrote this paper, I believe, and caused it be posted it about town? - I certainly did.</p>
               <p>The paper read as follows;"Felony, and Shadwell police office.</p>

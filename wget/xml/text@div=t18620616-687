                  </hi>. I live with my father, John Marks, and live at 1, Meyrick's-buildings—on 6th June, about half-past 7 in the morning, I was going out for some milk—as I went out I saw the prisoner outside—I was not gone a minute, I had only to go four doors off—when I came back I went down into the kitchen—I heard a noise in the parlour, and went and opened the kitchen door, and saw the prisoner go out of the house—I pointed him out to the policeman.</p>

I was on duty on the morning of 6th June, a little distance from the prosecutor's house—the last witness came and gave me information, and pointed out to me the way the prisoner had run—I did not see him then, but I went in that direction, found the prisoner, and took him into custody—I told him he was charged with com<lb></lb>mitting a robbery in the house of the last witness—I took him back to the house, took him into the room, and found that the drawers had been opened, and a shawl and black silk skirt removed—he had not taken any<lb></lb>thing away—I found on the prisoner 9 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a key—the key would go into the outer door, but would not open it.</p>

                  </hi>. On 6th June my daughter called me down—I went into the parlour, and found the black dress lying on the table—it had been hanging behind the door—my middle drawer was open, and my black shawl, which had been in it, was lying on the carpet—the things were quite safe at half-past 10 the previous night—I was the last person up, and none of my family had come down this morning.</p>

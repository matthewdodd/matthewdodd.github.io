                  </hi>. I am housemaid to Dr. Theodore Gordon, in Duchess-street, Portland-place, in the parish of St. Mary-le-bone—the prisoner was employed to assist the footman, and his wife washed the foot<lb></lb>man's linen. On the 27th of April, about ten minutes to three o'clock the footman went out with the carriage—I was up stairs—I came down into the drawing room soon after—the cook was the first that came into the room—she stopped a short time, and then went up stairs—the prisoner came in and was looking at the ornaments about the room with the cook, who came back about two or three minutes after he came into the room—I then told him to help me, and hand me a few pins, as I was putting on the cover of the furniture—he helped me with two cushions—he afterwards went to the table where the ornaments were—I did not look after him—I was sewing on the cushions—he came over towards me with a common tortoiseshell snuff-box in his hand—he said, "I will take a pinch of snuff"—I said, "Do, I did not know there was any snuff in it"—he went away again to where the ornaments were—I did not look after him—I suppose he put that box down, for it was there after he was gone—he left the room in a minute or two, and said he would go away before the carriage came back—the cook left the room two or three minutes before him—I had seen the case in which the gold snuff-box was kept on the table in the morning, and dusted it—it was a small red leather case—I did not open it, but I took it in my hand to dust underneath it, and I think I should have missed the box if it had not been in it, as it would be lighter, but I could not positively tell—I took no particular notice—the prisoner was in the room about ten minutes, and I think it was a quarter to four o'clock when left the room—the carriage returned I think about half-past five o'clock, and the footman with it—in consequence of what the footman said, I went to the prisoner's house, which is near the Edgeware-road, but he was out—I saw his wife—I met him in the street as I came back—I followed him and said, "Mr. Godfrey, you have taken the Doctor's snuff-box in a mistake from the drawing-room"—he said, "What box? I have not taken any box "—I said, "You must have taken it, for there was no other person in the room but the cook and you "—I told him to search his pockets, as perhaps he</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 27th of April, I was on duty in Bowling-street, and took charge of the prisoner—Hodnett was close to him, and accused him of stealing a gold snuff-box—I took him towards the station-house—as we went along he threw something into an area—Haggerty went into the area, picked it up, and showed it to me—it was this gold snuff-box—I asked the prisoner how he came by it—he said he took it to take a pinch of snuff, and intended to return it again—I searched him at the station-house, and found a pocket-book with some papers, ten duplicates, and another snuff-box—I believe there was no snuff in that—I have produced the gold box here—it has been in the care of the superintendent—he is not here—it is the same box which Haggerty showed me—I know it by a mark, and the size of it—there is no particular mark on it.</p>

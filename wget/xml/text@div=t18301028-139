               <p>JOHN CORTI. The prisoner never paid me either of these sums of money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told Mr. Corti he was to take it out of my wages at the same time. Witness. I did not owe him any.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He will owe me 8l. - I brought the money, and said I had received so and so, but I had spent part of it, and he should take it from my wages; he said very well - he now wants to take me off from my employ, as he has got persons who can do better than I can; he knows I brought him a good connexion, and now he does not care for me - I was agent to a respectable house before, and I reduced myself to go to him.</p>
               <p>JOHN CORTI. He did not tell me he had received this money, and made use of part of it - I was going for the money, as I wanted to make up a bill: I saw the prisoner change colour - I then went, and found he had had it; I had dealt with these persons before.</p>

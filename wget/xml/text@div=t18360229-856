                  </hi>. On the 15th of February, about twelve o'clock at night, I was in Joiner—street, Borough—a gentleman call out, "You are robbed"—I turned round and saw three person cress over—I seized the middle one—he said, "That is not the one, it is the other"—I then seized the prisoner, and accused him of stealing my handkerchief—he said he had not got it—but he put his hand in his pocket and drew it out immediately—this is it—it is mine—the prisoner was close to me when he was pointed out—I had not felt it taken.</p>

I was on the opposite side of the road—the prisoner and two other were walking together in company—the prosecutor was on before them them—I saw the prosecutor's coat—tail lifted up, and his handkerchief being drawn from his pocket—I could not tell for a moment whether it was the prisoner or a companion, but I saw the prisoner withdraw his hand with the handkerchief in it, and put it into his pocket—I called to the prosecutor, and pointed the prisoner out—he denied having the handkerchief—I said he had got it—he then put his hand into his breeches pocket and gave it in to the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, and live in Pitt-street, Peck<lb></lb>ham. On the 17th of December I was going through the Broadway, Deptford, at twelve o'clock at night—I had had something to drink—I passed the three prisoners—they were together, and appeared to be talking to one another—they made some remark, and followed me fifty yards—they were walking my way—after I had got some distance they came behind me—I suspect it was the whole three—they pushed against me—there was more than one, but they came behind me, and I could not see very well—im<lb></lb>mediately I turned, and saw Dunbar and Harrod running in the road—I did not see where Bartlett was—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed my purse—I ran, and overtook Dunbar—I said, "You have robbed me"—she said, "Here is your purse, it was not me that took it, it was the other girl," giving it to me—Harrod was then gone on—there had been 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my purse—it was gone—I gave her into custody—Harrod was taken about ten minutes after—this is my purse.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 104.) I saw the three pri<lb></lb>soners together about twelve o'clock—I heard of the robbery about ten minutes after—I then met Harrod and Bartlett going towards Deptford—afterwards I met Harrod going the other way—I took her—she said it was Dunbar that took the purse—I found near the place some stockings and other thing, and Bartlett accused Dunbar of taking them from her—I found 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper on Harrod, but no silver—when Harrod came to the station she said it was the other girl that left her shoe—there was a shoe of Bartlett's found there.</p>

                  </hi>. Bartlett was brought to the station, and said she had lost a great many things herself—my Inspector and I were coming down Dept<lb></lb>ford Broadway, and the other constable was coming down Deptford-bridge, and this was done between us—Harrod bad not got a hundred yards—the prosecutor was drunk at the time—Dunbar was taken on the spot—we were looking with three lamps the whole night, but we could only find a four-penny-piece, and Bartlett's property.</p>

            . I keep a little coal shed and an old horse and cart in the Edgeware road, Paddington side. On the 16th of February, returning from my stable I met Smith and Richards, Smith had something tied in a blue apron, and Richards had a sack upon his left shoulder apparently very heavy; I met

            , I desired him to follow me. I heard the prisoner Smith say to Richards let us cross over the road, they crossed over, I said to Richards, you seem very heavy loaded (it was about half after six in the morning just getting light); I asked him what he had got, he said he had got nothing, I insisted upon seeing, he said he would see me b - r first. Richards said if I wanted the stuff I might have it, and down he threw it. Smith rather refused putting his down, I insisted upon it, he put the blue apron down and then the lead was uppermost, the apron was not big enough to cover it completely. I told them they had got what I thought they had, for our neighbourhood had been infested with such sort of people; Smith said I might have it if I would, I replied I must have you as well as the lead; he run away as hard as he could, I ran after him and knocked him down, I secured him, Richards made his escape. I stopped with the lead and Smith till he was brought back to me; we delivered the lead to the constables.</p>

               <p>- THORP. I am a gardener, I live at Lisson green. Last Monday between six and seven in the morning I was going to my work up Edgeware road; I met the two prisoners as before described; afterwards I met Rous, he was near an hundred yards behind Smith and Richards, he had a bundle with him tied up in a pocket handkerchief, I heard the cry of stop thief, Rous immediately put the bundle he was carrying into a garden as he was walking along; then I followed Rous and took him, a man that was talking with me went and brought the lead out of the garden. Rous begged for mercy and said if I would let him go I might take the lead; it was about thirty pound of sheet lead.</p>

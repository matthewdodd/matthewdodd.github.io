                  </hi>. I keep a public-house in the Blackfriars-road. On the night of 3rd Jan. between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner and a woman named Ash came—Ash called for half a quartern of brandy, and tendered 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in payment, which I tried and found to be bad—Ash said, "It is a good one, what are you trying it for?"—I said it was a bad one, and ordered my man to call a policeman—my barmaid had called my attention to the prisoner—she was near enough to hear what had passed between me and Ash—when the policeman came I told him, in Williams's presence, that she had offered bad money to my barmaid two or three months before—Williams said nothing to that—I gave the policeman the shilling which Ash had given me—I gave them into custody.</p>

I was called to Mr. Brown's, and saw Ash and the other prisoner there—the prisoner was standing talking to Ash—Mr. Brown told me, in the prisoner's presence, that his barmaid had told him she had passed a counterfeit shilling there, some time previously—she did not make any observation, and I took her to the station—she had a basket on her arm in which I found a great number of articles, and this counterfeit shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at the bottom.</p>

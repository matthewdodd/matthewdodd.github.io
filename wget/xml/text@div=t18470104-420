                  </hi> I came home as steward on board the <hi rend="italic">Marias</hi>, from Calcutta—she arrived in the West India Dock on Wednesday week—the prisoner came on board to see for a job to take the chests up—he was told be was not required—he came again on the morning of the 31st of Dec.—he came on board, and was employed by one of the midshipmen to take chests up—while he was so employed some old shirts and trowsers were given to him—these shoes are mine, they were not given to the prisoner—they are not old ones—they are nearly new—I missed them the next morning, and hearing that the prisoner had been stopped at the gate, I went down and found them—they had been in my berth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Mr.</hi> Drew gave me lot of old things, and I asked him if these old shoes were of any use; he said, "No," and he gave them to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness. Mr.</hi> Drew is one of the midshipmen—he is a most respectable man, and is a nephew of the owner of the ship—he would not have given them away—they could not have been taken in a mistake for Mr. drew's shoes—I was in my berth at the time—my berth and Mr. Drew's are the same—I saw the old shirts and trowsers given to the prisoner—my things were under my own sleeping-place, about two or three yards from Mr. Drew's—there are four midshipmen—there were no shoes given to the prisoner, and certainly not my shoes.</p>

                  </hi> I am principal gate-keeper at the West India Dock-gate—I stopped the prisoner about four o'clock that afternoon, going out with a bundle of clothes—I asked him how he came by them—he said they were given him by the midshipman of the <hi rend="italic">Marian</hi>—I examined the bundle, and found these shoes, two handkerchiefs, two brushed, and a shirt—Mr. Drew, the midshipman, was with the prisoner—he looked at the things, and said to the prisoner, "What a thief you must be, to steal a shirt; this shirt belongs to Mr. Nursey, and you know he was asking for it to put on this morning; and after giving you all the things I have, what a thief you must be to steal the shirt"—after that, Mr. Drew said, "I will have nothing more to do with it," and he went away—Mr. Drew saw the shoes—he did not say anything about them—the prisoner did not say, "Mr. Drew, you know you gave me the shoes."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Mr. Drew came up to the gate, and Mr. Shipp said, "Where did you get these shoes?"

            . I am washerwoman; I went to wash at Mr. Grieve's on the 21st of May, at one o'clock in the morning. After I had been there about an hour and an half, I was washing the maid said she heard a noise; Mrs. Grieve went up stairs, and said, there was no harm. In about half an hour Mr. Grieve came down, and said he had a disorder in his bowels; he went in a little place backwards; I thought the necessary might be backwards; we washed in the kitchen, I was in the kitchen under ground. I can't tell whether he went into the yard or no; I find since that the necessary is up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay below?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. He returned up stairs directly. The alarm of fire was about half an hour after this; upon which we went to the door. Mr. Grieve came to the door; I went and called the turn-cock; when I came back again, Mr. Grieve was moving some things out.</p>
               <p>Q. What were those things?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. They were tyed up in bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at that time?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. He wanted a little water to drink, I said he had better have something in it. I saw a woman in her shift, crying out, Fire! I only saw the woman, I did not see-where the fire was. The people came and said, Mr. Grieve, the fire is in the stable, you need not move any more. He said he would go up stairs, and see how things were; several people went up with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. When he came down he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110023"></xptr> more than his shirt on; when he came to the door he had on his coat and waistcoat, a white cap, and his shoes and stockings.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he complained he was ill did you hear him say for what purpose he came down?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. He said he had a disorder in his bowels.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say that he wanted to go to any place to get some liquor?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he went backwards: do you know where he went to?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He went up stairs again, and there was an alarm of fire, you say?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think, the first thing he did was to endeavour to save his property?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the window up stairs command any view of the stable?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. I never was up stairs in my life till afterwards.</p>

            . I live at the lodge at Clement's Inn, I am porter and butler to the society; I rented the stable that was on fire, of Mr. Wingrave, at the Lamb Inn.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see the stable before the fire?</p>
               <p>Almon. I was at the stable at ten o'clock over night.</p>
               <p>Q. How many horses does the stable hold?</p>
               <p>Almon. Two; I had only one at home. I had a candle in a lanthorn with me, but the candle was never out of the lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other way to the stable but by the door?</p>
               <p>Almon. Not that I know of. Between three and four in the morning I was alarmed with the fire. I went to the stable; it began at the farthest end from Mr. Grieve's house, as far as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence did you conjecture that?</p>
               <p>Almon. Because that end was on fire; the other was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation upon any circumstances that led you to think any thing particular set it on fire?</p>
               <p>Almon. I found two bunches of matches in the stable, one of which had been lighted; I am no: positive whether the other had or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing extinguish them?</p>
               <p>Almon. The litter where the matches laid was damp, and I believe that extinguished them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the stable fastened as you left it?</p>
               <p>Almon. A neighbour had been kind enough to break it open, and let the horse out.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant is this stable from the prisoner's house?</p>
               <p>Almon. It joins to his back yard; there is a window from the stable into his back yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What height from the ground?</p>
               <p>Almon. About a yard; there was a light inside shutter to it, which hung so that a person might open it with one finger.</p>
               <p>Q. Might a person put any thing into that window from the prisoner's yard?</p>
               <p>Almon. Yes; and I believe a person might touch the hay-loft.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they put any thing into the hay lost?</p>
               <p>Almon. Yes, any thing of a light weight.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Did that wooden window belong to the hay-loft or the stable?</p>
               <p>Almon. To the stable. The hay-loft was all on fire at the other end.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said just now, the fire was on the outside?</p>
               <p>Almon. It was both on the outside and inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the fire appear to be in that part where the matches were?</p>
               <p>Almon. The matches were in the middle of the stable; the fire was at the farther end from the prisoner's house. These are the matches; (producing two bunches of remarkable large matches; two or three matches upon one bucnb were a little singed) I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. How do you get the hay and straw into the lost if there is no door to it?</p>
               <p>Almon. There is a trap-door in the middle of the stable.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any lease of Wingrave for this stable?</p>
               <p>Almon. No; I rent it for two guineas per year; I have had it from the latter end of March last.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the lanthorn no open holes in it, that you carried to the stable the night before the fire?</p>
               <p>Almon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said to any body that there were holes in the lanthorn?</p>
               <p>Almon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And the fire was at the farthest end from Grieve's house, and from the window you have been speaking of?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110024"></xptr>Almon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, a man might put his hand up into the window, and into the hay-loft?</p>
               <p>Almon. A man might, if he had a long arm, for the bars of the window are as high as the hay-loft.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the other end where the fire was?</p>
               <p>Almon. About six yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the matches?</p>
               <p>Almon. Opposite the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of the straw or litter burnt about these matches?</p>
               <p>Almon. The engine had been playing a good while before I found them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any straw at all singed or black about where the matches lay?</p>
               <p>Almon. I really will not say, it had the appearance of being set fire to. When I saw the fire, it had the appearance as if done from something at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the fire began on the outside of the stable opposite Mr. Grieve's house, or the inside?</p>
               <p>Almon. When I saw it, it was on fire on both outside and inside.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Was the lost burnt through atthe time you saw it, or only burnt at one end?</p>
               <p>Almon. It was not burnt through when I saw it first.</p>

            . I let out this stable from time to time to different tenants; there was formerly a communication with the inn. I lay within three yards of the place that the fire began in; I was alarmed about twenty minutes or half an hour past three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hire this stable all together with the inn as one inn?</p>
               <p>Wingrave. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you take these premises?</p>
               <p>Wingrave. Fourteen years ago; I have a lease of them; there were two men in it when I took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they continue to hold the stable from your taking the inn?</p>
               <p>Wingrave. No; they left off keeping horses.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first came into possession, you took the inn distinct by itself, did not you?</p>
               <p>Wingrave. I did; I had nothing to do with the stable then: when

               <p>- Woodward. I am a fire-man. I was called up between the hours of three and four to the fire at this stable; St. Clement's engine and another were playing upon it. We got it under, and a man belonging to the stable came and said, Here is what set my stable on fire, I believe; here are two bunches of matches.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it or not in the power of any person to put any thing into the hay-loft from Mr. Grieve's yard?</p>
               <p>Woodward. There is a trap-door out of Mr. Grieve's yard that you might put any thing out of his yard into the hay-loft: there was a hole I could put my arm through, in what we call a weather-board, at the next end to Mr. Grieve's house.</p>

            . I deal in coals; I live next door but one to Mr. Grieve's. About a quarter or half an hour after three, I can't be punctual to the time, I was alarmed with the fire; this stable that was on fire was just behind my house, between me and Mr. Grieve's. I went to go up an alley to go to the stable-door; there I saw two boxes with a candle alight in them, and a third with a whole candle not lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you alone then?</p>
               <p>Briddel. No; several people came before I came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose abundance of people had been there before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing you observed particular in the boxes?</p>
               <p>Briddel. I took them into my own shop, and set them on the compter, and put the candles out. After the boxes were gone, I observed a great deal of wet, which I supposed to be oil, that ran through the boxes whilst they stood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any other contents of the boxes, besides what you have mentioned?</p>
               <p>Briddel. I did not examine them any further at that time; I gave them to the high-constable about eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might these boxes be from the prisoner's house at the time you found them?</p>
               <p>Briddel. There is only one house between his house and this alley; the boxes stood against the door that leads into my shop; there was a door that opens in the middle of the alley that we don't make use of; I laid small wood for lighting fires on the inside against that door; these drawers were placed so close to that door that one of the candles had singed the paint on my door.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110025"></xptr>Q. But before this time Grieve had been removing his things out of his house; had he not every thing in confusion?</p>
               <p>Briddel. I was in confusion in my own family; I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the stable were these candles?</p>
               <p>Briddel. Fourteen or fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>Q. They could not possibly burn the stable in the situation they were in?</p>
               <p>Briddel. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there shop-books in these drawers?</p>
               <p>Briddel. There were some papers in the drawers I saw, but I did not examine them while they were in my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the candles fixed in the boxes?</p>
               <p>Briddel. One in a corner in each drawer; one of the candles had turned down, and laid hold of the wood of the drawer; I rubbed the fire out of the wood with my finger and thumb.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these candles open in the drawer?</p>
               <p>Briddel. Yes, burning as if in a candlestick.</p>
               <p>Court. The alarm of fire had been a long time before this, had it not?</p>
               <p>Briddel. I went down as soon as I had got my clothes on.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a good many people, were there not?</p>
               <p>Briddel. There might be ten or a dozen.</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution. I suppose the candles were burnt down a little?</p>
               <p>Briddel. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Court. How long might these two candles be in the other box?</p>
               <p>Briddel. One was not much longer than my finger.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether these candles were not brought by people who ran out in a hurry in the middle of the night to see the fire?</p>
               <p>Briddel. If the people did bring the candles, I don't know how the drawers came there.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it at all likely, that if Mr. Grieve wanted to set fire to your house, that he would stick candles open in a drawer against the door of your house?</p>

               <p>Briddel. I can't account for his reasons.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Do you know any thing about opening the stable-door?</p>
               <p>Briddel. When I came out the stable-door was not open; the fire was broke out on that side next my house; I took the boxes into my house, and then I went up stairs to endeavour to save some of my own effects. The stable-door was broke open soon after, and the horse taken out.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose this alarm of fire was what called you up?</p>
               <p>Briddel. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you was some time a getting up?</p>
               <p>Briddel. Some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Every body that went to the stable up this passage must pass by these candles?</p>
               <p>Briddel. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time the fire of the stable was very high, was it not?</p>
               <p>Briddel. It had burnt up, and I was afraid of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose Mr. Grieve was moving his drawers and put these books in them, might not any people that had been alarmed by fire, put the candles upright, for the sake of making a light?</p>
               <p>Briddel. It was pretty light, we did not light a candle in our room: before I put my clothes on, I saw the person that cried fire, in her shift.</p>
               <p>Sampson Rainsford. I am high-constable. I lay at my house at Enfield, I came home on horseback. When I came to the watch-house Mr. Grieve was conducted there by the constable. I went down to the house; Mr. Briddel told me that he had found three drawers in his passage, two of which had lighted candles in them. The church-warden was along with me; I said, let us see if we can't find places that these drawers will fit: he gave me three drawers; the drawers had greasy shop-books and some bits of candles in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these papers greased in the manner they are now?</p>
               <p>Rainsford. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they the prisoner's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Rainsford. They appear to be the same handwriting as his books are kept in; there is a letter directed to Mr. Grieve in the drawer. I found a place in the prisoner's shop where all the three drawers fitted exactly. There was a quantity of oil in the bottom of the drawers. He confessed they were his drawers before Sir

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110026"></xptr>Rainsford. No; he did not say any thing about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have these drawers been in your possession ever since?</p>
               <p>Rainsford. No; in Mr. Crocker's.</p>
               <p>Q. from jury. What part of the shop did they come from?</p>
               <p>Rainsford. There is a plan drawn out; I can point it out in the plan. It was at the end of his compter, a little place cut out; there were three hanging grooves that just held these drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they handy to take out at the time of the fire?</p>
               <p>Rainsford. I can say nothing of that.</p>
               <p>- Crocker. I received these drawers of Mr. Briddel; I had them out of his shop about eight o'clock; they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they now contain the same things?</p>
               <p>Crocker. Yes, they do, and nothing more, except the brown paper I put at the top of them when I first had them; I put them in a closet, and the oil ran through the bottom of the drawers, and wetted the place where they stood.</p>
               <p>Court to Briddel. If the prisoner had designed to set your house on fire, would he not have put it in such a situation as to set the drawer on fire?</p>
               <p>Briddel. The drawer was on fire; I said, I put it out.</p>
               <p>- Battison. I was at the stable about twenty minutes after three. I brought my engine into the yard; the stable was on fire; I went over the wall; I got it out; then I went into the lost with my branch; the lost was on fire on that part next Temple Bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the farthest end from Mr. Grieve's house?</p>
               <p>Battison. Yes, two yards and fourteen inches. The fire was in the inside of the lost, it burnt right up. In about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after I had got it out, there was an alarm of fire in the fore garret. We got that out: after that the two pair of stairs was on fire, the back room on the other side of the house; the fire issued through the frames of the window; we put that out in about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>- Woodward. I am a fire-man. I got to the stable about twenty minutes before four; the stable was on fire; the fire seemed to begin in the hay-loft; the top was fell in. After we had got it out, Mr. - the church-warden, said, he thought it was done on purpose. As we were standing in the street talking, he said there was smoke coming out of the fore garret; I said, that is impossible. He looked up, and said, Gad! there is. I ran up stairs with two more fire-men with me; when we came up to the garret, the door was locked; we broke it open, and there was a large wicker basket full of lighted paper, rags, hats, wigs, &amp;c. they lay upon a sort of rack; the basket was upon a rack of clothes. I burst the door open; the flames flew out; I got in; I could not get out again. I cried for Christ's sake for help. I threw out many different suits of clothes that were on fire. I knocked my elbow through the window, and if a man had not come to me, I should have been suffocated.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in that cradle or basket?</p>
               <p>Woodward. Paper and rags, &amp;c. it cracked and burnt like hemp.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fire place-in the room?</p>
               <p>Woodward. I did not see any at all; the door was locked, and the windows were shut. In a few minutes time the two pair of stairs backwards was all on fire, I can't say how long after this; and there seemed to be a place where a candle had stood, at the head of the bed; the furniture of the bed was all on fire; it was greased and tallowed all over; we got it out after. When we have done, it is a common thing with us to make a bill to carry to the office, which is signed by the sufferer; as we were drawing off for that purpose, there came an alarm that the pawnbroker's house was on fire again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after the fire in the two pair of stairs?</p>
               <p>Woodward. An hour, or an hour and a half, I believe; the fire was now in the shop, the door was locked, and the prisoner said he had given the key to Mr. Bean, a shoe-maker. I sent to him, and he sent word, he had not had the key. We got into the shop, and the old wigs and papers, &amp;c. were all on fire; we pulled them down: as one of the fire-men had a quantity of the paper on fire in his hand, pulling it down, Grieve made a catch at him to prevent him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any communication between the fore garret and the two pair of stairs back room?</p>
               <p>Woodward. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there between the two pair of stairs room and the shop?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110027"></xptr>Woodward. No, not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Grieve say, or how did he behave upon this affair in the shop?</p>
               <p>Woodward. He wanted to snatch the fire out of our hands, as I said, and not to carry it into the street; he looked very pale, indeed; he stood very still in a corner of the shop whilst I was putting it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at that time endeavour to remove any thing out of the shop?</p>
               <p>Woodward. I did not see that he did.</p>

            . I am a fire-man. I was called to this fire between the hours of three and four; when I got there our engine was there. I saw a fire coming out of the fore garret of Grieve's house. I made the best speed I could to get our engine ready for working. I could not get water to my engine, so I went up into the garret, thinking I might extinguish it with buckets; they were heaving clothes out; the fire was put out; the garret was warm in the cieling.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the fire communicate from that room to any other room?</p>
               <p>Meaden. That I thought impossible. I went out at the window to examine the roof; while I was examining the roof a man came up stairs, and said, Make haste down, there is a fire in another part of the house. I went down to the two pair of stairs back room, the tester of the bed was on fire; I throwed a bucket of water over it and extinguished it. I found it smoked very much; when the smoke was cleared out of the room, I went in and examined the bed: upon the head of the bed there was a circle of grease, I believe as big as the palm of my hand, and there was grease upon the bolster, the pillow, the blankets and quilt, which I took to be candle-grease.</p>
               <p>Q. When the fire in that room was extinguished, did any fire break out in any other part of the house?</p>
               <p>Meaden. I was in the street; we had drawn the engine away; Mr. Grieve stood at the door; he came to me, and said, I wish you would come this way, for there is a fire in the shop. I said, Where is the key? He said, he had given it to a man, one Mr. Bean, to look after the shop, about an hour before. We broke open the shop-door; when I came through the entry, he said, Don't break open that door, here is a door more convenient. When I came there it was very dark, I asked for a light; the maid went down and struck a light; while she was so doing, I returned back to the passage; there was a square pane of glass which I looked through, and I perceived more light than could arise from a candle. I forced the door open; on a shelf on the left side there was fire; I throwed some water over it, and extinguished it: after that I examined what it was; it appeared to be paper boxes and such things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any communication between the two pair of stairs and the shop?</p>
               <p>Meaden. I look upon it as impossible; I call them three separate fires.</p>
               <p>Court. You say, Mr. Grieve desired you not to break open that door, but come another way; how came you not to go that way?</p>
               <p>Meaden. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Then he was not averse to your coming into the room, because he shewed you a door?</p>
               <p>Meaden. He was not against my going into that room.</p>
               <p>Court. For what reason did you understand that he had given the key of the shop; was it not because there had been a fire in the house?</p>
               <p>Meaden. He told me he had had the key above an hour.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Grieve himself desired you would come and look at his shop; did he not?</p>
               <p>Meaden. Yes.</p>

            . I am a church-warden of the parish. I found these matches in Mr. Grieve's house; (producing several bunches of remarkable large matches) his maid-servant gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they a common sort of matches, or not?</p>
               <p>Marshal. I never saw any before in our parish like them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you compared the matches found in the stable with these?</p>
               <p>Marshal. Yes; they seem the same sort of matches; they are larger than any I ever saw.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Smith. I lived servant with Mr. Grieve.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time buy any matches any where?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; I bought them at Wapping.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to buy matches at Wapping?</p>
               <p>Smith. I was complaining to Mrs. Grieve that our matches were not good; I said, I would bring some good ones from Wapping, which she ordered me to do; I bought two pennyworth.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these matches that you gave Mr. Marshal part of them?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe the matches that were found in the stable are part of them?</p>

               <p>Q. How many bunches had you for your twopence?</p>
               <p>Smith. I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the fire was it that you bought them?</p>
               <p>Smith. A fortnight or three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you used any of these matches?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those matches that were sold in the neighbourhood of the same sort?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; they were smaller.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver any bunches of these matches to Mr. Marshal?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; I gave him all that was left.</p>

               <p>Mr. Rainsford. They were appraised by six capital pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>- Brookes. I am a pawnbroker. The next day after this fire happened, myself, with five other pawnbrokers, took an account of Mr. Grieve's stock.

               <p>Brookes. I did not see any. We only valued the stock, not the houshold furniture.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body attend upon the prisoner's behalf?</p>
               <p>Brookes. His wife was present in the house, and at the vestry.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think there was 300 l. worth of plate?</p>
               <p>Brookes. No, nor 150 l.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there over and above what you valued, any quantity of apparel?</p>
               <p>Brookes. No; we made the most of every thing.</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution. When you made a valuation of these things, did you examine the books with regard to the pawns?</p>
               <p>Brookes. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you find these things that were pawned in the month of May?</p>
               <p>Brookes. Some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the greatest part there, or missing?</p>
               <p>Brookes. I believe, missing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Burnet. Did you understand that the whole of Mr. Grieve's effects were sent to your house, or that they were dispersed in different parts of the neighbourhood?</p>

               <p>Burnet. I went to the fire, and left my door in care of a gentleman that lodged at my house; when I came back again, the shop was full.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Brookes. Did you ask the servant whether any of his goods were carried to particular places?</p>
               <p>Brookes. I did not: I was asked by Mr. Rainsford, to assist in taking the stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any one pawnbroker appeared on the part of Mr. Grieve at the time this valuation was taken?</p>

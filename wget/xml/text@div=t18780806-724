               <p>July, about 11.15 p.m., I was walking home and saw three men and two women—one woman said "Now is the time," and three men set upon me—(he prisoner is one of them—they knocked me down, knocked my head on the ground, and one of them knelt on me and took my watch and chain—they then turned to my father, who was with me, and took his chain—I saw the prisoner about 4 a.m with ten others, and picked him out—I have not the slightest doubt of him.</p>

"About a quarter to 11 on Sunday morning I was standing at the corner of Brick Lane, and three men asked me to take a walk with them.

An hour after they came running by, and they said, if I wanted anything out of what they had got, they would stick a knife into me. I was taken to the station.

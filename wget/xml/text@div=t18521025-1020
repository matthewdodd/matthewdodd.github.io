                  </hi>. I am the wife of David Donald, I keep a chandler's shop in New Compton-street. I know the Rev. Mr. Welch, he is one of the curates of St. Giles's-in-the-Fields; I am in the habit of delivering goods to some poor people on his orders. On 4th Oct. a little boy brought what appeared to be one of Mr. Welch's tickets—this is it; it says, "Mrs. Donald</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185210250023"></xptr>
               <p>will please to give bearer two ounces of tea, half a pound of sugar, and two pounds of bread. William Welch: Oct 4th, 1852"—This is the usual form of Mr. Welch's tickets—I let the boy have two ounces of tea, half a pound of sugar, and two pounds of bread—when the boy went out of the shop I watched him, and saw him give the goods to the prisoner, who was about three doors from my shop—the prisoner went away with the goods, and the boy went with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was acting as curate of St. Giles's-in-the Fields. I have been in the habit of giving tickets for the delivery of goods to the poor—this order is something like my writing, but it is not—I had seen the prisoner the day before; he came to me for relief; I refused him, not knowing him—I said I should have the case investigated, and if it required relief he should have it—I generally insert the name of the bearer in the ticket, which is just the difference between this ticket and mine—I do not know anything of Blanch.</p>

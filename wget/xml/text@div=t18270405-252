            . On the 15th of March, between nine and ten o'clock, I met the prisoner with a bag of books; I asked him what he had got; he said, a little waste paper; he said it was given to him by a person in Old'Change, but he afterwards said Watling-street, and he took me to the place; I produce seventeen account books, which I took from the prisoner.</p>

            . I was porter to the late Mr. Jackson, who lived at No. 94, Watling-street - Mr. Thompson has the care of his property since his death. On the morning in question I gave the prisoner a lighted candle to go into the cellar to take the dust - I went into a back cellar to clean boots - the books laid in the corner near where the dust was - I missed them afterwards; I am sure I did not tell him to take them; I did not see him take them away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did you not say any thing to him about the books? A. No; the cellar is a dark place; there were boxes and other things there - I cannot say how many books there were; he is the regular dustman, I suppose; I did not watch him, because I had no idea he would take the books; I did not miss the books for an hour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The books were covered among the dust.</p>

On the 24th of November last I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment; the prisoner lived with me till the 23d or 24th, and then went away; after she left me I missed these things; they were all in the house when she came to the lodgings, and they were all missed after she left it; I missed them the very same day, or a day after; I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>What time of the day did she go away? - It was between six and seven; I heard her on the stairs then, and never saw her after, till she was taken; I found part of my things at No. 14, in the same street, where I live; I found some more at Mr. Jackson's, White-hart-yard.</p>
               <p>Was any promise or threats made use of to induce her to make this confession? - None at all; she had sold some to Mr. Mills, Little Drury-lane, some to Mr. Jackson, White-hart-yard, and the bed down in Cross-street, the bottom of Newton's-lane.</p>
               <p>Was you present with Scott when he went to look after it? - No, but I went to fetch some of it yesterday to bring here.</p>
               <p>(Some of the property produced; the rest not brought because they were so cumbersome.)</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner own to you that she had disposed of such and such things, some at Mills's, and some at Jackson's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the value of all those things you did find? - I suppose they might be about a guinea, or two and twenty shillings.</p>

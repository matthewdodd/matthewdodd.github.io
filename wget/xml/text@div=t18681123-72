I am a detective officer, of Woolwich—on 7th October my attention was called to some men at the North Kent beer-shop—the prisoner is one of them—I watched them—Mr. Doar, who is since dead, was with them—I saw the prisoner come out of the parlour, holding the deceased by the arm—it was very dark—I watched them about 100 yards to the Arsenal Railway Station, where the prisoner left the deceased and ran away—I ran after him, about 150 yards, and caught him in the square in front of the Arsenal gate—he was carrying this umbrella (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he had a walking-stick also—I said that I was a police-officer, and asked whose umbrella he had got in his hand—he said, "It is mine"—I said, "I believe you have been robbing a gentleman, and giving him some snuff in some ale for the purpose of doing so"—he said, "It is an umbrella belonging to a friend of mine"—I said, "Who is your friend?"—he said he did not know—I left him in charge of the man at the Arsenal gate, and went back to the Arsenal Railway Station, 150 yards off, and found the deceased standing against the wall, almost insensible—I was obliged to hire a cab to take him to the station—he was sensible enough there to identify his umbrella—the prisoner was brought there, charged with drugging with intent to steal—I went back to the North Kent Tavern and the landlord handed me this bottle and contents—there was a little more then, as it has been analyzed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. It is not feasible that I should tell a strange man what I was going to do. The gentleman was perfectly stupid. On board the steamboat he asked if I was going to London. I said, "Yes; and then to Portsmouth, to join Her Majesty's service again." When we got out of the steamboat, at Woolwich, I told the gentleman I was going to look for my brother. I took him to the first public-house. We went into the club-room and had some ale. I then went to see if my brother had come. I returned to the gentleman and we had some half and half. I then went to the closet, and when I went back a man who was there said, "Your friend has gone out;" but he came back again. I followed him. We went to another house. I asked the gentleman if he would have anything more to drink. He said, "Yes;" and a young man who was there said, "You take this pot, and you will see a lark presently." I did not let the landlady have it, but took it to him, and he gave it to the old gentleman to drink. When I saw the colour of it I said, "We will go." I took the umbrella in my hand, and said, "If you will stand here I will go and get my box; I will join you before you get to the station. The policeman overtook me and said, "Whose umbrella have you got?" I do not deny saying that it was mine. I have always got my living by hard work. I am a private in Her Majesty's service.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid to Mr. Cousins, at the Steelyard, Thames-street—the prisoner was nursery-maid at the same place. I had three sovereigns and two half-sovereigns in my box, which was locked, and the key was between the mattrass and the bed—I went to my box on the 8th of Feb., and my money was gone—the prisoner was searched by Beale, and three sovereigns and one half-sovereign found in the toe of her stocking on her foot, it was wrapped in a piece of paper, which I believe was the paper my money was in, but I could not swear to it.</p>

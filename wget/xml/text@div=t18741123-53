I am a clerk in the service of the London General Omnibus Company, Limited, and am engaged at the Shoreditch Office—I have known the prisoner about six months as a conductor in the Company's service—in August last he was conductor of omnibus 1,304—we <hi rend="italic">give</hi> out way <hi rend="italic">bills</hi> similar to these; a sufficient number for the day's journeys; this omnibus had eight journeys each way, between Shoreditch and Camberwell—there is a place inside the door in which these forms are placed—it is the conductor's duty as each passenger pays him to mark the figure against the fare paid, at the end of the journey to put the way bill in a box at the office, and at the end of the day to make a summary of his way bills and return it with the money to the office the following morning—it is the duty of my assistant, Mr. Pilkington, to go through the way bills to see that the summary agrees with them and enter it in the book; he checks the way bills and I take the money and the summary—I have here the summary of the 7.45 journey from Camber well Gate to Shoreditch on 26th August; the entry is three 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. passengers and fourteen 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making together seventeen, and the amount 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the next journey, 9.48, from Camberwell to Shoreditch is stated as fifteen 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. passengers, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—on 27th the 7.45 journey from Camberwell Gate to Shoreditch is two 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. passengers and eleven 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the 8.43 journey is three 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and thirteen 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making sixteen passengers, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I produce the summary for these two days and they agree with the way <hi rend="italic">bills.</hi>

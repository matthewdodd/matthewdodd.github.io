            Did you at any time miss any articles or your property - A. Several times. On the 12th of June I returned home about six o'clock in the afternoon, and in consequence of information I received. I waited till the prisoner returned home; I then him I had been informed that he had got two pocket books and desired him to produce them. He told me that he had returned them from whence he took them. I knew that to be the case, I had taken them from the drawer into the accompting-house prior to my speaking to him. I said, these are the two pocket books that you took, he said, well master I returned them from where I took them from, and I hope you will think no more about it. As I had frequently missed things, I thought it right to have the business investigated; I sent for an officer, he came, and the prisoner was taken into custody. I sent another officer to his lodgings.</p>
               <p>- SHERRARD. I am warehouse man to Mr. Openheim. On the 12th of June, I sent some goods out of my master's warehouse. As the prisoner was loading the truck, he stooped forward to speak to me, two pocket books sell out of his bosom; I asked him how he came by them, he answered that they were given him by Mr. Foudriner, our stationer. He took them up and replaced them in his bosom; I informed my master I knew they were Mr. Openheims property as they lay upon the ground, they are a particular make.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them pocket books afterwards - A. Yes, I saw them in the drawer afterwards, and I saw Mr. Openheim take them out of the drawer.</p>
               <p>- WOODROW I am extra officer for the City. I am a warehouseman to Mr. Openheim. On the 12th of June, in the evening, I was sent to the prisoner's lodging, in Hun Alley East Smithfied.</p>

            Did you know where the prisoner lodged - 
               <persName id="t18110710-2-person66">A. </persName>
            Not before Mr. Openheim told me.</p>

            Who did you find at his lodgings - A. No one at all, his wife came a minute or two afterwards. I told her what I had come about, and went in and searched; and in a box on the table I found fifteen pieces of sponge, tied up in a handkerchief, and fifteen thread cases, they were in the box I gave these things to Kennersley, the officer. I had no conversation with the prisoner,</p>
               <p>FRANCIS KENNERSLEY. I am an officer of Portsoken Ward.</p>

            Do you know Mr. Openheim's warehouse - A. Yes, it is in the County. When Mr. Openheim told me that he had been robbed by the prisoner, I apprehended him. The prisoner acknowledged that he had taken these two bill cases for a friend, he was sorry for it, he did not mean to make a property of them I then whispered to Mr. Openheim to dispatch some body to his lodgings before the wife went to his lodgings. I had these two pocket books at the time, I had received them of Mr. Openheim; when I had lodged the prisoner in the Whitechapel watchouse; I returned to Mr. Openheim's house; he said he had dispatched some body to the prisoner's lodgings, and as we were going to East Smithfield, we met Woodrow, with these thread cases and the sponge He delivered then, to me; they have been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence Those two pocket books which they occured I had in my possession, I did not n make any property of them; I returned them and left them in the same place.</p>

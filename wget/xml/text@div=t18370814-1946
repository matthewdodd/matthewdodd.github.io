                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer. I know the house No. 10, Frederick-place—it is not inhabited, but there are goods in it—it belongs to William Gray—I was at work on some premises at the back, on the 9th of August—I had left a tool behind, and went to the back wall to get it—I was going to get over the wall, when I heard a noise at No. 10, as if people were in it, and it struck me that there was some one stealing out the goods—I saw no one come out of the house—I went directly to get assistance, and ran to my master's house—after I went round to get assistance, I got the collector at the front door, and went round to the back, and there were two persons running away—I did not take them, but they were taken half an hour afterwards—I did not see their faces—one of them had a coat on his arm, the other had a flannel jacket on—the prisoner was taken without a coat—they had both thrown their coats off in the chase—after they were taken, I went into the house of No. 10, and saw window sashes in the kitchen, which had been removed—the other sashes had been began to be bored—I have the other halves—the boy Nightingale was with me.</p>

                  </hi>. Kemp came to me, and said there was a noise in the house, and I remained in the yard—he said, "Stop there, and I will go and get some assistance"—I saw two men come and get over the wall—they had their coats on then—they pulled off their coats in Phil<lb></lb>pot-street</p>

               <p>—I followed them—they ran, and when they pulled their coats off, one threw his coat down, the other carried it on his arm—they ran down the Commercial-road—I was pretty near when they got over the wall—I am quite certain the prisoner was one—I followed them into East Smithfield—there the prisoner was taken—the other man I lost sight of.</p>

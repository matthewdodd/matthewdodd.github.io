                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City polic-constable, No. </hi> 671.) I was on duty in Bishops<lb></lb>gate-street on Friday evening, the 2nd of April, about a quarter-past eight o'clock—I saw Johnson with a heavy load on his shoulder and watched him—I was met by another officer, whom I directed to shot Johnson, which he did, and, not being satisfied with the account he gave me, I took him to the station—his bundle consisted of 16000 nails—he said he was ordered to take them to a place in Brick-lane—I ascertained that they had been stolen from Mr. Chambers's warehouse, in Bishopsgate-street—on the Sunday morning fol<lb></lb>lowing I was informed that Hounslow had taken a quantity of poison in con<lb></lb>sequence of being suspected of the robbery—I spoke to him, and said he was a very silly fellow for taking the poison—he said it was in consequence of this job—I asked him whether he saw Johnson take these things on the night in question—he said he did, and that he saw him take some on another occasion—Hounslow is the prosecutor's coachman, and the warehouse these nails were taken from is over the stable—he said he told Johnson that he would get <hi rend="italic">them</hi> into trouble, meaning himself and others.</p>

                  </hi> I manage the prosecutor's business. Johnson was a helper there, and would have access to the premises—Hounslow was very unhappy, and I asked if he had any hand in this transaction—he said, "Yes; Johnson saw some nails under the bench, and he said to me, 'Can't I have a few sometimes? I shall not bring you into trouble' "—I said, "Had you anything to do with this transaction?"—he said, "I had"—he did not say any more—he had taken poison then, and his wife begged me to get a doctor—he was coachman there—he had the care of the place where these nails were—the warehouse joins the stable—Johnson had an opportunity of going into the warehouse, but not at all times—he had on the morning of the 2nd of April—these are the property of Richard Chambers and his brother.</p>

He brought me to the prisoner's mother's house. His mother was feeding a donkey at the door. I went in, and seeing them all whispering together about me, I guessed all was not right, I went out, and the prisoner followed me and shoved me up against the wall and held me there, while Pat Downs took a ten pound note, and a five pound note, out of my pocket. They both pushed off, and I made sail after the prisoner. I lost sight of him, so I came back, and boned the donkey. I was getting on his shoulders, when the prisoner came back, and I seized him; but he was rescued from us. He was afterwards secured, and taken to the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am a patrole. Seeing a mob in Drury lane, just by Charles street, I went to see what was the matter, and there I saw the prosecutor, trying to get a donkey on his shoulders. He said he had been robbed. Just then the prisoner came riding down the street, upon a donkey; and the prosecutor said he was the man that robbed him; and I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MOLES. I was in Charles-street, Drury-lane, and saw the prosecutor trying to get a donkey on his shoulders. He said he had been robbed by the people of he house at which the donkey stood.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EDWARDS. I searched the prisoner, and took from him his money. The magistrate asked him how much he laid out, and what profit he had got, and he said he had sold all his goods for twenty-seven shillings, and that was all the money he had. When we came to count the money I took from him, there were two pounds five shillings and sixpence, and some halfpence.</p>

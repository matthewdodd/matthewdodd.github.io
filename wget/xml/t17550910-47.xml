About the month of March or April last, the prisoner came to my shop, and said he wanted a plain gold ring. My wife opened the drawer to him; he look'd among them, and said, he must have one made on purpose; he chose one small one out for a pattern, and said, it must come to seventeen or eighteen shillings; and that it must be done against tomorrow. I got it done. The first time he came in a gold-laced suit; the second, he came in a silver one; very grandly dress'd both times; he ask'd for the ring; I shew'd it him; he looked at it, and liked it very well: he desired my servant might mark it; he then desired to see the drawer again, and said he must bespeak five more, to make up half a dozen for his sister's children; he look'd over the drawer, and shew'd his hands, to shew he took none away. There were none to his mind; but I was to make five according to his direction, against the next day; he went away, but never paid for the first he had bespoke, nor ever came again. In the evening of the next day , he not coming I suspected him. I ask'd for my case the rings were in, and counted the rings, and miss'd two gold rings. I did not see the prisoner till the 15th of August last. My boy going to White-chapel, to my engraver's, saw the prisoner; he inform'd me he saw the Frenchman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175509100061"></xptr> who bespoke the rings of me. I went and found him, as the boy had said; I challenged him with taking the rings; he said he was but lately come from France ; he took me by the collar, and I took him by his, and said he should go, and give an account of himself, and what was become of the rings; he at first utterly denied being in my shop; at last he beg'd for mercy, and said , he did not steal two; he stole but one. I carried him before my lord-mayor; he confess'd there he stole one, before his lordship.</p>

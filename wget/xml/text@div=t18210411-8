               <p>RICHARD PEMBERTON. When I am in town I live in Castle-street, Holborn. I am a <rs id="t18210411-8-viclabel47" type="occupation">bottle merchant</rs>

On Tuesday evening, the 3d of April, about a quarter before six, I was going down Dowgate-hill and saw Kerslake coming out of my place; he had a knot and prickle basket of bottles; when he got about twelve yards from the place I stopped him, took him back, and asked where he got them, he said he was taking them for Williams, I called Williams up, and I think he repeated it in his presence - Williams denied that he had given them to him. I took one bottle out of the prickle, I do not know how many there were, it appeared full - a prickle usually holds seventy-two bottles, which were worth about 24 s. I gave him in charge, and the officer thought it necessary to take Williams, I said I would answer for his appearance to-morrow; there were no other servants on the premises. Williams appeared intoxicated - he said Kerslake was frequently about there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. - Q. What sort of a place is it. - A. It was a place by itself, there are rooms above it. I found a vacancy were the bottles were taken from, the bottles were packed in hay, which is unusual; my horse was kept in the stable. Williams had a wound in his head, and is deaf, I think he must know they were taken - he sometimes has fits.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was coming up Dowgate-hill and saw the prosecutor lay hold of Kerslake. I crossed and took him back. I asked him, in Williams's presence, how he came by them, he said Williams helped him up with them. I asked where he was going to take them to, he said he did not know, but he thought Williams was following him. Williams appeared in liquor, and said he knew nothing about it.</p>

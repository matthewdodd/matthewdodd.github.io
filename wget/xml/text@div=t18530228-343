                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Meyer Meyers and Co., umbrella and parasol makers in Bow-lane. On 9th Feb. I looked over the work in the warehouse, some of it bed to go downstairs to receive an addition to it, the work that was complete I took away—there was one bundle of parasols that was not complete, that I let remain—I was absent about twenty minutes—when I left, I left the prisoner and five or six others in the shop—Levin was one of them—when I came beck from dinner I was told the parasols were gone—I went and looked, and missed them—I have teen them since—it is the bundle produced by the pawnbroker—I cannot say how many parasols the bundle contained—twelve have been produced—they are my employers' property—I have also seen four ether parasols, which are my employers' property—they are the fellow parasols to the twelve—they were not finished when they were in our place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you cannot undertake to say that those produced by the pawnbroker were in the bundle that was on the counter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I only saw the sticks of them—they were tied round with a white wrapper—the sticks only were visible—I would not swear to them by the sticks—I would not undertake to swear that that was the bundle I left on the counter—I left five or six persons there—it might have been seven—I believe that was the first lot we bad made of that size and that description of sticks—it takes half an hour or three-quarters to make a parasol, or it might take an hour—I saw the prisoner again the next morning—we sent for her, and she came—I am not aware that she was very anxious to come—I heard that she was—she has been very accurate, according to the generality of them—she has been honest—we had about 100 persons in our employ—they were trusted with work to take home.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had the bundle of parasols that you left when you went to dinner, and missed afterwards, sticks like these? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—I can swear to these being my masters'—they were made by me in my room.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear that you made these? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave them out of my room to be made, and they were brought in—I will swear they were given out of my room, and taken to the persons' houses to make—it is a peculiar size—I think they are not made by other persons—I cannot swear that they are not—I cannot swear to the sticks.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in York-street, Commercial-road. I work for Mr. Meyers, in Bow-lane—I was there on 9th Feb., between 2 and 3 o'clock—I saw the prisoner there, sitting on the counter—there was a bundle behind her back—I did not take much notice of it—I believe she had a green baize before her, with work in it—she stood that against the other bundle, and threw her shawl over her arm, and said, "I should like to go to sleep"—she</p>

               <p>remained in that place about an hour or three-quarters, I cannot say—I saw her go away—when she went she took with her the two bundles that she had been sitting against on the counter—I said to her, "Halloo! what two lots?"—she said, "Yes, for two people"—she went out of the warehouse, and I saw no more of her.</p>

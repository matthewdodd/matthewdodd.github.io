               <p>Court. I do not know that, why not? - Because there is no other person about the shop that would take any thing away; the cross garnet hinges were found over a back office in a little cieling.</p>
               <p>Court. How did you get in to search? - The place was open where the cieling was, the prisoner kept the house, and he gave us leave to go in.</p>
               <p>Was it locked? - No, Sir, he had the key of the house.</p>
               <p>Was the house locked? - No, Sir, I knocked at the door, and they opened the door, I believe it is his wife, he had the apartments there, but I suppose Mr. Shepherd gave him so much a week to look after the house.</p>
               <p>His wife let you in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he any body else that lived in the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was the board found? - Behind the street door.</p>
               <p>Did some of your men lodge there? - No, Sir, they were some Bricklayers who were doing a job in the Grove.</p>
               <p>As to these bolts and these garnet hinges, were they your property? - Yes, I marked the bolts and the hinges, I missed the bolt, and found it on Mr. Shepherd's premises, I missed a great many things.</p>
               <p>Had you marked these bolts? - Yes, Sir, particularly, there was a notch cut in them, and a flaw in the egde; a particular sort of stuff; this iron was found in a field; the prisoner said they were Captain

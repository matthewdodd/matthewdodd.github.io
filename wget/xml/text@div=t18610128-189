               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were not these the instructions, that he was to furnish you with the names of the customers, and that you should receive the money yourselves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing was said about it at all—of course he must furnish me with the names, or we could not send the goods—if the persons in the country do not pay, we should send down an account for the goods which we had furnished—there was nothing said about the prisoner receiving money either way; it was merely a verbal agreement—only this one order was sent up by him to us—you are still to understand that if he received money it was not contrary to his orders, or contrary to his duty—that has not been my impression at all, quite the reverse—(<hi rend="italic">The witness deposition, being read, stated</hi>, "He had no authority to receive money on my account; I consider his receiving it contrary to his employment and duty; if he had received the money, and had sent it up to us, we should have considered it under the ordinary course of business")—that is what I stated at the police-court—I should not consider his receiving it contrary to his employment—I said so, but I think you will find that that observation was qualified afterwards by saying that we considered it under the ordinary course of business—it is an understood thing with travellers, that the customers pay the money—I do not think anything was said about receiving or paying at all—I have no recollection of his writing me a letter from Bristol just after the receipt by me of Mr. Tonkin's order—I believe if we had a letter at our house of business we should be able to find it, but we cannot find any correspondence at all from the prisoner—Tonkin had not been a customer—his name does not appear in our books at all—a statement would be sent out to him about a month after-wards—he paid it, therefore we must have sent it—we received this order in October, or it might be the latter end of Septembers—it was executed in October—I cannot tell you exactly.</p>

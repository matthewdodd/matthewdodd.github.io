                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. James Aldous, of Hammer<lb></lb>smith—the prisoner was in his service—on the 4th of Sept. I was talking to a person at the door—I had occasion to look round, and saw the prisoner at the cash—box, which contained the gold, on the back counter—he had one hand with the lid up, and the other hand in the box—I asked what business he had there, and what he had taken—he said, "Nothing"—I told him to empty his pocket—he pulled out some halfpence—I took them, and found the half—sovereign amongst them—I knew it by a mark on it—I had put it in the box the day before—I said I could swear to the half—sovereign—he took me by the arm, led me in the parlour, and said he hoped I would not mention it—it was his first offence, and he begged I would forgive him—I said, "Get out of the shop; you will be the ruin of me and my family"—I told him to get his dinner and go—he went up stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How was your family to be ruined? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am bound to make good any losses—I must account for all the stock—there are some thousands of pounds—I told him to be off about his business, or I would kick him out—I received this half—sovereign in the way of business—I had five of them on Monday morning—I do not know why I noticed this mark, but looking at the money I noticed a mark on the Britannia side—a half—sovereign could not be missed, but the accounts were short that day, and the day before—the prisoner's boxes were searched—he is not charged with stealing anything that was in his boxes—he was not searched—when I saw the prisoner at the box, and he took this out, I was talking to Mount—I left him and went in when I saw the fact—I did not bid Mount good morning—he was not close by at the time—he was gone—it was a full hour afterwards before he came</p>

               <p>and took the prisoner—I was not employed during the whole of that time in intreating the prisoner to confess—I was not with him no more than to take up his dinner—I said, "You had better have your dinner before you go"—I sent for Mount to see if there was anything in his boxes, not about the half-sovereign—when Mount came he said I should not give this half—sovereign up—I said, "I have no proof that this young man has robbed me; how shall I make out the case"—I did not wish to give him in charge.</p>

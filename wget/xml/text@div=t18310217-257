               <p>RALPH WEDGWOOD. I live in Rathbone-place. I lost this writing-case, with a number of others, the latter end of November or beginning of December - I afterwards found it at the office - it is my own manufacture; I am quite sure of it; I lost three machines for the blind at the same time - I have seen them all since; I think I must have seen them in the course of the day they were missed.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 14th of December the prisoner pawned a machine for the blind for 10s. in the name of Eliza Johnson, No.2, Jeffries-buildings, Westminster; I do not recollect what account she gave - I am certain of her person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Is it uncommon for people to pawn in a wrong name? A. Not at all.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew her well? A. Yes, by frequenting my shop for some time - she gave her right address, No. 7, John-street; I will not swear she said it was bought at Dover, or that she came from Dover.</p>

I have a machine for the blind which I took in pawn from the prisoner, for 10s., on the 15th of December, in the name of Johnson, of John-street, who I had repeatedly seen before; I asked how she came by it - she said it was her brother's; I knew she lived in John-street, Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not common for persons to give erroneous accounts to conceal the fact of their raising money? A. Yes; I had seen her frequently at out shop.</p>

            . On the 5th of February I was standing between two doors in Gast's house, when the prisoner came in; she put her shoulder against the partition, and called Harry! Harry! to a boy who was in the shop - he saw her, but would not speak to her; she turned round, and saw me standing at a short distance behind; I said, "What is it you want?" she said she only wanted to speak to Harry - I said, "What do you want with him?" she said she had come to fetch a shirt to wash for him, and that she washed for him generally - I took her into the next room, and asked where she lived; she said in Grosvenor-street - I asked which, and after a little hesitation, she said Lower Grosvenor-street; I said "It is impossible that a washerwoman can live in Lower Grosvenor-street, what is the number?" Ellis was in custody in the shop, and desired her to answer no impertinent questions, upon which Ellis was taken away to the office - I said I should not let her go till she satisfied me where she lived - she afterwards said she lived in Colvell-court, which leads out of Charlotte-street; I sent Goddard there with her - in the trunk, at Mr. Thompson's, No. 11, Tottenham-court-road, I found these three duplicates; I went to the pawnbroker's - they relate to these articles.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she know you? A. I am satisfied that she did; but the darkness of the place, and the dirty state she was then in, I did not then know her: Ellis was in custody; I cannot say that he lived in that house; for the room pointed out as his, had neither bed nor bedding in it, nor did he live at Thompson's.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received the prisoner from Ballard, and went with her to Colvell-court, Charlotte-street, to a shop there - I asked the landlady, in her hearing, if she lived there; she said Yes, in the first floor back room - I left her there, and from information I afterwards received, I went again, found her in the act of moving away, and took her in charge; the landlord said at the office that Ellis lodged in Colvell-court with her - I do not know whether she heard it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She took you to this place as her residence? A. Ballard sent me there with her.</p>
               <p>MR. WEDGWOOD. This machine for the blind I have no hesitation in swearing to; here is another, and this is a manifold-writer, not fitted up - I am positive they are all three mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. These are part of a number of articles stolen one night in November? A. Or the beginning of December - I sell a great many; these three happen to be the first that I stamped with a tool which I have - I never sold any with the mark of this tool, and these are not fitted up - the prisoner would not know but it was a perfect article.</p>

            . I live in Tottenham-court-road. I gave Ellis, (who has been convicted.) the use of a room in my house - the officer found the duplicates in that room; I married Ellis' sister - he was a muffin-maker; I knew he was in the habit of attending sales, and purchasing goods; and it was for the purpose of depositing the goods, which I understood he bought, that I let him have the room - I do not know where he slept: I believe he did not sleep at Gast's - I have heard he slept at Colvell-court - if I had wanted to find him in the night, I should have gone to Colvell-court.</p>

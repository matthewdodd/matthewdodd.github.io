On the 27th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the house with a pair of shoes for Mrs. Bligh. He said he brought them from Mr. Perkins, Red Lion-street, he waited on the mat of the passage to know if they would fit, while I took them up stairs - my mistress said they were not for her, and I brought them down. He appeared to be standing in the same place - I was not absent three minutes. I gave him the shoes, and said they were not for us; he said it was a mistake, and he would go back and see where it was. I let him out, and in coming across the hall, nearly at the top of the kitchen stairs, I turned my eye, and saw the parlour door open - I thought I had not left it open; the cloth was laid for dinner. I went in and missed six desert spoons and three silver forks from the sideboard, which I had put there about a quarter of an hour before. Nobody else had been in the passage or dining-room during that time. I immediately ran out down a street, but did not see him. I ran to the end of Tavistock-place, and saw him running slowly down Wooburn-place. I called Stop thief, he ran faster down Bernard-street, and was stopped in Little Guildford-street, taken to the watch-house, and the property found on him in my presence, under his waistcoat, and in his breeches.</p>

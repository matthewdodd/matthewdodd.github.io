                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Haines, a stationer, in King's-road. On 11th Oct. the prisoner came, a little before 9 o'clock in the evening, for a halfpennyworth of paper, and a halfpennyworth of envelopes—she gave me a shilling—I bent it with my teeth, and told her it was a bad one—she said that was not the shilling that she gave me, but I had changed it—it was never out of my hand from the time she put it on the counter till I bent it—after I bent it, I broke it in two with my fingers, and gave her the largest portion—I kept the other, and gave it to the inspector—after I had given the prisoner the large piece, she tried to get away—I went to the door and kept her back—a person went for a policeman, and she was taken—I did not see what became of the piece of the shilling that I gave the prisoner because I left the shop when the constable came.</p>

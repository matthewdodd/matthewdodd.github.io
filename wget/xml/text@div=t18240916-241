I had been suckling her between six and seven o'clock in the evening of the 5th of August; she then went into the field, and I missed her at five the next morning. There is a large hedge round the field. The gate was closed. I saw the cow again on the Saturday evening at Mr. Lansdown's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was this a good milch cow - A. Yes; she was worth 5 l. or 6 l. to us, but would not fetch more than 3 l. 10 s. in the market. The boy who has the care of the field generally pins the gate; he is not here. I did not put her into the field, nor go in again that night. I have known the prisoner some time, he is a man who sells cows and calves; we have had dealings in that line together. I have known the cow and had the care of her for fourteen years.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Coach and Horses, public-house, on the Hounslow-road. I saw the prisoner at our door with a red cow, with wheel horns on the 5th of August, about twelve o'clock at night. Our house is five or six miles from Littleton. He asked me if there were any Chertsey people there; I said there was Blake and Turner there; they are butchers of Chertsey. He said,</p>
               <p>"I believe I shall not stop, I shall go gently on - good night."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say, tell Blake and Turner I am gone - No, he did not tell me to tell them, or not to tell them. I went into the house about twenty minutes after, and told them what he said. He did not say what road he was going, but he went up towards London. He had got the cow in a string; he was not more than two minutes with me. I saw that it was a red cow, with wheel horns - there are many cows of that description. I have known him twelve years. He always had an honest character.</p>

            . I am a butcher of Chertsey. I was at the Coach and Horses on the 5th of August with Turner. I left about half an hour after the hostler spoke to me, a little after twelve o'clock. When I got to Smithfield in the morning I saw a cow there, about five o'clock, and the prisoner near it; it was a red cow, with wheel horns, and a large udder of milk. The prisoner came and pocked me in the pole. I said</p>
               <p>"What have you got here." He replied,</p>
               <p>"A great red cow; I have sold her to Mr. Lansdon for 3 l. 5 s." I asked him where he got it. He said he bought it of Mr. Dover, of Napp-hill, which is about six miles on the other side of Chertsey, for 3 l. He said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160091"></xptr>had bought her a week, ago but had not brought her up till yesterday. Napp-hill is sixteen or seventeen miles from the Coach and Horses. When I got back to Chertsey, hearing that Mrs. Rutter had lost a cow, I had him taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he know that you was a Chertsey man - A. Yes, he told me at once who the person was to whom he sold the cow - he knew I was going back to Chertsey. I never bought a horse in my life that was claimed afterwards. I have known Rolfe twelve years; he is a jobber in calves and cows. I never heard but that he was a very honest boy. I took the prisoner at Chertsey on the same day we left Smithfield; on Friday, the 6th of August.</p>

            . I am a butcher at Chertsey. I was at the Coach and Horses with Mr. Blake, and then went on to Smithfield. We did not overtake any cow on the road. I saw the prisoner at Smithfield; he said.</p>
               <p>"Good morning to you - have you got your cart here?" I said, Yes. He said,</p>
               <p>"I shall stand a chance to ride home" - I said</p>
               <p>"It will be a poor chance, I am afraid, for if we have luck we shall buy calves enough." I saw the cow go down to the slaughter-house with two drovers, and I ordered Mr. Lansdon's man not to kill it, for I thought it was stolen. I went to the prisoner, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is a large cow you have brought up, she has plenty of milk;" he said her udder is only corey; she has not been suckled for a fortnight - that he had bought her of Mr. Dover, for 3 l. 6 s., and had had her at home for a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long did you stop in the house after Curtis told you what he did - A. About half an hour - the public-house is about nine miles from Hyde Park-corner, and three from Brentford - we trotted on to Brentford, and then walked the rest of the way. I saw the cow and the prisoner in the market. I did not see him pay 15 s., to anybody. I saw him taken to prison by a man of the name of Purser.</p>

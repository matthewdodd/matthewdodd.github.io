                  </hi>. I am the wife of Isaac Cockley—we live ia White<lb></lb>cross-street, St. Luke's—the prisoner came to lodge with us in September last, and subsequently worked for me in my house—she was in the habit of making a bed for my apprentice—I missed a blanket from that bed—I asked her about it, she said she had had an accident, and let it fall in some water, and had taken it up stairs to dry—I consulted my husband, and we sent for a sergeant of police—we searched her apartment—the blanket was not found, but I saw a purse found and a printed book, which was the property of my daughter, Isabella Louisa Cockley, and a brooch and a pair of scissors, which are mine—I cannot tell when I missed the brooch, but it was soon after the prisoner was in attendance on me—I made inquiry of her about it several times—she said she did not know anything about it, that she had seen it on the writing-desk, but had not removed it.</p>

WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About what time had you seen the blanket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It must have been two or three months before—I must have missed the brooch about a month before that—I had seen the purse and the book the week before the prisoner was taken—I have three children, but they do not go into the prisoner's room—she has been in the habit of doing needle-work for me—I have not the slightest recollection of my child's going into her room, for her to take the size of the waist of a frock—she knocked at her door, and gave in the size for her, and she took it at the door—I understood she did not go in, but I was not there—I have three children—the eldest is eleven years old—I have another lodger besides the prisoner, who is married, and has two children—the elder of them is about eight years old—my children do not play with hers, I never allow it—I went to Deptford three or four Sundays following, and left my children in the prisoner's care—I left her in care of my house—when the officer came to search, she asked me to step aside, that she might speak to me—I believe she said she had sent the blanket to some person at Hoxton to be washed—I am almost confident that the blanket was safe when I missed the brooch.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any person in the room besides the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, her sister—I am not aware that the prisoner called me up stairs, the officer called me—the prisoner's sister came down into the kitchen to me, and made a statement—the cloth the brooch fell from was a sort of towel—I believe it was used for wiping down the table—I saw the brooch fall, from shaking the towel—it is a jet brooch—I set but very little value on it, or I should not have laid it about—I value it at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergcant G</hi> 20.) On the 9th of April I went to the prisoner's apartment with Mrs. Cockley—I found a brooch in a cupboard in the room—I placed it on a table with other things—I saw the prisoner take something from the table, and wrap it in a cloth, which was placed on a chair, and she sat on it—I afterwards found it on the chair she had been sit<lb></lb>ting on—I shook the cloth, and out fell the brooch.</p>

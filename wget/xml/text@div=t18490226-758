                  </hi>. I live at 33, Clerkenwell-green; it is my dwelling-house; Carter occasionally came there. On the evening of 25th Feb., I found my house broken open—they got in by the flap, and about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-worth of halfpence was gone—I had left them in a drawer in my room, which was locked when I went out, and open when I came home—I received informa<lb></lb>tion from my brother-in-law, and found the prisoners up in a loft, where they</p>

               <p>used to sleep, both tipsy—Carter was quite insensible; Hooks was not so bad—he said he would tell me all about it; it was not by his wish it was done, but Carter persuaded him to do it—I asked what they had done with the money—Carter said they had spent the greater part of it—I do not think Hooks knew how to get into the house till he was shown by Carter—Carter had got in that way once before, when he was in my employ—Hooks occa<lb></lb>sionally worked for me as carman—I asked Carter how much they had taken; he said about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, by the weight, and he reckoned up with a piece of chalk what he had spent.</p>

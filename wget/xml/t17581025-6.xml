               <p>Daniel Bunning. When I took my room of my landlord I was to lie alone, and none to lie with me without my consent; after that my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175810250007"></xptr> landlord took in the prisoner, and said he knew him to be a very honest man, so I let him lie with me; when he and the things were missing then my landlord said he did not know any thing of him, although before he said he was his acquaintance; I found the prisoner two or three weeks after, and before justice Welch he confessed he had taken my things.</p>
               <p>Q. What things?</p>
               <p>Bunning. A peruke, a silver stock buckle, a stock, and Common Prayer book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he had done with them?</p>
               <p>Bunning. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them?</p>
               <p>Bunning. They are worth sixteen shillings and six-pence, which is what they are laid at in the indictment.</p>

That Roberts brought up a second quartern: That while the Prosecutor was feeling Katharine Speed, she bid her go and sink him; but his Breeches was so stiff she could not. That it was their Custom that when they had pickt any Man's Pocket, Roberts (the Woman of the House) was to have 5 . in the Pound and 3 d. in the shilling of what they got: and being in the Room and finding that they could not get the Prosecutor's Money, would undertake it her self, but said that if she did it she would not stand to the 5 s. in the Pound but would have half snacks her self, and this Evidence and Speed should have the other half. That she (Mary Roberts) pull'd up her Coats, and bid the Prosecutor feel what she had; and in a little while said she had spoke; (which signified that she had got his Money) and carried it to an Alehouse hard by, desiring the Woman of the House to lay it up for her, saying that her Maid was Drunk. That Marsh (Roberts's Maid) only brought up the first quartern. That she (this Evidence) went to Roberts for her share; who told her that she could not give her any, for she had given 13 Guineas and a Broad Piece to Miller to go to make it up.

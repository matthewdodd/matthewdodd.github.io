               <p>Q. In September were you at any time returning from Charlton in company with a man of the name of Fitzwalter - A. Yes, about seven weeks ago; I cannot say the month.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts was this field - A. The field was near <placeName id="t18131027-18-crimeloc105">Littleton, in Littleton parish</placeName>

               <p>Q. What was Turner doing - A. He drove a flock of sheep into a corner of the field; he caught one of the little sheep, he tied its legs, and he laid it down while a strange man passed along the road.</p>
               <p>Q. While Turner was tying this sheep where was Bishop - A. Bishop was outside with a wheelbarrow, and while the strange man was going by Bishop laid down by the barrow, and when the strange man had passed by Bishop got up; Turner came out and saw how far the strange man had gone down the road; I saw him look down the road after him. Then Turner put the sheep over the bank; Bishop and Turner put the sheep into the barrow; the prisoner, Bishop, wheeled it away; he took it towards Sunbury.</p>

            . I am a day labourer; I work for Mr. Hardyman. I live at Upper Hslliford. On the afternoon that the sheep was taken out; I had been to Charlton; I was going up the Staines road, together with Seers.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your business there - A. I had done work, I went over to Charlton; I was going round to do my horses up again; I was going home to Halliford; going round that way I saw the prisoner Turner in Mr. Wood's field, and Bishop out in the road. Mr. Wood's field is in Littleton parish.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when you saw the men - A. In the Charlton-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any hedge or fence between you and Mr. Wood's field - A. There was Mr. Till's fence between them and me: the field stands between two roads.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in the Charlton-road; next to you was Mr. Till's field - A. Yes. and next to that was the Littleton-road. Mr. Wood's field is on the other side of the road; Mr. Wood's field is one side of the road, and Mr. Till's field the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this fence go all round Mr. Till's field - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any fence to Mr. Wood's field - A. Yes; it is in the Charlton-road, behind the fence of Mr. Till's field.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were standing there what did you see Turner do - A. I saw him tie a sheep's legs; I was about two hundred yards from Mr. Wood's field.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see at that distance from Mr. Wood's field - A. Yes; I stopped to see what they were going to do with the sheep. I saw Turner, the shepherd, drive the sheep in a corner; Bishop was in Littleton-road. Turner caught one of the sheep; Bishop had a wheelbarrow; after I came up Turner tied the sheep's legs, and after that he drove the rest away, while a strange man passed along Littleton-road.</p>
               <p>Q. When the strange man passed the road what did Turner do - A. Turner, the shepherd, came back, and looked over the bank; that was after the man had passed. Bishop had laid down; he got up just after he had gone by. When Turner delivered the sheep to Bishop, he put it over the bank, and with the assistance of Bishop he put it into the barrow; Bishop wheeled the barrow away, towards Sunbury, along the Littleton-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards speak to either of the men - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he drive the sheep up Littleton, where is it - A. Just at the end of Charlton-road. He drove the sheep just by us.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the Littleton-road cross the Charlton-road - A. Yes, it crosses it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the place where you was standing, does the Charlton-road meet the Littleton-road - A. About an hundred yards.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you speak to them - A. No. I did not. Seers was with me.</p>

            . I am a bailiff to Mr. Wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the charge of all Mr. Wood's sheep - A. Yes. Turner was his shepherd, under me; he gave me an account of the sheep every Saturday. and he did the Saturday before the 24th.</p>
               <p>Q. You then learned from him how many sheep there was - A. No more than what he killed; he said, he killed one for the house on Saturday, the th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how many he had left - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember when Turner was apprehended, do not you - A. Yes; on the 24th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. After Turner was apprehended, did you count the sheep - A. Yes, the fat ones; there were ninety then; I did not count the flock sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find how many there was missing - A. Yes; on the 25th there were five missing of the flock sheep, and two fat ones. The five flock sheep I never saw again.</p>
               <p>Q. At present he is only charged with stealing one sheep; was that a flock sheep or a fat sheep - A. A flock sheep, but in good order. The three fat sheep were found previous to this one being charged to be missing; this flock sheep was never found; the five were never found; they were all gone.</p>

               <p>Q. In the field in which Fitzwalter has described, were there any other than flock sheep in that field - A. No fat sheep.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it customary for this man to keep sheep among your master's - A. No, he never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they allowed to deal in sheep - A. In many places they allow it; some do allow it, and some do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you aware of that indulgence to have been allowed to the prisoner of keeping sheep of his own - A. That never was at squire Wood's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever notice a sheep without his mark to it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your master any particular mark to his sheep - A. Yes, T. W.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his flock all wethers - A. All wethers.</p>
               <p>Q. There might be such a thing as the prisoner having a sheep and you not knowing it - A. He might have it for a little time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear from him that he had bought any sheep - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Bishop's Defence. I bought the sheep of the shepherd; he told me it was his own; I gave him thirty-five shillings for it; this sheep was a ewe sheep; the esquire does not keep any ewes. There was no mark on this sheep at all; all the rest were marked; and I bought some of another shepherd, a next door neighbour; I thought it no more harm of buying of one shepherd than the other. I bought the sheep of this man; I paid him for it. As I brought it home I met

            ; I took it home to my house on the Wednesday; there it staid till the Friday alive; I killed it on Friday; the skin hung in my place for a week afterwards. Another butcher of our place bought five of this man; he is a respectable butcher; he bought the five of him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270013"></xptr>before I bought the one of him. I am sure it was not the 'squire Wood's, because there was no mark about it; besides it was a ewe sheep; I had it home by day light; I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Twner's Defence. I sold him the sheep; it was not Mr. Wood's; I bought it on the road of a man. I thought it no harm to sell it to Mr. Bishop. The two witnesess, Seers, and Fitzwalter, were in Mr. Wood's cover, hunting the rabbits about; I saw them in the cover a long time; I took no notice of them; they have only mentioned it out of spite; when I was taken in custody they mentioned to Mr. Wood that Mr. Bishop brought the sheep to me; it was about twelve o'clock in the day time when Mr. Bishop fetched the sheep. Mr. Bishop never laid down at all; he came over the hedge and took the sheep; I went about my business; it was my own sheep.</p>
               <p>Bishop called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Turner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. to Seers. When he drove the sheep up in the corner, did he take any particular sheep, or did he take one by chance - A. He stood and looked at them about two minutes, then he took hold of one of the hind legs.</p>
               <p>Q. to Fitzwalter. Did you observe that - A. I did not take so much notice as that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. How long was it before you acquainted Mr. Wood's bailiff of what you had seen - A. About three weeks; I never gave any information until they were taken up. I only gave information after the shepherd was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any reason why you did not tell sooner - A. No.</p>

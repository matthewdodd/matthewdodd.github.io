                  </hi>. I am in the service of Thomas Fowell Buxton. I received information from Squires, and on 26th June went to the prisoner at his house, and accused him of taking two trusses of hay and straw—he denied it—I said that was no use, for I knew a person who saw him take it, and if he did not bring it back by ten o'clock that night, I should send some one after him—he brought a truss of hay back, and said that was all he had taken.</p>

I am the wife of John Corner, and was in the service of Mr. John Thompson, of Albion-terrace, King's-road, Chelsea—the pri<lb></lb>soner is my brother, and was in the habit of coming to see me about once a week or fortnight, at master's house—I saw him there on the Tuesday before the examination—on the Saturday night before I went before the Magistrate on Monday, I left the house between nine and ten o'clock—I will not be positive it was after nine o'clock—it was after eight o'clock—I had the care of the house—Mr. Thompson was out of town—I left no body in the house when I went out—I pulled the door after me, but I will not be positive whether it was shut—I came back before ten o'clock, and found the door shut—I opened it with a key, and went in, and missed the property stated in the indictment—it had been wrapped up is a leather-when I went out it was safe on a large table—I should think it worth about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I spoke to the policeman directly, and he came in and examined the house—my mother had been with me that day—on the Sun<lb></lb>day morning, between nine and ten o'clock, I went with my mother over to Tooting to my brother's lodging—he asked us why we came there a early in the morning—my mother said we had lost some plate—he said he had not seen it—he at last took us to Wandsworth-common, kicked a turf with his feet, and there was the plate, wrapped up in the leather as before—we all three came along the road together, and met a policeman—my brother then turned away from us, and was going away from the common—the policeman went after him, and brought him back—he then came after my mother and me, and took us all to the station-house—I think the plate is master's—it is the same leather and the same plate that was in the box.</p>

            . On the 8th of Dec. about 11 o'Clock in the Day, the Prisoner and one Caushet came to my House, and told me they had two Pieces of Brass to sell, and if I would buy them, they would fetch them. Stevens staid in the Shop, and Causbee went to fetch them. While he was gone, I enquir'd where he lived; he said, in Wood's-Close, and Causbee in Clerkenwell-Green: They asked me 6 d. a Pound. I told them it was coarse Brass, and I bought them at a Groat a Pound: There were 52 Pounds; it came to 17 s. 4 d. and I paid the Money to Causbee, and that Afternoon I sent the smallest to Mr Newton, to know what he would give a Pound, and he sent me Sixpence per Pound. I sent the other, and Mr Newton said, that such Things were lost; that he supposed they belonged to Mr Bishop, for he had advertised them. Mr Newton acquainted Mr Bishop with it. I went to Mr Bishop's House, and he desired me to produce the Persons that brought them. I told him I would use my Endeavours; and without much Difficulty I found the Prisoner; he told me the right Place where he lived, I informed Mr Bishop of it, and he got a Warrant backed, and took him on the 28th of January, and on New-year's-day I saw Causbee go by my Door, and apprehended him.</p>

I loosed my hold of the prisoner to follow the other man; he then followed and struck me a blow with his elbows to push me down, to prevent my following, and as soon as I recovered, I laid hold of him, and took him to the watch-house, nobody came to my assistance.</p>

               <p>Q. He might have got off while you were pursuing the other man? - A. No, he ran to prevent my following the other man; and if he had ran the other way, he was sure to be taken, for it was in a very narrow passage, called Saunders-gardens, and it was very full of people.</p>

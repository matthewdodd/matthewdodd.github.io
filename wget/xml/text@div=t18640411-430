                  </hi>. I am a servant in the employ of Mr. Weatherby, of 4, Orme-square, Bayswater—on the evening of Saturday, 13th February, a little after 11 o'clock, I went up stairs in the dark, and heard a sound like some one trying a window in the water-closet, and also heard a noise of glass breaking—there is a sky-light at the back of the house—I went down stairs, opened the door, and found the sky-light broken—I was going up stairs again, when a policeman rang the bell—the water-closet window was fastened with a clasp, and looks out over the skylight—I saw broken glass and drops of blood on the ground under the skylight.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 291). At a quarter past 11, on the night of 13th February, I was in the gardens at the rear of Orme-square, and saw something at the back of No. 4 like the shadow of a man—I heard a noise like breaking of glass, and then saw a man run along on the partition<lb></lb>wall of the gardens leading from No. 4 into No. 3—I watched him until he dropped from the wall into No. 3, allowed him to come a few yards, and then I stepped out of my hiding-place, and seized him by the collar—it was the prisoner—he bad his boots in his hand—as soon as he stopped, I saw some blood on his feet—I said, "What are you doing here?"—he said he was going to Moscow-road—he said, "I have been to the Marylebone Theatre, and lost my road"—I then took him into the hall of No. 3, and afterwards to the station.</p>

About half-past 11, on Saturday night, 13th February, I was called to 4, Orme-square—I saw the prisoner and the last witness—I examined the water-closet window at No. 4, and found marks apparently made with such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it had been put between the two sashes to force the catch back—this knife was picked up by a female in the garden on the following day—the marks were quite fresh on the window—you could get on to the top of the party-wall and go along over the skylight to the water-closet window—the prisoner's foot was bleeding very much, as if he had been cut with glass—he lost a great deal of blood—I searched him, and found a quantity of matches, two pieces of candle, some dice, several letters, and eightpence in money.</p>

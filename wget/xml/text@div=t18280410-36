            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday, the 27th of February, in Kingsland-road; I first saw him in Hackney-road with this mare, and another man was on the top of it; I watched them both into a stable in Union-street, Kingsland-road; they looked at me and I had a suspicion of them - they went into the stable; the prisoner came out and went to a corn-chandler's in Kingsland-road, then returned, and both came out of the stable and went in the direction of the Hackney-road, into Austin-street; they kept looking after me - they turned to the right and came up into the same street they had gone down - they went towards Cock-lane; I missed them both for a minute or two - then looked, and saw the other man - I went over to the public-house to enquire if the prisoner had gone in there; I found he had not; I went to the door and saw the prisoner come out of a chandler's shop at the corner of the street the other man had gone down; he looked over at me and came over to the public-house, went in, came out again, and I asked him about the mare which he had taken into the stable; he said, "Why, it is mine. I bought it at Chesham fair, and gave 15l. for it;" I said, "Let us look at it, I doubt whether it is all right;" he went to the stables, and asked for the key; the stables were opened - we went in; he said it was his - I said he should come to the office: he came with me to Worship-street. I looked into the Hue and Cry in his presence, and saw a description of a horse, which led me to write to Mr. Haslewood, who came up and owned it; I am certain the prisoner said it was his own, and that he had bought it at Chesham fair for 15l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The man you saw with the prisoner acted as owner? A. He was on the horse; the prisoner took hold of the bridle, and came to the office with me, and said it was his horse. I had not observed him meddle with it till I questioned him about it. The other man got off while I was following them, and they both went to the stable together; I did not know the other man; I am sure the prisoner said he bought the horse at Chesham fair, not at Chertsey; I am positive of that. I asked him if he knew the person he bought it of; he said that was not a question of mine - and he should answer me no more questions.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he refer you to any other man of whom you could enquire about it? A. Not at all; he said he bought it, and gave 15l. for it.</p>

            . I am a plasterer and stenciller: the prisoner first came to me on Tuesday, the 26th of February; I was not in the way at that time: I was sent for and came over to my stables, and found the prisoner there: he said, "You have got a stable to let" - I said I had; I unlocked the door - he enquired the rent of it - I said 6s. a week: he said it would suit him very well if the rent was lower, and he would let me know the same evening. I saw no more of him till next morning between eleven and twelve o'clock, when he came, and a man with him, on a brown mare; the man was riding and the prisoner walking; the prisoner came to the door and said."I could not come last night, I had other business to do." I said he was in time - he said he would give me 5s. a week for the stable; I said it did not belong to me, and I must have 6s. a week for it; he then said to the man, "Bring the mare in;" it was brought in and tied up to the stall; he then said the loft was of no use to him, and perhaps I might let it for 2s. a week, which would ease the rent - I said I would stick up a bill to say it was to let - he said he would give me 2s. for my trouble if I could let it. He then said to the man,"You must get some litter and put under the horse;" I said he would find plenty of straw, which he did; he said he would give me something to drink for it; I went to the public-house with him and had a glass of liquor; we returned to the stable, and the prisoner said to the man"The young man will give you the key." I gave the man the key, and both bid me good day. I went home to dinner, and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour I was sent for - I came down - saw Tyrrell, the officer, and the prisoner waiting at the stable door; the prisoner asked me to unlock the door; I said "Your man had a key" - he said Yes, but he was not in the way; I had a key and unlocked the door; Tyrrell and the prisoner walked in - I did not hear their conversation; in a short time Tyrrell came and told me to attend at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner refer you to anybody else as the owner of the horse? A. No; he told me it was his own, and he took the stable to put his horse into.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not hear the other man bargain to sell him the mare? A. No; I never heard of his buying it of the other man.</p>

            . I am a stable-keeper, and keep the Mail Coach, public-house, Kingsland-road. On Monday, the 25th of February, about four o'clock, the mare in question was brought to my stables; I was out, but returned about nine o'clock, and found it there; I did not see the prisoner that evening - I saw him next day; in the morning, I think, but am not certain what time of day; he came to the stable, and said, "You are the ostler, are you?" Yes, said I; he said, "Well, you have taken care of my horse very well:" I said, "I have taken as much care as I could, on account of what you ordered - you ordered him to have nothing but hay:" he said, "I am very well satisfied, and I expect a poney to come to-day, and in a day or two I may have two or three horses; and, as you have taken so much care, I will send them here;" he was alone that day, and spoke of the mare as his own - he came again next day, with another man, and said, "Ostler, I wish you would bring that mare out, for I am going to have her shod at the smith's;" I said"What smiths are you going to?" he said, "He is a crosseyed man;" I said it was Etherington; "Yes (said he), stop, don't bring her out with the bridle:" he went away, and took the mare with him - I saw nothing more of him, but in consequence of an advertisement in the Hue and Cry, I attended at Worship-street, at his third examination; I found him in custody, and saw the mare in the possession of Mr. Haslewood's brother, at the office door - I never saw it in the possession of John Haslewood or Tyrrell - the mare I saw in possession of Haslewood's brother is the same as I had in my stable, and which I had this conversation about with the prisoner - I am certain of it; I am sure of the prisoner's person.</p>

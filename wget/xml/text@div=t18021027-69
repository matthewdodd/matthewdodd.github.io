               <p>Q. That not being a wrong thing you did it? - A. I thougth it was no harm his giving me the liquor; it was not in my charge; he chose to give it to me.</p>

             sworn. - I went on guard at the Wet Docks at nine o'clock; our orders were to let persons pass who had tickets, but no others; the prisoner was about eight or nine yards from me; I saw him pull a gimblet out of his pocket, and bore a hole in a cask, and let the liquor run into the can, and give it to Bishop, the soldier, and tell him to be off with it; a little time after Bishop was taken; there were a great number of puncheons all over the quay, and he was obliged to go among them when the alarm was made, for the constables halloa'd out, stop the man, before Bishop was taken; the prisoner went from his post to the other watchman, and got a coat; I did not hear him apply, but saw him go; it was a different coat from that he had before, which was blue; he came back in a sort of brown coat to his own station again; no conversation had passed between us; when I got back to the guardroom I informed my corporal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You had never seen the prisoner before till he was drawing the rum into the can? - A. I was distant about eight yards, and saw the prisoner with the can, but don't know where he got it; it was moon-light, and nobody passed me except Bishop.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was no harm to take rum out of the casks? - A. There were officers over them, and I had no business with them; it was no odds to me; I saw him with the can, but had never seen the can before.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to stop Bishop? - A. We have no orders to stop each other.</p>

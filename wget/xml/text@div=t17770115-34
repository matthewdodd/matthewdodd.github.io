I believe the prisoner is the man that stopped us; I saw him three different times: though he had a crape upon his face that hung down to the tip of his nose, I could distinguish the lower part of his face; and I had several opportunities to observe, being stopped three times; the first time the lamps were not lighted; I rather think I was stopped the second time by mistake, not knowing that it was the same carriage he had stopped before; it was the last time that he searched the carriage.</p>

               <p>How near was you to the prisoner? - Not farther off than I am from the table; I saw the lower part of his face which I could distinguish very plainly, because I held the candle to him; it was a dark night.</p>

               <p>I was stopped upon the 6th of December, the first time between Langley Broome and Colnbrook; I lost some gold and some silver; the prisoner on this side the Magpie stopped me a second time, but then I let down the window and said to him, why you have been with me before, upon which he bid us drive on; the lamps were then lighted; they were not lighted when first he robbed me; a little on this side Cranford-Bridge he stopped us again; he said, you have somebody else in the carriage; but found we had not; he ordered me to get out, which I did; I was going to get out at the door that he was at, but he ordered me to get out on the other side; the prisoner himself opened the door next to him, and then took out the cushion; the seat was locked; he ordered the coachman to give me the key, and I opened it; then he ordered the coachman to take one of the candles out of the lamp to light him; and he asked me what there was there? I said, I don't know; here is some game; then he asked the coachman why he locked the seat? the coachman said to preserve the parcels from being lost: I handed up a parcel to the prisoner; he looked at it by the light; I told him I thought it was like a pair of shoes; he took out two or three other parcels, and I read the directions of some by the candle which the coachman held; he held it in at the front window; I read a direction on one of the baskets; the prisoner asked me what it was; I said I thought it was game; he took three other parcels that were like letters; he then went away and bid us drive on; but we did not immediately drive on; upon which he called to us again and bid us drive away; it was very dark at the time; he had a crape half way on his face; I had an opportunity of seeing his face tolerably plain.</p>

               <p>Was the robber armed? - No; I saw none, but I apprehended there might be some accomplices near; he had a great coat on; it was not buttoned up, so as to hinder my seeing his face; I took particular notice of his voice too, and that is another reason that induces me to think the prisoner is the man; the lower part of his face is very remarkable as it is not equal; there is a difference between one side and the other of his face; I saw him afterwards at Sir

I gave him 20 guineas and 10 s. in change; but as I had not then all the goods that he wanted, he said he would come again in the afternoon; he came again at half past 2 o'clock and dined with me; he had been at my shop twice before; I had procured the other things against he came; after dinner he laid out all the rest of the money he received in change, which was 20 guineas, except 16 s. Between the time of his coming to my shop and his returning in the afternoon I went to Messrs. Brown and Collinson with the bill for acceptance; I left it there; on Monday I went for the bill, and then I was told they had received information that this bill had been stolen, and they told me I must give the best account I could of the person from whom I received it; having received this information I then recollected that some time before, for he had dealt with me for some silver tea-spoons and some salt-spoons or some such matters; I recollected where these were to be sent before, and upon this I sent my brother to go along with Sir

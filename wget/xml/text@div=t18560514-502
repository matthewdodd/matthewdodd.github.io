                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 369). I met the prisoner, about a quarter before 6 o'clock in the morning, on 11th April, at the top of Canonbury-street, Lower-road, Islington—he was carrying a birdcage with two birds in it—I followed him as far as Queen-street, about 200 or 300 yards, stopped him, and asked where he brought the birdcage from—he said, "If you win come with me, I will show you"—I went with him about two yards, when he dropped the cage at my feet, and ran away—I pursued him about a dozen yards, when he turned round, drew a knife from his pocket, and said, "You b—, if you come nigh me, you will have it"—he then con<lb></lb>tinued running till I stopped him again, about a dozen yards further—before I secured him he turned round several times, and attempted to stab me time after time—at the corner of George-street he took two tablecloths from his waistcoat—he threw one on a wall, with intent to throw it into a garden, and the other he threw in the middle of the road—he then ran about fifty yards further—he then dropped the knife, and I secured him—another policeman came to my assistance, and we searched the prisoner, and found this piece of ribbon in his waistcoat pocket—I got one of the table-cloths—a butcher came by, and took one, and ran away with it—I have not the least doubt that the prisoner is the man I saw with the birdcage—I never lost sight of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, Clifton-villas, Grange-road, about three minutes' walk from the top of Canonbury-street. On Thursday night, 10th April, I went to bed, a few minutes alter 10 o'clock—the window of the dining room was not closed within half an inch—the servant had had the sash down in the day, and we could not get it up—the door of the dining room was locked outside—I was alarmed about hall past 6 o'clock next morning—I went into the dining room, and found the window open wide, and the things in great confusion—some boxes, the cheffonier, and other things, were broken open—there had been two cages there, which had one bird in each; one cage was left, but the bird had been taken out of it, and put into the cage which was missing—that cage was afterwards shown to me, it was mine, and the birds, which had been in my room—I missed two tablecloths, this is one of them—on the Thursday night this was with the other, folded up, and put on a chair in the dining room—I can identify this piece of blue silk, it was in my wife's workbox the night before—my house is in the parish of St. Mary, Islington.</p>

               <p>DAVID PIKE sworn. - Q. Were you the person that came up at the time the boys were engaged with the prisoner? - A. I was; it was on the 16th of April, between eight and nine o'clock; as soon as I entered the street, I heard the cry of murder; with that I hastened to the spot, and when I was very near the prisoner he began to cry out watch; the boy was crying out murder for a long time; finding he had the bundle belonging to the two boys, I asked him what he wanted with these two boys; he said he wanted to know what they had in the bundle; I took him by the collar, and said he should go to the watch-house, and give an account of himself; I took him to the watch-house, and delivered him to the constable.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was returning from Mr. Showers, the Bull's Head, in Dean-street, where I had been drinking rather freely, coming up the street, I saw two boys; I asked them what they were about at that time of night; they made no answer for a long time; I suspected the boys had stole this bundle; I told them I would soon know; I immediately called out watchman; some persons came up to me, and asked me what I was about; I told them I suspected the boys had not come honestly by that bundle, and Mr. Pike and others, with me, went to the watch-house together; I was not collared; I believe the bundle was examined at the watch-house, and the watch-house keeper thought proper to detain me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

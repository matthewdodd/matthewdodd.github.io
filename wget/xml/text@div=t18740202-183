                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant L</hi>), On 15th January, about 4.15, I went to 49, Poole's Park Road, Holloway, where the prisoners were living as man and wife—I saw Lemmon, and asked her what property she had belonging to Messrs. Sanger—she said "I have nothing belonging to Sanger, I have something belonging to Ellen Chapman"—I asked her to show me, and we went together to a bedroom, where I saw in a portmanteau, a riding habit, a bridle, and a horse cloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—tho portmanteau was not locked, it was fastened by the straps—I told her she would bo charged with the unlawful possession of the things, and asked her if she had any-thing else—she said "No"—I said "What about the money?"—she said "I know nothing about any money"—I said "Do you remember Mr. Moore coming here on one occasion for some money?"—she said "I remember his coming here, but I thought it was for these things ho came, for Ellen"—while this conversation was going on, Froude came in and stood in the middle of the room; he said nothing—I went there next day and made a further search and found this opera glass in a box in the same room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mrs. George Sanger's niece, and am thirteen years old—I have been with them six years—I was going about with them last summer to different towns in England with the troupe—the prisoners were employed by my uncles—Froude was musician, and Lemmon was wardrobe keeper—Lemmon left before Christmas; she was paid off the next morning after we came to London to Astley's—she said to me last summer "If you <hi rend="italic">get</hi> money enough to buy a nice horse, you can go to France with me and make a good living"—she told me to get as much money as I could from my uncle to get the horse, which she said could be bought for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this riding habit belongs to one of the Miss Sangers; it was kept in a box in a tent with the other things, and I took them out of a box at Edgware and gave them to Mrs. Froude, who said she would mind them for me—no one but Mrs. Froude was present when I took them out of Miss Sanger's box—I took a riding habit, a saddle cloth, and a bridle—this opera glass is Mrs. George Sanger's; it was kept in the carriage where we lived, and Mrs. Lemmon said "Do you mind lending them to me to-night?"—I said "No, but you must give them back to-morrow morning, because they belong to Mrs. George Sanger"—that was three weeks before we were at Edgware—I asked her for them two days after, and she said "Have you not got them?"—I said "No"—she said "I don't know where I put them"—I said "My aunt will be sure to miss them"—they were not talked of after that, and I did not get them back—after we got to London I took a lady's saddle from Astley's—I told Lemmon I had got it, and it was taken to Mrs. Moore's house—Lemmon was paid off on the morning after we got to Astley's; but she used to come there for me, and I have seen her six times since—she said she had sent the money for the horse to the man, but had had no answer, and she did not know whether the ship was lost in going over there—we were afterwards both put in the same cell, and she said "Mind, Ellen, when you get into Court don't you say you ever gave me a halfpenny; if you do it will be worse for you, and you will get transported, "and she kept saying" Keep up <hi rend="italic">yourpedcer</hi>, Ellen; keep up your <hi rend="italic">pecker"—I</hi> was frightened, because I thought I should be transported if I spoke about it—it is a fact that 1 told Moore to go to them at one time.</p>

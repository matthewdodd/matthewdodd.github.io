             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of Mr. Akerman's servants. I was at the main gate of the prison on Tuesday night, the 6th of June, when Mr. Akerman's house and the jail were attacked. At about seven o'clock in the evening the mob assembled in a very riotous manner armed with different kinds of things, bludgeons and pickaxes. At about eight o'clock in the evening, I believe it was, I saw the prisoner or rather before eight o'clock, at the main gate of the prison; I saw him through the chequers of the gate; he was very busily employed with the rest. He was not the first person who came up with the pick-ax to the gate, but he assisted with a pick-ax; there is a main gate goes over the lattice; he was not the first person who began at that gate, but I saw him there afterwards.</p>
               <p>Describe particularly what you saw him do? - He took one of the pick-axes out of one of the men's hands, who had been employed at it before, and tried at it himself; there were others afterwards employed in the same way, but after all they could not penetrate the gate so as to get in. Mr. Akerman's goods being thrown into the street, when they found they could not get in by the pickaxes, and other tools, which they had, they placed Mr. Akerman's things up against the gate and set fire to them. I saw the prisoner employed four or five times in piling up the things; we endeavoured to throw them down with broomsticks, and to quench the fire with water.</p>
               <p>Was the gate actually set on fire? - Several times, it might as far as I know be nine or ten times attempted.</p>
               <p>How far was the prisoner from you? - Not above a yard or a yard and a half from me.</p>
               <p>How long had you an opportunity of observing his person? - I observed his person as near as I can recollect from between seven and eight o'clock till near ten.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say that is or not the man or have you any doubt about it? - I have no doubt about it, for I saw him both by day-light and fire-light.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You are one of the turnkey's? - I am.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in that employment? - I cannot say particularly, five or six months, under or over.</p>
               <p>What was you before? - Turnkey at New Prison till my master died.</p>
               <p>Where was you before that? - I belonged to Bedlam Hospital.</p>
               <p>This man had a pick-ax? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All the time you saw him? - I cannot say all the time, he and others tried to break the lattice of the left hand gate to break in.</p>
               <p>You say he got a bromestick afterwards? - No, I got a broomstick; I believe he might have something else at first in his hand, but he took the pick-ax in his hand at the gate.</p>
               <p>He was not above a yard from you? - I said not above a yard and an half from me.</p>
               <p>You speak now of the time the prisoner was a yard and an half from you at the time the things were on fire at the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not the fire between you and the prisoner? - No; he was between me and the fire when he came up on the steps.</p>
               <p>He piled up the wood at the door of the prison to set it on fire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>We heard of an iron bar some time ago? - They were armed with different kind of weapons.</p>
               <p>Have not you said the prisoner had an iron bar? - I said a pick ax.</p>
               <p>Have not you said at other places he had an iron bar? - No, I did not say so; there was something mentioned of a gun barrel before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>You said so? - From my fellow servant saying so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280224"></xptr>Did you say any thing before the magistrate of the pick-ax? - It was mentioned there.</p>
               <p>I ask you if you mentioned it, did you Sheppard before the justice of peace say that this prisoner at the bar had a pick-ax in his hand? - Yes, I believe I did say so.</p>
               <p>Did you mention a gun-barrel? - No.</p>
               <p>I heard there was a gun-barrel at Mr. Akerman's door.</p>
               <p>By who? - Mr. Lee I believe.</p>
               <p>Have you been out of England? - I have been in Yorkshire; I have never been but at the Isle of White.</p>
               <p>You have never been in a country where Blacks are the inhabitants? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you are only accustomed to see Blacks by accident as I am, where was you when you saw the prisoner by day-light? - At the gate of the prison; I was at the gate from morning till night. I saw several Blacks and Tawnies on the 8th or 9th of June. I heard there were a number of persons taken up who were in the Poultry-Compter; I went to see if there were any who had escaped from Newgate. I saw the prisoner, I said to my fellow servant that is the man who set fire to our gate.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to the prisoner then? - No.</p>
               <p>I asked him afterwards whether he knew me? He said he did not.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner say in your hearing he had a gun-barrel in his hand? - No, he did not; I might hear the latter part, but I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>You cannot remember what passed two or three days ago, yet you are come to swear to the person of a Black you saw by candlelight? - He is not dressed now as he was then but I know his face perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see more than one or two Blacks in the riot? - Yes; there were more than one.</p>
               <p>When he was examined before the Lord Mayor you went to give evidence against him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the Lord Mayor every thing you remembered which you thought material? - Yes; to all the questions which were asked me.</p>
               <p>Were you not asked to tell all you knew? - I do not know that; I did tell all I knew at that time.</p>
               <p>Did not you know it was your duty to tell the magistrate all you knew upon the subject? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell all you knew? - I told all the questions that were put to me, as far as I knew.</p>
               <p>Was not you asked about the prisoner and what you had see him do? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the magistrate that the prisoner took a pick-ax out of another man's hand? - To the best of my knowledge I mentioned it.</p>
               <p>Is it true what you have said, now did you see the man take the pick-ax out of another man's hand? - It is true.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a servant of Mr. Akerman; I was in the hall at the great gate when the mob came, which was about seven o'clock, but the gate was not attacked at that time. When it was attacked I was at the debtors gate.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner in the course of that night? - Yes, but he was dressed in a rough short jacket, and had a round hat with dirty silver lace upon it. It was very near nine o'clock. When I saw him he was standing on the steps, thumping with somewhat, but I do not know what, against the gate, another man was chopping at it with a hatchet, which split it, and some pieces fell off. I was not half a yard from him at the time I was in the street; I suppose I staid five minutes at that time. I saw him at the Poultry Compter on the 8th or 9th of June, I believe. My master sent us to see if we knew any of the persons who were taken up. I saw the prisoner; I asked him how he came to behave in that manner with the iron bar? He said No it was not an iron bar, it was his master's gun-barrel. I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How many years have you been in this employment at Newgate? - About six years.</p>
               <p>Was you ever out of this country? - Yes, I have been in Holland.</p>
               <p>You was never any farther than that? - No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280225"></xptr>You never saw this man above five minutes? - No.</p>
               <p>You was but half a yard from him, and yet you could not discern what was in his hand? - No, there was such a mob, and I was a little terrified.</p>
               <p>Is it very easy to know a Black? - I do not think he is a Black.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him before? - No.</p>
               <p>Yet you could positively swear to him in the Compter? - Yes; I looked at him sometime in the Compter before I swore to him.</p>
               <p>What time of day did you see him in the Compter? - In the forenoon.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said very true that it was not an iron bar but a gun-barrel? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not mean to make the jury believe that he said it was a gun-barrel he was thumping at the door with? - He said it was not an iron bar but his master's gun-barrel that he was there with.</p>
               <p>You alter it every time, you said just now he said it was not an iron bar but his master's gun-barrel he was there with, now you leave out was there with? - I know he was there at the time.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the man in the Compter pointed out to you? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner any time in the day on Tuesday? - No not till eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did not you say you saw him in the day? - I did not.</p>

               <p>I am a servant of Mr. Akerman; when the prison was attacked I was inside the press-yard; I saw the prisoner at nine o'clock, as near as I can guess, upon the steps which lead to the felons gate, which is the main gate; I observed him have, as I thought, an iron bar in his hand, which was afterwards confessed to be a gun-barrel; I looked through the lattice of the gate; he attempted to poke it in my fac. They said, D - n you, open the gate and let the prisoners out or we will burn Newgate down. I saw him again, about half an hour after, in the same place; there was then same fire before the gate, and with the instrument he had in his hand he pushed the fire against the gate in order to burn it.</p>

               <p>How many days was it after this before you saw him again? - I think it was on Thursday the 8th. I then saw him in the Compter; I saw him through the gate. I said, that is the man who burnt the gate down.</p>
               <p>Did you see any other Black there? - This I call a copper coloured person; I saw a different kind of Black; I spoke to him; I said, Friend, you are not in the situation you was in upon the steps of Newgate with an iron bar in your hand. He said no, it was not an iron bar it was his master's gun barrel.</p>

We had a matter of a hundred prisoners brought in; Mr. Akerman's three servants came to see if they knew any of them; they went in; they pitched upon this Black before they had been there five minutes; some words arose between Burkitt and him about an iron bar; all the answer I heard the prisoner make was, it was not an iron bar but his master's gun barrel.</p>

               <p>I am keeper of the Poultry Compter; it was on Friday the prisoner declared to his aster, in my hearing, that it was a gun-barrel; and that he took it out of his apartment.</p>

               <p>I am a watch-maker, and live in a court on Snow-hill.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation on the mob on Tuesday night as they came this way? - I did; about seven o'clock on Tuesday evenning, I think it was the 6th of June, I had heard the mob were determined to destroy Newgate. I heard the mob coming in a very formidable manner. I came upon Snow-hill and stood upon the kirb-stone, within half a yard of some of the mob, as they passed by to the amount, I believe, of five hundred.</p>
               <p>Whether you saw any Black in that mob? - I did; a very remarkable person; I should know him ten years hence if I saw him.</p>
               <p>Was he very active? - Yes, he had something which seemed to be the spoke of a wheel.</p>
               <p>Do you think the prisoner is the man? - I do not; a gentleman told me his black servant was taken up; he desired me to go and see if the man in the Compter was the man I saw. I went and saw him, and am very certain it was not the prisoner.</p>
               <p>If there was any other Black in the mob is it not probable you must have seen him? - Many of the mob had passed before I came out; I did not see any other; I saw the Black afterwards, who passed me, upon the top of Mr. Akerman's house, very active.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say there was but one Black in the mob? - I saw but one.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you go to Newgate? - I did, about a quarter after seven o'clock; then I saw the Black there whom I had seen before; he had a piece of linen shaking out of the window of the one-pair-of-stairs; I was opposite Mr. Akerman's house.</p>
               <p>He had something which looked like the spoke of a coach wheel, you could not see at that distance that it was the spoke of a coach wheel? - To the best of my knowledge it was.</p>

               <p>You are in the army? - I am.</p>
               <p>Was you in the neighbourhood the night Newgate was destroyed by the mob? - I was on Snow-hill, within a few yards of St. Sepulchre's Church; as soon as the men with the pick-axes passed me, a Black came by me; he had a bludgeon in his hand, like the spoke of a coach wheel; he passed me smiling; he struck the ground with his stick and said, Now Newgate. As soon as I heard that a Black was taken I went into the Poultry-Compter to see if it was the same, but it was a different person.</p>
               <p>They went directly to Newgate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see any other Black? - No.</p>
               <p>If there had been another do you think you could have distinguished him? - Very easily.</p>
               <p>- PHILLIPS Esq. sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner at the bar was my servant. He was ordered go to from my house in Westminster, to my chambers in Lincoln's-Inn to bring a drawer with some papers; he was ordered to bring every thing away but the heavy articles.</p>
               <p>Was there any gun barrel? - Yes, with neither lock nor stock, it had been tried and had burst.</p>
               <p>How long has the prisoner lived with you? - About twelve years; he was a quiet, sober, honest servant.</p>
               <p>Had he any opportunities of being connected in any respect with these rioters, had he been out in the course of the day? - I believe, he had not indeed. I have trusted him with large sums of money.</p>
               <p>It was in the evening he was sent for these things? - He left Westminster, I believe, about four o'clock in the evening to execute these orders.</p>
               <p>This gun-barrel was in the chambers at the time? - Yes, I believe it was.</p>

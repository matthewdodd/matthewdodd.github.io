               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner. - A. Yes, I knew her a good while, she had lodged with me, but not of late; I missed the property last Sunday was a week, I missed a ten pound bank note, three one pound notes, three guineas in gold, these two pieces of flannel, and the napkin; the purse was wrapped up in the flannel, the purse had the three guineas at one end, and the bank notes at the other end, it was in a deal box under my bed on Thursday before the twelfth of June, I had it in my hand and told it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lives in your family besides yourself. - A. Nobody; I heard something which made me suspect her, I went to her room and examined her, she said she knew nothing at all about it, I insisted upon breaking open her box except she would give me the key; with great persuasion she gave me the key, and the first thing that I saw was these two pieces of flannel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body with you when you found it. - A. Yes, the man of the house, she said it had been there for a month; I asked her what was become of the money that was in it, she said that I had not a farthing of money in my box; then I insisted upon searching her pocket, she said she would not be searched without I had a search warrant; I can swear to the flannel, I wore it about my legs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been living with this man four years as his wife, these flannels were hanging on the line in the passage, he got up in a passion, and told me he would kick me down stairs: I tore my clothes from off the line and these flannels; they have been in my trunk ever since last May; he was mad and jealous because I was going to marry a Frenchman.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

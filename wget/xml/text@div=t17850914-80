               <p>Mr. Garrow Prisoner's Council. What is your profession? - I am a coal merchant and wharfinger, I was at my wharf, these barges were moored; I have known the prisoner Bear for some time, and knew his barge had delivered a freight of lime at the next wharf, there is nothing parts it but a row of pailing, this was a large bulk of deals.</p>
               <p>Did Bear know you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He must know that your situation was near to this noise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You looked out, but you could not sufficiently observe, who the persons were that were making a noise? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know the apprentice Hyser; - I did not know him before.</p>

               <p>Did you find any person who claimed those deals? - Mr. Green, a carpenter at Northfleet.</p>
               <p>Did you communicate to him, that the deals had been taken from your wharf? - I did, after he acknowledged that he bought them of the prisoner Bear.</p>
               <p>Could you speak with any certainty as to the deals so lost at your wharf? - When I saw the deals, I knew them to be like the deals that were in our wharf.</p>
               <p>Then you speak to the likeness? - Yes, I brought them up, and immediately upon their arrival, they were shewn to Mr. Remnant, and to Mr. Jameson; I left Northfleet at eleven o'clock, and returned at two, and communicated it to my father.</p>

               <p>Did he bring them to you? - I did not see them, he told me he gave fourteen pence a piece for them, and he must charge me eighteen pence, and if that was too much, when he came down again he would settle the difference; he came between nine and ten on Sunday morning, I was going to church, they were then on board a barge, he said that he had them, he did not say any particular place where.</p>
               <p>Did he say that he had them in a barge? - I do not remember, I believe he said he had them in the barge: on Sunday after service in the afternoon, I walked down to see where these battens were, and when I saw them, I saw they were deals and not battens, and therefore I never put my fingers upon them.</p>

               <p>Is it upon account of this affair? - I suppose so Sir.</p>
               <p>What somebody was wicked enough to suppose you stole them? - (No answer.)</p>
               <p>Why you could speak fast enough just now, now you are as mute as a mackarel, now I am come to speak to you, why don't you speak out, did not somebody take you up about these deals? - Yes Sir.</p>
               <p>Come let us have it, then you told this story about master? - I told on Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Did you intend to tell? - No.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in your master's service the last time? - This is only the second voyage.</p>
               <p>How long did you live with him before? - Not two years.</p>
               <p>What did he turn you away for, don't be ashamed? - He did not turn me away.</p>
               <p>Now I ask you upon you r oath, (God knows you don't mind that) did not he turn you away? - I went away, they did not take me up, and he wanted to persuade me from going to sea.</p>
               <p>As the only way of preventing you from being hanged: now whose stitch of bacon was it you stole? - I never stole any bacon.</p>
               <p>How long was you absent from your master's service? - I cannot tell rightly.</p>
               <p>Was it a year, or half a year, a month or six weeks? - It was almost half a year, I worked in Mr. Man's craft at Chelsea, I was in the craft twice.</p>
               <p>Now tell me one honest day's work, that you did for any human being in that six months? - I never took any thing from any body while I was there, I should have been there now if my master had not sell out with him.</p>
               <p>Can you state the name of any human being, that you have done one honest day's work for these six months.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Hyser. Why do not you answer my friend by asking him the same question?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mr. Fielding. I have held many briefs of yours during that time.</p>
               <p>Court. What was you to have for this? - I did not know I was to have any thing, I dare say they would give me something.</p>
               <p>Do you know what Davies was to have for it? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did Davies and you know that these deals were to be moved before you were called up that night? - I did not know, and I dare say Davies did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140119"></xptr>Upon your oath, did you or did you not know that these deals did not belong to your master, that he had not bought them, or was not employed to carry them away, but that you were doing a wrong thing? - Yes, Sir, I have owned that there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding to Remnant. Are you able to speak with any precision to the property? - The deals that were returned were the same sort that were in the barge.</p>
               <p>Only the same sort; can you say you believe they were the same? - We know them to be the same sort by the marks at the ends of them; they bore the same marks at the ends that the remaining ones bore.</p>
               <p>Court. And did the numbers tally? - The numbers that we were short were thirty-seven, but there were only thirty-one returned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have said very fairly that you believe these to be the same sort of deals? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they narrow deals? - Yes, two and a half Frederick stand; there were upwards of five thousand in one ship; I did not take the whole of the cargo; they were distributed among half a dozen or eight people; they are marked with red chalk, or red paint; I never saw them marked in England; they are marked in the country where they are cut.</p>
               <p>Then the whole five thousand had the same mark as these? - I believe they had.</p>
               <p>So that the deals, for any thing you know, may be the property of somebody else of the same cargo? - It is possible they may.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Saint Giles's, High-street.</p>

               <p>I live at Limehouse; the prisoner has worked under me; I am employed for Mr. Birch; he behaved very honest; I sent down money by him to pay the people twenty or thirty pounds at a time.</p>

               <p>Do you know Hyser? - I was always very suspicious of him when he was with the prisoner; he was turned away when he was with Bear for theft.</p>
               <p>Phelps. With respect to the boy, he robbed my craft of two shirts and two pair of stockings; he has a very bad character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Bear called six more witnesses, who all gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Davies called two witnesses to his character.</p>

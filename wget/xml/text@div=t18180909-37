            . I am clerk to Mr. Langley, who is chamberlain of Bristol. On the 10th of April I saw him inclose a 10l. note in a letter to the Rev. Mr. Whitby, Erdsland, near Leominster; I took the number of the note, it was 15,490, October 23, 1817; I marked it(looks at one), this is the note. I gave the letter to the clerk at the post-office, Mr. South, and paid the postage of a double letter.</p>

            . I am clerk at the post-office, Bristol. I was on duty on the 10th of April, and made up the Wor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181809090016"></xptr>cester bag; a letter for Erdsland would be put into that bag. I sealed the bag, and forwarded it by the mail.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. There are two persons besides me who take letters in. The mail leaves at seven o'clock - I remain there until then. I might have been out at the door about four o'clock. Worcester is sixty miles from Bristol.</p>
               <p>JOHN PARRY. I was assistant to the post-master at Worcester. The Bristol mail arrives about four o'clock in the morning, it arrived on the 11th of April as usual; the bag was regularly delivered. This letter would have been put into the Leominster bag, which was forwarded there by a man on horseback, who leaves the bag-the distance is twenty-six miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person employed to carry the bag on that day from Worcester to Leominster - A. The prisoner's father is the contractor for carrying the mail; in the early part of April the prisoner himself frequently carried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you remember whether he did or did not carry it on that day - A. I cannot be certain. I made a memorandum of some money that he owed me, and to the best of my belief, he paid it on that day, which was Saturday. He said his father lived at Leominster.</p>
               <p>SARAH NICHOLLS. I am the wife of the Post-master at Leominster. I and my daughter always do the business of the office in the evening. On the 11th of April the Worcester bag arrived about eight o'clock - I cannot say who brought it. Mr. Coates frequently brings it himself, though he did not ride that day. The post-rider takes the bag to Coates, he then either brings or sends it to my office. We generally send Mr. Whitby's letters to an inn where he puts up.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether any arrived on that day-A. No; We cannot trace any as having arrived. Coates lives about a hundred yards from the office, and keeps a public-house. The prisoner assisted him at that time instead of a hostler.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When the mail arrived did any thing appear unusual - A. The bag was sealed, and the word "Worcester" on the seal.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Is that always the case - A.In the hurry of business the impression is not always perfect. I will not swear that there was an impression on the seal that day, as I did not particularly notice it.</p>

            . I am book-keeper at the Worcester heavy coach office. On the 16th of April the prisoner took a place for London, between eleven and twelve o'clock - He paid me a 1l. Leominster note for the fare. He afterwards came with his father, to the best of my knowledge. I gave him two 1l. bank notes for two local ones, as his father said he was going to London, and they would be of no use there. He started about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COULSON. I live at the King's Head, public-house, in the Commercial-road. The prisoner arrived from Worcester about the middle of April, and lodged with me till he got a situation. Three days after he came to my house, I gave him change for a 10l. bank note (looking at it)-this is it. I wrote "

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was introduced to you by Lewis - A. Yes. The note was traced to me about a fortnight afterwards; the prisoner was taken some weeks after that. I am sure he knew that inquiry had been made about it. He remained in his place, which was at Mr. Templeman's, near me.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father. The mail comes from Worcester to me; it is then carried to the office immediately, without coming into my house-it is always sealed with an impression. My son sometimes carries it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who carried it on the 11th of April - A. He did not; but I will not swear whether I or my other son did. The prisoner never went out on a Saturday. He left Leominster on the 14th. He had been talking about going to town for three months previous, but I was not able to supply him. His mother gave him 5l., his brother 2l., and he had saved more than 3l. himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. Q. Did you see the money in his possession - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this letter-is it your son's hand-writing-(handing it to him) - A. I think it is (reads)</p>

               <p>"I received a letter on Sunday about the note I paid to Mr. Coulson. I gave a 5l., one 2l., and three 1l. notes at the Worcester Old Bank for it. I think Mr. Hughes gave it to me.</p>

               <p>MR. THOMAS HUGHES. I am cashier at the Worcester Old Bank. When persons change notes we always mark them-this note has no mark of its having passed through our hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Sometimes, by accident, a note escapes unendorsed - I have known instances of the kind. It is possible I may have given the prisoner a bank note for the value in local notes.</p>

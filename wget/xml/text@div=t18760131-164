She was the Italian brigan-tine <hi rend="italic">Java</hi>, from Buenos Ayres for Liverpool; I consider that she bore up for Queenstown as she did not show any lights and signals of distress, and also that the men reported that their captain intended before the collision to bear up for that port at daylight.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">interpreted</hi>). I am an Italian, and am twenty-seven years of age—I have always been at sea since I was nine years old—in September, 1873, I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi>, a three-masted schooner, built of wood; I could not exactly say her tonnage—in September, 1873, we sailed from Buenos Ayres for Liverpool with fourteen hands on board, all told—on 14th November we were off the coast of Ireland, I was not on watch, I was down below—I heard the ship's bell ring about 4.30 or 5 o'clock in the morning—I went on deck as soon as I heard the bell and they called out below—the captain and crew were on deck—I saw another vessel a very short distance off, about 1 1/2 yards—we were on the port taek—she was on the starboard taek—she came into collision with us; I now know that vessel to be the <hi rend="italic">Oberon;</hi> she struck us amidship; as soon as she struck us the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi> leaned on one side—the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> had all her sails set, they were drawing—we were carrying low sails—she struck us on the starboard side—it was dark, I could not exactly state what effect the collision had on our vessel; as soon as it took place I jumped on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>—I did not notice the figure head of the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>—her jibboom and bowsprit were right across the midships of our vessel—our people cried out "Help! help!" and called the Blessed Virgin to their aid—the collision gave a great shock, our vessel oscillated'a little and gave way to the other side—all our men were on deck at the time of the collision—I got onboard the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> by getting hold of the chain attached to the bowsprit—another fellow-seaman, Eugenie Giacomucci, also got on board—two or three other sailors were trying to do so, but they got hold of the jibboom, which broke away, and I believe they fell back on the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi>—when we got on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> she backed out, that was a very short while after the collision, I could not state how long—I then saw our vessel, we could not see the whole of her, we could only just see the bulwarks—the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> put her sails aback and remained in that position, nothing further; she then went on the port</p>

               <p>tack—I did not hear any cries or anything said from our vessel as the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> was backing out—I saw our vessel for about ten minutes after I got on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>, I could not exactly say the time—she was on the port side, I could not exactly see what became of her, she must have gone-down; I have never seen or heard of her since—we spoke to some one on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> and told them to lower the boats to render assistance; we were making signs with our hands to the sailors on board to lower the boats—I cannot speak any English—as soon as they put the sails of their vessel right they made us go into the captain's cabin—then sails were put so as to take the port taek—there was a strong wind—I found that the cook could understand some Italian—I found that out when we—were asked to go into the small cabin, when he brought us some coffee; that was about half or three quarters of an hour after the collision—we asked the cook to lower some boats so that we might go and give assistance to our companions—I afterwards saw the captain (<hi rend="italic">the defendant</hi>)—Giacomucci and the cook were with me—in the captain's presence the cook asked us some questions; I could not say exactly how long that was after the collision, it was about three quarters of an hour after—he asked us first the name of our vessel and then what damage was done to her—I said damage there was a good deal done, but I could not state what damage really was done to the vessel—the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> continued on the port tack about two or three hours; I could not state exactly, I had no watch—the captain afterwards called us to the poop, I could not state the time; we had then been on the starboard tack a little while—the captain asked us through the—cook if we had any casks on deck and what colour they were—we said they were painted white with black hoops—I did not see any casks in the sea—I had helped to stow the cargo of the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi> at Buenos Ayres—we had barrels of tallow, bones and some hides on board—the tallow was in the hold, amidships—I saw some tallow on the prow of the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> close by the martingale when it was clear, in the morning and when we were on the port tack—the only damage I saw done to the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> was the jibboom, that was broken and the martingale was damaged—I believe she had a figure head—if the other sailors had had courage we could have lowered the boats and rendered assistance to the other sailors—the weather was not very good, it was bad weather; the sea was rather roughish—nothing was done on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> to assist the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi> after the collision—we afterwards arrived in Liverpool—I stayed there forty-seven days—the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi> never arrived there and was never heard of afterwards—some time after the Board of Trade inquiry I went back to Italy—I arrived in London last Saturday—I was brought from Mar<lb></lb>seilles in an Italian man-of-war.</p>

The collision took place directly after I got on deck—I mean to state on my oath that the <hi rend="italic">'Oberon's</hi> sails were draw<lb></lb>ing when I got on deck; there were none of them aback—I could not say whether the lee-braces had been let go before the collision; if they had been let go the sails would not have been taken aback directly—the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>, came on the starboard side and then she went on the port tack—she was on the port tack when I came on deck—I could not say to what point of the compass she was heading, because we were on the prow of the vessel—she backed out of us, her sails were aback then, she had all plain sail on—she went stern ways—she went astern a quarter to half a mile; she got good sternway on her—they did not haul up the courses to stop her sternway—when they were backing astern they slackened the sails to stop her way;</p>

               <p>they took the sails away, because it was very bad weather—she was going right before the wind—when there is a desire to lower the boats to save people's lives it does not matter what sea there is on—I mean to swear that they could have pulled a ship's boot against the wind for half a mile that night; if we could have seen the vessel we might have done so—as soon us they stopped her sternway they set-to to clear away the wreck, the gear of the bowsprit, and one thing and another at her bow—she was on the port tack while they were clearing away, she was sailing—they did not put her on the port tack to go after the other ship; theyput her on the port tack so as to get out of the way—our vessel was on the port tack at the time of the collision, sailing by the wind—I do not remember how the wind was; when the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> went on the port tack I could not say whether it was the same tack that our vessel was on, they took their own course—she was close hauled on the port tack—we had some sails up at the time of the collision, but very small ones; we were under very low sails—we earned square sails on one mast only—the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> took off the greater part of his canvas when he went on the port tack, he went away on the port tack under very low canvas—the reason why I think he was running away from our ship is, because he went on the port tack—I thought so the very mo<lb></lb>ment that he put on the port tack—we gave a hand with the ropes to get her on the port tack—we ought to have gone on the starboard tack to have gons in search of our vessel—I did not think it was to go in search of our vessel—I was examined at Liverpool about two years ago, I do not write, I did not put a mark to my deposition that I remember, or remember its being read over to me—no doubt we were on deck rendering assistance, but it was not to go round to the other vessel—I did not swear at Liverpool that I lent a hand at the ropes, and that I thought the manoeuvres were made to go round to our vessel—I think it was to go away from her—we were help<lb></lb>ing to try to keep the vessel on the port tack—when the collision took place they could not do otherwise than put her on the port tack—the ma<lb></lb>noeuvres could not have been intended to help those on our vessel—I did say so—I first formed an opinion that our vessel had sunk when we heard nothing of her, when we got to Liverpool—we could not see whether she had gone down or not, but we could not see anything of her—I did not know whether she was damaged below the water line or not, I could not exactly say what damage was done—I do not know what Giacomucci said, he is here, he can answer for himself—I did not hear him say so to the captain when we were called aft to him—the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> stood on the port tack until the morning—if we were on the port tack, how could we have been on the look-out for the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi>, they were not looking for her—it was before midday that they put on the starboard tack, I cannot say the hour, it was when he put the vessel again on the starboard tack that he asked about the casks—that was before midday; after we had sailed a little while on the starboard tack—it is impossible for me to judge how far we had sailed, I do not think we had got back to the place of collision, it is impossible for me to say—it was a strong blow that struck our ship, very heavy, because she leaned on the other side—I said at Liverpool that it was a good blow, I did not say "very heavy," if the'interpreter added words, I don't know—I could not say whether our vessel sailed away for some dis<lb></lb>tance on the port tack after the collision, because we could not see her, the last time I saw her was about ten minutes after the collision, I could not see the vessel, it was so dark we could not see her lights, they carried</p>

Saints!" they were calling out in distress—I don't know how far the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>, went astern before the was put on the port tack—after I got on board her X saw one of the sails of the <hi rend="italic">Chivari's</hi> mainmast, I did not see her lights, I did not pay any attention.,—the light of the <hi rend="italic">Chivari</hi> was not touched by the collision, because it was on the poop—I was standing close to it—the <hi rend="italic">Chiavari</hi> must have gone down—I did not see her go down; I never saw her after I got on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>; I only saw one of the sails—she remained in her place; I could not say whether she was going on or not, after I got on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>, when I got on board I met the cook and told him we had better lower one of the boats to save the lives of the sailors—I could not exactly state whether the <hi rend="italic">Chivari</hi> was then in sight, I could not say how long she was in sight after I got on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>, because I was not looking; all we could see was the hull—I could not exactly state bow long it was after I met the</p>

               <p>that way with a great shock would throw you off your feet—our sails were backed to clear us of the other ship—we got a stern way on, and the courses were clewed up, and we let go the maintopgallant sails—men were sent aloft to furl them, and I distinctly heard the captain order them to keep a look<lb></lb>out for the other vessel—I did not hear him inquire of them whether they had been able to see her—I can't say whether any of the other hands were looking after her; I did not see—the Italian sailors said nothing to me about one of their masts having come down, or their foretop mast; I am sure of that—there was no one else on board that could speak Italian; there was a Frenchman, they were conversing with him; I don't know his name, he was one of the crew—I am sure they never mentioned it when we were with the captain; all their mention was about the foreyard, they said they thought that was gone; I think that was said before the captain, I am not sure—I did not see enough of the vessel to see how she was rigged—we had sixteen sailors on board, besides the officers and apprentices; I don't know the number exactly.</p>

                  </hi>. I was carpenter on board the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the collision, about 4.30 or 5 o'clock, I turned out of my bunk—all hands had been called on deck—I saw a vessel coming on our port bow—I saw her green light—I was on the deck when the collision took place—I con<lb></lb>sider we struck the other about amidships—I did not feel much of a shock on our vessel—I felt the jibboom going—I went to-get aft out of the road in case the fore topgallant mast came down in consequence of the collision—I afterwards went forward to the forecastle head; that was just imme<lb></lb>diately after the collision—I saw the two Italian sailors climbing on board the best way they could—I called out there were two men coming on board, and I called for the assistance of the other crew to stand by me, and the boatswain and one of the crew came to assist them if they required assistance—the captain, I suppose, might be aft or on the main deck, I can't exactly swear where he was—we backed out and went astern—the instant the captain was called on deck he gave orders to let go the lee after braces to deaden the ship's way, to stop the way; and he ordered the topsail and the fore topgallant halliards to be let go; that was when we actually struck—I heard that order distintly given; in fact, he went himself and let go—I did not hear anything about the helm—directly her lee braces were let go her yards were swung and she would deaden a little and come round on the port tack—as soon as we backed out I went and sounded the fore com<lb></lb>partment; I found it tight—I then sounded the main pumps and found they were making no water—I dare say I might have reported that to the captain or the mate—I went to assist in getting the yards hauled round to get the vessel round on the port tack, and she was brought round on the port tack—a portion of our flying jibboom was carried away and the jibboom was hanging overboard in the water and all the head gear broken and gone; the martingale had gone—that might be the principal cause of the jibboom going, according to my judgment, by catching the other vessel's bulwarks—after the collision I saw the other vessel, she was standing just across our bow either a half or a quarter of a point to port, that was immediately after the collision—I don't know how long after; I</p>

               <p>don't suppose it was more than a minute or a minute and a half—I felt the crash of the jibboom going, and I went forward in an instant—she seemed to me to be all right, what I saw of her the instant after the collision—I did not see anything gone, no more than her main-top mast staysail, that was all I saw gone—I did not see what became of her, we were making great stern way—I did not see her afterwards—a considerable time afterwards my attention was called to a piece of tallow about 3 inches in diameter, just as if it had been thrown on the stern—I think we went round the starboard tack when my attention was called to that—it was well into daylight—I could not say whether our stem had cut into the ship—I did not think the vessel had been hurt—I did not know till after I en<lb></lb>quired of the cook what their vessel was loaded with, and he said with tallow, but I could not say where it came from—we had four boats on the <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi>—the two forward boats were life-boats—the two would hold about fifty people and the others about thirty in a case of emergency—they were in good condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We got a good sternway on and after the collision I think we went astern for about half a mile, or perhaps three-quarters—we went to leeward—if we had lowered one of the life-boats, I don't believe the men could have pulled it half a mile to windward on that night, because they would have the wind and sea against them—there was a very rough sea on at the time, and what you might call a stiff topgallant sail breeze, I saw some men go aloft to furl the topgallant sails, and I heard the order given to keep a look out if they could see the other vessel—I believe the captain gave that order, and when they came down he asked them if anything was seen of the vessel, and they said no, I heard it said distinctly that they saw nothing of the other vessel—when I last saw her she was on the port tack, on the same tack as when we came into collision—she was a little on our port bow, about a quarter of a point when I last saw her, more on the port bow than right ahead from what I could see of her—I considered she was not seriously damaged; of course it was rather dark—I don't know which way the wind was, I don't understand it; I can't say which way she was heading—we were on the starboard tack before the collision; afterwards we went on the port tack that was the same tack as the other vessel when I last saw her—I should think that was the best chance of finding the other vessel, I was as anxiously looking out for her, I should say as any indi<lb></lb>vidual on board.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was anxiously looking out to see if I could see her, which I dare say a good many individuals on board, besides myself were also doing—not because I thought she might have been seriously damaged, "merely just to see if I could see anything of her—I can't say that I thought she was seriously damaged, I did not think so, and I should be going against toy own judgment to say so—if she had been seriously damaged the captain may have stood away on the port tack as he did—he could not have done more than he did do—if he had thought she was sinking when we struck her it would have been right to go on the port tack—I consider the captain did what was right in coming round on the same tack as the other vessel, I am not supposed to be the judge of that—he came round on the port tack to give every assistance he possibly could to the vessel he was in collision with—this was my second voyage in a sailing vessel, I have not been above three years at sea altogether, I don't profess to be a nautical man; I was carpenter of the ship—I was doing my utmost in looking over</p>

               <p>the side of the vessel shortly after the collision, while we were going round—I saw her at last a little on our port bow, and then I went on my duties—I last saw her just an instant after the collision; I saw no more of her, because I went to sound the fore compartment and the main pumps, then all hands were called to attend to the braces, to get the yards hauled round, and I went to assist—the first thing to be done was to get the vessel brought to the wind again, to bring her round on the port tack—I think that was the first thing that was done.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant clerk to the Borough Magistrates at Liverpool—I was present at the Court of Inquiry held at Liverpool, on the 13tb, 14th, and 15th December, 1873, it was a Board of Trade inquiry before the Magistrate, and two nautical assessors—after the witnesses had been examined the solicitor for the defendant put in a statement which he signed, this is it.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">This was put in and read; after some preliminary statement relative to the voyage, it proceeds to narrate the circumstances of the collision, as follows</hi>: "At about 5.30 I was called by the second officer who reported a green light on our port bow. I instantly went on deck and saw a green light from two to three points on lee bow. I directly ordered the man at the wheel to keep the ship close to the wind, reducing the speed from seven knots to about three, and the second officer to go forward to see if he could make out what the ship was doing. At this time we had a fresh breeze from S.E., ship headed E.N.E., wind increasing fast. About ten minutes after, seeing that the light was drawing very near and not showing her red light, and that a collison was inevitable, I ordered the helm hard down and the lee after braces to be let go, which was done immediately, and the main and cross jack yards immediately swung round. About the same time we came into collision with a three masted vessel, when all the sails were a back. I ordered the topgallant halyards to be let go, the ship backed astern directly. I never felt the slightest shock. The only thing I heard was the crash of our jibboom. Our ship having good stern away, I ordered the helm to be reversed, or hard a starboard, and the ship payed off to starboard; We got the yards hauled round and brought the ship to wind on the port tack, hauled up the courses and clewed up topgallant sails. I lost sight of the other vessel about five minutes after we separated. She was then about two points before our port beam. I considered that she must be still on the port tack I did not hear a sound from the other ship during the collision, either before or after, neither were any lights or signals of distress or sign of distress seen or reported. A ship at this time without any light could not be seen above 500 yards off. As soon as the ship was trimmed to the wind I ordered four hands to furl the topgallant sails and the rest to clear away the wreck forward. Carpenter to sound the pumps. Found the ship tight and the jibboom jibs and all head gear towing under the bows endangering the topmast and topgallant mast. Directly after we separated I called to the steward to know what time it was. He reported 6.20. Shortly after he reported to me that there were two of the vessel's men on board and that they were Italians and that the cook could understand them a little.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187601310048"></xptr>
               <p>I sent for them and the cook directly and questioned them through the cook as to what the vessel was, where she was from and where bound, and partic<lb></lb>ularly whether she had received any serious damage. They replied she was the <hi rend="italic">Java</hi> (as we understood) from Buenos Ayres bound to Liverpool and that they did not think she was damaged below the decks—they also said that they were standing off the land under easy sail waiting for daylight the captain intending to bear up for Queenstown. When the hands were sent up to furl the mizen topgallant sails I ordered them to give a good look round to try if they could see anything of the vessel or any lights. When they came down I asked if they had seen anything and they said no, I myself was looking out on the poop all the time and a look out on the forecastle as well. At daylight about 7.30, blowing a strong breeze; thick and dirty, I judged that a vessel might have been seen three-quarters or a mile off; I then held a consultation with the chief officer and we concluded that she must have gone on the other tack. I then gave orders to wear ship, we having been under three topsails going very close to the wind about half a knot an hour since we parted. All the gear being cleared away and the mast secured got the ship round on the starboard tack and set the foresail. At 9 o'clock sent all hands to breakfast; at 10. blowing a strong topsail breeze and cloudy weather. Seeing nothing of the vessel. I had another consultation with the chief office and we considered that she must have borne up for Queenstown; we continued our search. At about 11 a.m., I saw two casks in the water. I sent for the cook and the two men and asked them whether they had any casks on deck; if so, what colour were they painted. They replied they had two painted white with black hoops. We continued our search; at 1 p.m., saw the land, bearing north; at 3 saw the Hook Light House, bearing N.E., distant about 3 miles, wind E, strong breeze, tacked ship, arrived off Holyhead at 5 p.m. on the 19th and took a steam tug for Liverpool and arrived in the Mersey at 9 a.m. on the 18th November. During the time I have been a master, I never had a col<lb></lb>lision or an accident of any description; I never had to make a claim on the underwriters except when my vessel was damaged in the Bay of Bengal and afterwards when damaged in the Arabian Sea being caught on both occasions in a Typhoon.

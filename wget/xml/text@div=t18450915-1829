                  </hi> I am a fish salesman, and live in Rood-lane. Be<lb></lb>tween ten and eleven o'clock in the morning on the 3rd of Sept, I was in my first floor room—my daughters called me down—I saw the prisoner—he had been up stairs to my second floor room, which is used as a counting-house—I did not see him there, but saw him on the stairs—I asked what he wanted—he said he wanted to speak to me—I invited him up stairs to my second floor room to inquire his business—he said he did not want to go up again, he had been up, he wanted a situation—I said, "If you will wait a bit I will get you a situation"—I sent for the policeman, and in my own great coat, which the prisoner had got on his back, he found my silk handkerchief—I had not discovered that he had my coat on—this is my coat and handkerchief—they had been in the second floor front room, which was open—I had seen them there the day before.</p>

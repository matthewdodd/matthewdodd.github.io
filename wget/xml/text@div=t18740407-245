                  </hi>. I am an oilman, at 52, Leverton-Street, Kentish Town—on 21st March, at 5.30 p.m., the prisoner came in for a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. cake of fancy soap—she placed a sovereign in front of the counter in payment—my brother asked me for the change for the sovereign; I gave him a half-sovereign, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—my brother counted the change over to her—he turned round, and was going on with his work, and the prisoner suddenly said "Did I give you a sovereign? I intended to give you a shilling; if you will take it out of the shilling, and give me the sovereign back; I did not want to change that sovereign," and she placed the shilling by the side of the change—my brother took the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the shilling, and I gave him the sovereign out of the cash-box to give to her, and he placed the change on the desk by my side—the prisoner asked the price of the Swiss milk a tin, and I said "Eightpence"—she said she would have a tin, and she paid for it out of the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change from the shilling—she then went out—I counted and 'examined the change, and found a bad half-sovereign—I can swear that was not the Same half-sovereign that I had handed to my brother—I showed it to my brother, and he bent it between his finger and thumb—we both ran after the prisoner, and he said "This is not the half-sovereign I gave you; this is a bad one," and he returned it to her—she drew her hand from her muff, and threw another one down on the pavement from the same hand, and put it back in her muff, and said "What do you mean?"—I picked that half-sovereign up; it was a good one—I gave it to my brother, and said "That is not the half-sovereign you gave her"—he said "No, that is not the one; that is a good one"—we followed her about 300 yards till we got a constable, and gave her into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was attending to the books—the shop is rather dark—I took the sovereign from my brother—I counted the change out of the cash box myself and gave it to my brother, and he counted it over on the counter and left it there—I did not see the prisoner touch the change at all, and when she said she would pay with a shilling my brother took the change off the counter where it had been placed, and she remained some few minutes being served with the Swiss milk—she walked down the street at the ordinary pace—she was not running at all—she had both her hands in her muff—she withdrew one hand, and the very instant my brother passed the coin to her the other, fell on the ground.</p>

                  </hi>". I am the brother of the last witness—on 21st March, the prisoner came into the shop and asked for a piece of fancy soap, which was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a sovereign in payment—I put down in front of the counter close to her half-a-sovereign, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she looked into her purse and said "Did I give you a sovereign? I meant to have given you a shilling"—she asked me to take it out of the shilling, and I gave her the sovereign back—I picked the change up again—she afterwards asked for a tin of milk, which was 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I took that out of the shilling, so that she had 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the shilling altogether—I put the change down by the side of my brother—my brother counted it after she had left the shop and found the half sovereign was bad—I twisted it—I am certain it was not the same one I had put down in front of her before—we followed the prisoner—I handed the bad half sovereign to her and said, "This is not the half sove<lb></lb>reign I gave you? it is a bad one"—she took her hand out of her muff and took it in her finger and threw the other one down—it fell on the pavement my brother picked it up—it was not the one I had twisted—she went down the street and we followed her for about 400 or 500 yards, and then gave her into custody—I did not hear her say anything.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We followed some yards behind her—I did not see her speak to anyone—I did not see her pick the change up when I put it on the counter before her—I did not notice her touch the change—I did not hear the rattle of any coins at all.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody in the Kentish Town Road—I told her she was accused of ringing the changes, but I knew no particulars—she said, "Not me, sir; you have made a mistake"—the prosecutor came up—I asked him if that was the woman, he said "Yes"—she said "I have not been to your shop"—I took her to the station and she refused her name and address—I found in her bag the tablet of soap and the Swiss milk, also the sovereign and 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper. <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN PITNEY</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant Y</hi> 44,). I was at the station when the prisoner was brought in—she gave the name of Sarah Beaumont, but would give no address—she said "The gentlemen must have made a mistake. I never was in the shop."</p>

               <p>Q. Was your House broke open?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Wilson. On the 19th of December, the Day after the Fast.</p>

               <p>Q. In what Manner was it broke open?</p>
               <p>Wilson. There was a Quarel of Glass taken out of the Casement of the Window of my lower Room.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Then an't please my Lord, my Neighbour that liv'd opposite to me, coming home early the next Morning, saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. By what Time in the Morning did you find it otherwise?</p>
               <p>Wilson. My Neighbour call'd to me between One and Two o'Clock in the Morning. I found the Quarel taken out and the Casement open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not miss any Thing? Did you not miss a Pewter Dish, a Pewter Plate, a Pewter Mustard-Pot, a China Cup and Saucer, an Earthen Dish and a Drinking Glass, all your Property? Having lost all these Things, what have you to say against these Prisoners?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I saw none of them 'till they were brought to my House. I know that little one.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they are the three Prisoners at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I know the two little ones on the Right Hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them did you not see?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I did not see Joel.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they behave?</p>
               <p>Wilson. They own'd the Fact before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. In what Manner did they own it?</p>
               <p>Wilson. They own'd they were at the doing of this Fact, and that they took part of the Money the Things were sold for.</p>

             the 19th of December, the Day after the Fast, lent me a broken-pointed Pen-knife. I got upon this Gentleman's Bulk, the Prosecutor, at the Black-Horse; with that I took the Knife and open'd the Lead, and took out a Pain of Glass; and then I put in my Hand and open'd the Casement: I took out a Pewter Plate, a Pewter Dish and a Drinking Glass, a China Cup and Saucer, and a half Pint-Pot, a Pewter Pot and Earthen Dish :] The Pewter Plate and Pewter Dish I took myself, and Joel held the Candle, while I open'd the Window and took the Pewter Plate and Pewter Dish out: Then Joel got up himself and took out the Glass and China Cup and Saucer, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mayson, did he do any Thing?</p>
               <p>Bullock. Mayson receiv'd some of these Things. The Man facing the Black Horse saw us, and follow'd us: Then I call'd Joel, and he laid with me 'till next Morning. Mayson said, he was going to the other Side of the Water to his Sister; and that she had sold the Things for half a Crown.</p>
               <p>Tellinson Torvey. The Fast Day at Night we went over the Water and we stay'd playing at Cards 'till between One and Two in the Morning. I live opposite to Mr. Wilson's, by the May-Pole: Before we could put the Fire out, I heard one call thro' the Window to light a Candle; I said my Mistress and I had been out late. It was Bullock that spoke, I could swear to him among a Thousand. I seeing a Light at my Neighbours Door, look'd out and said, the Black-Horse is broke open. They would not stir 'till I open'd the Door; then they all run away, and Joel was upon the Bulk handing down the Dish. Mayson confess'd the Fact before me in Mr. Wilson's House. Joel did not speak in my hearing. <rs id="t17460117-31-verdict126" type="verdictDescription">

On the 13th of February my wife and I were sitting at dinner; the prisoner at the bar came into the shop; my wife said there is Mary, shall I ask her in; she then said to the prisoner, Mary, will you go and order a pint of beer; the girl readily went for the beer and brought it in; my wife asked her if she would take a piece of beef, she said thank you, ma'am, no; at the time she came into the room a customer came into the shop. I went into the shop and left my wife in the room; when I was in the room my wife laid two seven shilling pieces on the table and a crooked shilling; at the time I was serving the customer another customer came in; then my wife got up and came into the shop, leaving the girl there; my wife had not been long behind the counter before she saw the girl coming out, she asked her some questions, but what I do not know; the prisoner then went out of the side door very quick; my wife went down stairs, she returned immediately and went into the room, and said the girl had robbed us. I then went and missed the money and my silver watch. I immediately went in pursuit of her, but could not find her; I had an accident - sprained my knee and hurt my thumb.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your watch again - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>MRS. SULLY. The prisoner was a servant with me about two years back, and upon my hearing that she had a cruel mother I always, when she came to me made her welcome. On the 13th of February the prisoner came to me, I put my hand in my pocket, took out two seven shilling pieces and a crooked shilling; a customer came into the shop, my husband went into the shop to serve the customer; Mr. Sharp, who was with us, followed him immediately into the shop; I said, Mary, will you have a piece of beef, and when the second customer came in I went into the shop and left the girl in the room; I am sure there was nobody in the room but the girl. When I was in the shop I heard the side door creak; I was rather surprised to hear the door; I said, Mary (she said yes, ma'am), I am going down stairs; I saw her countenance change, I thought she might not be well; I turned into the room and found the two seven shilling pieces which had been on the table, gone; immediately from there I went into the kitchen, I said Mary is gone, good God,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180904120005"></xptr>she has robbed me; my husband said, robbed indeed! my watch is gone; I said go after her; the watch was a family watch. Mr. Sharp went after her one way and my husband the other; Mr. Sully slipped down; they could not find her; she was found on the Wednesday week following; she was brought by an officer from Mile End in a coach to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the watch - A. Never; I told her she had acted very cruel to me. I said Mary, if you will return the watch I will let you go; she told me not to talk to her, she should go before my betters, it was too late to talk about the watch, it was not in my power to liberate her.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known this young woman some time - A. Yes; she lived with me about five months. I never found any thing amiss while she lived with me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. There was one lodger in the house - was there not - A. I believe there was.</p>
               <p>MR. SHARP. On the 13th of February, about half past one, I was in Mr. Sully's back room; the prisoner came in, Mrs. Sully asked her to get a pint of beer, she brought it; there were two seven shilling pieces on the table and a shilling, and two watches were in the room; we were in the back room altogether. After the prisoner had fetched the beer a customer came in the shop; Mr. Sully went to the shop, I followed him immediately, I stood outside of the counter; another customer came in; Mrs. Sully came out, leaving the prisoner in the room alone. In the course of a minute or two I saw this young woman get up from the chair and sit down again; about a minute after that she came out of the shop; Mrs. Sully and she talked together; Mrs. Sully went down stairs, came up and went into the room, she exclaimed, good God! she has robbed us. I went one way and Mr. Sully the other after her; we did not find her.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM REID. I am an officer. On the 25th of February I apprehended the prisoner at Mr. Sully's house: I searched her, and found nothing about her; I searched her lodgings, I found nothing there.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel, called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>GUILTY, aged 18.</p>

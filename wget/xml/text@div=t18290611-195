               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was the prisoner in your employ? A. Yes; I build on speculation -I have sometimes two or three men, sometimes twenty or thirty; I had at this time four or five men - I generally paid them in money; never with any thing else - I may have paid them a few shillings short on the Saturday night, but never paid them in goods, to the best of my knowledge, for the last twenty years, nor ever authorised any one to pay them in goods; if a man wanted a board, I let him have it at market price; if so I outset it, but I never let them have goods when I had no money to give them, that I will swear; there was an execution against me in the Forty-Shillings Court, but I did not keep out of the way on that account; I was pulling down some houses in the Strand - I was not out of the way for fear of being arrested; I do not owe 20l. in the world - I was not indebted to some others of my workmen to the amount of 15l. or 20l. - the prisoner was in my employ; they drew their wages weekly; upon my solemn oath, I have not given some of the men materials with the view of paying them their wages, nor allowed them to take materials; I had a labourer named Horsley - I cannot say what I owed him, because his work was not finished; I did not allow him to take any thing by way of paying himself - I do not consider that I have paid him for all that he has done; I did not desire the prisoner to take four long joists from Mr. Sutton - they did do it, and I have had them to replace; these four long joists were employed on my premises without my knowledge - I never knew a word about it till after the surveyor called upon me.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BARWICK. I took the prisoner on the 9th of May.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BRAIN. I keep a shop in Somers'-town. On the 8th of May I was gone to an auction-room; the prisoner and another man came to me there, and asked if I would buy a couple of doors; I said, "What sort of doors are they?" they said, "New ones, and they are all fair and square - we have got them to sell instead of getting money from our master:" when I returned home, they brought them down, and left them; I gave them 6s. 6d. on the doors - they said they had got two pairs of sashes and frames, would I purchase them; I said, "I don't know - they are things very dangerous - they may be broken, perhaps, in my place;" they said, "We will chance that; if you will have them, we will bring them:" the chief of this discourse was from the other person - they brought down the sashes, and left them there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.These men came in broad daylight? A. Yes; they told me to expose them for sale - they said they were not afraid of them; they said their master owed them from 15l. to 20l.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Did they tell you their master's name? A. No; I did not ask.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have a witness.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM TRUSS. I am a carpenter. I know Mr. Sparks; I worked for him at the time the prisoner did -Mr. Sparks owed me some wages, and I was obliged to go, and kick up a noise before I could get any to support my wife - we were to draw money for the work every week, but on the very first Saturday night he left us without a copper; some went to Kennington, to Mr. Sutton's, to try and get the money - he knew of our taking these joists, but he denied it before me - Mr. Sutton, his brother-in-law, who is the foreman, told us to go and take the joists, which we did.</p>

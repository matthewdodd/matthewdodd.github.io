            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 7th of September I went with Mead to the William the Fourth beer-house, at Enfield; the prisoner came there about a quarter-past one o'clock in the morning, with a horse and cart - he stopped opposite the house, came up to the door which leads into the yard, jumped up, put his hand over, and unbolted the door; he then went back to the cart, and brought out a sack of potatoes- when he had got to the passage leading to the road, we showed ourselves, and he put the potatoes down; I asked him what he was going to do with them - he said to leave them for the ostler, who was to give him a 1s. for them; I secured him - he begged forgiveness, and said it was the first time he ever robbed his master; after some time I allowed him to go on to London with his cart, and when he returned I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. How many horses were there in the cart? A. Two; he did not say it was so loaded he was forced to leave some - he said he lodged at that house.</p>

            . I am bailliff to Mr. Fordham Ellis, of Edmonton. The prisoner was in his service, and the sack is his property.</p>
               <p>MR. FORDHAM ELLIS. The prisoner has been in my employ about two years; I employed him to carry the potatoes to London, and on his return I met him at the station-house, and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence When I put them off my back the officer told me to take them into the stable, which I did; I said I was going to leave them there - he asked what I could get for them if I was going to sell them; I said I might get 1s. for them, but I did not mean to sell them.</p>

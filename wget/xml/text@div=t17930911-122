I am a grinder by business; I had been abroad that day, and it was almost ten o'clock, I walked as hard as I could to get home, and just as I got to the Black Horse, in Barbican I got up behind this coach, there was another man behind the coach then; I had not been up above half a minute before that man jumps down from the coach, and the coach stopped, and I jumped off; I never meddled with the straps or knew any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Court to Carter. Was any other man behind the coach but this man? - No, there was no other behind the coach all the way.</p>

                  </hi> I am shopman to Charles Meeking a linen-draper on Holborn-hill. On the 14th of January, between half-past five and half-past six o'clock in the evening, a boy who was passing gave me information—I went to the door and missed a print, which had been pinned up inside the door—the boy directed me up Shoe-lane, and half way up there I met the prisoner Storey, with another woman, who I believe to be the other prisoner, but I cannot swear to her—I took the piece of print from Storey, and gave her into custody—the other ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to Mr. Johnson, in Fetter-lane. I saw the two prisoners and a boy together, at Mr. Meeking's shop—I heard the boy say to the prisoners, "Now it is all right"—I saw the two prisoners go to the door, unpin the print, and go down Shoe-lane with it—I am certain of then both—I ran in and told the shopman, who followed them—I could not tell which unpinned the print—Storey was immediately taken into custody—Delany and the boy ran away—Delany was taken a week after—I have not seen the boy since I am sure Delany was the person.</p>

            . I am an officer of Mary-le-bone. On the 14th of December, about half-past four o'clock, I went to No. 1, Little Welbeck-street, next door to the Edinburgh Castle, public-house - when I arrived I saw a hackney-coach at the door - I went into the house, and saw the prisoner, a woman named Hickey, Mrs. Harrington, and the coachman - the prisoner and Hickey seemed to be intoxicated; I asked the prisoner if her name was not Conroy, which she denied; I said"Why, you were servant to Mrs. Hunter" - she also denied that, and denied having lived at Mr. Crowder's - Hickey also denied it. A trunk stood by the side of them - I asked whose it was - Conroy and Hickey said it was not theirs - I said I should detain them all - Hickey threw down a pocket-book which had a duplicate in it, which does not apply to this property. I took from Conroy's hand some keys, and the duplicate of a piece of silk, pawned for 30s. on the 14th of December. Mr. Crowder and Allison came in and identified Conroy: I immediately took them all to the office, and opened the box in the presence of them all. The first thing I saw was various lengths of silk, containing, in all, twenty-five yards - there was a silk dress, and pelisse, three petticoats, two night gowns, four shifts, four silver tea-spoons, two silver table-spoons, a stuff dress, a cloth pelisse, and a pair of silk stockings, all of which I gave to Mrs. Hunter, at the second examination, about the 18th - they were in my custody till then; from the prisoner's person I took a bombazeen gown, a shawl, a cloth pelisse, and bonnet - she had them on; I delivered them with a pair of boots and shoes, from the trunk, to Miss Bowstead, at the second examination, by order of the Magistrate. I produce six more tea-spoons, a dessert spoon, and a salt-spoon - every thing was in the trunk except what was found on her person.</p>

They took her to the office with the box. She had told me the night before, that she had a parcel of silk in the box, and after my husband went out in the morning she took out a piece of silk, and shewed me - it was exactly of this colour - she asked me to cut enough for an umbrella off it - (my husband is an umbrella maker) - I said I should like to measure it first, which I did, and it measured forty yards; after I cut it I said "In the name of God, Ann, how did you come by all this?" she said "I nabbed it - I have plenty more, and silver spoons too;" I said "How could you do so, you will be hung;" she said "Oh, never fear, she is an old widow, and she won't know where to find me;" I asked where she lived; she said "In Charles-street;" I asked if she kept a silk mercer's shop - she said she was a dress-maker; I asked her name; she said "No matter;" I told her she must leave my place instantly, and then I got so flurried that I do not know what more passed - only I remember her going away from my place.</p>

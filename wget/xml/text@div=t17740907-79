            . I am brother to the last witness; I fastened all the doors and windows over night; I went to bed at near eleven o'clock; I got up in the morning at about seven o'clock; I was first up in the family; I found all the places in the shop and parlour fast as I left them over night; soon after I missed several things, of which I informed my brother; it was some time before I discovered which way the thief had got into the house. I went into the cellar about eleven o'clock; I observed a greater light than usual came through the door, and upon examination I saw the bar of the cellar door lie upon the stairs; the porter and I examined it; there were three marks of a chissel, which corresponded with a chissel Mr. Brown has in his custody.</p>

               <p>Brown. Yes, I was; there were two impressions made by this chissel; one at the top of the door, the other at the bottom; the impressions correspond precisely with the point of the chissel; there was one mark on the centre of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177409070042"></xptr> door, where the wrench was made when it was opened, for they drew bolts as thick as my finger; there is a mark corresponds with the face of the chissel for five inches; there is likewise a notch in the chissel, and there is the mark of it in something hard in the door.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Davis, a sawyer, in Plummer's-place, Clerkenwell. On the 30th of September, about six o'clock in the evening, while I was in the yard of Sadler's Wells theatre, my pocket, containing 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 4 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. In copper, was torn from my side with vio<lb></lb>lence—I looked about, and saw the prisoner with my pocket-book is his hand, which he was taking out of my pocket—I snatched it from him—he struck me three times, once in the eye, and twice in the side, but I succeeded in getting it—I cried out, and told him I would give him in charge—he went up into the gallery—I have no doubt whatever that lit is the man.</p>

On the 6th of February, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I had occasion to go up stairs to give some instructions to my cutter. When I came down then I discovered the prisoner coming out of my warehouse upon the first floor, she was making towards the second floor up stairs; I followed her, accusing her that she had robbed me. When she had got half way up she dropped a pair of blue cloth pantaloons; I picked them up and accused her with robbing me; she said she had only taken them to put some buttons upon them. On my looking at the pantaloons I discovered that there were no buttons off,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181202190039"></xptr>and I stated that as such she could not have taken for that purpose, but for no other purpose than taking them away. I immediately searched her, and caused her to go to the apartment that she occupied; the rooms that I appropriated for the work people to have rent free, for the sake of protecting my property, a kitchen, and a little room adjoining. I then ordered one of my servants to go up and tell her husband to come down, who was in my employ at that time; he came down, I told him of the circumstance, we went together into her apartment; I stated, before her, I had missed a number of other things, and as she had taken them pantaloons, I conceived that she had taken many others; and told her if she would give up the property, and tell me where it was, I would not prosecute her, or send for an officer, on account of her family. She stated, that she had never robbed me of anything else, and as such she could not give up any thing else. I went up in the shop and consulted with my brother; Wane came up in the shop, and told me that he could not get her to acknowledge to any thing, I then sent for an officer; he came, and I went with the officer into her apartment; he searched her, and while he was searching, she dropped a duplicate on the ground; I picked it up, and discovered it was a coat, pledged for one pound, at Mr. Fleming's in Whitechapel; she was then taken to the counter, and returning to search the apartment that she occupied, they discovered a new cloth great coat, a cloth pellisse, a pair of cloth pantaloon-trowsers, and a pair of cloth breeches; all these things were found there. In the evening I went to Mr. Fleming's, the pawnbroker, he sent up the coat, and looking over his books he discovered another coat. I found another coat there my property.</p>

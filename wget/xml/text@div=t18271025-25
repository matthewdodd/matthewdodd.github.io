            . I am a prisoner, confined in Clerkenwell - my sentence of imprisonment expires on the 30th of November. On the <rs id="t18271025-25-cd161" type="crimeDate">24th of July</rs>

Everett immediately jumped off the wheel, and Ross, who was on the stage, struck him in the face - I am sure Ross gave the first blow; Everett, in return, struck Ross in his left eye and in the throat - those were the only blows that passed; Ross and Everett went and sat on their different forms - no more fighting took place; in five or ten minutes, Ross kept rubbing his eye with his shirt sleeve, and complained very much of his head - he died on the 26th of the month; there was no previous quarrel - the prisoner was not a quarrelsome man.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and attended with Mr. Webbe at the examination of the deceased, and under the membrane covering the brain, I found about two ounces of coagulated blood, which was produced by a rupture of an artery; it was most certainly occasioned by a blow on the temple, and I have no doubt was the cause of his death.</p>

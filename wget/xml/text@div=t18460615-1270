               <p>All Saints, Poplar. On Saturday, the 6th of Junt, I was on the pier about twenty minutes to five o'clock in the afternoon, altering a mooring-chain—the prisoner, Molloy and George Palmer passed me, and were blas<lb></lb>pheming together, using dreadful language—they were tipsy, and took their meats on the after-part of the dummy, where the steam-boats come to—they commenced quarrelling and blaspheming dreadfully—Palmer said, "You never gare it me"—I do set know what he meant—Molloy said, "I gave you one a-piece"—Palmer pulled both his trowsers' pockets out, and laid, "Have I anything there?"—he opened the lid of a small box, and said to me, H Is there anything in that?"—Palmer then left them on the pier, and had some conversation with some men on Garfield's-wharf—he returned in about a minute, in rather as excited manner, on the barge—there was a good deal of pushing each other—they began quarrelling again—he again went on Garfield's-wharf, and as he returned on the pier, be met a lady and child, and in order not to interrupt them, he leaped over on the outside dummy—Molloy tapped him on the cheek, and called him "George," in a friendly way—the prisoner took Palmer by the hand—he disengaged himself from tat prisoner—they stood in a fighting attitude, facing each other—Palmer liftsd up his hand as if he meant to make a blow—the prisoner said, "If you do, I will <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> you into the river"—the words were no sooner said, than he pushed Palmer headlong into the Thames, by <hi rend="italic">skoving</hi> him on the left breast—he went head-foremost into the mud, and never rose—there was about eight feet of water alongside the barge, and he stuck in the bottom—I leieated him with a staff in about a quarter of an hour—he was then dead—they tried to restore him for nearly an hour, but without success.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publican, and live in Thurston-grove, South<lb></lb>wark. I was at Limehouse-pier on the 6th of June, about four o'clock, and saw the prisoner, the deceased, and Molloy on the corner of the dummy, all very drunk, and wrangling about some money—they appeared to doubt each other, and were feeling in each other's pockets—they referred to me several times, hut seeing them drunk, I took no notice of them—after settling their money affairs, they began sparring about the barge, apparently <hi rend="italic">larking</hi>, not in anger—the prisoner and Palmer then ran up part of the gangway, still <hi rend="italic">larking</hi>—they returned to the outside dummy, in a sparring attitude—the prisoner then said to Palmer, "D—n your eyes, has any one insulted you here"—he went round sparring at the passengers going by the steam-boata—Palmer laid, "No one has," but suddenly turned round, and pointed to a man rowing about on the river, eight or ten yards off, and said, "That mm has"—whik he was pointing to the man, the prisoner came behind him and pushed him into the river—he rote once Hut went down again immediately, and was drowned.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you think it was accidental? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My opinion is it was the result of a drunken frolic—there did not appear any ill feeling, but foolish forking—I never saw either of them before.</p>

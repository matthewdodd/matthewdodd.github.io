                  </hi>. I am a merchant, and live at Claremont Terrace, Lordship Lane, Stoke Newington—I know the prisoner; he calls himself a general dealer—on 20th June last he purchased 135 bundles of straw boards of me, the price was 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave me his acceptance for the amount; it came back dishonoured—I met the prisoner once or twice after that, in the street, and asked him to pay me—he said he would do so—after that his sister paid me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account; I think that was in October, about three weeks after the bill was dishonoured—on 26th October, the prisoner came to my office, and asked me to grant him some more time—my clerk was present—I asked what time he required to pay the balance, 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said twelve days, but if I would not pay the acceptance away, he would probably be in a position to take it up before that time—I had a bill-stamp in the office, or I got one, and my clerk wrote out this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., payable in twelve days, and the prisoner accepted it—it would fall due on the 10th November—it has never been paid—on 12th November I received this letter from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "November 11th. Sir,—I have been expecting your bill to be presented, and only now have received the enclosed. I shall take the bill up this evening, and save you further trouble.") It never was taken up, and I gave instructions to my solicitor—I did not tell the prisoner I would renew the bill on its becoming due, nor did he tell me he could not meet it—I did not say it would be all right, and that by his obliging me, and accepting the bill, it would be doing me a personal favour; it was not upon that under<lb></lb>standing alone that I consented to accept the bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This was the first transaction I ever had with the prisoner—I sold him the goods on 30th June—I have not got the first bill here, it is at my office—I sued on the second bill, and then he made the affidavit—I got judgment against him—I left the matter in the hands of my solicitor—I had to withdraw the levy, there being a bill of sale, and pay 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the costs of the interpleaded—I took out the summons when I found that perjury was committed—I think it was taken out on 15th</p>

               <p>January—the affidavit was sworn on 29th November—I wrote a letter to the prisoner in January stating I should take proceedings if he did not pay the money—I did not tell him verbally that I would indict him for perjury if he did not pay—I asked him to pay me when I met him in the street; I think that was in December—he said the matter rested entirely in the hands of his solicitors—I said nothing to him then about perjury—I met him again in Cannon Street, about a month ago, and asked him to settle it, and he again told me it did not lay in his power; it was in the hands of his solicitors—I did not say anything about perjury then—it was he who proposed the second bill—I did not particularly care whether I had it or not; I thought it would be a better security—I paid it away—I did not tell him that was what I wanted it for—I did not agree that I would not pay it away—I did not give up the old bill, because I thought that was a collateral security—when he re<lb></lb>accepted this bill I told him I would not return the other; that I would keep it as a collateral security, and return it to him when the other bill was paid; that was at my office at the time he accepted the bill—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my clerk's writing; it was no doubt written by my instructions. (<hi rend="italic">This was a Utter to the prisoner stating that it was his intention to prosecute him for perjury, and not to spars him the slightest mercy in dealing with him according to law.</hi>) If my clerk wrote that, it was evidently by my instructions—I do not dictate to him what to say, merely to write such and such a letter—Mr. Murray is my attorney, and has been so all through.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the prosecutor—I recollect the defendant calling at the office on 26th October—he asked Mr. Eckhaus if he would take a bill for twelve days for the amount of the account, and Mr. Eckhaus consented to do so—I wrote it out, and saw the prisoner accept it—he said he was expecting to receive money every day, and he should very likely pay the bill before it was due—he did not say he could not meet it when it was due, nor did Mr. Eckhaus say he would see it was all right—if he gave him the bill it would be doing him a great personal favour—the prosecu<lb></lb>tor did not consent to accept the bill on the understanding that he would renew it when it became due.</p>

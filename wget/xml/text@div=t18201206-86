The cheque was in that pocket. I pulled it out and was wrapping it up. The prisoners were there. Fortesque said</p>
               <p>"What is that paper." I said a cheque for 9 l. 17 s. belonging to my master. He said</p>
               <p>"Let us look at it." I held it in my hand, and said you may look at it He took it out of my hand, and said I am very poor and immediately ran out of a little side door. He whispered to Purdon, who was in the other room. He could not see him take it from me. I said to Fortesque,</p>
               <p>"You have carried the joke too far, give me the cheque, and let me go." He said wait a little longer and you shall have it. He said if I went up the street with him he would give it me. Purdon came running back as hard as he could and whispered with Fortesque. I again asked him for it, and he said he had no cheque of mine, I might go about my business. I ran home and told my master - he sent me to the bankers - it had been paid ten minutes before - it was about one o'clock. I have since seen a letter, which I shewed Fortesque. He said it was his writing - (looks at it.) - this is it. -</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cigar maker, and live in Radeliff-gardens, St. Luke's. On 7th Jan. I was in Long-lane, Smithfield, between 7 and a quarter past 7 o'clock in the evening—while I was walking along, the prisoner and a companion of his came up to me—the other asked me the nearest way to the Strand—I pointed in the direction towards Snow-hill—on my doing that, he renewed the inquiry, and I pointed towards St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I still kept my hand pointing, and he renewed the inquiry a third time—I then felt a jerk at my watch—I laid hold of the prisoner, and we struggled together, and fell across the road—I called out, "Thieves!"—the prisoner got up before me—some one laid hold of him, but he made his escape—I saw my watch in his hand, and saw him pass it to another man, and he said, "Why don't you take hold of it?"—I saw no more of the prisoner till 8th Jan., when I saw him at the police station—he was by himself—I knew him again—I am certain he is the man—there were gas lights where we were struggling—his face was in front of the gas light—I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a photographic artist On the night of 7th Jan. I was coming from the Charterhouse towards Smithfield, about a quarter past 7 o'clock—I saw two men struggling in the road-—one of them had a crutch, and he seemed to have hold of the other man—I heard one shout out, "Stop him, he has got my watch," and I saw a man run away—he was caught on the pavement by several parties—by this time I got up, but he seemed so securely held that I did not lay hold of him—I looked well at him—the prisoner is the man—to my surprise he got away—on 8th Jan. I went to Newgate—there were several prisoners there—I picked the prisoner out directly—there is no doubt about the man.</p>

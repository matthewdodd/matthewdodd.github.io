The prisoner and another woman came on the 28th of February, and asked to look at some muslin, which she said was too dear. She then asked to look at some lace. On the middle of the counter there was some stuffs and callicoes. While I was turning round to get the lace-box, I heard a rustling. I did not take any notice at the time. I shewed the lace, and they bought half a quarter of a yard, which came to 3 d., the other woman paid for it. I let them go out, and having a suspicion from the rustling, I called the other two young men, who were at dinner, to follow them. They both went and returned in about an hour and a half with the prisoner in custody, and 11 yards of printed stuff. I had shewn it to a lady about half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she acknowledge to have taken it, and wished to be forgiven - A. Yes; she said she did not know what possessed her at the time. She gave her address, Hampstead.</p>

There was another woman in company with her. They went into a private house together, and when they came out they went down Chapel-street. About ten minutes after we took them at St. Pancras Church. They turned up a court, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120032"></xptr>I saw the prisoner take the stuff out of a large bundle.

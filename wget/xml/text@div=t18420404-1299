                  </hi>. I am engineer at the works of the Gas-light and Coke Company. I have seen some pieces of quartering, which belonged to an old vat which held gas, but which was pulled down and in pieces—it was in some new houses which were building in Johnson-street, inside a fence on some premises belonging to the Gas Company—that fence was open to the public all day—I do not know the prisoner—this is the timber now produced.</p>

About eight o'clock on Thursday night, the 24th of March, I met the prisoner in Johnson-street, carrying this wood under his arm—I stopped him, and asked what he was doing—he said he was moving—I asked where from—he said, "No. 2, Johnson-street"—I asked him to go back with me to No. 2—he did so—the woman there said she knew nothing of him, but he had formerly lived there—when he turned out of the gate he said, "For God's sake, policeman, let me go; I have a wife and child at home, and no firing; poverty has brought me to it; I have taken it from the new buildings," pointing to them.</p>

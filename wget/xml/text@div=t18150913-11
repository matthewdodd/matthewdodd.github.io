            . I lost some bank notes on Saturday, the 2nd of September. I went into the Black Horse that night, and called for a pot of beer; shortly afterwards, the prisoner came in, and sat on the other side. I treated him, until at length, the landlady would not let us have any more liquor. The prisoner then called me out, and asked me as a countryman, to come, and eat a bit of supper with him. I went with him to his lodgings, but I don't know in what street they are; and there was a girl there; we had supper, and when I had finished mine, I wished to go, but the prisoner held me back three or four times, and said, I should not go yet; I then kicked violently at the door, and cried out murder; and then he took me by the other shoulder, and hit me in the face; he then took his knife out, and cut the handkerchief which was round my neck, and took three one-pound notes out of it. I am sure they were in it. I came on shore that day, at Tower-hill, from on board the Menelaus frigate, and had received the notes from Captain 
               <persName id="t18150913-11-person170">Dicks</persName>
            . I immediately ran out then, and went for a watchman, and found three in about half an hour. I brought them to the door of the house, but they would not break it open, as it was locked. I soon after, saw the prisoner in a cook's shop, and then I called some watchman again, and when he came out, they attempted to take him, but he made his way through the whole of them. He was taken on the Sunday afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Burry. I received three pounds fourteen shillings from Captain

                  </hi>. On 10th February I lived at 10, Holborn-buildings—I now live at 10, Bishop's-head-court—I am the wife of Michael Connor—I had a child named Catherine—on 10th February the prisoner visited my room, my husband was at home as well as myself and four children—the child Catherine was there among the others—she was ten months old the night she died—the prisoner was sitting by the fire—there was a piece of iron used as a poker, with which we stirred the fire, standing by the fire<lb></lb>side—the prisoner took it and began to poke out the fire with it, and began fiddling with the fire, with the iron rod—I <hi rend="italic">reprimanded</hi> her two or three times to put it down—she was poking the fire out one way and the other—I was suckling my child, and when I was in the act of holding it out, she thrust the poker quite straight at the child, right in the groin—I said to the prisoner, "You have burned my child"—she said, "No," turning the poker round and bringing me the other end—I said, "Don't you do like that,—I put my hand against it and it was quite hot—I was suckling the child at the time she did it, and holding it out—the child's clothes were up, and the prisoner thrust the poker up towards it—it came right on the privates and thigh—the child did not cry much at the time—I got some sweet-oil and used it—it got very low—the prisoner had used the poker towards the other children in the morning part, and she said to my husband she should like to put the poker so and so, and mike so and so of him; it is not fit to be ex<lb></lb>plained—this was between 6 and 7 o'clock on the Sunday night—I went to a surgeon in Leather-lane on Wednesday—he examined the child and gave toe some elder-ointment for it—I can't tell the name of the doctor—on the Friday I took it to Bartholomew's Hospital and the doctor dressed it, and</p>

I am a labourer, and live at Bishop's-head-court, Holborn—I work for Mr. Sanders, in Castle-street—the deceased child, Catherine Connor, was supposed to be my child—she was ten months old when she died—I was present on Sunday evening, 17th February, when she died—on the Sunday evening before that, at the time the accident occurred, I was in my own room, in Holborn-buildings—the prisoner was there—she had come in several times the day before—I saw her doing something with the poker—I do not know anything much about this occasion, and I am very sorry to know it now—she caught hold of this poker and was putting it in between the bars for some time, I can't tell you how long—she kept putting it in and out—my wife sat at one side of the stove and the prisoner sat at the other side—my wife was holding the deceased child out to make water—since this has happened I cannot recollect things as I ought—the prisoner took the poker out of the fire and put it right into the child and catched her in the privates and in the thigh—the poker was hot at the time—I do not know whether it was red hot—the child made but very little noise—my wife said to the prisoner, "You have burnt my child"—I can't recollect what she said to that—I don't recollect her saying anything about the state of the poker, whether it was hot or not—I had had something to drink at this time, but I have often had more—I was sober enough so far as not to do an injury to anybody else—I was sober enough to recollect what happened—what I do recollect I am telling you.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and live at 4, Gray's Inn-lane—on Saturday night, 16th February, about 11 o'clock, I was visited by Honora Connor, with a female child—I examined its private parts—it was suffering excruciating pain—it was bordering on a state of mortification—the extensive inflammation was seated on the right labia of the female organ of generation, and there were marks, corresponding to the instrument produced, of charred cuticle—the child was suffering from nervous excitement from pain—it was in a healthy condition generally, and well nourished—it was not in a low state—it was in a very excited state from great pain—such an inflammation as I saw would produce that excited state until the mortification made progress—having examined the marks I aw with the instrument, I have every reason to believe it was inflicted by that instrument, and by a burn—I have not the slightest doubt of that—I ordered a liniment, which my assistant made up—I was absent when called on the following day, and my assistant went and visited the child—that was on Sunday—I was summoned to go to the child—it died just as I arrived, about a quarter to 7 on Sunday evening, the 17th—I saw it dead at that time—it vas the same child—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the body twenty-four hours after death—the general appearance of the body was good, very well developed, and particularly fine for its age—it was particularly clean—the under and upper parts of both thighs were highly inflamed, and bore marks of the instrument, marks of burning, charred cuticle, completely destroyed—there was a corresponding mark on the outer side of the left foot, as though the instrument had been applied to the genital organ, and then in the movement to avoid it. H had caught the foot—the mark was slight on the foot, it had merely destroyed the surface of the cuticle, but it bore evident marks of the instrument produced—there was very extensive inflammation of the right labia passing to the internal parts of generation, extending to the bladder, and producing extensive inflammation into the pelvic cavity—I was very careful in my examination, and was unable to find any<lb></lb>thing other than would have ensued from nervous excitement—the cause of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186102250030"></xptr>
               <p>death was nervous prostration, induced by the injuries inflicted—it is my firm belief that the burn was the cause of death—I could not see anything else to account for it—mortification had taken place in the parts, conveying the effects to the nervous system, and ultimately killing the child—the mortification was in the substance of the labia and the lower part of the right thigh, which implicated all the vessels in the immediate part.</p>

I have been a good friend to her in every way; my husband was fifteen or sixteen weeks out of work; we were obliged to sell our home, and I went to her for shelter. I did not do it with any bad feeling, it was dirt and neglect, and the place being so narrow, and I poking the fire with the poker. I did not mean to do it.</p>

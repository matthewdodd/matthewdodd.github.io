                  <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE HURRELL</hi>. I am a gentleman, residing on my property, at Dal<lb></lb>ston-terrace. I have known the prisoner three or four years, keeping a milk-shop, in Chapel-street, Lamb's Conduit-street—I always considered her a respectable woman—on Monday, the 5th of May, I had occasion to pay 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to her for rent, for a poor woman, which I have paid for years—I left my house early that morning, and was driven by my groom, Gibson—I went Old-street way—it was between eleven and twelve o'clock when I arrived at the prisoner's shop, I should say nearer half-past eleven—I found her in the shop, behind the counter, with her daughter—I took a bundle of money out of my pocket, one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes, and ten sovereigns wrapped in them—it was wrapped up very small—I had put that in my pocket that morning before I started, intending to pay it into the London Joint Stock Bank. I placed it on the counter, between myself and a milk-can, about four inches from the edge of the counter on my side—the counter is about two or three feet broad—a person on the other side of the counter could not see it—I took one of the sovereigns partially out, but recollecting that that money was counted for the Joint Stock Bank, I would not pay it out of that, and I replaced the sovereign, but did not particularly wrap up the notes—I did not refold them so tightly as before—I then took out my purse, and was going to pay in silver, but finding I had not silver enough I paid it in two half-sovereigns—I had a number of half-sovereigns in my purse—she gave me a receipt—some conversation occurred about some losses I had had lately, and my not paying the poor woman's rent any longer, I then said, "Mrs. Davies, since I was here I have lost the sight of one eye," (which was the case, and that might have caused me not to observe this parcel)—she commiserated me about it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184506160122"></xptr>
               <p>—I remained there about ten minutes—I then drove off, and called in Charlotte-street, Bedford-square—I paid no money there—I then stopped in Fleet-street, at the office of the Anti-Corn-law League, to see Mr. James—he was not at home—I had no occasion to put my hand in my pocket there—I went from there straight to the London Joint Stock Bank, and found that the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was gone—I told my groom to drive back directly to Mrs. Davies'—I recollected at that time that I had left the money there, and could swear to the spot at which I left it, because when I got back I found the milk-can was moved a few inches from the spot—when I was at the Joint Stock Bank it was as near half-past twelve o'clock as possible—that is in Prince's-street, by the side of the Bank of England—we travelled very fast back to Mrs. Davies, and got there within ten minutes—I dare say I was there about a quarter to one o'clock—I saw the prisoner and her daughter—I said, "Mrs. Davies, I have left my money on your counter" (I did not say how much then) "I left it in this spot, I can take my oath I left it here"—she said, "I have not seen it"—I pointed out the spot, and said, "Who has been in since I left, if you have not seen it?"—she said, "No one, but a woman for some milk, and two boys for a halfpenny worth of milk"—she said she knew the woman, but did not know where she lived—Miss Davies, I think, then asked me in the prisoner's presence what the amount was—I said 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it is in one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and ten sovereigns—I believed what the prisoner said at that time, and thought somebody else must have taken it—I said "This woman must be found; if you have not seen it, she must"—I went the same night with a paper offering 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward for it—I think I saw both the prisoner and her daughter—I gave the paper to Miss Davies—I then got bills printed offering 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward—this is one of them—I took that on the Wednesday—I showed it to Miss Davies in the prisoner's presence, and she said she would put it in the window—I gave one at most houses in the neighbourhood—I went to make inquiry every day—I inquired about the woman that had come for the milk, and I think the prisoner told me she had seen the woman, and she had not seen any money—I afterwards communicated with Sergeant Brannan, and in consequence of information, accompanied him to the prisoner's house on the Thursday night—Brannan and Tate went into the shop first—the witness Wells was called in next, and then I was called in—the prisoner denied having seen the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I was groom to Mr. Hurrell; I am now a coachman, living at Bayswater. On Monday, the 5th of May, I drove Mr. Hurrell from Dalston to the corner of Chapel-street—I dropped him there close to the prisoner's shop—we went along Old-street—I looked at St. Luke's clock—it was then from ten minutes to a quarter past eleven o'clock—I should say I was as nearly as could be a quarter of an hour going from there to Chapel-street—it would be about half-past eleven when we got there—Mr. Hurrell went into the shop, and came out again in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I drove him from there to Caroline-mews, at the corner of Charlotte-street, Bedford-square; then to Fleet-street, and then to the London Joint Stock Bank, in Princes-street—after leaving the bank I cast my eye up at the clock in the Poultry, and it was just then turned half-past twelve—Mr. Hurrell did not remain in the Bank, I should say, a minute—I drove him back to Chapel-street—I was not more than ten minutes going, I should say—I drove pretty fast—we were there before one o'clock—I drove up opposite the door, and went on to the threshold of the door—I heard my master ask Mrs. Davies if she had seen anything of the money, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he had left on the counter—she said no, she had not—he asked who had been in the shop since he had left—she said there had been a woman in for some cream, who lived some-where in the neighbourhood of Guiidford-street, she did not know where, she would inquire, and there had been two boys for a halfpenny-worth of milk each before that woman came in—I then left the door—she said no<lb></lb>thing in my hearing about a person coming in with eggs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Messrs.

               <p>right—she did not count it—she then purchased some eggs of me—I left some in a basket on the counter, and took some behind the counter, where I always did—I then wished her again to count the money, before I went away—she did not do so, she said she dare say it was all right—I saw I her again on the Wednesday following, two days afterwards—I then asked her if the money was correct—she said, "Yes, it was quite right"—I saw her no more until the officers took me to the shop, on Thursday night, at half-past ten o'clock—Brannan took me in, and said, "Mrs. Davies, this is the witness who says he picked up the money off your counter, and gave it to you"—she said, "Oh dear! yes, but that was my own"—she saw me then, and I said, "You must recollect my picking the money up of your counter, and giving it to you"—she made no further remark—the officers then proceeded to search—I mentioned to our collector on the same Monday night that I picked the money up.</p>

Le Mere's employ—I have never been charged with any offence—I was never charged by my master with embezzling money that had been paid to me—I am not now paying money to my master by instal<lb></lb>ments for what I have embezzled—it is through bad debts, which I had no business to trust—before I went to Messrs. Le Miere's I lived in Blooms<lb></lb>bury-market, with Mr. and Mrs. Pollett—I left them on account of their retiring from business, and went to Messrs. Le Miere's in the following week—I recollect selling some eggs to a Mr. Pursod—he paid me for them, and I immediately took the money to my master—my master did not charge me with not having paid it—the clerk did at first, but it was afterwards proved to be paid—I was in the employ of a Mr. Knight for six weeks—he took Mrs. Pollett's business—I left him because I could not make myself comfortable—no charge was brought against me by him—I gave him warning—there were no words between us—he wished me to do more than I had done, I told him the situation did not suit me, and left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dress-maker, and live at No. 10, Portugal-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. On the 5th of May I was sitting in Mrs. Davies's parlour, and recollect a woman coming in for change for a sovereign, and one shilling's worth of halfpence—Mrs. Davies gave it to</p>

               <p>her—her daughter came from the parlour, and the eggman opened the shop door and said, "Do you want anything to-day, Mrs. Davies?"—before she could answer I heard a fall of money—I looked through the window, which is about a yard from the counter, and saw him place some paper on the counter—he said to Mrs. Davies, "What a foolish woman you are to leave your money like this"—she said, "Good God, I am, I left it since I changed a sovereign for the cook"—she took up the paper and held it in her hand—he stooped and picked up some of the sovereigns, from five to six, as near as I could tell, and then Mrs. Davies said, "You go and get me half a hundred of eggs; I will attend to this"—when he was gone for the eggs, Mrs. Davies said, "<hi rend="italic">Betsey</hi>, give me a light"—<hi rend="italic">Betsey</hi> took her a light—I followed into the shop, and saw one sovereign lay—I picked it up and gave it to Mrs. Davies—she counted them, counted thirteen sovereigns and a half, put them into a paper, and put it into a puree in her pocket—nothing more passed about that—about a quarter of an hour after that, as near as I can tell, I saw a gentleman come in to pay some rent—he paid it to Miss Davies in two half-sovereigns—I saw it in her hand when she came into the parlour—I saw the paper on the counter—I did not see the money in it—it was light brown paper, exactly like this—I am certain the eggman came before the prosecutor—I cannot say how long before—I did not notice the time—I did not see anybody come in after the prosecutor had left—I was not there after.</p>

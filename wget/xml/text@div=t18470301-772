                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Beaufoy, of Stanhope-street, Hampstead-road. The prisoner was our servant—on a Wednesday in Feb. I missed some knives, forks, plates, cups and saucers—I had not missed anything else then—I spoke to the prisoner about the knives, and forks, and cups, and in consequence of this examined the dust-hole—on the following Friday evening I called in a policeman—when he came I saw a handkerchief in the prisoner's hand—I said, "Sarah, let me look at that handkerchief," which she did—it was mine—she said it was one I had given her to wash in the week, but it was not—I had given her three, which she had returned—I gave her in charge—she had a box in the kitchen—it was searched in her presence—it was not locked—the policeman took out two baby's caps, a toy watch, and a reticule, which were my property—the prisoner said she had found the reticule on the floor in the bed-room—the last time I saw it was in a box in my own room—she said the caps were with some rags which I had given her—I had given her some pieces of net and muslin, but the caps were not with them—I missed a blanket from the prisoner's bed—I know the articles produced—I have another blanket like this, there is no mark or work on it, but it has all the appearance of mine—I am quite sure one was gone, but cannot tell how long it has been gone—the prisoner had lived with me four weeks—I do not know whether it was gone before she came to me—I had not looked at her bed.</p>

On Friday evening, about half-past nine o'clock, I was called to Mr. Beaufoy's, and found the prisoner in the kitchen, with her bonnet on—I saw her give this handkerchief to Mr. Beaufoy—I said something to the prisoner about searching her box—she made no objection, and said what was in the box was her own property—I searched the box, and found two caps and a toy watch—she took a reticule out of her pocket, which she said she had picked up in the second floor front bed-room—I took her to the station—she was searched by the female searcher, and four duplicates found, one of which related to the blanket, and one to a ring and seal.</p>

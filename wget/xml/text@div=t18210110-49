            . On the 24th of November, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was at Paddington, and sold the prisoner and another man a horse for 30 s., when they came to pay they were short 6 d. I said,</p>
               <p>"You cannot go home without money, keep half a crown, and owe me 3 s." On the 9th of December, the prisoner saw me at <placeName id="t18210110-49-crimeloc286">Paddington</placeName>

               <p>"Loosely, that was a capital horse you sold us, we made 5 l. of it." I knew he followed horse-dealing, I said,</p>
               <p>"Then you can afford to pay me the 3 s." he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, if you will change a 1 l. note." I had only 15 s., and borrowed 2 s. to give him change; I said,</p>
               <p>"You are joking with me." He pulled out a 10 l. note and one 1 l. note; I saw him putting the notes into his fob. He said,</p>

               <p>"Count it over into my hand." I counted it over in my own hand - it was 17 s. I closed my hand, and held out my other for the 1 l. note; he immediately tore the silver from my hand forcibly.</p>
               <p>Q. You remained quiet - A. Yes, he hit me over the shoulders. I could not find an officer; I went home, got a warrant, and had him apprehended two or three days after; he was taken before the Magistrate, who said he could not settle it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. What did the prisoner say - A. He said I owed him 23 s.; he robbed me opposite the public-house, and had a dung-fork over his shoulder. I was afraid to touch him or call out; several persons were passing, but I gave no alarm.</p>

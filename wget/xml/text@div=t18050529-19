               <p>Q. Do you let lodgings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming to you on the 13th of April last? - A. I do; she came for a furnished apartment; she asked what apartments I had to let; she looked over every room in my house; she fixed upon the front parlour, and the bed-chamber over it; she was to pay me twenty shillings per week for these rooms; she told me that she came from Sunderland, and that she and her husband were going to settle in the West-Indies, and she would take these rooms for three months certain; I asked her to give me a reference for their character; she told me she was a stranger in London, and could give no reference, and that she would go back to her husband, who was on board a ship, and probably he had some acquaintance in London. She gave me three shillings, and desired that I would order in some coals for her use; she took my address, and went away; she came back in the course of two hours, and then told me she could give me a very respectable reference to a Mr. Pilkington, in Cornhill; she told me her name was Wilson, and Mr. Pilkington would give me any satisfaction that I would require; she asked me if she might go into the bed-room, and refresh herself; I went with her, and put up my bed-furniture while she was in the room; I left her in the chamber; she then came out of the room, and said, might she lay herself down for an hour, for she was very much fatigued; I made no answer; she went in immediately, and shut the bed-room door; I left a friend of mine in the charge of the house sitting in the parlour; I went to Cornhill to look for Mr. Pilkington.</p>

               <p>Q. How far might that be from your house? - A. About a mile and a half; I could not find any person of that name in Cornhill; I returned, and I asked for her, and my friend that I left in the house told me that she went out, and said that she would return in an hour; I then went into the bed-chamber, in which I left her, and found that the bed was completely stripped of all the furniture; the whole of the curtains and trimmings, and the sheets, were gone. Upon this I went to a friend, and they advised me to give information at Bow-street Office; I saw no more of her till I saw her at the Public-office, in Bow-street, which was about eight days afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no part of your property there then? - A. Not then.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any part of your property?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290014"></xptr>- A. I had a letter from an officer in Bow-street, informing me where some of my property was pledged; I went to Bow-street, and the officer came with me to the Minories, to a pawnbroker's there, where my property was found; this was about three weeks afterwards; I saw my bed-furniture there; another pawnbroker had the sheets.</p>
               <p>Q.Are both these pawnbrokers here? A. One is here that had the sheets.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the bed-furniture and trimmings to be your own? - A. Yes, I did.</p>

             sworn. - In consequence of information from our Office, Mr. Collins, I think, on the 18th of April, sent to me, and said that there was a woman in his shop answered to the description of what we wanted; I went up to his house, and he asked me if I thought I should know the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the woman? - A. No; I had taken the description of her down so many times, I was sure I should know her; I went to the shop, and went into one of the private boxes; I there saw the prisoner at the bar; I said to her, how do you do, Mrs. Wilson; she said her name was not Wilson, I must be mistaken; I said I was quite sure that she was the person that had been so frequently described to me; I said, let me look at your hand, and by her nails and every other description I was positive; she denied it. I said, I must search you, I am sure you are the woman; I searched her, and found only one duplicate, as I can recollect, upon her; the duplicate was to Collins's, the same shop, for a gown or petticoat; I gave it back to her; I asked her before I went to the Office where she lived; she said she did not live any where, she had no lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know where any part of the things were pledged? - A. Mr. Collins intimated the circumstance to me, and said that there was a man, who was a carpenter, who had been at work in his shop, which induced me to think it was the husband of the prisoner; it appeared that he had been afraid to come out, and said that his wife was lost; I went to the house, and there I saw Mr. Cureton. After being committed several times for re-examination, she told me the bed-furniture was pledged at Matthews's, in the Minories, and Mr. Collins likewise told me of a Jew, who had bought some duplicates, and had fetched some things out; I went to Solomons, the Jew; he said he had six or seven duplicates, which he gave me to look at; one of the duplicates were for the sheets, I took the direction of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Solomons would not part with the duplicate? - A. No; the sheets were pawned for fifteen shillings; I left them a summons to produce them the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the place where these duplicates pointed out? - A. Yes, to Mr. Collins's.</p>

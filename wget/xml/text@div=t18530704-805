                  </hi>. I am one of the partners in the prosecutors' firm; we are brewers at Ratcliffe. In Sept. last the prisoner came to the brewery, and said his name was Thomas Chambers, and he wanted to borrow some money; that he would deposit the assignment of the lease of a house to him in our hands, that it was a chandler's shop or corn dealer's in Felix-terrace, Liverpool-road, and he wanted money for the purpose of converting it into a beer shop—he was not selling beer at that time, I presume—having looked at the premises a day or two afterwards, I agreed to advance the money on that security—there was an agreement that he was to be supplied with his beer from our brewery—in about a week or ten days he came again, and brought the various assignments up to the tenant previous to him, and alleged as the reason for not producing the assignment to him that it was in the hands of his solicitor, to whom be owed money, and he could not bring it—he wanted a check for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give his solicitor, and so bring the assignment—I gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in a few days after he came again, and brought this deed (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then gave him these two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. checks (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for the rest of the money—he signed his name on the back of them, at my request—we supplied him with beer on several occasions to the amount of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the deed was to he security for the money and the beer—if I had known his name was Plum I certainly should not have advanced him the money, as beer had been supplied by the firm in 1849 to Plum, and brought away again in consequence of it not being paid for, and because we heard the character of the man—I did not know him personally</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185307040058"></xptr>
               <p>before that—before I trusted him I communicated with Mr. Larchin, a member of our firm—on 17th Dec. I gave the prisoner into custody on a charge of forging the deed—he said he had altered it from the name of Plum to Chambers, for his name was Chambers equally so with Plum—I asked him why he had done that—he said it was not my business, or he did not choose to tell me, or some answer of that sort, I cannot tell exactly—before that time I had received some information about him, and the house he was then in—I had that information at the time he was given into custody—I told him that his name was Plum, and that he was the same man that had been at the brewery in the Kingsland-road, and that we heard he was about disposing of his business—he said yes, it was quite true, he intended to dispose of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was the prisoner first given into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say the exact date; it was in Dec.—he was taken before Mr. Ingham, and was then brought before Mr. Yardley, and discharged—I attended by solicitors, Messrs. Goddard and Eyre—I had the prisoner taken into custody again a short time ago—he was taken before Mr. Norton—he did not discharge him, I believe—I was not present—he was merely taken before Mr. Norton to be identified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the reason that, after preferring a charge as far back as Dec, and taking him before a Magistrate, that you indict him without going before a Magistrate now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We were induced by our solicitors to believe that the Magistrate's decision was incorrect—they directed us to come before the Grand Jury, and get a bill without going before a Magistrate—it would have been difficult to give him notice, for he could not be found—we learned that his name was Plum a few days before he was given into custody—we did not learn it three or four months before—I did not know his name was Plum before I made him an advance, and I believe my partner did not—he is here—I saw the person who professes to be the prisoner's landlord—I believe his name is Davis—I do not know whether he is here—I went to make inquiries of Davis before I made the advance to the prisoner—I told Davis that a person of the name of Chambers had a house of his, and wanted to borrow money, and after that I advanced him money—after I knew this to be a forgery, I asked him for an assignment of the lease—that was before I had seen my solicitor—I do not say that we should not have prosecuted him if we could have got the assignment—it is impossible to say what we should have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say you would have got this assignment from him and prosecuted him also? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think if he had fulfilled the terms of his agreement with us, that is, to assign the lease to us in default of paying the money advanced to him and for the beer, there would have been no prosecution—he had agreed to assign the lease to us, and before giving him in charge we asked him to assign the lease, and he refused—we would not have settled it if we could.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and estate agent, living in Islington. In Jan., 1852, I knew the prisoner by the name of Plum; I got this deed prepared, and attested the execution of it—at that time the name of Plum was throughout the deed—the receipt has been altered in the same way as the body of the deed—all are altered from Plum to Chambers—</p>

               <p>it was prepared by Plum's direction, and the Plum mentioned here is the prisoner—I delivered the deed unaltered to the prisoner on the morning of its execution.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drayman, in the service of the prosecutors; I have been in their service six or seven years. In May, 1849, by the directions of Mr. Larchin, I took two loads of beer to a beer shop in Back-lane, Kingsland, kept in the name of Plum—I do not know exactly the amount of the beer I took, but suppose it was somewhere about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—I unloaded it from my drays in front of the house, the prisoner was there doing something to his cellar; he said he would not have it in just then—we went in, he signed the loading ticket, and I went away to a short distance to a lady's house, that I serve with beer regularly—I made inquiry there, and made a communication to Messrs. Larchin, in consequence of which I went to try to get the beer away, and succeeded—I saw Plum there, he saw it taken away, and sent for the police to give us into custody, but they refused to do anything of the kind.</p>

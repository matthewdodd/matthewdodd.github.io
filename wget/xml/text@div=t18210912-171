On the 8th of August, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I and my family were all in bed. I was awoke by a loud knocking at the street door, saying, "Norman, get up, there are thieves in your wood yard". I immediately came down, went to the private door to open it, seeing the chain down, I could not open it, which I thought strange, as the bolts were undone - one of the witnesses was holding it to prevent their escaping - I then ran into the shop, opened the shop door, and found my neighbours in front - I instantly ran down the wood yard, and after looking about some time, saw Washer on the top of the adjoining house; I kept my eye on him - they got a neighbour's ladder, put it against the wall, and I saw the witness collar one of them; I went and slipped on my things, went round to the street, and helped to take them to the watch-house - both prisoners were found on the top of the house. I lost a table-spoon and two tea-spoons, four crown pieces, and some halfpence; I had left them in the back parlour cupboard.</p>

            . On the 8th of August, early in the morning, I heard a noise in the street, got up, ran to the the window, and saw Norman in his shirt, in the street; I ran down stairs, and understood that thieves were backward - I kept outside the door, and presently saw a person's hat on the top of the house, above the coping; I watched till somebody brought a ladder - I then got on the top of the house, and found both the prisoners lying in the gutter; I collared Washer, and said, "Come, get up," and in rising, some silver spoons dropped from under his smock frock, and a brown paper with some copper in it. I handed him down the ladder to the watchman, then went back, Flanery still laid in the gutter; I handed him down the ladder to the watchman, we all went to the watch-house, and there two crown pieces were found in one of their bats.</p>

            . I got up about five o'clock in the morning, and went into the Commercial-road; as I returned, I saw Flanery in the passage of Norman's house, and Washer leaning with his back against the gate outside - as I passed by, they came out of the passage and went towards the Commercial-road - by that time, I had got home, which is thirty yards off. I opened my window, looked out, and saw them both return to the same spot; it struck me all was not right, I went up by Norman's house, and met a man at the top of the road, and told him I thought all was not right; I went up to Norman's door, gave a good knock, and directly heard something inside - I looked over the yard door, and Flanery was on the planks in the yard coming towards me, he made his way back again, and they got on the adjoining house - I saw them in the gutter.</p>

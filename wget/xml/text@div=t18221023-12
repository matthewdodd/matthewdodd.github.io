On my turning round, the prisoner walked out from behind me; there were several others near me; I followed and stopped him in King-street - he had crossed over. My suspicion was increased by his walking fast. I took him, and found my handkerchief in his pocket; he had another blue one, which he said was his own, and that he found mine. Smith took him in custody.</p>

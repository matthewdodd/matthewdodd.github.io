                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Selle, of Permont Villa, Woodford—on 25th August, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I saw Winson near the house, and the other two prisoners going from the house—the groom then came in, and those two fellows moved off a little—I heard no noise—Winson had a basket in his hand, which attracted my attention, and hearing a leap from the window, induced me to look, and I saw him moving down the garden with a basket on his arm, placing a paper over it—I instantly ran into the dining-room, and missed the cruet-stand, which was there a very short time before—the window was wide open, and a person could get in and out—I called to the servants, and ran out with my daughter, and saw her find the cruet-stand in a basket of shrimps—this is it—it is worth 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

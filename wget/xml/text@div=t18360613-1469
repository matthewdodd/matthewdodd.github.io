                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph John Sanways Currey, of Upper Chapman-street. On the 21st of April, the prisoner came to me for employment in the shirt-making—I gave her work—she stated her name to be Betsey Harris—I gave the girl that was living with me some cotton cloth for two shirts, to go with the prisoner to ascertain whether the address was correct—she took them from the girl's hand, in my presence, and said she would carry it for her, as she had the child to carry—I never saw her again—I met her on the 22nd of May, and asked her about the property—she said she never saw me before—the cloth has not been found—I am sure she is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Sarah Currey—I am nine years of age. She sent me with the prisoner, who gave her name, as Marry Harris—I was to go to No. 26, Denmark-street—the prisoner took the cloth, and told me to wait till she came back—she said she was going to her aunt's—I went after her, but could not see her—she ran faster than I could, because I had the child—I went to this place in Denmark-street—there was no such name and no such number as she gave me—I am sure she is the person.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 73.) I took charge of the prisoner—I asked her if she knew any thing of two cotton shirts—she said "No," and that she never saw the prosecutrix before in her life—I took her to the station-house—she was locked up with several other girls—I then told Mrs. Currey to fetch Cable—the prisoner was brought up with several other girls, and Cable walked over and picked out the prisoner directly.</p>

I then unbuttoned his close coat, put my hand behind his back, and pulled my coat out.(The coat produced.) I took him into the room to the others; they were all Irish, and began to talk in the Irish language, which I said was not behaving like gentlemen; he struggled very much to get away, till I called assistance.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifford. Q. Did you serve them with any thing? - A. Half a pint of gin; there were no other people in the room but them; I know one of them to be a master tailor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not some dispute about a five-pound note? - A. He sent his friend to get change while he stole the coat, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he got his change back when he took the coat? - A. He had the change, but he said he had not the four one-pound notes; he found a half-guinea, silver, and halfpence, and then he said he had given the notes to his friend; I gave the change to his friend, and did not know it was the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>MARTIN BREUNAGIS sworn. - I lodge with Mr. Trott: On the 15th of November, I saw the prisoner come to the house with some others; I met the prisoner in the passage; he said, holloa! to me, as he passed me; I saw the steeve of a coat hang down behind; I went to Mr. Trott, and asked him if he had lost a coat; when he looked, he said he had, and went backwards to see where the man was; he met him, and took the coat from him; the prisoner said, he thought it was like a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020017"></xptr>coat he lost some time before, and he took it to look at it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Is it likely I would go away with that or any other coat not worth over three shillings, and leave my 5l. note in his hands; I had lost a coat some time before that, and I took that coat to look at; he met me, and asked me whether it was not his coat; I said, I had taken it to look at, but it was not mine.</p>

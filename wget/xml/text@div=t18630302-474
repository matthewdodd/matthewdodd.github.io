                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at 10, George-street, Hanover-square—my mother, Mrs. Taylor, resides at present in Colchester—on 5th January, I wrote this letter (produced) to her, addressed, "Mrs. Taylor, Beverley-terrace, Colchester," and inclosed in it these three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes (produced)—I took the numbers of them before inclosing them; they are 50, 835, 50, 836, and 50, 837, and the initial letters are S.G.—I put them in the letter myself, put a very small quantity of gum on the top flap of the envelope, fastened it in the usual way, and sub<lb></lb>sequently sealed it—I took it myself to the Post-office, 99, Oxford-street; took the letter into the shop, and registered it, at about a quarter-past 1 o'clock—I received this receipt (produced) from the clerk in the office—on the following day I received information that the notes had not arrived—the letter has since been shown to me, and there was a spot of gum on the lower part of the flap, and a corresponding spot on the letter, for which I cannot account—the seal has not been broken—I did not put any gum where that spot was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Stevenson, bookseller, at 99, Oxford-street—he keeps a post-office receiving-house there—I assist in the post-office—the prisoner was also in his employ in January last—I remember Mr. Taylor bringing me this letter to be registered on 5th January—I wrote the word "registered" on the front of it—I did not notice whether the letter was then sealed or the flaps firm—the letter is endorsed with the name of the office—I do that—if the flaps had been open I must have seen it—after a letter is registered I tie a piece of green tape round it—this was about a quarter-past 1 o'clock—I generally go up-stairs to dinner about half-past 1—I do not recollect whether I did so on this day—when I go to dinner I generally leave Mr. Stevenson in the shop—the prisoner did not generally have dinner at the same time as I; sometimes</p>

               <p>before and sometimes after me—one of us is usually left in the shop while the other is at dinner—after writing "registered" on the letter, I put it in the till-drawer, where I put registered letters—it remained there till 2 o'clock, at which time I sent the letters from our office to the Western office—I made up the bag and a bill of the registered letters that are dis<lb></lb>patched—this one, with "Mrs. Taylor, Beverley-terrace, Colchester," on it, was made up by me, and dispatched about 3 o'clock to the Western office—I tend a list of all registered letters—I tied up the letter with green tape, longways and across—I should have done that before I went to dinner—I had not bad my dinner when the letter was brought to be registered—I tied it up before I went to dinner—I never left them untied before going to dinner—the tape is easily slipped off by doubling the letter; it is not fastened to the letter—we keep a quantity of that green tape in the shop, and alto a bottle of gum,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where is the gum kept? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Generally in a cup<lb></lb>board behind the counter—I should not think that a person going to that cupboard must be observed by any one else in the shop—I cannot remember whether the prisoner went to dinner before or after me—he would go out at the shop door when he went to dinner—I do not recollect his ever going to dinner at the same time as myself and leaving Mr. Stevenson in the shop—I do not remember whether I left Mr. Stevenson behind the counter when I went to dinner that day; I believe he was there—it is usual for him to be there at the time I go to dinner—he carries on the business of a stationer and bookseller—what with that and the post-office business there it pretty full employment for the persons behind the counter—Mr. Stevenson occa<lb></lb>sionally goes into the little compartment where the registered letters are—with close observation he has, while serving behind the counter, the oppor<lb></lb>tunity of seeing what I am doing at the registered letter drawer—there is glass round the compartment—another registered letter went by that same post; I am not sure whether I received that one—the prisoner has been about twelve months in that employment with me—I know he was engaged in similar employment before that—I am generally absent about half an hour at dinner.</p>

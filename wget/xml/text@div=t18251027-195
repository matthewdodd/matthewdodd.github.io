On Friday, the 30th of September, between one and two o'clock in the day, I and other persons were at home - I had occasion to go to my own room, and passed Morey's room - I saw the door a little ajar - I staid about a minute; and then pushed it open, and saw the prisoner in the act of tying up a bundle on the bed; I said, "Pray who do you want here?" she said, "Mr. Jones;" I said, "I have no Mr. Jones lives in my house, but I see you are come to rob." The articles had been placed on the table about eleven o'clock in the morning; I staid in the room and sent for an officer; he took charge of her and took the bundle - Mr. Morey was then in the kitchen with my family - I cannot say whether the door had been fastened or not, but the key was down stairs - these breeches are my husband's, they had been in a drawer in Morey's room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are there not a great many lodgers in your house? A. Yes, I did not know the prisoner before - there had not been a woman named Jones living in the house - we have kept the house two years, and the house adjoining eight years.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for and found Montefield in the room up stairs with the prisoner - I put several questions to the prisoner, she made no answer - I have the breeches and the handkerchief; Mrs. Morey had occasion for some of the articles, which the Magistrate directed her to have.</p>
               <p>(Handkerchief and breeches sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MARY MOREY. I occupy the back-room first floor, in Mr. Montefield's house. On the 30th of September, Mr. Montefield called me up stairs - I found the prisoner there, and some articles of mine on the bed, which I had left on the table - they were all new and worth more than 30 s. - I had seen them safe between ten and eleven o'clock that morning, and it was between one and two when I saw the prisoner there, I had locked the door and put the key in the kitchen - none of the lodgers knew where it was kept - I can positively state that I locked the door when I went down, and I afterwards found the key in the kitchen where I had hung it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there many ladies in that house? A. None but myself and an old lady - I do not know how many lodgers there are in the house - my name is Mary Ann Morey.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at St. George's-terrace, Paxton-park, Sydenham, and am a plate-layer on the permanent way—on 12th July I was going towards London-bridge Railway-station, and as I was passing near where St. Thomas's Hospital used to be I met two women—the female prisoner is one of them—one of them, I believe this one, asked me to treat them to two bottles of ginger-beer—I pulled out some coppers to pay for three bottles, and a sixpence fell out on the ground—this woman poured some dust over it—I went to take it up, and she took the dust and sixpence up together—I asked for the money several times, and then the male prisoner came up and pushed me down, and kicked me on the head and face when I was down—I have a mark there now—I had my watch before I was thrown down—I was rendered insensible, and taken to Guy's Hospital, where my wounds were dressed—my head bled very much in several places—when I came to, I missed my watch—I am quite sure it was the male prisoner who knocked me down.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Fair-street—on 12th July I saw the prisoners and the prosecutor at the corner of Thomas-street—they were kicking him in an unmerciful manner—I went up, and said what a shame it was, and the female prisoner hit me with something in the forehead—it felt like a door-key, and the male prisoner hit me also; a mob collected, and I went to look for a policeman—I was covered with blood—here is the scar now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 163). From information I received I took the prisoners into custody—I told the male prisoner I should take him in charge for knocking a man down in Thomas-street, and robbing him of his watch—he said, "It is rather a serious charge, is it not?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Well, this is what I have got for looking on; I merely pushed him."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you take him, and where? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The same morning about half-past 5, in George-street, Kent-street, and his wife too—I saw All<lb></lb>butt's face bleeding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">David Gardiner's Defence.</hi> I walked with my wife from Kingsland<lb></lb>gate to Thomas-street, and there we stopped to rest, as my wife was exhausted—I saw the prosecutor with a female go to the ginger-beer stall, and he hit her in the face with a glass—she ran to where we were, and I put out my hand to prevent his hitting her again. I then left my wife at the corner, and saw the prosecutor lying down; he had been kicked. I turned back, and my wife was gone. I walked down the Borough, and met a policeman, and then saw my wife leaning against a wall. I asked her was the matter, and she said some one wanted to give her in charge for striking a man with a knife. I said, "Stuff, come home." We went home, and about half-past 5 in the morning a policeman came to our house, and told us the charge. I said it was a serious charge, but we knew nothing about it. We were taken to the station, and the prosecutor came in. The inspector asked him if he knew us. He said he did not know me, but he thought that was the woman, but if it was her she had a light dress on and a black shawl. The inspector asked the ginger-beer man what he knew about it. He said he saw me and my wife standing together, and he saw me put up my hand, but whether I hit the prosecutor or shoved him he could not say, and the inspector said on that evidence it was useless for him to book the charge. A sergeant then came in, and said, "If you don't intend to press the charge, I shall on my own account," and we were locked up; we were remanded for a week, and then committed to Croydon Assizes for high<lb></lb>way robbery with violence; we were there honourably acquitted, and then committed here for a common assault.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I did not make any charge against the prisoners at the station—I took them into custody on suspicion, and then the prosecutor identified them—it is quite false that the inspector refused to take the charge—no sergeant came up, and said he would press the charge himself—I gave evidence at the trial at Croydon for robbery with violence—they were acquitted on that charge, and the judge ordered them to be com<lb></lb>mitted immediately for the assault.</p>

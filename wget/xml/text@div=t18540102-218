On 7th Dec, about 6 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and asked the price of savoys—she bought one, at three halfpence, and gave me half a crown in payment—it was good, and I put it into the till, and gave her a florin, and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—she said she did not like the florin, and I gave her two shillings of King George's reign, which have not the words "one shilling" on them—I tried them with my teeth, to show her that they were good, and put a magnet to them—I said, "You see they are good"—she kept rubbing one of them about, then took it up, and I saw her put another down, saying, "I don't like that"—I snatched them both up, saying, "Neither do I," and asked her to give me my good shilling back, and I would give her her half crown, to take herself off—she appeared tipsy when she came in, and when she said that she appeared more so—she said, "I do not know what you mean"—I gave her into custody with the bad shilling—I am quite certain this is not one of the shillings I gave her.</p>

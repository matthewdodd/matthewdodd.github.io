               <p>Gerrard Russel. Between 10 and 12 at Night, on Christmas-Eve, I had Occasion to go to - do - my Occasions. I had a pair of Breeches under my Arm besides those on my - those that I wore. And as I was couching down (in Hanging-Sword-Alley in Fleet-street) the Prisoner came up to me, and very immodestly put her Hand betwixt my Legs. The first thing that she laid hold on was my - my Watch-String, and she held it so fast, and Jugg'd it so hard, that tho' I catch'd hold of it myself to save it, I thought in my Conscience she would have pull'd it off - and so indeed she did at last [for what could a Man do with such a Woman when his Breeches were down? She got my Watch out, but the Hook of it hitch'd in my Fob. Damn you, says she, I never had such a Tustle for a Watch in my Life; and with that she gave me a punch, and push'd me clever backwards, and then the Swivel broke , and away she run a-cross the Way. I got up, but had not Presence of Mind to cry Stop Thief; and so she made off with my Watch, and I afterward , found the String in the Alley. She was three Minutes a struggling with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How many Women did you charge with this Robbery before you charged me?</p>

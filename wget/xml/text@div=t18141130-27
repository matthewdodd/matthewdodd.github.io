On the 9th of of November, the two prisoners came into my shop, they asked for some cotton handkerchiefs; I was not attending; the young man, he is not here, was attending to them; they said, they wanted some cotton handkerchiefs; I heard them ask and saw them shewn to them; some customers came in the shop before they went away. I saw him shew them several; there was nothing suited them. As soon as I had done attending to my customers, I heard one of them say, there was nothing would suit them; then they went away; I walked up towards the window; I saw the worked shawls were put out of their place After they were gone I missed a shawl, I ran out and pursued them; I overtook them about five or six doors down Milford-lane; they were in a yard that leads up to a house door; they were both together there. I asked them if had been in my shop; I named the shop to them; I laid hold of

I stooped down, and perceived a shawl under her; I perceived something move as she was standing upon the ground; I took up the shawl from underneath her gown, and took it into my shop; my shop is only two doors from Milford-lane; I took them both there, and sent for a constable, they made no resistance at all; the shawl is here; there is my own writing upon the shawl, that I had put within ten days.

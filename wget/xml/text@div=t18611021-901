(<hi rend="italic">Policeman.</hi>) I am specially employed by the London and South Western Railway Company—on 23d September last the prisoner met me in Dorey-street, Lambeth—she came up to me and said, "Shepherd, I wish to speak to you"—I had known her for the last five years, and knew that she had been living with a man of the name of Barnes—I said, "What is it?"—she said, "I have been to your house, but you were not at home—do you know if there have been any robberies on Clapham-common"—I said, "Yes; I know there have been"—she said, "I can tell you who did them—you know Barney, that I have been living with?"—I said, "Yes; I know him very well"—she said, "Well, he is the man who has committed all the burglaries at Clapham-common"—I asked her when it was—she said, "In the first part of July last, <hi rend="italic">Barney</hi>, went to a gentleman's house on Clapham-common; he got in there and stole a lady's mantle, but he could not get any further than the hall, and that was all be took on that occasion"—I said, "Well, what was done with the mantle"—she said, "I wore it myself a few days—I altered it; I put fresh buttons and fresh lining to it—I wore it for a few days and then I pledged it"—I asked her "Where?—she said "At Burnett's in Savill-place, Lambeth-walk, for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by <hi rend="italic">Barney's</hi> instructions—<hi rend="italic">Barney</hi>, as outside waiting for me at the time"—I asked her when it was pledged, she said about 19th or 20th July, and that it was pledged in the name of Barnes for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said to her, "What is your motive for coming to make this statement to me"—she said, "You know that I have been living with him"—I said, "Yes"—she said, u Well, I intend to send him away, for he has been beating me about"—and she showed me some bruises on her arm—she then said, "I will tell you of another bnrglary, the night after which was a Friday night, 5th July, <hi rend="italic">Barney</hi>, and me went to</p>

               <p>Clapham-common, and there Barney got into a gentleman's house, he was gone two hours and a half; I waited outside near the furze—he got into a gentleman's house there, and took three coats and a great quantity of plate, forks, knives, and spoons, which he took home—we went home together, and Barney broke up the plate"—I said, "What did he do with it then?"—she said, "He sold it for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "What was done with the wearing apparel?"—she said, That was pledged—I will tell you where one cost was pledged, a very remarkable coat, you will be sure to know it if you see it, it has seven chamois leather pockets; it is a gentleman's drab coat; it was pledged for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the name of Bennett, at a pawnbroker's in the West<lb></lb>minster-road, opposite the Catholic cathedral"—she said it was pawned the very next day after it was stolen, on a Saturday—she said, "Barney was with me; he waited outside again—I pledged it by his instructions for 15<hi rend="italic">s"</hi>—she said the other two coats were pledged in Chelsea for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., she would tell me where some day; she would go with me—I let her go at large that evening, and made the necessary inquiries—I found the mantle pledged as she had said, at Barnett's, in Saville-place—on the followimg Tuesday, the 1st, the prisoner came to me again, outside the Tower-street station—she said, "Shepherd, I have been looking for you, I want to see you particularly; I know you are looking after Barnes; I am come to tell you that the state<lb></lb>ment I made to you the other day is not true—I was angry with him at the time for he had been beating me about and threatening my life, and I intended to have sent him away, but I have now forgiven him, therefore what I hare told you is not true"—I said, "Then if this is the way you are going to act, you must take the responsibility upon yourself"—she said, "I am quite willing to do that; I pledged the property and I will take it on my shoulders rather than he should suffer"—I then took her into custody—on the first interview, she said to me, "Do you know that there was a policeman's cape lost at Clapham-common"—I said, "I don't know that there was, but I shall make the inquiries"—she said, "The night that Barney took the mantle he also took a policeman's cape which he found and brought it away, and wore it home"—I said, "What was done with it then?"—she said, "Barney gave it to his father; he kept it for a few days and then burnt it, and nearly set the house on fire"—I have made inquiries and find that a cape was lost—I asked her where the burglary had taken place, and she said, "You can't make a mistake there is some furze close by"—I know the place; there is some furze close to Captain Meller's house, and also by Mr. Coomber's.</p>

               <p>Clapham-common, in the parish of Battersea—between the night of the 5th and the morning of the 6th July my master's house was broken into, and property taken away—I was aroused on the morning of the 6th by some one coming to the pantry door, where I was sleeping—it was tried twice—the latch was lifted—I could see a light through the bottom of the door—I heard footsteps go up the stairs—I afterwards went up stairs myself; I heard nobody, and then went to bed—in the morning I went into the scullery, and found the window open at the bottom, nearly as far as it would go up—that sash had been closed the night before—the top sash was open a very small distance—there are iron bars inside six inches apart—I do not think a man could get through that opening; a small person might; I could not—I am five feet eight and a-half inches in height—I found one of the drawing-room windows open; the shutters were opened from the inside, and a bell taken away—some ornaments were taken away from the drawing-room—I missed some silver plate from the dining-room, and four coats from the hall—the plate missed was worth about 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had seen it safe in the house when I went to bed about 11 o'clock—I noticed some footsteps out<lb></lb>side the drawing-room window—they were the footsteps of a man—I only saw the footsteps of one—this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) is Capt.

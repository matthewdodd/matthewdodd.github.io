               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, perfectly well; they came to take an apartment of me about Christmas last: on the 18th of February I took about twenty one-pound notes and put them in a drawer; I had indorsed the persons names that I had taken them of, I put them in a one pair back room where I sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you had deposited them in that drawer had you occasion to go to the drawer? - A. On the 24th of February they were all safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards miss any part of them? - A. Yes; the next morning, at nine o'clock, I found the drawer had been broke open, and I missed ten notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any of those Banknotes that had been taken from the drawer? - A. Yes; I found two in a tea-pot among some leaves in the room where the prisoners occupied, and two at Mr. Lane's the pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search in those two places in consequence of information you had received? - A. Yes, from the woman prisoner herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any other property you had lost at the same time that the notes were lost? - A. Yes, at the prisoner,

               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing else? - A. I did not miss them till I saw them, and knew them to be my own; the officer brought me a table-cloth, a pair of sheets, and a white apron,</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that time did you see them in your house? - A. I cannot exactly say, because they were in a drawer in my own bed room; I saw two of the notes which had been lost in the parlour, when I saw the linen.</p>

On the 1st of March I left town for the Northern circuit, and took Smith, my upper servant, with me, leaving the prisoner behind - there was no other man servant; Miss Rivers, my sister-in-law, who generally resides with me, remained in London during my absence, till about ten days before the circuit was over; she joined me at Wakefield, in Yorkshire, on the 31st of March, and to supply her place, Mrs. Alexander, another relative, came to town; I returned to town with Miss Rivers and Smith, on the 8th of April - I had left a dressing-case in my house; it originally stood on a chest of drawers in my bed-room - it was formerly my mother's, and came to my wife at her death; I had not opened it since the 10th of November last - it then contained the articles stated in the indictment, as usual; I saw it every day; the value of all the articles would be 45l. or 50l., besides which there was from 40l. to 50l. in money - one of the quarter-guineas was remarkable, it being bent; there were several foreign coins - one of the Emperor of Austria, and another small gold coin among others; here is a forty franc piece of the Emperor Francis, and a quarter-guinea of 
               <persName id="t18320517-112-person980">George</persName>
             the Third; it is crooked.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you certain that quarter-guinea was in the box when you left town? A. I saw it there on the 10th of November, because I went over the whole of the pieces in the box; I locked the box up - the upper part has a Bramah's lock; I then locked up the drawer underneath, and put the keys into this in key-box - there is a lower drawer in the dressing-box, intended for ladies' jewellery; that has a separate lock, with a double tumbler; the box was never used - this key-box was intended for a cash-box; I have for some years kept keys in it, and the key of that was always kept in my possession when in town, and was fastened to the key of my own dressing-case - I always had it about me; the keys of my wine-cellar, and a great many others, are kept in the tin box - on leaving town, I left the key of the key-box with Miss Rivers, to enable her to get wine in my absence; a few days after my return this forty franc and quarter-guinea were shown to me by Miss Rivers; I immediately knew them as part of the contents of the dressing-case, and immediately ordered it to be brought down into the library; I found both the upper and lower part locked - I got the key out of the key-box, opened the upper part, found the trays reversed, and the tooth instruments, which should be below, were above - on lifting up the tray, I saw all the boxes and silver tops were gone, also the gold; it was then late at night, and Smith was the only servant up; but the following morning I went to Bow-street, and on returning assembled my servants; I discovered marks on the outside of the box, as if attempts had been made by some instrument, to force it- here is the mark of a chisel and a very distinct mark further on; the edge of the drawer below is made almost ragged, where a chisel has run along; on opening it I found a piece of glass, broken off a bottle, as if an instrument had been put through and broken it - there were several pieces of loose glass; there are marks of some instrument having cut the velvet lining - I assembled the servants, pointed out to them that the dressing-case had been opened by its own key, for the lock had sustained no injury, that the key-box had been got at by a false key, and none but a domestic servant could have access to the box to make the marks, and not having succeeded it had been opened by a key; I said they need not feel alarmed, for if I could not find cause to suspect any one of them, I should not discharge them all, as was sometimes done; I should not discharge any of them - I had assembled the nurses, cook, and other servants, some of whom have lived with me fifteen years; I put the two pieces of coin into the prisoner's hand, and said, "Where did you find those?" he laid them down on a sheep skin mat at the entrance of the dinning-room, within the door-way - the wall is so thick that the door leaves a space, where the mat goes; he placed them in that space, as showing me where he had found them - it is a thick sheep skin mat, with the wool on it, and it is certain they could not have rolled there; one of them was crooked, and could not have rolled at all - I asked when he found them; he said, between twelve and one's o'clock on the Friday before I came to town (the 6th of April), and the moment he mentioned between twelve and one, a servant who was there said, "I told Joseph at the time that I had shaken the mat that morning, and they were not there then, and it was odd he should find them;" he made no observation at all - finding the gold had been discovered at that hour, I, or somebody, said, "Who had been there that morning?" and it was said by somebody, that the glaziers had been there - I stated to the prisoner the next day or the day after, that I was certain the key-box<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170072"></xptr>had been opened, and the keys taken out - he side he was not aware that I kept keys in that box at all; I took up the box, shook it, and said, "You could not be ignorant of that - it is quite manifest that keys were in it;" it was impossible he should not know it, for I am quite certain he must have seen me frequently send for this box, and particularly if any wine was wanted; he must repeatedly have seen me open the box, and give the key to my son or servant; and I think I must sometimes have sent him to fetch me the key-box to the door of the wine-cellar - the key of the key-box now turns as if something was the matter with one of the wards, and there is a scratching about the key-hole; it generally stood in the library, sometimes in the dining-room - I observed the difficulty in turning the key about Christmas, I think - the top lock of the dressing-case is a Bramah lock, and requires to be pushed in in a particular way before the key is turned -I asked the prisoner to open that dressing-case, in my presence, and he opened it with perfect case, as if acquainted with it - as freely as if I had done it myself; I received a statement from Nunn, who came with his master, and after that went to Bow-street, and had the prisoner appreheaded - I received a brown paper parcel from Ann Saunders, the servant, which I opened in the prisoner's presence, by his permission, and found in it some promissory notes or securities for money, a lease, and a small pocket-book; and he stated that he had obtained that lease by lending a person, named Saunders, 15l., in sovereigns or half-sovereigns, on Saturday, the 10th but that the money was advanced out of part of his wages, which I had paid him before I left town, to the amount of ten guineas - I find that on the 3rd of February I paid him ten guineas - I did not wish to take him up on that, thinking he might have that amount to advance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. I believe you received him from the service of Mr. Ferard, of Queen-square, Westminster? A. Yes; Smith acted as butler, and the prisoner attended when Smith was absent; he slept in the pantry - the small quantity of plate used during my absence, was under his care; my bed-room was not locked up - no external appearances on the box attracted my attention till after I had opened it; I was impatient to get it open, to ascertain what was gone - I am not aware that any masters attended my children during my absence but the French master - he is a gentleman of the highest respectability, who I have known for a number of years; the school-room is up two pairs of stairs - when I lived in Bedford-row Nunn's Master did some work for me, that was before Smith came into my employ; this is a lady's dressing-case, and was never used - Bramah's locks are now very common; the key-box has been brought to me over and over again to give the key of the wine-cellar; it was Smith's duty to attend me to the cellar, but I think Joseph has done so - I may have occasionally given Smith the key to open the key-box when in the library, while I sat in the dining-room, but more generally the box was brought to me; I found the key of the dressing-case in the key-box when I discovered the robbery.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your house is called Queen-square house? A. Some body has given it that name; Smith has been in the service of my family three or four years, and is still so; perhaps I ought to mention that I was at Blackheath at Christmas, and during that time the prisoner slept in the pantry - and during the conversation, when I asked what he knew of the dressing-case, he said he had carried it down into the pantry, and from the weight of it, and the care the housemaid took of it, he was aware it contained matters of value; that he took it down by desire of the housemaid, that it might be in the same custody as the plate-chest - at that time he had the sole and entire custody of this box for about a fortnight.</p>

            . I am sister-in-law to Mr. Pollock. When he left town I had the care of the family - he gave me the key of the key-box, and during his absence I went to it when wine was wanted, and if not, I usually gave the key to Mr. Pollock's son; I do not recollect that I ever gave it to the prisoner or to any of the servants - it was never my habit to do so; I went to meet Mr. Pollock before he returned, about the latter end of March; my sister, Mrs. Alexander, was then left in charge of the family - within a day or two after my return with Mr. Pollock, I was made acquanited with the discovery of two pieces of coin; I did not inform Mr. Pollock of it, as I took it for granted he had been informed - he came home from the House of Commons late one night, and I produced to him the coins, (a crooked quarter-guinea, and an Austrian coin,) which I received from Mrs. Alexander, with whom I had left the key of the key-box during my absence; when I left, I directed that the glaziers were not to come to clean the windows - I did not give these directions to the prisoner; the French master, and I think some other masters, which Mr. Pollock was not aware of, came to the hose during his absence - they were gentlemen, and attended in the school-room; that had nothing to do with Mr. Pollock's bed-room, which was on the first floor.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe the bed-room door was not generally open? A. It was not locked - the windows are occasionally cleaned four times a year, but that rule was broken on occasions; they were generally cleaned during the circuit - I can almost positively swear I never gave the key of the key-box to any of the servants -I would not have given it to a female servant, and I should rather have gone myself than have given it to the man servant.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the tin box familiarly known among the servants as the key-box? A. It was.</p>
               <p>MRS. DOROTRY ALEXANDER. I am Mr. Pollock's sister-in-law, and live at Binfield - I came to town the latter end of March, to take care of his hose, in the absence of Miss Rivers. On the 27th of March she gave me the key of the key-box; Mr. Pollock returned on the 8th of April: I never trusted the key of the key-box to any body but Mr. Pollock's son, except on one occasion, when I believe I sent the key by the prisoner to Mr. Pollock's son, but I will not be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know it was the key of the key-box? A. I think on one occasion he came to ask me for the key of the key-box, for Mr. Pollock's son to get some wine for dinner; it was always called the key-box in the house - the prisoner gave these two coins to me on the Friday before Mr. Pollock returned; he said they had been found on the mat at the entrance of the dining-room door; it is a rough sheep-skin mat with the wool on it - they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170073"></xptr>could not have dropped on any place and rolled on that mat, it was impossible; I do not exactly recollect who he said had found them - he said they had been found; I did not go to look at the place where he said they had been found; I kept them in my possession, and delivered them to Miss Rivers, with other things, on the Tuesday morning, when I left town - I had mentioned the circumstance to her on the Sunday, but said nothing to Mr. Pollock; I mentioned it to several persons, hoping to find an owner - I did not know they had been in Mr. Pollock's possession; when the prisoner brought them to me I said,"Let us try and remember who has been here, and is' likely to have dropped them;" he reminded me that Mr. Pollock's son had brought a young friend home to lunch with him - first one and then another named different persons who had been; nothing was said at that time about the glaziers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you ever seen the key given to Smith? A. I may, but then the key-box was always in the room - I think I have seen the key-box on the sideboard, and the key given to Smith, who opened it in Mr. Pollock's presence; and I have known Smith fetch the box from the library to Mr. Pollock.</p>
               <p>MR. ADLPHUS. Q. When you have seen the box opened, was the prisoner waiting at table, so that he could see what was in it? A. Most probably.</p>
               <p>THOMAZINA ROWE. I am in the service of Mr. Pollock, as kitchen-maid - Lovel is Mr. Pollock's glazier. On Thursday, the 5th of April. the prisoner came into the kitchen, and asked if any body was going out - I said I was; he said," Will you call at the glazir's, and ask him to come to-morrow to clean the windows;" I said I would - I went, and Milford came on Friday, the 6th, to clean the windows with

            . I am in Mr. Pollock's service. On Friday, the 6th of April, I was cleaning the dining-room wainscot - the prisoner was there, laying the things for the nursery dinner; when he first came into the room he brought me two pieces of coin in his hand, and told me he had picked them up - they were the colour of gold; I asked where he picked them up; he said he would show me - I went outside the dining-room door, and he laid them down on the mat - there was a distance between them; he took them up again and went down stairs -Mrs. Alexander was at this time in care of the house; the prisoner told me that evening that he had asked Mrs. Alexander if it was her coin, and then said he had asked Master Robert and George (master's two sons), and it did not belong to them - next morning he said he thought it was odd nobody owned them; I said, "Did you ask the glaziers?" he said No - I said, "You had better ask them, as they might have drawn them out of their pockets with their window-cloths; he said he would - I remember all the servants being questioned afterwards in master's presence; I said I had taken the mat up on the Friday morning on which Joseph showed me the coin - I had taken it up at seven o'clock that morning - I turned it to sweep there; I did not particularly shake it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by turning? A. I took it up, and moved it a good distance from its place; I am not positive whether it was on Thursday or Friday that I did it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you remember the prisoner depositing any thing with you? A. On the Sunday morning before my master came home he asked if I would take care of a small parcel for him, which he gave me - he had boxes and drawers of his own.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. He made not secret of it? A. No - he said the servants' hall was public, and that at times he was called away in a hurry, and left his drawers unlocked.</p>

            , a glazier, of Red Lion-street, Holborn. On Friday, the 6th of April, I and Milford went to clean Mr. Pollock's windows; I saw the prisoner and Ann Brooker there - Brooker said Miss Rivers had given orders that the windows were not to be cleaned; the prisoner said, as we were come we should clean the principal ones, and mentioned Mr. Pollock's dressing-room or bed-room, I do not know which he called it - we cleaned three dining-room ones, then went to breakfast, and on returning brought the machine, and fixed it in the library window; a person came into the library, and ordered us to the blue room windows - I do not recollect who it was; we went there, and then to Mrs. Pollock's bed or dressing-room, and after that back to the library; after cleaning the hall window, I asked the prisoner if we should clean the fanlight - he said No, he would rub that himself, as it would make a mess; we had occasionally cleaned the fanlight before; we left about half-past twelve o'clock - he never came to me to make inquiry about coins - he knew where to find me.</p>
               <p>Q. When told Miss Rivers had directed the windows not to be cleaned, did he say he should have been told of it? A. He said "Why had you not told me that."</p>

            . I am a journey man locksmith, in the employ of Mr. Tibbs, of Bedford-street, Bedford-row; he occasionally works for Mr. Pollock. About three months ago master sent me to the house with a job, and I saw the prisoner - he showed me a tin box like this in the pantry; he had it in his hand, to the best of my belief - he said it contained the keys of the cellar, and asked me to make him a key to it, to get a bottle of wine when he thought proper, and gave me a pattern of the key on paper; it was an impression in ink, made two or three different ways - I could have made a key from it; there was a pattern of the side, the top, and end; it was as much like the key of that box as I could possibly tell - it was a double tumbler lock,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170074"></xptr>which is difficult to undo; I gave him to understand that I would make it - he called several times at the shop, and asked if I had done the key; I had not began it - I told him at last, plainly, that I did not intend to do it; I heard of Mr. Pollock's robbery on the 19th of April, and went three or four days after with my master to Mr. Pollock's - he had before that told Mr. Pollock what had passed between me and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner knew you had been employed by Mr. Pollock? A. Yes; I am still with Mr. Tibbs, and have been so for a year and a half; I thought this proposal a bad thing, but did not tell master till he stated to me that Mr. Pollock had been robbed; I have not got the impressions - I do not know whether I threw then away, or put them into my pocket; I have seen Smith, the butler, at Mr. Tibbs', but never saw him there with any wine - I never intended to make the key; I think I have been at Mr. Pollock's house after the prisoner spoke about the key.</p>

            . I am a locksmith, and occasionally work for Mr. Pollock. I have examined the lock of the tin-box attentively; it appeared to have been opened with a picklock; that is my deliberate opinion - the ward is damaged in the way a picklock would do; I have looked at the dressing-case lock; that has been opened by no other than its own key - it is a Bramah's patent lock; I heard of this robbery from an officer; when I told Nunn I wished him to go with me to Mr. Pollock's, he told me the footman had asked him to make a key to the tin box, and given him a pattern on paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The Bramah lock has been opened by its own key? A. Or by one of the same sort - I have tried it with the key, and found it will go; I never knew a Bramah lock picked without injury - when I heard of the robbery I went with the officer into the shop to Nunn and asked if he had been applied to by the footman to make a key - we did not mention the report of the robbery to him at that time; he had not mentioned the circumstance to me; I never gave Smith any spirits in my life - I went to Mr. Pollock's when business called me, and Smith called on me, when he had orders to bring; the other servants came as often as him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MANNING. I am in the employ of lves and Burbidge, lock-manufacturers, Fleet-street. I have seen this tin-box, and in my opinion it has been opened by a picklock, the wards beings gulled, as we call it - the upper lock of this dressing-case has not been opened, except by a key - Bramah locks have been picked, but they have been very common ones; this is a very good one - the bottom one is common - the least variance prevents a Bramah lock being opened; I have opened the lock.</p>

            . I am Mr. Pollock's servant. I went the Spring circuit with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe the key of the key-box was given to you at times to get the wine-cellar key? A.Never; I have fetched the box to master, but never had the keys in my possession - I have taken them from master to my young master, from one end of the table to the other - I brush my master's clothes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the key of the key-box in his pockets? A. He has a fresh suit when his clothes want brushing; and he shifts his things himself - I have seen the keys drop out of his pocket when his trousers have been in his hand, but I never found them in his pocket - I never went to the winecellar alone; I knew Tibbs by his coming to work at the house, but did not visit him; I never saw him till I came into the family - I did not see him or Nunn Between the beginning of March and the discovery of the robbery - he never gave me information of this.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. At no time whatever have I had an opportunity of having the key of the box, except once, when Miss Rivers gave it to me to give to young Mr. Pollock; I gave the money to Mrs. Alexander at the time I found it - Eliza said at first, that she took the rug up that morning; and afterwards, that it was the day before; Nunn never was at the place at the time he mentioned - if he had fixed the time, I dare say I could have proved I was out with master at the time; I never denied that I did not know this was the key-box - what I said was, I did not know the keys of the box were in it; it is false altogether that I asked the man to make the key for any purpose whatever.</p>

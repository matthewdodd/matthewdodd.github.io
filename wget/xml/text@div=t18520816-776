                  </hi>. On Saturday night, 31st of July, I was on the canal bridge, at Uxbridge—I laid my head down, and went to sleep—I had a half crown, a sixpence, and three penny pieces in a tobacco-box, in my left hand pocket—I awoke, but I did not miss anything till I had got thirty yards beyond Mr. Roadknight's house—I then told my friend that I had lost my tobacco-box—he said he had no doubt but <hi rend="italic">Bet</hi> (the prisoner) had it—I went back to her, and said, "You have got a tobacco-box"—she said, "Yes"—I asked to look at it, and said it was mine—she said <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dean gave it her.</p>

I was standing by the last witness—I saw him asleep —the prisoner was shaking him, and trying to wake him—I awoke him, and said, "Come home"—he came on, and the prisoner came with us—after we got off the bridge, there was a tobacco-box fell—I said, "What is that?"—there was no answer, but the prisoner took up the box, and put it in her bosom—when he got about thirty yards further he said he had lost his tobacco-box—I said, I saw the prisoner with it—he went back; she gave it him, and said <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> Dean gave it her.</p>

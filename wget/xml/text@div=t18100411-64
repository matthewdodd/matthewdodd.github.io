               <p>JAMES VICE. I am a sawyer. As I came along Harley-street I saw the prisoner come up the area steps with the property in his hands, and directly Mr. Saunders sang out stop thief, and I followed him up Portland-street there I got hold of him along with the gentleman's servant, and brought him back to the house, I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him put the spoons down - A. Yes, I saw him lay them down on the pavement, they were picked up before I came up. I kept on after him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CHESTERMAN. I am a constable, I was on duty about seven o'clock, the prisoner was delivered to me, I found a key on the prisoner; the young man at the house kept the spoons.</p>
               <p>Saunders. These are the spoons that he took and the forks, they are my masters property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the area gate open - A. No, it was locked.</p>
               <p>Q. How he got the area door open you do not know A. No, I am sure it was locked the over night, and none of the family were up.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the value of these things, they are worth more than forty shillings are not they - A. A great deal more than that.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish is your house in - A. Mary-le-bone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Sunday morning about a quarter before seven, as I was coming up Harley-street I heard a cry of stop thief; I saw a man go by me; at the corner of Portland-chapel there were a number of people pursuing of him, some were riding and some on foot; one of the men came up and said, you are the man; some said I was not the man, and some said I was the man; that gentleman came up and said he was almost sure I was the man; directly I said, if you are sure I am the man I will go back with you. The key that I had found on me was the key of my lodging, every lodger in the house gives the landlady a shilling for the key to open the door themselves if they stay out late.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. to Saunders. Had none of your servants been out - A. None at all, all the doors were on the lock.</p>

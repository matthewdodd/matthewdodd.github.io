No - I had been about executing warrants and other things - I cannot say how long I was there; there are a great many Irish in White chapel, but not exactly in the neighbourhood; there are frequent disturbances among them.</p>

            . The prisoner is my son. I live in White's-yard, near Rosemary-lane; he came to my house on a Thursday evening in May, about eight o'clock - I cannot remember the day of the month - I think it was the second Thursday of the month; he was dressed in his shirt sleeves, and had no hat on: he said very little - I asked if he had been fighting; he said he had been fighting some Irishmen in the skittle-ground - I walked with him a little way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say whether any thing had happened while he was fighting in the skittle-ground? A. He made mention, in going along, that the parish-officers were after him for relief, for his wife and child, which I did not recollect before - I accompanied him to Mr. Pugh's in Carnaby-market; he said nothing more about the Irishmen, that I can recollect - I think there was something mentioned about a knife - I really cannot say the particulars.</p>
               <p>Q. You must tell us, as well as you can, you must tell the truth: did he say any thing more? A. He got 10s. at Mr. Pugh's - I accompanied him to Oxford-road, and he said he was going to Barnet; he mentioned something to Mr. Pugh about a knife, which I did not particularly attend to, for I was drinking a glass of gin at the time; he went to Pugh's for a coat and hat, which he got there, and 10s. to put into his pocket; I left him in Oxford-road; he shook hands with me - I bade him good night, and did not see him again till he was in custody; he had been married about five weeks - I suppose his wife had had the child two or three months before - I think her name was Beadle before she was married - I did not know the name of the child till after it was dead - I do not recollect, that I ever heard him call it by any name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The name of the woman who afterwards became his wife, you had only heard, I suppose? A. No; I heard it before and since their marriage; she went by the name of Beadle - I was not acquainted with her myself, she was such a bad character.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I went to Pomeroy's house about eight o'clock in the evening of the 10th May, after Dalton had been there - I did not search the room then - I saw the child's head on the table, and the body on the bed - I searched the same room the next morning, between ten and eleven, and found a fustian coat lying on the floor, towards the back of the room, opposite the window: it lay thrown down carelessly; there was some blood on both sleeves, and the front: the blood was splashed upon it; there was a good deal upon it in one place or another - I produce the same coat - I knew the prisoner before this happened - I had seen him often, and have observed his dress; I have seen him wear such a coat as this - I saw him two or three days before the 10th of May, but cannot tell what coat he had on then - I have seen him wear such a coat within about a week of that time - I marked this coat, and locked it up at the office - I examined the child's head on the Thursday night, and observed a dent or little bruise on it - I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and found him at a farmhouse in Radnorshire, Wales, called the Lane-house, on Thursday, the 17th of May, a little before ten o'clock in the morning; I had been in search of him from the day after this happened - I found him sitting in the lower room in the chimney corner - I had made a complete search of that house, at three o'clock in the morning of that day, and did not find him; the prisoner said, when I went in, "O, Davis. is that you? I shall go any where with you" - I secured him, and took him to the Seven Arms inn at Penybout, where I had a horse and chaise - I did not search any other house in that neighbourhood - I took him afterwards to a house at Radnor - an old lady there, who appeared to be the landlady of the house, said to him, "In God's name," or "In the name of God, how came you to do such a cruel thing?" (I had not used either threat or inducement to him - I had asked a question, which he declined answering); his answer to the woman was, "It was not God, it was the Devil;" when we were on the road from the farm-house to Penybont, I asked how he came to be guilty of such a thing, he would not give me any answer - I had not then told him why I took him, but I had before the landlady asked the question - I told him immediately I got him out of the house, that I took him on suspicion of murder; he said, "Very well, Mr. Davis;" this was before I asked him how he came to do such a cruel thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use the word cruel? A. Yes; nothing more passed between us; at Kinton, about sixteen miles from Penybout, I saw him change his shirt: the one he took off was bloody; here it is, (producing it) it is bloody on the left sleeve, and in front of the breast; it was just as it is now, and appeared to have been worn a good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, during your journey from Radnor to London, use any threat or promise to him? A. Never; I heard him say, "Oh, my poor mother, when she knows I am taken it will break her heart" - I heard him say nothing more. I put my name and the day of the month on the jacket before I locked it up - it is on it now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the only person who keeps the key at the Police-office? A. No. The landlady of the inn is not here. I was in the prisoner's lodging twice, but did not search until Thursday night; there was daylight enough for me to see - I did not see the jacket there then; there was a considerable quantity of blood on the floor. I cannot say whether the room had been occupied on the evening of the 10th, or whether the jacket was there then.</p>

On Thursday, the 10th of May, I was at home - old Mr. Sheen came to the house between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, and got a coat and hat - I saw him have the coat and hat, and 10s. The prisoner came in about ten minutes - the old man had not left; I saw the prisoner standing at the door when the father came; the father got the coat and hat the first time he came, and the second time I lent him 10s.; I lent it to the father.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner? A. At the door: that was the second time the father came - he then had my husband's coat and hat on, which the father had borrowed- the father had said something to me, which induced me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310013"></xptr>to ask the prisoner what he had done with the knife which he struck the Irishman with - he gave me a knife, and told me to burn it for God's sake; I threw it on the sink: I gave the same knife to Dickenson, the officer, the next morning.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your husband alive? A. Yes - he was at home, and heard what passed, but he had had rather too much; he gave old Sheen the coat and hat - there was no blood on the knife; it was much in the same state as it is now.</p>

            . I am beadle of Whitechapel. I examined the head of the child and the neck, and I looked at the body, and the part of the neck there; the skin at the back part of the head was very much in notches - it was cut off directly at the upper joint, at the back part of the neck; there were some notches in the skin, at the back, about the place where the joint had been cut through - the head could be taken off with such a knife as this, according to my judgment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you examine the head? A. I first examined it on Friday, about eleven or twelve o'clock - it was afterwards pointed out to me by Dickenson; I then examined it very minutely, and rubbed the saw-dust off; this was just as the Coroner's Jury were leaving the room. After they had returned their verdict on the Saturday, the master of the workhouse had the care of the body - he is not here.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you form your judgment from the head, or the body? A. From the head mostly; I saw the head on Friday - it was in the same state with respect to the neck, but was all over saw-dust.</p>

            . I am clerk to the attorney for the prosecution. I have examined the register of baptisms at St. George the Martyr, Southwark; I saw this extract made from the register, and examined it with the original - it is correct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How did you examine it? A. By taking the register in one hand and the certificate in the other, and comparing them; the parish-clerk examined it also, but did not read it to me, nor I to him - I saw it signed - it was signed at the time I examined it.</p>
               <p>This certificate was here read, and stated the child to have been baptized on the 31st of January, 1827, as Charles William, describing it as the son of Lydia Beadle, of Mr. Willis' poor-house, Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>SARAH POMEROY. I have heard the prisoner's wife called Lydia.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON contended that the deceased child having been born out of wedlock had, in law, no name, consequently, if it had not by reputation acquired the name stated either in the indictment or inquisition, the case could not be supported, and that the certificate produced was not sufficiently shown to have been that of the deceased. - <rs id="t18270531-14-verdict63" type="verdictDescription">

               The Court ruled that the indictment and inquisition were bad, but ordered the prisoner to be detained, and the witnesses bound over, to prefer a fresh indictment

I live with my father, a chandler, at 20, Trafalgar-street, Walworth—on 24th November, about 3.30, Carroll came in for half an ounce of tobacco, which came to three halfpence—he gave my mother a shilling—she gave him change, and put it in the tilt—there was no other shilling there—it was left open—I remained in the shop—he returned almost immediately and asked the time—I told him, and he left—I then took out the shilling, and found it was bad—a policeman came in and I gave it to him—the policeman afterwards showed me the packet of tobacco which I had sold to Carroll.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Mantellon, a news-vendor, of West-street, Walworth—on 24th November, about ten minutes to 4 o'clock, Hayes came in for a <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>—I said, "There is one on the rack"—he gave me a shilling—I gave him a three penny-piece, two halfpence, and one penny, from the till, and sixpence from my basket—I wrapped the shilling up with some florins, but no other shillings—I afterwards gave it to Farrant, P 2, who spoke to me, and who had a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Evening Standard</hi> with him, which I knew to be the one I had sold Hayes, as it was torn when he took it from the rack.</p>

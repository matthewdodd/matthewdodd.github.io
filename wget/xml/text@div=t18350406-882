                  </hi>. I live in Trafalgar-square, Stepney. On Sun<lb></lb>day night, the 15th of March, I was returning home in company with my wife, and passing down Mile-end-road about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock—I was on the pathway close to the houses—just before I got to the Trinity Alms Houses (my wife was by the tide of me) four or fire persons came upon us very hastily—we were surrounded in a moment—I think there were four or five of them—they came up hastily—one of them, which was the prisoner, rushed up against me—I know him again—he said, "What do you mean by assaulting me?"—I said "My friend, there is no harm done"—I put my hand out to put him on one—I had a ring on my right hand finger, and had not put my glove on—he instantly seized my hand, and never quitted it until the ring was wrenched from my finger—I say wrenched, because it was on tight—he had some difficulty in getting it off—he had hold of my hand a few seconds—I struggled, trying to get my hand away, but I could not do so, he had got tight hold me—the moment the ring passed over the joint of my finger I found he had got it, and called out, "He has stolen my ring"—at that moment I was tripped up by him and thrown down—there was nobody but him near me—I could not save myself, and I got a severe blow on my head with the fall—my wife immediately called out "Stop thief"—the policeman was close at hand—the prisoner ran to<lb></lb>wards the policeman and was instantly secured—I lost sight of him when I was tripped up, and when I got up he was in custody—he had got sixty or seventy yards from me, perhaps, before he was taken, but I cannot tell the distance—I did not see the ring again that night—I saw it next day—he hurt me in getting it off—my finger was sore for two or three days afterwards.</p>

               <p>the prisoner drove up against my husband, which occasioned him to jolt against me—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man—he said, "You have assaulted me, Sir," my husband said there was no harm meant—I saw him grasp my husband's hand very tight—I had no idea what he was doing—he held hold of his hand tight—my husband endeavoured to put him away, and at last, as he was falling down, called out "Police, he has stolen my ring"—I called "Stop thief" repeatedly—I saw the prisoner taken—I had not lost sight of him at all from the time my husband fell till he was taken—he was walking briskly—I concluded he was among the others—they were all together—I cannot say he joined the other four—I think he was taken too soon—he was going in the same direction as the others, but he was alone when he ran away, and had not joined any body—I am quite sure the policeman took the man who ran against my husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in the Mile-end-road, on Sunday night, the 15th of March—I heard a call of "Stop thief"—I had not observed any thing before that—I went towards the voice—I was about thirty yards off—on looking that way, I saw the prosecutor and his wife and a man near them—I could see him holding the prosecutor's hand—there was, a cry of "Stop thief," and the man ran towards me—I kept my eye on him and took him—it was the prisoner—I am sure I took the same man as I had seen with Mr. Clarke—there were four other men a<lb></lb>head of him between me and Clarke—they were walking on, and had passed me—there was not then any body between me and Clarke but the prisoner—after he was taken to the station-house, I returned with a light to the place where I took the prisoner—I saw my sergeant pick up a ring, which I produce—it was on the ground about the spot where I took the prisoner—I found it about one o'clock the same night.</p>

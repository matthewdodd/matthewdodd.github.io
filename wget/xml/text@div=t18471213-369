                  </hi> I am a refiner, at Wilderness-row, Clerkenwell. On 26th Aug., between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, Bowman came to my shop, and said he had come to sell some silver and gold for his master, Mr. Anderson, of 8, Hatton-garden—he produced spoons, forks, and fork handles, about eight or nine pieces, and a gold case, wrapped up in a hand<lb></lb>kerchief—I said it was pity his employer had broken it up in that manner—he said he wanted to make up a certain sum, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think—I weighed the articles, gave him an invoice with the weight and amount, and told him to send his master—I immediately sent one of my workmen to 8, Hatton-garden, who returned again in about twenty minutes—in about three quarters of an hour. Bowman returned with a person who I believe was Townsend, but I am not quite sure—he said his master had given him a good <hi rend="italic">blowing up</hi> for not bringing the cash—the other assumed the name of Anderson—I asked if that was Mr. Anderson—he said his name was Anderson—he brought the</p>

The prisoner was a night-watchman in the Company's employ—on the 29th of March he came off duty, at a quarter after six o'clock, and came to our office, in the Dock-house—I searched him, and found a bladder in his hat, containing three quarts of port wine—I found on him a small tin funnel, and a brad-awl—I asked him where he got that wine—he was much agitated, and said he had obtained it from B quay, where he was employed.</p>

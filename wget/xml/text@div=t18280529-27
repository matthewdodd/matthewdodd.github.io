               <p>JANE FERGUSON. I live in Kensington workhouse. On the 1st of May, about ten o'clock in the evening, I was in <placeName id="t18280529-27-crimeloc150">Jew's-row, Chelsea</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you not see him coming back to return your handkerchief? A. No; I was looking down, he threw the handkerchief at me, and ran back again - two officers came by and saw what a state I was in; I screamed out as loud as I could while he was robbing me, but nobody came up- I was only ten yards from the public-house.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I took the prisoner about half-past one o'clock on the morning of the night this happened; I was returning home and found the prosecutrix standing against the rails of Chelsea College, crying very much - she said she had been knocked down and robbed; she described the person - I found the prisoner in Queen's-yard, Chelsea, with four more who I took with him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Southwood to the top of a house, and took the prisoner with three more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I and a man named Drummond were coming from the play; we met this woman - she called to me by name, and asked me to go and have some gin; I asked if I should pay for it - she said No; she snatched Drummond's handkerchief off his neck, and as she was going away, I said "Ayn't you going to give him his handkerchief?" she said No; I snatched at it, and took hers by mistake; when I saw it was wrong, I threw it down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller, and live in Windson-terrace, Dover-road. I went to Epsom races on 23rd May—I took with me my Geneva watch, with gold cases; it had the name of "Badollet" on it—I was present at the first race, and after that had been run, I ran to see the horses come in, nearly opposite the grand stand—I felt a sudden push against me—I was rather interested in watching the result of the race, and did not look immediately; but on looking down, a moment or two afterwards, I dis<lb></lb>covered my watch had gone out of my pocket, and the guard, and bow, and pendant was in the state it is now, broken away from the watch—this is the pendant and the bow—I gave information to the police—on Monday, 16th June, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and I replied to that—some works of a watch were shown to me by Finnis, the officer, on Wednesday, 18th—they were the works of such a watch as mine, as near as I could tell—the maker's name "Badollet" was on the dial, which was with the works—there is a name on the works—my watch had a gold case, with a shield in the centre—the works of this watch are precisely similar to mine—I bought the watch of Mr. Hughes, a jeweller, in the Borough, for nine guiness—I had had it about four years—my impression is, that the works shown me by the officer were the Works of my watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker, and live in Greek-street, Soho. I supply the trade—I sold one gold watch to Mr. Hughes, on 4th March, 1847; the number of it was 22,908—it had a gold case, with an engine-turned back, and there was a shield in the centre—it had a skeleton movement, a horizontal escapement, and was jewelled in four holes—it had a white enamelled face, with a seconds hand—to the best of my recollection, these are the works of the watch I sold to Mr. Hughes—the number on the plate is the same as the watch I sold, and there is a name on the plate.</p>

                  </hi>. I work at watch-making occasionally, and attend the clothes market, where I hold a situation to take the toll—I live at 2, Pill's-buildings—I know the prisoner by sight—I remember his coming to me in Pill's-buildings on 28th May; he brought a gold watch with him, and asked me if I could repair it for him—I looked at it; it wanted a bow and pendant to the gold case, and the movement wanted repairing—it was a Geneva watch, with a gold case, engine-turned, and a shield in the centre—I took the movement to pieces while he was there, to see what state it was in—I under<lb></lb>took to repair it, and he went away—after he was gone, I observed something more about it, that induced me to follow him—while he was in the shop, I only observed that it wanted a bow, and after he was gone I found it wanted a pendant—the ring is the bow, and this part that goes into the case is called the pendant—I had separated the works from the case before this—I put the case in my pocket to go to him to show him that it wanted a pendant—he still desired me to repair it—I did not repair it, for on the same day I missed the case out of my waistcoat pocket; I have never got it back—I took the movements to the maker to get a case, and in the meantime I was summoned before the Lord Mayor, and then I went and fetched the movements back from the case-maker's, and took them with me before the Lord Mayor—I then took them back again—the works remained with me, and I product them now—I believe the number is 22,908, and the name is Badollet.</p>

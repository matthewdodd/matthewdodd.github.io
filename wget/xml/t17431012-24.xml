            . I am a Goldsmith; the Prisoner lodged in my House, and missing a Spoon, I suspected him.</p>
               <p>Q. What Reason had you to suspect the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hales. Upon the Account of his being idle, and not minding his Business; I charged him with it, and threatened him, that I would take him up, if he would not tell me what he done with the Spoon; and then, he said, he had pawned it at Mr Norwood's; but that he found it in the Dust-Basket; the Spoon is not marked; I told the Justice, I could not positively swear to it; I have the Weight of the Spoon in my Pocket, which I had from the Person I bought it of, and it answers to the Weight of this Spoon - my Wife concealed this Affair from me, for about three Weeks - the Prisoner had, at my Wife's Request, removed three Baskets of Ashes out of the House, in which, he said, he found it.</p>

            . On the second of September, the Prisoner brought this Spoon to my Master's to pawn; the Prosecutor came, and enquired after a Spoon, which the Prisoner had brought to pawn, and said, the Spoon was his: my Master said, if he would swear the Spoon to be his, he should have it; he said, he believed it to be his, but could not swear to it; because it had no Mark upon it. <rs id="t17431012-24-verdict111" type="verdictDescription">

                  <hi rend="italic">Hackett's Defence.</hi> I sell wash-leather; the day before this I had made my way to Deptford; I sold a piece at a house for 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the lady sent down</p>

               <p>a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece; I could not change it; the servant said would I leave the leather, or take it; I said I would leave it; the servant asked me to buy a few old wines and some shoes; I said I could not take them then, I would call the next day—the day I was taken I was going to the lady's house she owes me the 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the leather now; in going along, I sold one wash<lb></lb>leather at the Bricklayer's Arms for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I went on and sold another half a mile off for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I was going on, making all the haste I could, and met with a gentleman's servant; he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a piece of leather, and I went into the baker's shop; I had a pennyworth of bread, and put him down the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he looked at it, and said he did not like it; he gave it to a young baker; he said it was not a good one; then the old baker bent it very nearly in half; I threw him down another; he still kept talking; I told him to make haste, and I would overtake the man I had sold the leather to; I crossed the bridge, and saw the man who had a bad foot; I said he had given me a bad sixpence; I gave it him; he said, "I don't think; it is bad, but here is another;" I then went into a greengrocer's shop for a farthing's worth of onions; I gave a halfpenny, and they gave me a farthing; I went on to a public-house, and called for half-a-pint of beer; I put down 3/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the woman said it was 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and she took a drop out for the 1/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I came out, and walked on the road; I was very ill, and sat down on a step of a door; I began to have the tooth-ache; I went to get 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin; I threw down the sixpence; Mr. Mobbs said it was bad; I said I took it I down the road; I threw him down two other sixpences, and said, "Look, and tell me if they are good;" he said, "Yes, and if you take my advice destroy that sixpence;" I did so; as I came out, I took it between my fingers and teeth; Mr. Mobbs came up, and said, "Give me that sixpence;"I said, "It is no use to you or to me, I am breaking it up;" the man came up with the basket, a round hat, and two boots; he said, "What is the matter?" I said, "A bad sixpence; he said, "Ah poor woman, I am sorry-for you, I shall give you another sixpence for it;" he took me in and left me, and was away three-quarters of an hour; he then came in and said, "Take off your shoes and stockings till I search you;" I did so, and he said, "Loosen your gown;" I did, and a man said to him. "You are not going to search a female before so many men?" he told him to mind his own business; there were a great many people there; he took me into custody, and said I was more highly honoured than Victoria in state, and said there were many people looking at me; I never saw the prisoner Doolan till I was going to the station the same day.</p>

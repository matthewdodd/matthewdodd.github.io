                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the district of the parish of Lambeth, and live at Moor-place, Kennington-road—on 10th November I saw the body of a male infant at the dead-house; Adamson directed my attention to it—I made a post-mortem examination of it, the navel string was cut close to the abdomen—the child was fully developed—there was a jagged wound in the throat about four inches long, extending from left to right, cutting through all the large vessels of the right side of the neck, together with the trachea—there was an incision between the fourth and fifth cer<lb></lb>vical vertebra), dividing the spinal marrow—on reflecting the scalp I found a fracture on the right parietal bone, rupturing the longitudinal sinus—there was extravasations of blood round the fracture—in my judgment the wound on the throat was the cause of death; it was not jagged very much, but sufficient to call it a jagged wound—it had been inflicted by a cutting in<lb></lb>strument, because by the side of the long incision, there were two slight incisions, cutting through the cuticle, making three incisions altogether—the three incisions did not run into one—the two others were merely slight cuts, an eighth of an inch long, through the cuticle—they were independent of the principal cut—they were distinct cuts, not marks only—the large cut had gone half-way, and then gone on again, and so produced a notch in the centre—I should imagine it had been inflicted by a knife, and rather a pointed one, on account of the division of the cervical vertebrae—it would be impossible for the wound to be produced by the child falling from the mother into the fender—the lungs were fully inflated—I placed them in water, and they floated very buoyantly, together with the heart—I</p>

               <p>took the heart away, and put them in water again, and they still floated—I then cut them up in twelve or fourteen pieces, pressing each piece, and each piece floated—my judgment is that the child breathed—it might have done that in the the act of being born—there is nothing to assist my opinion as to whether it breathed in a state of existence separate from the mother—the body was completely drained of blood, every organ.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it a fact that a child may breathe before it has passed into the world? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there is a great difference of opinion about whether the hydrostatic test can safely be relied upon—with regard to the fracture of the skull, it has been the case that the cranium has been pressed against the pelvis in the pains of labour, and has been fractured—I knew a case, where the throat was cut when the child was half born, in the endeavour to cut the umbilical cord—it was not a case of mine, but my father's—the woman was alone—I know, as a man of experience, that in the case of a poor wretched woman cutting the navel-string, wounds are frequently inflicted unintentionally on the child itself.</p>

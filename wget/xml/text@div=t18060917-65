               <p>Q. When did you lose your gelding. - A. My horse was put in the field on the 3d of July at nine o'clock; I wanted my horse very early the next morning, I got up about four o'clock, I believe it might be half after four when I got to the field, I missed my horse, I brought my other horses home, and then I went and searched for this horse, I could not find nor hear any thing of him; about ten o'clock I came to London, and went to Mr. Dixon in Barbican, I told him I had lost a horse; from that I went to Mr. Sadler's in Goswell street; then I came to Smithfield, I believe it was about five o'clock when I came there, there was about four horses tied up to the rails, and there among them four I saw my horse; I said to my friend who was with me, there is my horse, he was tied up to the rails for sale; me and my friend went over the way and contrived how we should get the horse, I went and got a constable and he went and cheapened the horse; I came back again with the constable with me, I told him there was a horse there that I had lost, I looked at the horse and asked the price, whether he was to be sold, and who it belonged to; me, says the prisoner at the bar; I directly then gave the constable charge of him; the man that was with me took him over to the Greyhound, and I took the gelding there likewise. The constable then gave the landlord charge of the horse, and we went to the lord-mayor the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that it is your horse. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a mare or a gelding. - A. A gelding.</p>
               <p>Q. Any marks. - A. Blind with one eye, he has got a blaze in his face; we have got the horse here just by.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it is the horse you had lost. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the man. - A. No, I never saw the man with my eyes, till I saw him in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you lost the gelding that you saw it again. - A. I saw it the next day, the day before it had been at work in the hay-cart all day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him again he was public in the market. - A. Yes, with his tail done up in a nice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170045"></xptr>order.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a very nice horse perhaps. - A. Yes, it is a very good one.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked who owned the horse, the prisoner said it is my horse, did not he tell you he bought him at Bromley. - A. He did say something about that.</p>
               <p>Court. What colour was the horse. - A. Black.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What was it, a horse or a gelding. - A. A gelding.</p>
               <p>- WINTER sworn. I am a shopkeeper at Dulwich. On the 4th of July I went to Mr. Sadler's, I met Mr. Horton, he told me he had lost his horse, he was looking for it; he said he had been to the other repositories, he was then going to Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him. - A. I did; there I saw the horse which Mr. Horton owned, I asked him to look at him again to make himself sure, he did so, and then he agreed to go and fetch a constable, and that I should bargain for the horse; I did, I asked the prisoner at the bar if that horse was his, he said yes; I asked him if he had had him long, yes, he said, a good while; I asked him if he was a good draught horse, he said yes, he broke a chain in last week's drawing; I asked him the price of it, he said fourteen pounds, I then saw the horse run up and down the market, I cautioned him not to say it was his horse if it was not, as many people brought horses to Smithfield that never saw them before; he said it was his horse, he had had him a good while. I then bid him seven pounds for it, I bid him that money to detain him, he said he would not take that, but he would take ten pounds; then Mr. Horton came with the constable, he told the prisoner it was his horse; the prisoner said it was very odd, he bought it that morning at Bromley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who he bought it of at Bromley. - A. No, he did not know the man, he had a string of horses, and he bought one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the horse he was publicly in the market. - A. Yes, and he told me he lived at Bromley.</p>
               <p>Q. It is no uncommon thing to make a horse look fine, or to set him off in order to sell him to the best advantage. - A. No.</p>
               <p>- BETTS sworn. I am a constable; on Thursday the 4th of July last, Mr. Horton, the prosecutor, came to me at the corner of Hosier lane and asked me whether I was a constable, I told him yes; he said he wanted me to come along with him, he said he had lost a horse the night before, and he had found the horse in Smithfield; I went up along with him, I saw Mr. Winter with the prisoner and the horse; Mr. Horton asked the man who was the owner of the horse, the prisoner at the bar said that he owned the horse, Mr. Horton says, I give you charge upon suspicion of this man stealing his horse; I took him in charge and took him to the Poultry compter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner notwithstanding the accusation said it was his horse. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 4th of July I went into the country, our business was dead, I went down to see my brother, with intention of going into business myself; I intended to purchase a horse to carry goods about the country; when I came to Bromley this man came out of the road with five horses in a string together; he asked me if I wanted to purchase a horse, he asked me several times over, in consequence of that he prevailed upon me; I asked him the price, he said ten guineas, I told him I did not want one; he asked me again, he said the horse was rather refractory, he wished to sell it, I asked him the lowest that he would take for it, he said nine guineas, I bid him seven guineas, he took it; I had but eight guineas and three shillings; I took him to Smithfield, I had not money enough left to purchase any goods, and therefore I thought to sell the horse to see if I could get any thing by it, and to buy another cheaper, and to go into business myself.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

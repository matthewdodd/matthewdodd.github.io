I let the prisoner Edwards part of my second and ground floor, furnished, at two guineas a week; she brought Jones with her as a Lady's maid. She represented herself as having a daughter about to be married, and she had come from Bristol to take a furnished house for her, and wanted apartments for herself, her cook, and Lady's maid; she agreed to bring her own plate and linen; she came on Friday, the 16th of June, and was very tipsy - I thought she was ill - she said she had been travelling a long way; I made her a glass of brandy and water, and then left her to her maid; I told my wife to be careful of her; they went to bed and, I believe, got up together and went out the next morning. - When I came home at night I heard something which excited my suspicion; I went out on Monday morning, and came home about seven o'clock in the evening, and sat up that night watching - I saw Edwards, her cook, and her servant, on the ground floor, packing up some things; I went up stairs about ten o'clock, and my servant called me down, when I saw Jones lighting the cook out with a bundle; I then looked through the window, and saw Jones and Edwards, with a bundle under each of their arms, with the door in their hands, ready to go out - I heard one of them say "Hush - they are coming!" I went in and stopped them; I found part of a pot of honey, and one of my silver spoons, in one basket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner EDWARDS. Q. Did you see me packing any thing up? A. Yes, and when Jones was going out with the basket you took it from her and put it down. You had this honey and spoon, a Stilton cheese, and many other things, in it; this spoon is mine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you leave this spoon in the room? A. No - they had got it somehow - it had not been lent to them.</p>
               <p>EDWARDS' Defence. This young lass brought up three spoons in the morning, with the breakfast, and afterwards she brought up but one - I said "Where are the other spoons?" she said they were down in the kitchen - I did not know the spoon was in the honey.</p>

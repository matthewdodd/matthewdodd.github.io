                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer at 5, Angel-place, Penton<lb></lb>ville; it is my dwelling-house, and is in the parish of St. James's, Clerken<lb></lb>well. The prisoner was in my service for six months, and quitted about five weeks ago—he was fully acquainted with the interior of my house—since he left he has sometimes called to see Rabjohn, my shopman—on Tuesday night, 27th Nov., I was in my shop about half-past eight o'clock; I heard a loud screaming, which induced me to run to the passage door—Rabjohn was there, close to the street door—my servant maid ran to me from the interior of the house; and from what she told me, I ran towards the parlour at the back of the shop, and saw the prisoner just inside the parlour coming through the door—he had no hat on, that was only a few seconds after I beard the screams—I then ran to the street door, Rabjohn and the girl were near the street door—I closed it, and ordered it not to be opened—I then went to the third-floor front, which is my bed-room—I had a secretaire there—the prisoner knew I was in habit of keeping my money there—I found it half open and a small inner drawer also, from which I missed 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, which I had seen safe about eleven in the forenoon—I came down</p>

               <p>stairs and found a policeman, and searched about the house with him—there is a back door; I turned the key of that door before I went up-stairs, so that nobody could have come in from the back door, after I heard the screams—it leads into a yard, which is surrounded by a high wall and some buildings—it the time I first saw the prisoner I had no suspicion of him, but when I came down I had, and I asked how he came through the parlour at that time—he said he was standing near the Angel at Islington, and hearing screams he ran down a private passage and through the parlour, where I met him—he was only two feet from the foot of the stairs; I had seen him at my house that evening—my house is three houses and a half from the Angel, the half is over a gateway—my passage-door has no spring to it, it will not shut of itself if it is opened—I opened it—when I went up-stairs the windows were all shut, and everything secure.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Phillips. After the prisoner left, he was in the habit of calling to see me—on Tuesday evening, 27th Nov., he came about half-past seven o'clock—he walked into the shop as usual, and we had a little conversation—about five minutes to eight I went to the street-door, and stood there, having the care of some goods out in the street, and left the prisoner in the middle of the shop—he came up to me, and said, "Master says you may take the chairs in"—I said, "Very well," and walked back to move a couch; the prisoner stepped out, and brought in an arm-chair and sat down in it close by my side—after some time he said, "You do not want me any longer, I will bid you good night"—I was then about fifteen feet within the shop; he went out, the shop door adjoins the street door—whether he went away or went into the passage I cannot tell—I placed the arm-chair in the room, and immediately went to the door, looked both ways, and could not see him—I stood on the threshold about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I could see the Angel from there—if the prisoner had been standing there, I think I should have seen him—I then heard a cry of "Murder!" and women's screams from up-stairs—I immediately turned round, and Mr. Phillips came up—if the prisoner had come into the house after I heard the screams I must have seen him—I am positive he did not—Mr. Phillips had the girl in his arms—I took her from him, and he ran down the shop to get a light—he then came back and bolted the street door, and said to me, "Do not let anybody in or out"—I drew the servant twenty-nine inches from one door to the other, and when I turned round the prisoner was close to my elbow, without a hat, and his hair very much rumpled, and he was very much confused—he smoothed down his hair; he came from the direction of the back parlour—it would have been impossible for any one to have come in from the time I heard the scream till I saw the prisoner in the shop, without my seeing them—I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, how did you come in the house when you bid me good-night a quarter of an hour ago?"—he made no reply—the girl was still screaming—a knock came to the door, it was the policeman—the prisoner said, "Hold the girl fast, and do not let her go out; I will go for a policeman"—he unbolted the door and ran out, as two policemen came in—I fastened the door afterwards; in about a quarter of an hour the prisoner came back and brought some policemen with him, four or five came in altogether—during the twenty minutes I was standing at the door the prisoner had time to go up-stairs and get the money, and he bad time enough to get rid of it afterwards—when he was given in</p>

On the evening of 27th Nov., I was on the second-floor of the house—in consequence of what the girl said to me, I went up after her to my bed-room on the third-floor—she raised the valens of the bed, and said there was somebody under it—as she left, I saw a person in the act of crawling from under the bed—the person turned his face towards me—it was the prisoner—I opened the window, and screamed out—I had been in the room about a quarter of an hour before—the secretaire was then safe, and shut.</p>

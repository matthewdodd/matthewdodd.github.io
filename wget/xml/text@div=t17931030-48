               <p>Q. Are you servant to Mr. Kendall? - No, I was in his shop; he is a pawnbroker, I saw the prisoner put his hand to the breeches and take them down and put them down by the side of him and carried them away, I told Mr. Kendall.</p>
               <p>Kendall. I pursued him and over took him and took the property from him, they are my breeches, there is my duplicate on them, they were hung up in the shop to be sold.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been drinking along with an hackney coachman, coming along Brick-lane, Old street, he had a bundle under his arm which he said he had got from his sister; he says to me come into this pawnbroker's, I want to pawn something, accordingly I went along with him and I waited some time while he pawned his shirt, stockings, and some other things, he came out to me and brought a pair of breeches out, and said, take these breeches down to the coach stand, the bottom of Old-street-road, and I will meet you there. I had twenty pounds in my possession not two hours before, which I might have made away if I had been dishonest.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Kendall. I believe it is his first offence, he stood there quite stupid as if he did not know what to do.</p>

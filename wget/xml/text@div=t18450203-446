                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Ivy; our workshop is in St. Giles's churchyard; the house and front of the shop is in Compton-street, Soho; there is a yard leading to the back premises; there is do other communication to the workshops, except through the yard; St. Giles's churchyard is surrounded by a railing. On the morning of the 31st of Oct., my attention was called to the state of the premises, by a person named Liddle—I went to the workshops—there is a window look<lb></lb>ing into the churchyard, with iron bars to it—I found one bar wrenched off, and the sash had been opened—it is a sliding window—I looked at the fastenings myself the evening before—they are always kept fastened—that window is about the height of a man from the ground—there was no other part of the premises broken that night—I missed a flageolet and other instruments—the prisoner had been apprenticed to me, and had quitted my service about three years since—this flageolet produced was sent to me from Rye, in Kent, to repair—I gave it to Liddle to repair<lb></lb>owing to some communication I had with a person named Thorn I pur<lb></lb>chased a clarionet from him for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was one that I had lost on the morning of the 31st—I bought it to enable me to produce it, and likewise to return it to the party I had it from—it is worth six guineas—this pro<lb></lb>duced is it, and this is the flageolet I gave to Liddle the night previous—I am quite sure of it.</p>

I am journeyman to Mr. Wood—when I came on the morning of the 31st of Oct., the first thing I missed was this flageolet, which I had placed in a drawer, the last thing over nigbt, beside a clarionet—I missed various flutes from my own board, and se<lb></lb>veral flageolets from the other benches—there must have been twenty instruments missed, perhaps forty, clarionets, flageolets, and flutes—I am quite positive this is one that I missed that morning—it was one of my finishing originally, and I had to do a trifle to it—I saw the window bar had been wrenched off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Neat, a pawnbroker, in Duke-street, Manchester-square.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was at the witness's place, but there was a young man with me, named Scarlett, to whom the flageolet belonged; I deny all knowledge of taking it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was no one in the shop but the prisoner—he gave the name of John Scarlett—he called on me again, to redeem it, in company with another person, and I then recognised him at the person.</p>

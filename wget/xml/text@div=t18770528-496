I live at 10, Landseer Terrace, immediately opposite the prisoner's—I was standing at my door on the afternoon of 14th April, between 4 and 5 o'clock my attention was called by the prisoner and his wife quarrelling, which was very frequent—I could hear them using very violent language towards each other, more especially on her part—I saw her driving him out saying "Stab me you b——if you are a man, stab me, stab me"—she kept on saying it three times, and she struck at his head three or four times with a spoon—there is a little narrow garden in front of their house, about 2 yards wide, and the prisoner backed out into the path and then into the middle of the road, she striking at him all the time; I never saw him raise a hand to her till this happened, and then he held up his hands to ward her blows off to all appearance and gave her a push—he pushed her with one hand, but he had both hands up, she was striking at him furiously on the forehead, and I believe it did cut him—she even struck at him after she had received the stab—I did not see any knife until the policeman told me that he had a knife—I did not see any blood, I saw the sister get a cloth and put on her neck and take her off to the doctor.</p>

I went with Mr. Hannay, the Magistrate, to St. Mary's Hospital, and there saw the deceased Elizabeth Wicks—she made a statement which I took down, I afterwards read it over to her and she made her mark—Mr. Hannay asked her if she knew that she was dying—she said "Yes, I have no hope of recovery, my breath is so, bad"—she could only speak in a whisper—this is her statement. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "On Saturday, my husband was at home sitting by the fire, he had been drinking, I went in and said to him "You might have done your work," and I asked why he would not let my son do the work as he would not do it himself. He called me very bad names, and I ran upstairs and got a little iron fender and threw it down at him, but it did not hit him, he got up, and went into the garden and sharpened a knife; I took a spoon out of the drawer and went to him, but I did not hit him; he was stooping sharpening his knife; he got up turned round and stabbed me in the neck; I don't remember any more. I had a share of two or three pints of beer. My husband had been drinking for six or seven weeks; he was the worse for drink at the time, when he is sober there is not a kinder man or a better husband.</p>

                  </hi>. On 11th April, I was house-surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital, I received the deceased there and examined her—she had a wound in the upper part of the neck, on her left side, about an inch long; I did not probe it, because fluid and blood came out of it—it went into the back of the larynx and food came out of it, I should say the depth was about 2 inches, it pierced the larynx right against the spinal column; the wound had been closed by two small superficial stitches by an assistant of the gentleman to whom she had been previously taken; I had to take those out before I could form an opinion as to the wound—there was not much blood, she could not swallow, or speak, except in a whisper, inflammation of the lungs immediately set in about ten days after, and she died on 9th May, from exhaustion and inflammation of the lungs, the result of the wound; she was of rather a bad habit of body, and apparently had not led a very regular life, but these wounds are almost always fatal even in the strongest habit of body—in my judgment unless she had received this wound she would not have died—a knife of this sort would cause such a wound.</p>

The wound was quite horizontal with the body, it went in at right angles, not downwards; if the man held the knife stiffly in his hand, the woman falling against it might be sufficient to produce the wound, it was a penetrating wound; if she had fallen forward it ought to have been not only penetrating but longitudinal—it might probably be caused by the woman coming against it, it is unusual to get such a wound in that way, but it might be.</p>

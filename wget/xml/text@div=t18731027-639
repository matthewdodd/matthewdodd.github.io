On 10th October, about 4.30 p. m., I was under the railway arch, College Street, Kentish Town—I saw the two female prisoners standing at the corner of College Street, talking to one another—Tipper had a black and white shawl on as she has now, and Brown had a black jacket—I afterwards saw them go in the direction of Holloway, and saw Tipper beckon to Brown who went across the road, took a shawl from her back, and placed it under her apron—she joined Tipper—I stopped them, and asked Brown what she had got under her apron—she</p>

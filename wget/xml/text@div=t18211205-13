            . I am a watchman. On the 2d of November, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I found Mr. Ward's door open, a young man stood with his back against the shutters, I asked him why the door was open, he made no answer - I walked into the passage, and the man said, "Come out of there d - n your eyes, what are you doing there." He had no sooner spoke, than a man darted out of the back parlour into the passage, and I apprehended him, I took it to be the prisoner - I held him for three minutes, and then he broke away from me; I sprung my rattle, and pursued him, he was taken in about four minutes - I lost sight of him, as four hackney-coachmen stood in the way, ran, and crossed me, I did not lose sight of him a moment, and then saw him again - I noticed as he ran, that he had no hat on, I found a hat in Ward's passage after he was taken to the watch-house. When he was first brought back he was in custody of Vincent. I examined the house, but could find no marks of the door being forced - I suppose it must have been opened by a false key, no keys were found on him. I tried the hat on the prisoner at the watch-house, it would go on his head, but was rather too big for him. I went to the house, and alarmed Mr. Ward - I was absent from the house about five minutes; I then found the hat, the clock was missed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You lost sight of the man who ran out - A. Yes; the coachmen interrupted my view. He said the hat was not his - I put it on, and it dropped down over his eyes. I did not see him secured, as I was on the other side of the coach - he got into the coach, and on my opening it, he got out on the other side, I kept my eye on him till he got into the coach. I had known him by sight four or five years, he is a hackney-coachman - when I first saw him, it did not strike me that it was a person whom I knew.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 2d of November, I was in Bow-street, and about half-past one o'clock, heard Sullivan's rattle spring - I came to the top of Charles-street, and saw the prisoner running, and Sullivan in pursuit - the prisoner then crossed the coaches and got into one of them; when I got up to the coach, Sullivan had the door open, and was going to pull him out, he jumped out on the other side - I came round the horses heads to the opposite side, and he ran down Charles-street again; I pursued him, he ran round the coaches, and came up the street again, and when he came up close against the third coach, he sat himself up close against the horses, and I took him - I cannot say whether he had a hat on when I first saw him; he had one on when I took him, and a coachman whipped it off his head and said it was his.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time you pursued him had he any opportunity of getting a hat - A. I cannot say, for he went round the coaches different times. I am sure he is the person whom I first saw - I did not know him before; I might lose sight of him when he got into the coach, but at no other time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not know him before - A. No. There were twelve or fifteen coaches there - I think he could not mix with the other coachmen, as more watchman were pursuing him - I did not lose sight of him, I only saw his back while he ran round the coaches; the hat might be put on his head, but I did not see it done. The coachmen did not interfere to stop him - I was within a foot of him when he stood up at the horses heads.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did you see him get into the coach - A. I did not see him get in, as all the four coachmen crossed me at the time - I went to the coach to get him out, he laid back as if he was asleep - I went to catch hold of him, and he jumped out on the other side. I noticed his having no hat before he got to the coach, I cannot say where he got the hat, he had none on when I saw him in the coach.</p>

            . I am the beadle. I joined in the pursuit when the alarm was given - I was with two or three watchmen within one door of Mr. Ward's, and saw people running, and crying Stop thief! I did not see the man who was running away, to distinguish him, till he got out of the coach - he had no hat on then; I saw him taken, I lost sight of him once for a moment, he ran round the coach rank two or three times - he had a hat on when he was taken; I saw a hat thrown from one of the coachmen to him, just before he was taken, but whether the coachman put it on his head or into his hand I cannot say, when he got it on, he turned round to the horses, as if he was attending to them - a coachman came and took the hat off his head, I caught hold of it and asked what business he had with it, he said it was his own, and that the prisoner took it off his head, the prisoner said nothing to it - he was within a yard of him. I cannot say whether he heard it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was taken off his head while he was being taken away in custody - A. Yes; we had not moved towards the watch-house, he was taken instantly.</p>

            . I am a constable, of Bow-street. I saw the man who was running after he came out of the coach, he then had no hat on; I came to the horses heads, and found the prisoner was secured - I cannot say he was the man who was running; I was about a foot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182112050011"></xptr>from him when I first saw him, I seized him momentarily with the watchman; I am not positive that the man I seized was the man who ran, the watchman had seized him while I ran round the coach and met him, he was out of my sight for a moment - when I caught sight of him again, he had a hat on his head, a man knocked it off and said "This is mine;" the prisoner said nothing. There was a great noise, I heard him very plain, he was not out of my sight above a second - I saw nobody else running away.</p>
               <p>Q. If the person you had seen without a hat had ran away, must you have seen him - A. Yes; I can speak with certainty to him, as I have known him for years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not certain that the man who was taken is the man who ran - A. No; A handkerchief hung out of the hat down his back, which fell when the hat was taken off - I believe the coachman picked it up.</p>
               <p>MR. WARD re-examined. My door was fastened when I went to bed at twelve o'clock, I was not the last person up, I saw it fast about a quarter before twelve o'clock, I always see it fastened, it was not bolted, only on the single latch, my lodger, (Mr. Allen,) being out at the time; and I left Mr. Gladstanes up with a friend. When the watchman came, I went into the back parlour and missed the timepiece off the sideboard; it was not carried away, only removed into the next parlour - it was nearer to the front of the house than the parlour in which it was; a small tea-chest was taken off the drawers behind the parlour door, and taken away entirely. I and my wife went to bed at the same time, leaving Mr. Gladstanes up - my back parlour door was not locked, but shut; a light was left there for the lodgers. There is a door from the front to the back parlour, which was left open, but the door from the front room to the shop was forced open; it had been locked, but was forced. Nothing in the shop had been moved, but I think they must have been there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. After you went to bed, your lodger let out a friend - A. Yes.</p>

            . I lodge at Mr. Ward's, and had a friend with me on this night. I let him out at half-past twelve o'clock, and left the door fastened on the latch, on the spring lock. I am sure the lock had caught, for it being late, I shut it with violence that the prosecutor might hear that my friend was gone.</p>

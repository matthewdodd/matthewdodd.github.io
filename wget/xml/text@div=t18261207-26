               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. He came to you at half-past three o'clock and remained till half-past ten; what had you to drink? A. He asked if I would have any thing to drink; I said, No - he said he was thirsty, and my servant got him some ale - I only know of two pots being got, but I was not awake all the time; I sat on the sofa by the fire, and slept between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you show him the watch, or did he take it up? A. When he came in I said, "You are pretty punctual;" he took the watch off the mantel-piece, and said I could not be in great want of money having such a valuable watch by me - he had told me that he had no money; I had had the watch about four months, I should think; I told him how I came by it; he complained of having no money, and that brought up the statement; I told him it was a bad debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him you were walking in Regent-street on Tuesday evening, and met a genteel boy, about thirteen years old, and that he gave you the watch, having been with you that night, and having no money? A. I said a gentleman had been with me, having no money, and said he would leave the watch - I do not know his age, he was quite a young lad; I did not take much notice of him- he was with me all night, and gave me the watch to keep till he could redeem it; he has called for it since it has been missing; I did not ask him for the watch, he gave it into my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was the price of your prostitution? A. Yes; I never promised to compromise this matter if the prisoner would pay 30s. for expenses and 3l. for the watch; I have neither seen him nor sent to him; nothing of the kind has ever passed - he said he did not know me when I met him; he valued it at ten guineas when he was in my room; I missed it while he was in the room, and afterwards found it was in the cupboard wrapped up in the handkerchief - when he was leaving the room I did not say I was going to dress to receive another visiter - I was quite sober; I had but three glasses of ale and some filberts; I do not think he could be very sober; I had neither dinner nor tea, for as soon as I got home he knocked at the door.</p>

            . I attended on the prosecutrix at the time in question; I was there all day, but did not sleep there - I saw the prisoner at her lodging on the day the watch was missed - I let him in, as near as I can recollect, at half-past two o'clock; they had a little ale and some nuts; two pots were fetched while she was up; the prisoner paid for both ale and nuts; I cannot say whether he was sober or not; they had no tea; I found the watch hanging over the fire-place; while she was asleep the prisoner went out, and while he was gone I wrapped it up in a handkerchief, or part of a white petticoat, and put it into the cupboard; he came in again in five minutes, and said he had ordered some oysters, for he was hungry, and they were brought; he asked the prosecutrix to take some; she said she was too ill; I went home after the oysters came and know nothing more; I did not see the watch after I put it into the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How was she ill? A. She had had no dinner when the prisoner came, and she fainted away with the heat of the room; she drank ale about three times; I suppose she had a glass altogether; I fetched two more pots afterwards, but she drank none of that, and she did not know of its being brought; the prisoner handed the watch over the back of the chair to me, and said, "Here, Mary, go and pledge it for your mistress; it is a pity she should be so short of money, and have such a beautiful watch in the place;" but I did not take it; this was after I had wrapped it up; I do not know how it got into his possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you would not pawn it, what did he do with it? A. Mistress took it out of his hand, saying,"No, I would sooner want a shilling than pawn it, when it is not my own" - it was not in the handkerchief then, but I am sure I had wrapped it up before that.</p>

            . I am a constable of Marlborough-street; the prisoner was brought to the office, and gave his address at Brunswick-terrace, Hackney-road - I afterwards went to the lock-up room, and asked him if that was correct; he said he did not wish to give me trouble, that it was not correct, nor would he tell where he lived, let the consequence be what it would - I afterwards got his proper address from his wife at the office; but the watch has not been found.</p>
               <p>ADELINE WILLIAMSON re-examined. It was a silver hunting-watch; I never ascertained the value; the lodgers in the house are married people; I have seen Frederick Smith there; he passed as the landlord.</p>

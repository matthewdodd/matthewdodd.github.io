I have a partner - on Saturday the 27th of April, about eleven o'clock at night, I missed these things - I had been showing them to a customer about six or seven o'clock; they were in a glass case in the shop - the prisoner worked for me and had access to the shop; I had missed a great many things, some of them during that week, and mentioned it to the policeman; I did not miss these shoes till the Saturday night - I found the prisoner in custody, on another charge, and duplicates of these articles were produced to me - I afterwards went to the pawnbrokers with the policeman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Could I get access to behind the counter? A. Yes; but these were not behind the counter - he came to the shop to bring his work in; and sometimes shut it up for me; my apprentice was in custody with him - I have at times found my shop door open.</p>

            . I live with my father, who is a pawnbroker in Old-street. I took this waistcoat piece in pawn, but I don't recollect the prisoner; and I took in the shoes - three shillings was advanced on the shoes, and one shilling on the waistcoat piece - I cannot be certain the prisoner pawned them - it was on the 25th and 27th of April - I saw him in custody on the Tuesday - these are the duplicates which were given to the person - they are pawned in the name of Thomas Jones.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I took the prisoner in charge about two o'clock on Sunday morning, on another charge; I searched him and found five duplicates on him, one for a pair of shoes, another for two waistcoat pieces.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.How long was I in the watch-house before you searched me? A.You might be ten minutes, you could not have destroyed the duplicates, as too many were present.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I left his shop about half-past ten o'clock, and was returning down Shepherdess-walk; I observed a piece of paper on the ground, took it up, and it contained three duplicates, which I put into my pocket; I went to the public-house and was taken on a false charge; I intended to ask if they belonged to anybody about there.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The warrant was for conspiring with Vance to murder a person unknown.</hi>) The other warrant has the name of Quarll in it—I read both the warrants to her—I have three warrants, they are worded in a different way—I am not sure which of these two I read to her—after reading them she said "I have not harmed any one, and did not intend to harm or murder any person; I have been very weak and ill and I meant the drugs for myself, and I intended to have them by me in case I was ill again, but the powder I received smelt so hor<lb></lb>rible I could not use it, the other in the bottle I poured away, and broke the bottle. I sent the powder back the same day as I sent the post-office order, and that I intended for the trouble I had given the person who answered the advertisement I had put in the newspaper"—I am not quite sure whether she said the "Daily Tele<lb></lb>graph" or not—she said "I have never seen the person"—I said "I must search for letters"—she said "You will not find any, I have destroyed them all, even the blotting paper"—I saw this diary on the table—I turned to look at it, and she said "That is my diary," and she called my attention to one or two entries that she had made in it—she said that she had been very lonely after her husband left, and if it had not been for the sister-in-law who had been stopping with her she should not have known what she should have done—I do not remember which were the entries she pointed out; they did not appear to me to be of any consequence at the time—several leaves of the diary are turned down—on two of the leaves I found the impression of. the name of William Quarll, it is very plain on one; they are about the dates of 31st January and 9th February—I only see one now—I took (her to the station and she there gave the name of Ellen Snee—I produce a copy of the "Daily Tele<lb></lb>graph" of Friday, 18th February, also some letters which I received from the post-office authorities upon the Secretary of State's warrant—I opened them in the presence of the Solicitor to the Treasury—there are six altogether, but one envelope contains several—I also received a "Globe" newspaper.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 49, Brady Street, Bethnal Green—I know the prisoner Vance—I first became acquainted with him at the latter part of August last, I engaged him to assist me as my <hi rend="italic">locum tenens</hi>, to take my practice while I was away for a few days—I understood that he had completed his curriculum and that he was preparing to go up for his M.D. examination some time early in the year—he was introduced to me through a medical agency—he acted for me very satisfactorily for ten days in August—he came to me again for a week at Christmas, he then acted as my assistant—he returned again on 22nd February for two days, on the 22nd and 23rd—I knew his address, 59, Euston Road—while he was with me he had access <hi rend="italic">to my</hi> surgery and to the drugs in it, in the ordinary way—I have frequently seen him write—to the best of my belief this envelope marked B and the letter contained in it marked A are in his handwriting—my house was formerly No. 53, Brady Street, it is no 49. (<hi rend="italic">Letter A read;</hi> "59, Euston Road, N.W., Wednesday. My dear Sir,—It occurs to me I may not have very clearly explained my suggested <hi rend="italic">modus operandi;</hi> one thinks of many things pertinent after closing the letter for post. Referring to your note of 20th, I must say there is risk of discovery with whatever mode of death; for the registrar requires notice of 'cause of death' from medical attendant. Should this be not forthcoming, an inquest, and in all cases of sudden decease, an inquest. If a person die under unnatural or suspicious conditions and the matter hushed up and no inquest, this implies the distinct connivance of friends. But you desire to have your friend or friends igno<lb></lb>rant of any premeditated design and no doctor called in attendance, under these circumstances there must ensue a coroner's inquiry. My plan is this: Sudden death allowed, or apparently suspicious death acknowledged, still a favourable verdict may be returned which in no way can invalidate a will made antecedent to death, probably many weeks. The peculiarity of my suggestion is that although the actual cause of death is found out, and that a narcotic, yet the verdict will be the most lenient, viz., 'By misadventure, or as it is phrased sometimes more specifically' The deceased was in the habit of taking chloral, and died from an overdose incautiously adminstered by himself.' I can arrange details to 'square' with this and submit them to you at our meeting, or on paper. If you like, chloral might be administered to a <hi rend="italic">dog or cat</hi> or you might try yourself an ordinary dose, and be thereby cognisant of <hi rend="italic">the bond fides of the agent.</hi> Upon mature consideration, I know of no more feasible method. The cases of the poisoners, Pritchard and Palmer, both doctors were ingenous, yet they were detected. They lived before these chloral times. As an anatomist and medical jurist, I altogether frown on any attempt to excite arterial rupture, &amp;c., and am willing to adduce reasons. I would desire this for several reasons (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) to get rid of the affair, have it off my mind, which is natural and necessary; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) I am expecting to be summoned to Liverpool any of these days to meet my brother-in-law, returning in a sailing vessel from San Francisco; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) a cousin of mine, <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> for Hamburg, is coming to 59, Euston Road, to stay a few days, and if I be not at Liverpool next Tuesday I want to be at his service. I write this letter at 53, Brady Street, Bethnal Green, E., where I am since yesterday doing full duty for Surgeon Mannering. We have a surgery here and I have access to the drugs, bottles, and labels, &amp;c. I return to Euston Road to-night and will have a supply of the drug. If you adopt my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187605290051"></xptr>
               <p>theory we might arrange to meet, and then take leave of the subject. You can select your own fit time. Expecting a reply.—Believe me, Sir, in confidence, yrs., W. K. V.—M. Q." I also believe this letter of 12th April, 1876, with the initials W. K. V. to be in Vance's writing, also this letter of Thursday, 12.30 at noon, in the same envelope marked F. (<hi rend="italic">These letters were read as follows: Envelope addressed</hi>"To be called for, M. V., 149, Kentish Town Road, Post-office, N.W. April 9. Dear Sir,—I cannot thank you enough for the admirable way in which you have managed everything. My niece knows nothing of your being a medical man. I have given her to understand you are something of a virtuoso, and that the box contained impressions from antique seals, <hi rend="italic">also that I owe you a great deal of money.</hi> I am inclined to think that the chloral will be perfectly satisfac<lb></lb>tory. I should like to know if there is any likelihood of its strength evapo<lb></lb>rating, especially in the corked bottle It is possible that this may get somewhat wasted with sniffing and experimenting, and that a further supply may be necessary, but I will, try not. Supposing I do not give the dog his, a portion of it diluted would, I suppose, do for me in every sense of the term. Is a portion of it equal to six teaspoons full of the labelled bottle <hi rend="italic">quite certain</hi> in its effect? If you can assure me of this I shall not want any other me-diam, except, perhaps, a drop or two of prussic acid in a tiny phial in case of failure with the dog-; but that I can let you-know. I think I had better get a little oil of peppermint at any ordinary chemist's. Tell me what quantity will suffice. I shall be in the City early to-morrow, and will post your fee whole, after drawing it out. I do not think there is any danger, and you will want it for your holiday, perhaps. Don't forget the bill. I can trust my niece to see it paid, but you may have to wait six months after the event. This lovely weather has given me great desire to see one particular spot of country in the North for the last time. I think I shall start on Tues<lb></lb>day afternoon and give myself a week's holiday. This may defer the event till Easter Tuesday or Wednesday, but cannot make much difference to you. Tell me in your next if the Euston Road address is good for six months.—Yours most faithfully, Wm. Quarll. In what way is alcohol a poison? I have somewhere met with the following passage: 'Arsenic will not destroy life so quickly asalcohol, for the former has to decompose the structure of the stomach, whereas alcohol directly assails the principle of life in the nervous system." "59, Euston Road, N.W., 12/4/76. Dear Sir,—I notified to P.O., K. T. Rd. (149), that I received your letter, Monday. But I feared to reply to the old place lest you thought of changing your address. I hope this may not cause unpleasant delay. The prussie acid is quite ready for post, and as for the essence of peppermint, you will find some three or four drops suffice to flavour, and neutralise odour. Alcohol kills like chloral—both are narcotic, they in<lb></lb>duce sleep and simulate apoplexy. Sometimes apoplectic folks lying in the street are taken for dead drunk. My full name is William Kingston Vance. Let my address remain, 59, Euston Road, N.W. If you keep the solutions corked carefully they evaporate little. The dog's portion would do you, the full half of it is sure to be effectual. Your own share is diluted, and doubly so, for having found that the fluid rushed about in the bottle (filled more than half) and made a noise when the packet for your niece was shaken, I filled up the bottle with water. Let the label remain, but (should you use your own solution) take <hi rend="italic">two good tablespoons.</hi> It might be a good plan, having abstracted <hi rend="italic">your dose, before swallowing</hi>, to pour in some clear water, but not to <hi rend="italic">the extent of filling</hi>, for if the solution were found very strong and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187605290052"></xptr>
               <p>undiluted, suspicion were aroused. You understand you may employ either bottle. If the smaller, abstract a full half, and then pour in a little water. If the larger, abstract two tablespoonfuls, then pour in a little water, Whichever bottle you use. throw the other away, and let the bottle you employ be left on the mantelpiece or table, not hard by the bed. Let no specimen of my writing, save that relating to debt, be found; and let all around you remain in usual condition, to imply absence of design. The entire affair is to show <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> accident." "April 13th, 1876. Dear Sir,—The vile weather on Monday, and a sharp attack of rheumatism pre<lb></lb>vented my visit to the City, or to K. T. until this morning. There I found your card. Please reply to, and return last letter (also this) to M. V. 149, K. T. Road. I have deferred my week's visit to my native place until the weather is more propitious. The remittance only awaits your further advice. Do you wish it sent to Euston Road? I missed your letters much, Can't you tell me about the alcohol, and draw out the bill I spoke of to you?—Yours faithfully, William Quarll." "Thursday, 12.30 o'clock, noon. Yours received. I will go with this to Kentish Town Road, 149, and drop it in <hi rend="italic">immediately.</hi> I am anxious to have remittance <hi rend="italic">to-day.</hi> Bank holiday to-morrow. Can you send by some trusty person to me at this address I You might wire if you think proper. I should so like the money directly. I shall write again and enclose bill, and send the prussic acid—Very truly, W. K, V.") This envelope marked G and the letter contained in it I also believe to be in Vance's writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Will be called for." <hi rend="italic">Envelope addressed</hi> M. V, Post-office, 149, Kentish Town Road, 59.13/4/76. My dear Sir,—I had expected you would have received with the card written Monday my little letter penned last evening. This last, as the former, simply explains delay on my part. You did not renew address, so I feared to risk any more letters, left at a post-office 'to be called for,' after the his<lb></lb>tory of the first batch. You will agree this is a natural scruple. I thought I had given you to understand that my address remains as now. If better I can make my address, Care of Dr. Fuller, Oswestry, Co. Salop, or Dublin. For I only came to England three years ago, and only came to town six months back. If any hubbub were excited about my 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would be unpleasant if I made out a bill dated five years back, and if it turned out I but lately came to England, and that I'm so young in the profession. Why not let it stand so; the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is a loan from me to you. The sum lent, say in 1874, when I was in Oswestry, or 1875, when I was in Guernsey. You might in your will, and the body of it, direct the loan of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be returned without interest as soon as executors have paid immediate debts, or within six months. I might hold in your own writing a promissory note, and a letter alluding to the transaction, and among your papers a letter of mine might appear showing evidence of a loan. I fancy this plan is better than the bill. A 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. medical bill would imply attendance on a long and tedious illness, of which there would be no evidence, and no evidence certainly to connect me with you as attendant. I presume you mean a medical bill. If you mean a trader's account—well, I have never had any trade association. But I might appear as a private lender. Will you think over this, and say what you consider advisable. I might hold a receipt of payment of some 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the assured loan, or the loan might stand at 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of which 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. have been paid, and of which the remaining 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is to be paid with all other various claims. As you defer holiday (and I regret this unpropitious weather, and your conse<lb></lb>quent rheumatism), there is space to communicate on this matter. On</p>

               <p>receipt of yours this morning I forthwith replied, and enclosed your last two letters. I asked you to oblige by remitting your favour as soon as convenient. Indeed, I should have been off again to-day but for the delay in this matter. I returned from the Black Country on Wed<lb></lb>nesday morning, to be on the spot, and give the affair earnest consideration. I shall be off as soon as I again hear from you. Kindly return all entire, and believe me very sincerely, W. K. V.") This envelope marked H, and the letter enclosed are also I believe in the handwriting of Vance. (<hi rend="italic">Read: Envelope endorsed "M.</hi> V., 149, P. 0., Kentish Town Road." <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi>"59, Euston Road, N.W. Sabbath. My dear Sir,—When you go to 149 for your letters (if you have not gone already), you Trill find I have been diligent in explanation since receiving your last, which assured me of your address. I hope you are satisfied with my reply. I trust your attack of rheumatism is fully passed over, and that you can now enjoy a holiday. I have spent only a fraction of a holiday. I had an agreeable evening in the Black Country Tuesday, but returned to town principally at the instance of our mutual affair. I could hardly enjoy a trip with this matter hanging over me. I had hoped for a letter Satur<lb></lb>day. I suppose there will be no delivery to-morrow (Monday) morning. But surely I shall have an answer by early Tuesday morning. I think the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note carefully addressed to 59 is quite safe, we can trust to the theory of probabilities. If you reply Tuesday early, I might get off to Wales Tuesday afternoon. I, of course, will furnish you with my address there, and be happy still to answer any letters from you.

Q," or "W. Quarll"—I remember her coming to the office on 1st April, she inquired for letters that had been returned to the General Post Office—there were none for her at that time and she left—she came on the Monday or Tuesday and asked if the letters had been returned from the General Post Office, that she had written for them—I said they had not been returned yet—she said she would come again; she came again on Wednesday, the 5th—there was one letter for her then and that was given to her—she opened and read it—she said it was from the General Post Office, and it was all right, the letters were destroyed; she said on each occasion that her letters might be addressed M. Q., or W. Quarll—that was the last time I saw her; I think a post-card was—returned with the rest of the letters to the General Post Office.</p>

I practice at 50, Parliament Street, I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and Lecturer on Forensic Medicine at the Westminster Hospital—on 25th April, I received from Inspector Clarke, a quantity of drugs, amongst them a bottle of Corbyn's that has been produced—I could tell by the smell that it had contained chloral—liquid chloral, if taken in a strong dose is destructive to life—I should say a full ounce was quite certain to destroy life—this bottle would contain equivalent to I oz. of solid chloral—to the best of my judgment and knowledge the half of it would cause death—the effect of a fatal dose of chloral is that the patient passes away and leave no trace of having been poisoned, beyond the symptoms of. coma and great sleep; we should not find anything upon a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination to communicate the precise nature of the thing which had caused death, except by an analysis of the" contents of the stomach, then it would be possible, if we analysed recently, by distillation to get the volatile particles of chloral which would be the same were it, either chloral or chloroform; it is very quickly absorbed, it would be impossible to find it except upon a very complete examination,. shortly</p>

               <p>after death—in the box that was brought to me I found some prussic acid in these two bottles—here is 1oz. sold in a wholesale condition, and 6 drachms in an unlabelled bottle—I have tested it, this is the dilute prussic acid of the British Pharmacopoeia, from four or five minims to a drachm of that would cause death—here are 8 drachms and 6 drachms, fourteen altogether—a smaller quantity than a drachm might produce death, but a drachm might certainly—there is enough in these two bottles to kill fourteen people—I found no chloral except the empty bottle—there were 46 grains of strychnine—from half a grain to a grain of strychnine is poisonous, a grain certainly would be fatal—it would not be sold to the public in this form, the medical preparations of strychnine are made from that—I also found 2 drachms 25 grains of bi-chloride of mercury, corrosive sublimate, that is a deadly poison; from 2 or 3 to 5 grains would cause death, even less, say from 2 to 5 or 10 grains—I also found a large quantity of laudanum, a bottle of powdered opium, morphia and tincture of bella donna, those are all poisonous, more or less.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. I have no list of the drugs that were given to me; I have them at my house, they are ordinary common drugs, a large quantity—I picked out the poisons from a very large quantity of drugs—each of these poisons carefully and properly administered are such as medical men employ continually—there were forty or fifty different kinds of drugs in quantities, varying from a few grains to a considerable quantity—it would fill three or four sheets of foolscap to enumerate them, they were simple kinds of drugs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am acting as Mrs. Snee's attorney—I went to the post<lb></lb>office, 149, Kentish Town Road, to call for some letters—I was instructed on her behalf on the Saturday morn ing after the first remand—I went for the letters immediately afterwards—I have known her a good many years—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">the advertisement</hi>) is her handwriting. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "To medical men in need of money, or students well up in chemistry and anatomy. A gentleman engaged in an interesting experiment is willing to give liberal remuneration for professional assistance, Q. W., Post Office, Junction Road, Kentish Town, N.W."

                  <hi rend="italic">referred to a passage in</hi>" East's Pleas of the Crown," <hi rend="italic">where a distinction appeared to be drawn between suicide and murder.</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">admitted that if the indictment were not for conspiracy he might be induced to yield to the argument advanced; but, in looking at the peculiar language of the section, the first branch of it was absolute and unqualified</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">All. persons who shall conspire to murder any person? It was only in the second branch that the word "other" occurred. With respect to the other objection, it was for the fury to say what the real nature of the conspiracy was; the evidence was sufficient to warrant a general finding, which might apply to the intent to mur<lb></lb>der a person unknown, and the sixth count charged the offence in thai form. Referring to</hi>" Hale's Pleas of the <hi rend="smallCaps">CROWN</hi>" <hi rend="italic">and</hi>" Jervis on Coroners" <hi rend="italic">as an answer to the distinction attempted to be drawn between suicide and murder, he drew attention to</hi>" Reg. v.

The other objections were on the record, and, if necessary, might be taken before a Court of Error.</hi>

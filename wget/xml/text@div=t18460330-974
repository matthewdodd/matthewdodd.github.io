                  </hi>. I live at Lambeth—my wife is a laundress—on the 4th of March, about six o'clock in the evening, I was in my kitchen, and heard my wife's voice call out, "Thieves!"—I ran out, and saw the prisoner come from a dust-yard adjoining my premises—he ran to Newport-street, where he was stopped by a gentleman named Payne—when I took hold of him, he said, "Oh, Smith, do you think I am come to rob you?"—I took him to my house, and gave him in charge—one sheet was dropped in the yard, but I did not see him drop it—I should think he was not one hundred yards from the yard when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="largeCaps">ANN DEAN.</hi> I am servant to Mrs. Smith—about six o'clock in the evening I was in the yard assisting my mistress with the linen—she called me to help her take the sheets in—I heard the peg basket rattling—I crept round slowly, and the prisoner had got one sheet rolled up—he was in the act of taking another, and rolling it up—I looked at him, and he looked at me for I suppose a minute, and then he jumped over the fence—he dropped one sheet, and the other was half-way over the fence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> If she saw me get over the pales, was it possible for me to have got three hundred yards? When Mrs. Smith came in she said, "We have lost nothing, give him a hiding, and let him go;" Mr. Smith said, "No, no, keep your fist out of his face, and take him to the station;" a policeman came, and he gave me in charge; there was nothing lost; I was never in that yard; I was walking quietly with my hands in my pocket; the man said, "I do not see anybody but you," and laid hold of me.</p>

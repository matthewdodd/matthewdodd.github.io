             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a taylor and live in Tottenham-court-road. I was at Mr. Waterhouse's house in <placeName id="t17800628-91-crimeloc465">Little Russel-street, Bloomsbury</placeName>

There were three or four hundred people there, I suppose; they were armed with bludgeons, and some had iron bars. I saw the prisoner among them.</p>
               <p>Did you see them break into Mr. Waterhouse's house? - No, I did not. I saw them pull down some of the wainscoting, when it was almost over. When I first came the mob were in the house throwing out the boards; I saw the prisoner at that time, which was between twelve and one o'clock, pulling down some of the wainscoting of Mr. Waterhouse's house.</p>
               <p>How long did you see the prisoner there? - About ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. There are two divisions; the schoolhouse and the front house, which does not join the dwelling-house, but is three or four yards from it.</p>
               <p>Is there any way from the house into the school? - I do not know; I was only past the house. I staid there about a quarter of an hour; when he went away I followed him.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner the whole time? - Not the whole time; I saw him for between ten minutes and a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing? - Not at that time; he went away with thirty or forty others to the workshop of Mr. Simmonds. He said there were sixteen taylors at work for one Simmonds, in Monmouth-street there, and he would destroy the place where they were working. The prisoner said that directly as they left Waterhouse's.</p>
               <p>Court. They were going there before he said that, were they not? - I do not know. As he came to the door he said so.</p>
               <p>The dwelling-house of Mr. Waterhouse and the school-house are separate? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do any thing in the dwelling-house? - I saw him in the school.</p>
               <p>What were the mob doing in the house at the time he was in the school? - Throwing out the wainscoting and partitions of the house.</p>
               <p>Did they appear to be the same mob which were destroying the house and the school? - I cannot say, I believe they were one mob.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes. I took notice of him in the street every time I passed by; I have seen him frequently for a year and a half; he is a barker at a shop in Monmouth-street.</p>
               <p>What is a barker? - They stand at a clothes shop door and call to the people who go by to ask them if they want to buy any thing.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the person of whom you have been speaking? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know how the prisoner came to be apprehended? - Yes, upon my information.</p>
               <p>Was the information made after the king's proclamation? - Yes, I think it was.</p>
               <p>And do you consider yourself as entitled to the reward? - No, I do not, because I do not want it; I did not do it on that account.</p>
               <p>If the prisoner is convicted and you are entitled to it shall not you claim the reward? - I shall not ask it, I will never claim it.</p>

               <p>This man was a barker in Monmouth-street, that is, one of the most publick persons there, how long was it before you took him up? - A fortnight or three weeks.</p>
               <p>Was it not quite three weeks? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280213"></xptr>How came you not to take him up sooner? - I was afraid of myself; my wife would not let me.</p>
               <p>Did the fear remain for three weeks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That is longer than it remained in any body else's mind. - I do not know that I am safe now.</p>
               <p>You never said that you made the information by the persuasion of any runner or constable that you might have fifty pounds? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not talk to any one about it? - I did talk to some persons; they said I was a fool if I did not do it.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell a gentleman that Grubb said you might have fifty pounds for taking up this man? - No; Grubb never told me so.</p>
               <p>And you say you never told any body it was by the persuasion of Grubb that you took the prisoner up? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never tell Mr. Barber so? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>What think you of this very day; did you tell him so to-day? - Yes, I believe I told him to-day it was by the persuasion of people.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him by whose persuasion? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. M'Cartney in Monmouth-street? - No, I do not indeed; I may know him, but not to be acquainted with him; I do not know where he lives.</p>
               <p>You never said it was by his persuasion? - No; I never spoke to the man in my life.</p>
               <p>The whole time you was there was a quarter of an hour? - Yes; I cannot recollect the exact time; I believe it was between twelve and one o'clock.</p>
               <p>You knew the prisoner so well you must know where to find him to take him up? - Yes, but I did not think he would stay there.</p>
               <p>Did you give him any information to go off? - No. I thought somebody else would take him up; he staid there three weeks.</p>
               <p>But you thought somebody else told him of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And yet he would not go away? - I thought he would be told of it.</p>
               <p>When he was before the magistrate do you recollect trying different coats on him to see which coat he looked most like the man in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say when he had one coat on he looked more like the man than in the other? - I did not say so; I knew him in any coat; it was the others wanted that.</p>
               <p>What coat had he on that night? - I do not know, I did not take notice; I knew the man.</p>
               <p>Had he a great coat on? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Had he any coat on? - Yes; he had a coat on.</p>
               <p>Why did not you take him up sooner? - I did not think myself safe.</p>
               <p>No more you do not you say now, how came you to be courageous all at once? - It struck my mind to take him up.</p>
               <p>But your fears still remain? - I was always afraid ever since.</p>
               <p>Court. At the justice's, though you knew the prisoner before, the other witnesses only knew him from his clothes? - I do not know how they knew him; the clothes were put on for the other witnesses to know him.</p>

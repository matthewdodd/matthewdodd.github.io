I am barman at the Zetland Arms, South Ken<lb></lb>sington—on 26th April, shortly before 5 p.m., I saw the prisoner there—he said to three men, of whom the deceased was one, "Aint you Devonshire men?"—I heard nothing remarkable in the way the deceased spoke, but he got up and knocked the prisoner down with his fist against the partition and he fell in the corner—I went out for a constable and was away about two minutes—when I returned the prisoner and one of the others (not the deceased) were scuffling in the bar—the whole of them were then put into the street—I saw one of the witnesses come with his eye cut and I shut the door and bolted it—they were all strangers to me, I did not see what took place outside.</p>

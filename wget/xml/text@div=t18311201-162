On the 3rd of November, about nine o'clock in the evening, this coat hung in the coffee-room; the prisoner came in, and called for gin and water - he had no great coat on; he sat down near the coat - I invited him nearer the fire, as it was cold, and he came; I served him: I returned to the room for a cork-screw, and found he had placed himself near the coat again - I left the room, went into the yard, and in a few minutes saw him go down the yard with the coat on his arm, leaving the house; I secured him - he went back without resistance, and finished his gin and water; I was answerable for the coat.</p>

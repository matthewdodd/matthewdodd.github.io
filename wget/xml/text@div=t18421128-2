                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Kilby, a labourer, and live on Twickenham-common. On the 2nd of Nov. the prisoner came to my house with bread—I was in the kitchen—he put the bread on the table—I had occasion to turn my back to look for my book in which I put down the bread—I could not find it at the moment—about a quarter of an hour after the pri<lb></lb>soner was gone I missed my husband's watch from the mantel-piece, which I bad seen there a very few minutes before the prisoner came in—no one but him had been—he had served me four months, <hi rend="italic">three</hi> times a week, and always behaved well.</p>

In consequence of information from the prosecutor, I went after the prisoner, and found him on the common with his basket—I told him I took him on suspicion of stealing a watch—he asked where from—I said from Mr. Kilby's—be walked with me as far as his barrow—he wanted to go across to it—I would not let him—I beckoned Kilby up—the prisoner then took the watch out of his breast pocket and offered it to Kilby—Kilby said, "Where is the chain and seals?'—he took them out from his right-hand side-pocket with the keys.</p>

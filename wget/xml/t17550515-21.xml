            . I left a room to the prisoner with these goods in it at three shillings per week.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lett the room to him?</p>
               <p>Carroine. About six months ago, to the best of my remembrance, but he knows better than I when these things were missing. I advertised them in the paper and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them?</p>
               <p>Carroine. On the 19th of March; my wife and I looked in at the key-hole of the room, and we saw the room was stripped; I went for the smith and he forced opened the door, and we missed the goods mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Carroine. He was taken up at High gate, there he owned the d - I assisted him to do the like, and that he took the things, and we found upon him a sheet made into shirts and shifts, and an apron, and the like, and his wife had on the quilt made into a petticoat; he had on a coat made out of a blanket, and another upon his son.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Make him speak out, I can't hear him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took him at Highgate?</p>
               <p>Carroine. One Randolph did, for a little guinea reward, and I paid it before the prisoner's face.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. First and foremost, all that I have to say is this; all those things I have taken, it is true: but please to ask him if they were not mine before I took them?</p>
               <p>Carroine. No, they were not his property, they were mine.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did I not change a silk gown of my wife's for three old bits of blankets? Have not you the silk gown now at your house.</p>
               <p>Carroine. There is no such thing. His wife brought a silk gown, and desired my wife to lend her half a crown upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that gown now?</p>
               <p>Carroine. It is now at my house; I keep it for him; his wife ran up fifteen or sixteen shillings upon it.</p>

            . I sell a few books about the streets, and was going to Hampstead and Highgate, in order to sell a few; at the farther end of Highgate I happened to meet the prisoner's wife and children, and knowing they were advertised, I asked her how her husband did? She said, very well. I got it out of her where to find him; she said that he lodged in a barn on the side of Finchly-common. I went to the officer of Highgate, at the Brown-bear, and told him such a man was advertised, and desired him to go with me to take him; but he would not. Then I went to St. Giles's, to the prosecutor, and told him; afterwards returned and took the prisoner as he was going towards the barn; bringing him along I met the prosecutor. The prisoner said, when I told him what I took him for, that if I would go to the barn, there was one sheet tied up in a bag, and we might have it. We brought him to Highgate, and from thence to London.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did I not say they were my own things?</p>
               <p>Randolph. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>This is nothing but spite and malice, to banish me from my family, or take my life. The prosecutor wanted me to go into divers parts of the kingdom, to shew how the roads lay to the French; I was to lead about a blind man, but to enter into the French service at the same time; and he wanted me to go to the priest about it, but I would not, and from that is the spite. This evidence of his is a ballad-finger.</p>
               <p>Q. to Randolph. What are you?</p>
               <p>Randolph. I sell books about.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you sing ballads?</p>
               <p>Randolph. I do sometimes, and I also sell pamphlets and godly books.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Have you had much intimacy with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No never.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he lodge at your house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make any proposals to him to go about the roads, as he says?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I live at St. Giles's, and sell coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you concerned in the army?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in England!</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175505150017"></xptr>Prosecutor. I came from Ireland here seventeen years ago the 4th of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been used to pay for his lodging?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He paid me when he had it; but there is fourteen or fifteen shillings owing now.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his employment?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He and his children used to go with godly books of questions and answers about the streets.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any quarrel with him?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the goods you lost worth what they are rated at in the indictment?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are not put down at a quarter of the value they cost me.</p>

I am barmaid at the Waterloo Station Refreshment Rooms—on 19th September, about eight in the evening, a bad half-crown was paid to me for two glasses of ale by a man, whom I cannot swear to—I told him it was bad—he said he was not aware of it, and gave me a sovereign—I gave him change—I smashed the half-crown, and gave it to the prisoner the next day—I am not sure whether the prisoner is the man—I am not quite sure that he is not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brass-finisher, of Windsor Terrace, Islington—on 19th September I saw the prisoner in Westminster, with a man not in custody, who passed something to him, and the prisoner went into the Waterloo Refreshment Rooms and called for something, and gave the bar-maid a half-crown—she gave it to him back, and he went away and took a ticket for Hampton Races at the booking-office—I saw no more of him till about eight o'clock at night, when he went with the other man into the refreshment rooms—I think they came out of the train—I saw something take place—I was there again the following morning, and followed them to Vauxhall Station.</p>

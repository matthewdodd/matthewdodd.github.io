On the night of the 1st of June a gentleman spoke to me—in consequence of which I went up to Angel-alley, Whitechapel, and found the prisoner rifling the prosecutor's pockets—he was lying down asleep on the. pavement in the alley—I asked the prisoner what he was doing there—he said he was going to take the old man home—a female came up, and told me in the prisoner's presence that the old man was a pensioner, and had received his pension that day—I took the prisoner to the prosecutor's lodging in Essex-street—I tried the prosecutor's pockets after he had tried them himself to see if he had got any more money—I have a box here, containing two sovereigns, which I found on the prisoner—I asked him several times if he had any money—he said "No" several times before I searched him.</p>

On the 28th of December, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140050"></xptr>was informed by one of my young men that two women had been there, and taken this box of thimbles from the counter - I had seen them safe an hour or two previous; I went out, and the two women were pointed out by one of my young men; I brought them back again, they had gone about one hundred yards - the prisoner was one of them; I told her I suspected that she had something belonging to me, she vowed she had not, and wished to be searched - I sent for an officer, and he found five thimbles in her pocket - they appeared to be mine, they were of the same size and the same pattern; she seemed very much confused, but gave no account of them.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WOODARD. I am in the prosecutor's employ; the box of thimbles were in another small box upon the counter - the prisoner took hold of the box, and drew it under her cloak; I was standing against the fire, and told the young man to tell my master.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JONES. I was sent for, and found the five thimbles loose in the prisoner's pocket - the box has not been found; there was nothing found upon the other person who was with her.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

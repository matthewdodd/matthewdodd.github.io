                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Rout. On Saturday night, the 14th of October, the two prisoners came to our shop—I was standing by the side of the counter—Harris came and spoke to me—I saw Mary Wilkins go out of the shop—I immediately went after her, and brought her back—I took her down to the end of the shop, and there told her she had got a habit-shirt belonging to me—the said, "I will swear I have not"—I said I was certain she had, and I would send for a policeman; upon which she immediately took a habit-shirt from under her shawl, and said, "I have nothing but a habit-shirt which I have purchased"—she had purchased one of Harris, and some flowers, but that was then on the counter—the policeman came, and I gave her into custody—the screamed most violently—the one she purchased was similar to this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to the prosecutor. The prisoners came in, one of them, asked for some flowers, and purchased two—after that, one asked for habit-shirts—I showed them some—Dinah chose one, then one of them asked for another of the same pattern—I turned to get one, and when I turned again, I saw Mary take hold of the habit-shirts, and turn them over in such a manner that made me suspect she had got one—she had her hands in her lap, and then placed them on the counter, and then she did not think she should have another—I made out the bill—Mary staid all this time—Dinah said she should have hers, and I made out the bill, for one habit-shirt 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and two flowers 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—she gave me a five shilling piece—I took the money to the cashier, and told Mr. Pimlett I saw Mary put something under her shawl—I had put the one I sold up in paper with the flowers—I think Mary saw that</p>

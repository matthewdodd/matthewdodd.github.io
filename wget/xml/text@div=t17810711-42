I lost all my clothes on the 18th of April: I lodged at the Thirteen Cantons, and the prisoner and I slept together. I waked about five o'clock in the morning; the prisoner was gone with all the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). I employed the runners to look for him; they could not find him. I went a voyage to Boston in Lincolnshire; I was gone five weeks. When I came back to Mr. Mitchell's house, the prisoner came in, and, seeing me, he turned back, and ran away; I ran after him, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110132"></xptr> catched him. He told me he would speak to me. I said I would not speak to him. When he was before the justice, he said he would make it up with me, and would pay me so much money every month.</p>

               <p>Have you ever found any thing of your's? - No.</p>

               <p>About half after ten o'clock in Easter week, the prisoner came into our house. The prosecutor was glad to see him, and treated him, and paid for his lodging: he had known him before. About five the next morning, the prosecutor called out, Where is Charley? and said he had been robbed.</p>

               <p>How did the prisoner get out of your house? - He went out, and left all the doors open.</p>

               <p>I went into this house: the girls he was in company with asked me to drink. About ten o'clock we went to bed: I got up about four in the morning, and went down to Deptford to my work, on board a Spanish prize.</p>

               <p>To Myers. What is Criger's christian-name? - John.</p>

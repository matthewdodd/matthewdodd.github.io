                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live in the "Sailors' Home," Wells-street, Wellclose-square—on the 2d February I was walking in some square, I do not know the name of the street—it was near the Sailors' Home—I had a watch in my breast pocket—I had been drinking a little, but I knew quite well what I was doing—I had seen the prisoner about 9 o'clock in a singing-house just before—that is what is called a "free and easy"—he was laughing at me—I left the "free and easy" about a quarter to 12, and a girl vent out on the opposite side of the room—she was with the party inside, sitting—she said to me, there is somebody outside waiting for your watch—I went out—I am quite sure my watch was safe—she then went up to the prisoner, and he said to me, "Have you got no further, mate?"—I said, "No, I have got no further"—with that the girl walked away—the prisoner said, "Follow the woman"—I said, "I do not want to"—he said, "Do you go with her"—I said, "No, I am not going with her; I do not want to"—with that to went to catch me by the arm—I said, "I do not want you, I am going</p>

I went into another public-house—I had a glass of pale brandy there—o I had only one glass—I had no beer, gin, or rum—I do not know how many glasses I had at the "free and easy;" I had a good many—I had wine and beer—I had no spirits—I cannot tell whether I had six pints of beer—I should like to tell the truth—I do not think I had—you did not want to fight me—upon my oath you did not take the watch, but you helped the man to take it—the man who knocked up against my shoulder was in the concert-room joining in the laughing at me.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in the Sailors' Home—I was with the prosecutor on the night of 2d of February—I had been at the sing-song—I saw the prisoner come up to the prosecutor—the female who was with him then left—the prisoner took hold then of the prosecutor's arm—he told the prisoner he did not want his company; but the prisoner clung to him until we came down to Wells-street, and just as we turned up Wells-street, a man was fol<lb></lb>lowing down behind—there were three or four men; the prisoner made the fourth—just as we turned up Wells-street the prisoner made a rush at White—he said, "It is rather curious"—then another man wanted to fight him—I saw the prisoner unbutton White's coat, and the other man snatch the watch and run away—I ran after him—I had before seen the man who ran away with the watch, with the prisoner—they were in the "Paddy's Goose"—that is the "free and easy."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Policeman, 133 H</hi>). About half-past 12 at night, on 2d of February, I heard a cry of "Stop thief" in Wellclose-square—I saw the prosecutor, the last witness, and the prisoner together—the prosecutor said, "I have lost my watch, policeman"—then the prisoner said, "He has gone down Ship-alley, "that is running out of Wellclose-square—the prose<lb></lb>cutor said, "This man unbuttoned my coat, and proposed for me to fight the man who ran away with my watch"—he then gave the prisoner in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> This public-house, the "Paddy's Goose," I never resorted to. I never saw the prosecutor until I met him at the end of Pearl-street, that is lower down towards the "Sailors' Home." I was talking to a female when he and the witness came by, both taking up the whole of the pavement; they seemed stupidly drunk; the prosecutor kicked over a tub of oysters. I said, "You will get into a mass;" he said, putting his hand in his pocket and pulling out 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., "Do you know where the Home is? "Yes," I said, "I am going up that way." He said, "I want to go to the 'Home;' will you have a glass of ale?" I laid, "I don't mind." We went to the next door but one, I said, "We can have a glass of ale hers, mate, if you choose to pay for one, if not, I will pay." "No," he said, "I will pay." Then we went on up to Wells street, and we turned the corner, when a man rushed out of the alley; the prosecutor was drunk, as I could see by his staggering about, and unfortunately I laid hold of his coat, but whether in so doing I opened it, I can't say. When I turned round I heard him say, "It is gone! it is gone! my watch is gone; he has taken it." I said, "Why do you not cry out?" Three of them ran down Wellclose-square. I suspected when they got to the end of the alley they could get no further. A policeman came up and asked what was the matter, the pro<lb></lb>secutor turned round directly, and gave me in charge for unbuttoning his coat When the policeman came up I was with the prosecutor. Is it likely, if I had stolen the watch, I should have stopped there; we had been run<lb></lb>ning after the man.</p>

             swron. - I am an office; on the 10th of August, I went with the last witness to the prisoner's mother's house, in a court, in Nightingal-lane; the prisoner was denied; I saw a number of women there, and they seemed confused; I suspected she was in the house; I searched, and found her concealed in a cupboards, in her mother's room, with all the things mentioned in the indictment, on her person. (They are produced and indntified by Mrs. Hart.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This woman keeps a bad house in St. Catherine's; she took me into the house, and made me go out to look for company, and I met with a man that gave me four shillings to sleep with him, and Mrs. Hart had the money; I slept with three other men that day, and in the evening she made me stand at the door, to look for compnay again, and there was a black man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180081"></xptr>offered three shillings to sleep with me, and I would not; then Mrs. Hart said, I should not be there; Mrs. dlart's girl put these things on me.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hart.) Is this true? - A. No, she robbed me of the things.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Trott.) What sort of a house is this? - A. I have made enquiry, and I believe it is, in some respects, as the girl states.</p>

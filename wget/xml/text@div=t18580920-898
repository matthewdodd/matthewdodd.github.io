                  </hi>. I am a van-boy in the service of Messrs. Chaplin &amp; Horne—I am the prisoner's van-boy—I have been so six or seven months, as long as he has been in the service—Messrs. Chaplin &amp; Horne keep their vans at Hambro'-wharf—the prisoner has two chestnut horses which he always drives, except now and then he has another horse—they are the only two chestnut horses at the wharf—my duty, of a morning is to help him</p>

               <p>clean the horses and get them out—I go to Hambro'-wharf for that purpose at 6 o'clock, and sometimes 5, and meet him at the wool-warehouses with them in the van. On 7th August I went to Hambro'-wharf as usual at ten minutes to 6, and saw the prisoner coming out with van No. 2 and the two chestnut horses—I had never known him do that before while we were at wool-work, I have when we have been going a great distance, but never when we were only going to Haydon-square—he drove up to the corner of Garlick-hill and hallooed to me—I was just coming out of a public-house—I was going to get into the van, and he said I need not go with him there, I could go and get my breakfast, and meet him at 8 o'clock at Haydon-square—he went on in the direction of Haydon-square—you can go in at one side of Haydon-square from the Minories—I went to Haydon-square at five minutes past 7, and he was not there—No. 2 van was there, but there were no horses in it—I remained there, and between 8 and 9 o'clock the prisoner brought in an empty van with his chestnut horses and told me that one of them had got a shoe off—they were rather in a sweat—I asked him where he had been, and he said, "To the London Docks after this empty van"—it is not at all usual to send down two horses to fetch an empty van—one of us would stop at the warehouse with one horse, while the other would go to the Docks with the other—the van which he fetched from the Docks was one which he had left there on the Thursday before, there being no load then—he left me between 9 and 10 o'clock, and between 10 and 11 he came back to Haydon-square—he did not remain long away, only while I was loading—he got on the van for about ten minutes and then went away—I saw him again about a quarter-past 11, and he took the van of wool away, and drove it from Brown and Eagle's premises in the square—I saw him again between 1 and 2 o'clock, having his dinner—it was not his duty to have been away during that time—I saw him again between 3 and 4 o'clock at the warehouses, and he took a load away—he told me in the afternoon to fetch a van from another part of the warehouses, and I did so—he then went away—I saw him again just before 6—he ought not to have been absent between those times.</p>

On August 7th I saw Dawson come out of the Brown Bear—the prisoner was there before I got there, harnessing one of Cordery's horses—that was not usual, but he said that Cordery and he had to be at Brown and Eagle's early that morning—his own horses were in the other stable—I believe they were harnessed, but I did not go to see—at eleven or twelve minutes before 6 o'clock I saw him take away his van with the chestnut horses—I did not see Cordery go away, but he had his horses out in the yard—I saw Cordery's boy about half-past 6—they sometimes go away without their boys—the boys are not always there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman at Chaplin and Horne's, Haydon-square—my duty is to superintend the removal and departure of vans—I received information, and missed a van-load of wool, which I had seen safe between 7 and 8 the previous night in Aldgate-yard; it was No. 90, and was covered with a London and North-Western sheet—I made enquiries, took some horses to Frederick-street, found the van by the railway-arches, and brought it back with the load complete—that is not a place where a load of wool ought to be; there are nothing but railway-arches, marine-store dealers, and stables—no orders had been issued to the prisoner, or anybody else, to my knowledge, to take that load away; he had no right to take it without special directions—the wool was worth 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the chestnut horses were always driven by the prisoner—his driving a load, with his own horses, would not excite suspicion; another person driving his horses would not excite suspicion, if it was seen that the man belonged to Chaplin &amp; Horne's also—I got there on the 7th, between 7 and 8 o'clock; the pri<lb></lb>soner was not there; it was his duty to have been there—it was not his duty to take a pair of horses to the London Docks to fetch away an empty</p>

               <p>van, without instructions, and they generally only take one horse—there was no necessity to bring up the empty van, as he had a van which he had brought from Hambro'-wharf—when I went between 7 and 8 o'clock, I saw No. 2 van there, and the boy was with it—the prisoner ought to have been there, and come to me for instructions, as the wool-partner was away—he did not come, and I did not see him till between 9 and 10—I took Rotherham to look at the horses, and he selected the two chestnut ones, which were the prisoner's; he passed lots before he came to them—Ramsone also walked through the premises with me and pointed them out—the prisoner told me about 10 o'clock that he had got a shoe off one of his horses, and asked if he should take it to our farrier or to Sheffield-yard, Minories; I said to Sheffield-yard, and he took it there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had the wool foreman been away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two or three days—Mr. Rowden, who also gives orders, is here—nobody else gives orders—there are a great number of vans—I always know what vans are at the Docks—it is important that the men should get their turn at the Docks—if the prisoner went down to the Docks for a van which had been left there all night, he should have left one horse in the van he had brought from Hambro'-wharf—that is the general custom; but sometimes the men may have done otherwise—the vans at the London Docks would be there for the purpose of loading—if a van had been loaded at the London Docks, it would have been drawn away over night—I should expect the prisoner, if he had been going down for a loaded van, to take a pair of horses, and if there was no load he would bring the van—it is not a custo<lb></lb>mary thing for the men to lend horses—they may lend a pair if a party gets stuck in the street: carmen assist one another—I have never heard of a man lending his master's horses for a job without the driver being with them—he would be dismissed for such a serious offence—I have the en<lb></lb>gaging of the men, but I did not engage the prisoner—we do not engage men without a character—George Cordery has been there several years, off and on—he is here; I have seen him outside—there are a great many more in the employ—I had not given orders about the removal of any wool that morning, nor had any one that I know—there was nobody there besides myself to give orders—there was plenty of wool to be collected—the prisoner would have his instructions for that the night before—seven or eight van-loads of wool were brought into the premises in the course of that morning—van No. 90 was there all night—these vans were there ready to be moved—they were waiting as there was more important duty to do.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman at Haydon-square—I saw to the loading of these bales of wool, No. 96, and saw it safe at 8 o'clock on Friday night; there were no horses in the van—I saw it again at 6 in the morning, and it was in the same state then—I should have to give the man who removed it a book, and he would not know, where to take it to without my directions—I gave no directions about it, but heard of the loss of it at 4 o'clock—Mr. Chaplin's name is William James; he has one partner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). I went with the officer Smith to the prisoner's house on Sunday, 8th August—I told him that we were police-officers and that he must consider himself in custody, charged with stealing a van-load of wool from a yard in Aldgate—he said, "Very well"—I said that we wished to know how he spent his time between 6 and 8 o'clock on the morning previous—he said that he went at 6 o'clock to fetch his horse and van from Hambro'-wharf, took them to Brown and Eagle's in Haydon-square, and remained there loading till half-past 8 o'clock, and then went to the London Docks to fetch an empty van—I said, "Where were your horses?" he said, "They were in the van with me the whole of the time"—he afterwards said that he should not have gone to the London Docks so soon, had he known it had been so early.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>.)I was with Bassett; I walked with the prisoner along the Kent-road, and Bassett walked with Mr. Rowden, who was behind—I said to the prisoner, "Well, you must account for your time;" he said, "I was at Brown and Eagle's till about half-past 7; I then went to the London Docks; I took the two horses to the London Docks"—I said, "What did you go there for?" he said, "A job for myself"—I said, "What was that?" he said, "I went to secure a van"—I said, "Were you sent?" he said, "Yes; we are allowed to go; when we want vans we go and fetch them on purpose to take a turn."</p>

            . I manage the business of Mr. Thomas Weaver's floor cloth manufactory, at Kensington, and live in the house; Mr. Weaver and his family does not; but he pays the rent. On the 13th of February, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180031"></xptr>seven o'clock at night, I heard a noise at the latch of the door, and sent my daughter to see who was there; she said, nobody. Two minutes after that I heard it again - I crept on one side of the shop, and saw the prisoner with the roll of cloth on his back in the shop-there was another man with him; I followed him, and secured him about ten yards from the door - He dropped it, and got away from me, but was secured again immediately. He was never out of my sight.</p>

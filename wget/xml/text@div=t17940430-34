On the 4th of January, between three and four o'clock in the morning, I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was you alarmed? - Not till I got up; I was very bad with a cold, and did not get up till between seven and eight o'clock, and my servant told me that I had been robbed; I went and looked at the back parlour, and I found these articles missing that the servant told me; the prisoner got into the door, by unhanging the asp; he knowed the way of my house very well, he worked for me some time, he left me the 28th of September; I missed the things that are mentioned in the indictment; I did not see any thing of them, I found nothing but this adze, that was taken in September last, I know my tool is lost, and many other things besides; I found my dog in his possession, and the collar took off the dog's neck, and this leather collar put on; the officer did not take him I believe for a month afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was it? - Between two and three, I was as wide awake as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be awake at that time of the night? - I had occasion to be awake, I sleep up one pair of stairs; I rose up and hallooed out to him, and he returned; this blind fell on my bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a fair view of him then? - I had a fair view of him, as much as the Element would allow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any thing away with him? - He did not take any thing either from me or out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where these things were lost which are stated in the indictment? - They were lost that very night, for when I got up in the morning I related it to my master Sharp, and we went backward and saw these things missing. I know every one of these things, being in the house, all the articles in the indictment, Mr. Sharp found the adze on him.</p>
               <p>Q. These things were all in the house the over night? - They positively were, all the articles that were missing the next morning.</p>
               <p>Court to Sharp. I did not hear you say any thing about this adze? - I did not find it that evening. I got a warrant for him for not finishing his work, so when I went to serve him with the warrant he was at work with this tool, and he made his escape from the constable and me, and got across the water. I missed a great many tools out of my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. All these things were lost in September? - No, only this adze.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you recovered any of these things that were lost that night? - No, recovered nothing only this leather, I found on my dog's neck.</p>

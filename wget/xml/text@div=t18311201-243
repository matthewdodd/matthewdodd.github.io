            . I am a Policeman. On the 23rd of October I saw the prisoner in the Strand, showing some new knives to another boy, and having seen him before in bad company, I took him; he said his father made the knives, and sent him out to sell them - he begged hard of me to go to his father with him, to convince me that what he said was true; I went with him, and as soon as he got to the house he ran up stairs as fast as he could - I heard him say, "Mother - knives - say you gave them to me;" I went up, and he then said he found them in Covent-garden-market - I took him to the watch-house, and found these seven knives on him.</p>

The prisoner has been in my service about three months - he slept in the shop, and had access to all my drawers; I had sent him on an errand about a week before he was taken, and he never returned; these are my knives - I have some others in my pocket; they correspond exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Do you swear to them by the maker's name? A. I gave an express order to a man to make these particular knives for me, and they have the stamp on them - I swear they had not been sold.</p>

               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character, one of whom stated that he would take him as an apprentice.</p>

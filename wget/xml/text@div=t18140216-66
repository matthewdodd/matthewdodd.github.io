               <p>Q. Did you lose a pair of shoes any time - A. Yes, on the 9th of February, about nine in the evening; at that time I was in the act of serving a customer; I heard the window make a great crash. I went to the door, and saw the people had gathered round the window that had been broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the window was whole before that - A. There was a bit broken out at the bottom; it would admit a finger. The window was whole otherwise than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hole large enough to draw a pair of shoes through - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before had you observed it - A. I was before it almost all the evening. We examined the shoes immediately, and found some shoes were gone from the window.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you heard this crush was there any shoes near enough that by breaking that pane of glass any person might draw them out - A. Oh, yes. There was one pair taken away, and the second pair I found on the pavement opposite of where the glass was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Then one pair had been carried away, and the other pair had dropped on the pavement - A. Yes, close under the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person near when you came out - A. I did not see them that did it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recover your shoes again - A. Yes, the next morning, between nine and ten o'clock.

I am chief cashier of the goods department of the London and South Western Railway Company—I have been fifteen years in their service, filling the office of chief cashier at Nine Elms—the prisoner was a clerk in the Nine Elms' office—it was his duty up to February last to receive the carmen's accounts—he also collected certain other debts that were outstanding, by my instructions—I do not mean by my instructions with regard to each specific sum he was to receive—the character of those debts would vary, but they would be accounts that were outstanding—in consequence of some matters which occurred in the office, I gave him verbal instructions that he was to discontinue from that time going out collecting; but there was an exception made in the case of Buck and Co. on account of their being rather difficult to deal with in working the account, and there<lb></lb>fore it was considered that it was better to remain in his hands—that was the only exception—it would be in opposition to those directions for him to obtain 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from quartermaster Smith of the Fusilier Guards; or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Frost on account of Waring—until I spoke to him on the subject of these accounts, I had not theleast idea that he had received either of them—if he had been authorized to receive them, it would have been his</p>

C. book, and I gave instructions in reference to that item—this was in the prisoner's own office, and be requested me to go out with him into the corridor, and told me it was of no use sending, for he had received the amount of the Fusilier Guards—there was no amount named—there were people in the room at the time—it was after that that be gave an account of his defalcations, and in that these two sums were put down.</p>

               <p>this account on the Wednesday, but should be sorry to swear to it; it might be on the Thursday—I swear that there is no date in the book to show when I made it up—I call it the cash balance book—this that I made out up to 13th April, was copied from the books kept by the prisoner—I have got it here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the 13th is all in the prisoner's writing—all the other days are in Ponten's writing—it is the carmen's cash-book—it contains an account of the various sums, small and large, received from the carmen only, through the pigeon-hole—this 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 8th April is not in one sum, it is the result of his additions—they are either his figures, or Ponten's—I do not add them up to see if they are correct—I take the addition that is given me as being infallibly correct—I have added them up to see if there are mistakes, and I have found occasional mistakes—I have not found errors against himself, large or small—I have found that in respect to other parties, mistakes have been made both against, and in favour of the company, but nothing like 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nothingimportant, only a few pence—I am not dealing with errors of calculation, I am dealing with additions—I admit having found mistakes on both sides, but the errors were unimportant in amount—I never recollect an instance of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the balance of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in favour of the Company, which I spoke of yesterday, may have arisen from mistakes in calculation in reference to pounds, and not to pence—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the C. C. book—this repre<lb></lb>sents the money that has been collected out of doors—it is not all in the prisoner's writing—the prisoner copies the book in his office—he has one clerk, whose name is Ponten—this entry, "April 13th," and others, appear to be the prisoner's writing—this "Legg, Exeter, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." is Ponton's—I cannot see that it was entered first 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I should be sorry to say that the shillings have been altered—I do not feel certain—this first entry of mine, "Collector, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," I got from this book—they are my figures—I made a point of adding this book up—this 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. did not attract my attention—I cannot say whether there have been erasures or corrections in the collector's book—this 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. are my figures I am sure—this book, which I have copied, commences with a balance of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had not paid close up the week before, and had got that in hand—I mean that he paid 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. less than he ought—he did not give any account of it—it was money which he ought to have paid over on the 13th, but which he retained in his possession—next week, beginning with the 15th, we commence with a balance—he then commences with a portion of the 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he had retained the week before—the balance in his hands is less—that balance has gone on from the end of last year, when he paid close up—whether he had any occasion to keep money in his hands, would depend upon circumstances, on adding up I find there is a difference, and carry the balance on to the next week; the balance is one for which he is responsible to the Company—it is not in cash, but in vouchers—he has vouchers in his possession at the end of the week, which he has to realize in amounts down the line—I eater in this book the cash that is entered in the collector's book and the carmen's—the carmen would not realize the amounts—here is entered "Vouchers, 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and "Vouchers, 556<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that represents cash, but probably he has not realized the whole of it.</p>

               <p>amount of 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know whether they were for other clerks—at the time he was suspended, I heard that he had been in the habit of giving money in that way to the clerks—there was a month between his suspension and his being taken in custody—he was at the office for the first week, going over his accounts, not with Grimsdick, but by himself—it was alter that that he furnished me with a list of his defalcations, and in that list were these two sums which he is charged with obtaining.</p>

I did not know of the prisoner going for these amounts to the Fusilier Guards—I made out the account, and handed it to Stanford for collection—I have not the slightest idea when that was, but it may have been in the beginning of April—I know it was not the latter end—that was all I heard about it at that time—I am chief clerk in the down goods' office—Stanford asked me to assist him in going through his accounts and making them up, and I assisted him for not quite three months before his suspension—I concluded on the day he was suspended—after his suspension I was appointed to take charge of his department, and I still attend to make his accounts up—I detected a great many errors—there was a mistake of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. entered 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. entered 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but which way it was I cannot say—I do not know that at that time he was trying to raise money on a bill of sale—I have heard that he had realized a bill of sale at the time—I do not fill his place now, I am in the same department, but in a very inferior position.</p>

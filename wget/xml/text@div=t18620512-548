                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mrs. Massey, a money-changer, of Leadenhall-street—on 29th April, the prisoner came to our office with two Scotch notes, purporting to be two notes of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each of the National Bank of Scotland—she held them in her hand, and said, "Will you change these?"—I looked at them, and immediately saw that they formed a portion of notes that I had had information respecting—I asked her where she got them—she said, "I brought them from Edinburgh nine months ago in a box—I said, "These notes have not been printed nine, months; how can that be?"—she said, "Indeed, I did"—I told her they were forged notes—she said, "I beg your pardon, they are good"—I said I must detain them—she said, "Well, then, you must detain me too"—I said, "A policeman will soon settle that"—she did not make any reply to that—I sent the boy for a policeman whom I saw passing the door at the time, and gave her in charge to him with the notes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to the firm of Perkins, Bacon and Co., bank-note engravers, of Fleet-street—these notes are part of a batch of 500 with the same top numbers, that were stolen from our premises—the number at the top is 176; the bottom number varies with each one—we have nothing to do with the signatures; only the printed forms—we print the forms all but the signatures, and send them to the bank—we have not sent these two to the bank—they have been missed from our premises.</p>

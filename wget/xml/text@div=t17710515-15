            . I received two bank notes, the numbers were of one 144, the other 217; I did not look much at them; they were 20 l. each. I wanted to get some gold to send into America. On the 30th of April, I took them out of my chest, and went to Mr. Drummond's to change them; they refused to change them. I offered to change them at the Crown in Bow-street. When I came near the Admiralty coffee-house, I met two soldiers; they said, Mr. Moreton, how do you do? said I, Do you know me? they said, Yes. They asked me to give them a pint; they took me down a long alley to a publick house. I stood against the table, and they stood by me; I put my hand in my pocket, and said, I have been robbed since I met you; they said, No sure Mr. Moreton, you can't be robbed, they said they would not take them away; they felt my pockets, then they bid me examine and search. I put my hands in my pocket again, and said, sure enough here are my bank notes; I put my hand in my pocket and felt them. I said, I am so glad I have got my notes again, I will give you half a gallon of beer for joy; a young man in the house wrapped them up in paper; and I put them in my right hand pocket. I paid for the beer, and we went up into the street; as soon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177105150023"></xptr> as I had got into the street, Kenney kept pretty close to me, at my right hand; there were five or six girls at the door; this all happened in half an hour; when I got into the passage I felt something kit against my thigh; I catched Kenney's hand in my pocket; I said you have got my notes again; I felt for the notes, and they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you caught his hand in your pocket, whereabouts was Hawkins?</p>
               <p>Moreton. Not far off; a little at my left hand; there were several girls at his right hand. I charged them with it; they denied it; I was a good deal confused; I leaned against the wall, and they went away. I went down again to the same house, and said, They have robbed me of my notes again. They sent out after them, and caught them again. I received the notes from Mr. Lassater; they were brought back again in a few minutes; they offered to be searched; when they got to the top of the entry I walked behind; one of the girls knocked my hat off, and another struck me in the face; then they ran away, and I saw no more of them till they were taken; they acknowledged before the justice that they had changed the notes. I think Hawkins said, he got them of his father; Kenney said he found them in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you was confused; was it with your loss or with liquor?</p>
               <p>Moreton. With my loss; it was all the money I had.</p>

            . Kenney came into my house on the thirtieth of April, and ordered a pint of hot to be made; he asked me to change him a twenty pound note; I said, How came you by it? he said, it was sent by his father out of the country to buy his discharge. I said, I was glad of it. I took it out of his hand and went to Mr. Cox, the brewer, to ask him if it was a good one; I told Kenney if he came in the morning I would change it; he came in the morning; I went up to Mr. Cox's and told him it came from a soldier.

            . I saw Mr. Moreton and the prisoners at Derry's; they came in and called for some beer; Mrs. Derry said, Let no beer be drawn for them: I said, There is a creditable man with them. Then they called for a pot, and had it. Moreton put his hand in his pocket to pay for some beer; then he said, I am robbed of forty pounds; I said, It is impossible to be robbed in this house. I asked him if he knew the prisoners; he said he knew a little of them. He said he had two twe nty pound notes. He searched his pockets and pulled out some paper. He did not pull them out then. I said, You had better look further. One of the prisoners said, Look in that pocket, perhaps you have not searched far enough; upon that he put his hand in his pocket, and pulled out the two twenty pound notes. I looked at them, and said, I think you wrap them up in a careless manner. I took down a paper, and put the notes in it; he put them in his right hand waistcoat pocket. Then they had another pot of beer. They staid about twenty minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not Mr. Moreton say he had lost one hundred pounds?</p>
               <p>Saunders. Yes; he did. I said, In what? he said, Two twenty pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman that was in company with them near Mr. Moreton?</p>
               <p>Saunders. No; they were all together, and drank together.</p>
               <p>- Derry confirmed the account given by the last witness.</p>
               <p>- Bond. I took them at Richmond. Hawkins was very quiet; Kenney very obstinate. I found eleven guineas and a half, and a six and nine-pence on one; and upon the other I found six guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask them how they came by that money they had?</p>
               <p>Bond. They were very much in liquor. Hawkins said he had the money of his father. I gave them back a guinea each, by order of the magistrate.</p>

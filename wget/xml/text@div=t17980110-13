               <p>Q. A number of other persons live in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And each has a separate room to himself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The door of the house is sometimes open, and sometimes shut? - A. Yes; I have seen it both ways, but it is generally shut after dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was the outside door shut that night? - A. I cannot swear that it was either open or shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that there is a forty pound reward if you convict this man? - A. I do not know that there is.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you never heard that there is a forty pound reward, upon conviction? - A. Yes; but I do not know for what.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that you will be entitled to a share of it, if this man is convicted? - A. I am not doing it for the sake of the reward.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you not know that you will be entitled to a share of it? - A. I do not know whether I shall or not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he give you any thing himself? - A. No; the things that she gave me, were a pair of half gaiters, a regimental book, three pepper-casters, and four tops; I took them to serjeant Gill, before he was out of bed; I gave them to him, and told them one by one; I will take my oath, that I brought but three pepper-casters up, and when the serjeant brought them before the Justice, there were four; there had been one put in after I gave them to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were in the house, and heard the bustle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If the man had been crying for mercy, you would have been in a situation to hear him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him? - A. No, I did not; I stood listening at the door ever so long, but did not hear any such word.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you must have heard it, if there had been any such thing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you desired by any body to swear there were more than three pepper casters? - A. No; the serjeant said, here is all you brought, and I said, serjeant, I brought but three casters, and here are four; and he said, well, there they are, I do not know how they came there.</p>
               <p>Q. But you swear you brought but three? - A. No more.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You said before, that when the serjeant told you he did not want you, you went up stairs immediately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not listen there? - A. Yes, I did stop some time.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Gill). Q. Did you see the four casters? - A. The handkerchief never was opened after he brought it me; I never opened it till it came to the office.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Is it true that he told them out one by one? - A. No, he did not; he put down the handkerchief, and said, there are some things that Evans's wife has sent you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. At the Magistrate's, did he put them down one by one, that is what he has sworn? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Milton. I put them down one by one in his room, and I asked him separately, if they were his, and he said, yes; there were three pepper-casters and four tops.</p>
               <p>Court. There are but three casters in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Gill). Q. Do you mean to swear they were never opened in your room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Milton. He opened the window-shutters in the front street, and I said, I have brought some things here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open the handkerchief, and shew him them one by one? - A. Yes; in his own room, upon his own trunk; he was then in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he see you do that? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he look at you when he was talking to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he must have seen you? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable belonging to the office in Queen-square, Westminster; On the 14th of December last, I was sent for to the First Regiment Hospital, to take the prisoner; I took him from there to the office; I searched him, and found a metal watch-case and part of the works, and a pair of leather gloves; I afterwards went to his apartments, No. 7, Little Canterbury-place, there I found a pair of regimental gloves, a regimental shirt, three hat feathers, and some implements of house-breaking, a saw, a large borer, and a chiffel that is broke; I tried it with the door, and it matches where he broke the door open; I suppose there are a dozen marks of a chiffel upon the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Let me look at these things, did you never see such things before? - A. Yes; a great number of houses have been broke open with such things, lately, in Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not such things to be seen in every carpenter's shop? - A. Yes; but he does not appear to have been in that line.</p>
               <p>Q. You are as ignorant, I take it, of a forty pounds reward, as the other witnesses? - A. I am wife enough to know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation about the reward to-day? - A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a single word has escaped your honest lips? - A. Not a word; I have been to get two more bills; I had not been much with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What are those bills, have they rewards belonging to them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you shall be entitled to a share of the reward? - A. I do not know that there is a share allowed yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think you will be entitled to a part of it? - A. Yes; I should look upon it so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give directions for this indictment? - A. Mr. serjeant Kirby ordered it.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you present at the time the indictment was given instructions for? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you write the instructions, now? - A.No, I did not; only our names to the back of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell the clerk of the indictments what you meant to indict for, whether for forgery, highway robbery, sheep stealing, or murder? - A. He asked what time of night it was, what was lost, and what was the value of the things, that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, you gave no instructions? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present when the corporal gave the account of the things that were lost? - A. I was backwards and forwards, but I gave no instructions.</p>
               <p>Gill. The two cases and part of a watch I can swear to; and the two first letters of my name are upon two of my shirts, and the other I know; upon one of the shirts there is a D and two eights, upon another there are two eights and a figure of four, and upon the other shirt there are two G's and three ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the memorandum book, is there any writing in it that you know it by? - A. Yes; there were a great many receipts and papers in it when I lost it, and when it came back, they were all gone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.What is the value of that book? - A. It is of great value to me; but, I suppose to any body else, it is not worth above sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. D and two eights are not your initials? - A. It is my shirt, it was given to me by my wife's brother; I have had it almost two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish that from another shirt with a D and two eights? - A. Yes, from my wearing it; and it may have some holes in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mark them yourself? - A. Yes; I did mark the other two, myself, with India-ink.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men have you in your regiment? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there no other man that may have the same mark of two G's in the regiment? - A. I do not know, there may be more.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these three shirts? - A. They may be worth, mayhap, three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how long have you had that watch-case? - A. I suppose, ten or twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a common metal case? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is no uncommon thing? - A. No, only it is broke to pieces.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You know the prisoner is a soldier? - A. Yes; he has only been in the regiment eight or nine months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if he followed any business? - A. I don't know that he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going past the end of serjeant Gill's house and found the two bundles, I went home, and had not been home an hour when serjeant Gill, and the corporal came in; they asked me how long I had been at home; I told the serjeant near an hour; he said it was a lie, for he had seen me within that time; he asked me whose hat that was; and I told him my brother's; he then collared me, and said, you villain, you have robbed me; I told him I would give him the shirts; him and the corporal took me to his house, and called a woman, who said she spoke to me, and saw me in the room; I saw no more of serjeant Gill till the next day, when he came with the officer to take me to the Police-office.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who had known him ten years, and gave him a good character.</p>

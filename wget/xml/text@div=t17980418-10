               <p>Q. Who lays in the wine? - A. I laid in that quantity; I am accountable for it, as it is drank the money is paid to me. I said to him, I have been able, at last, to find out who the thief is; I went to the guard-room, and told him he had taken a great deal more; he said it was his first offence, and that he found it at the bottom of the stairs; the constable has the wine.</p>

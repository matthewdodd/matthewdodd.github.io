I looked up my master's premises—I locked up the fowl-houses—there were eight fowls—the geese were not locked up—they were close by, round the pound—this sack was in the cow-house, which is close to the fowl-house—I came there at half-past six o'clock the next morning, and they were all gone—I examined the geese and fowls and sack which were found—they were my master's—these walking<lb></lb>sticks I know—they were standing against the cow-house door.</p>

About nine o'clock in the morning I took the shoes off Hastings at the station, and went to Mr. Willis with them—I traced foot-marks from Mr. Willis's to within three yards of where this property was found—the foot-marks corresponded with Hastings' shoes.</p>

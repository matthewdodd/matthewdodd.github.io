            . I am an officer of Bow Street Office; about one o'clock I saw Mr. Hadley come out of a house in Charles Street, Drury Lane, very much intoxicated, I said to Limbrick, I think that gentleman has been robbed, about two or three minutes afterwards, Mr. Hadley turned back again and said, I have lost my watch, and I think I have lost it at that house; the prisoner and another woman stood at the door, and as we drew towards them, the prisoner ran in the house up stairs, I followed the prisoner, told her she had robbed the man, and I must see if she had got his watch, and directly took it out of her bosom, I took her to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch, I do not recollect any thing that passed, I was excessively drunk.</p>

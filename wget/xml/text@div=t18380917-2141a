                  </hi>. I live in Melbourne-place, North Shields, and am a ship-wright. I met the prisoner on the night of the 29th of August—she asked me to go home with her—I refused—she stood talking with me a bit—she put her hand into my pocket, and took out nine sovereigns and ran away—I pursued and fell down, and she made her escape—I was tipsy—she was taken by the officer, and the money was found.</p>

I found the money on the ruins where Burns says he saw them <hi rend="italic">shuffling</hi>—I then went to a room in Providence-court, and saw the prisoner going under the bed, which gave me suspicions—I searched her, and found the crown-piece, the half-crown, three shillings, and two sixpences, in her bosom.</p>

As I was returning from my aunt's on the 29th of August, I called on an acquaintance to whose child I stood godmother—the child was unwell, and I was requested to remain—this was half-past eight o'clock in the evening—I was partly undressed, and going to bed when hearing a noise outside as if persons were quarrelling, I was stooping under the bed to get my shoes to see what was the matter, when the police<lb></lb>man came in and took me—he had a man with him, who said I was north</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to William Butcher, carpet-manufacturer, Great Marlborough-street. The prisoner was a servant there about two months, and was going to leave on the 9th of Nov.—I missed a handkerchief, and asked her if she had seen it—she said no—I missed from my box four other handkerchiefs and two collars—after looking in my box, I spoke to Miss</p>

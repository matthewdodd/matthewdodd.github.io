            . I live in Market Street, St. James's Market. I had recommended the prisoner to Mr. Mackensie, and found afterwards she was not worthy the character I had given her. She being in custody for some other offence, I went and informed the prosecutor, that if she had wrong'd him, he might know where to find her. He took out a search warrant, and got a constable. I went with them to her mother's house, where she lodged, and found the things in a box mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose box it was?</p>
               <p>M. Riley. The prisoner had the key of it in her pocket. She took up first one thing, then another, and said, this is your's, and this is your's, acknowledging them to be Mr. Mackensie's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before Mr. Fielding?</p>
               <p>M. Riley. I was.</p>

               <p>M. Riley. I do not recollect what past there.</p>

               <p>A young woman, an acquaintance of mine, sat up with me to wash and iron, and I went to lodge with her in the same house, but not in the same room. She desired she might be paid for the box before it was broke open. If I had known of these things being there, I had time enough to have made away with them, as Mrs. Riley said she would be as great an enemy to me, as she had been a friend.</p>

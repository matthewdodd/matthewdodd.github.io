               <p>Before you went home with her, was you quite sober? - I think so, I was sober enough to take care of myself, and every thing I had about me; I went out about three or four o'clock, I came home from the first house to my own house, and staid there sometime, then I went out again, desiring the man to put up the shutters, and said, I would be in instantly; I will swear I was so sober as to know what I was about when I came home, when I went to bed, I put my watch in a chair by my bedside; I had six guineas in my waistcoat pocket, four guineas and a half in gold, and a dollar, and twenty-seven shillings in money; I am sure I had this money in my pocket when I picked up this girl; I pulled off my clothes, and laid them on the bed, when I awoke in the morning, I felt with my hand about the bed, and I was surprised there was nobody there; I got up and came down stairs, I believe in my shirt, if I do not mistake; I found the door open, and the young woman gone; I lost nothing out of my shop, thank God! then I called my man who slept in the house, Tom, get up, I am ruined! and I went to Buckle-street, where she said she lived, but I could not find her; I found her afterwards, she had bought a parcel of clothes with the money that was missing.</p>

               <p>I took the prisoner between eight and nine in the morning, she was putting on this new petticoat, I put my hand in her pocket, the first thing I found was this watch (Deposed to.) then I took out this little box, with two guineas and a half in it, and two half crowns, and sixpence, and a dollar.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The guineas have no mark, the dollar is marked in two or three places, black as if it was burnt, I have had it a long time, I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Dormer. I found this new gown and stays, and a cloak, and a new shift, she had the fellow to it on, and the prosecutor's handkerchief, and a new apron and two new caps; when I took her into custody, she desired me to try, and settle it with the prosecutor, and she would return the things, she said, it was the first fault, and she would never do the like again; I did not promise her nor threaten, she said, she had laid the rest of the money out.</p>

               <p>The money was my own, I was on board a ship with a young man six weeks, and when he got his impress money and wages, he gave me some money to buy me some clothes, and he told me to bring him some things which he wanted, and the same night I came from on board of ship, I met the prosecutor, he asked me to drink, and went to the public house, and he gave me this dollar, and he promised me half a guinea; I went home with him, and he said he had no money, and he gave me his watch, I told him where I lived, and he was to come for his watch.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What did you give that girl? - No money at all.</p>
               <p>Did you ever give her your watch in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220115"></xptr> pledge? - No; I never told her I had no money, I had plenty of money.</p>
               <p>Dormer. We took her in Plow-street, not a hundred yards from Buckle-street.</p>

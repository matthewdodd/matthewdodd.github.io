                  </hi> I am the wife of Baker Smith, of 20, Gloucester Place, Park Road, Peckham—the prisoner was in my service for about three weeks—I had given her warning to leave the day before this happened—on 1st August, about four in the afternoon, I went up stair to change my dress—there was no appearance of fire then—I came down in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—the prisoner afterwards</p>

               <p>went up to dress—I think it was about five—she shrieked and ran down stairs and said something had happened—I told her not to frighten me so—she said nothing about fire—I went up stairs and found the bedroom door open and the room in flames—the bed was dropping on the floor—the two eldest children slept in that room—the bed was burnt to pieces—it was one of the usual four-post bedsteads—the fire originated in the top, as it was completely destroyed inside by the fire—there were some old newspapers kept there, and that was all, with the exception of an old bon<lb></lb>net—I saw no matches—my two eldest children were down stairs with me, and the three little boys were in the garden—only the prisoner was up stairs—I sent for the greengrocer, who helped to put the fire out—the prisoner only fetched one pail of water—I asked her why she did not assist and she said she was afraid—the windows were shut—they had been open in the morning—I would not like to swear they were open when I went up to dress—I asked the prisoner how it could happen, as no one was up stairs but she, and she said she did not know—the same evening she came and told me my daughters had accused her, and she would not put up with it, and would fetch her mother—I told her to leave the room, as I was too ill to see any one—I had told her many times I was afraid of fire.</p>

On 1st August I was called to the prosecutor's house, and saw that the curtains, and the bedding, and the bed were burnt—I opened the lid of the case over the bedsteps, and found some burnt paper and this, which I am told is used as a duster, and a part of a lucifer match lying on it—I asked the prisoner how long she had been up stairs before she discovered the fire—she said two or three minutes—I told her I was a policeman, though I was dressed in plain clothes, and asked how it was she did not discover it before—she said she did not notice it till she felt the heat, and she threw her dress over her shoulders and ran down immediately—I then asked about the duster she was using that day, and she said she took it down stairs, but did not know where she put it.</p>

"—she made no reply, and got some water—I asked her why she did not come down stairs before, and she said, "It was not likely I was coming down without putting my dress on"—I had not been in the room that day—I don't know that my sister had—we never kept matches there.</p>

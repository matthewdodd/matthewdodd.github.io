               <p>Corporal Smith thus depos'd During the Prisoner's Confinement in the Tilt-Yard I saw his Coat and Wastecoat, which seemed to be run through with a Sword, I likewise saw his Thumb bound up with a Handkerchief, but had not the Curiosity to see in what Manner it was wounded: The Prisoner was 8 Months with me in the Barracks in the Tower, and was always a quiet Fellow, and always declined and avoided Quarrels.</p>
               <p>Colonel Williamson thus depos'd. The Prisoner is the Son of an old Soldier that is now disabled, and his Father requested me to do something for his Son, I told him that I could not at present, but recommended him to Colonel Price's Regiment, but advised him to take no Bounty Money, and then when any Thing better offer'd he might the easier get a Discharge; the Prisoner is a pretty good Scholar, and understands Latin, and during his being at the Tower, which was near a Year, he behaved so well that I gave him the liberty to come into my Kitchen, and he always appeared to be a very modest Fellow; and for wearing a Sword it is a standing Order, that no Soldier shall be Seen in the Street without his Sword on, which makes me believe the Deceased might have a Sword.</p>
               <p>Some of the Evidences for the Prisoner directly contradicting what had been sworn in favour of the Deceased, the Court thought it necessary to ask the former Evidence some further Questions; upon which

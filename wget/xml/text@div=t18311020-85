            . I am a Police-officer. I was called to a house in Perkin's-rents, Orchard-street; the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge for robbing him - I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183110200038"></xptr>what money he had lost; he said a nan-sovereign, two half-crowns, and two sixpences; I found it in a concealed pocket in her stays - she said before I searched her that she had only two sixpences about her, which she had received from the prosecutor, and no other money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave me two sixpences, and I asked him to give me some halfpence - he gave me two penny pieces, as I thought; when the officer asked me I took it out, and it was two half-crowns, and there was a half-sovereign between them - I had no light; he was not sober - there was another girl with me, but she is not here.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS FOY. I was sober; a parcel of girls broke the door open, and I put them out again; I gave the prisoner only one sixpence; my money was all in one pocket there was a candle in the room.</p>
               <p>JOHN MANN. The prosecutor was sober; there was no light when I went in.</p>

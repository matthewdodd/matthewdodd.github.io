             sworn. - On the 19th of March, between four and five in the afternoon, I was passing along <placeName id="t17980418-74-crimeloc391">Little St. Martin's lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. What do you mean by forcing away? - A. He took me against my will.</p>
               <p>Q. But how against your will? - A. It was against my will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any struggle? - A. I cannot say I did make any struggle, but it was against my will to go; there was him and several others; when I came there, we went into the house, and he called for half a pint of rum; he produced the rum, and drank some of it himself, and some he gave to those people that were in company with him, there were three or four more.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they soldiers? - A. Yes. He insisted upon my paying for the rum, for which I paid one shilling; upon which I changed a seven shilling piece, out of which I had two half crowns and a shilling, besides paying a shilling for the rum. When we left that place, I meant to go about my business.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there? - A.Not longer than the liquor was drank. When I came came out, he still persisted in detaining me, and laid hold of me, and persisted in having something more to drink; upon his persisting very violently that he would have something more to drink out of the change I had received, I gave him half a crown, and the other half crown he forced out of my hand; upon that being accomplished, he insisted upon having two guineas more from me; I was very much surprised, and asked him for what; and he insinuated that I knew for what; I told him, I was at a loss to know what he meant, as I was a stranger, and unacquainted with him; then he persisted upon my going to another house, and forced me away to another house, called the Cart-and-Horses, in Little St. Martin's lane.</p>
               <p>Q.Were the other people with him all the time? - A.They were. When we came there, he forced me into a box to sit down, and called for a pen and ink and some paper; he then insisted upon my writing an order for two guineas; I told him I would not, and persisted in it; after this, he rifled my pockets of a pocket handkerchief, a pair of spectacles, and an eye-glass, a small pen-knife and a muslin handkerchief; I called out, was I to be robbed and murdered? he then knocked me down upon the bench, I was then upon my legs; after this I had occasion to go into the yard to make water, and he forced me into the necessary, and there he unbuttoned my coat and waistcoat, and turned out my pockets; still the others were with him, and in the street also; and, at the time my pockets were rifled, two or three of them stood to screen him while he was doing it. After he had ransacked my pockets and undone my clothes, he suffered me to come out; he swore he would split my scull and beat out my brains, if I did not give him two guineas. After this, I was forced back into the box from whence I came, in the room, where he told me, after being there but a short space of time, he would take my hat, my shirt and my boots, which I had on at that time. While this happened, a person whom I knew nothing of who happened to be in the room, went to Bow-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180070"></xptr>street, and gave information there, and they quickly came to my assistance, or else I no not know what would have been the consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the violence was committed upon you in the street, was there any body about? - A. It had rained a little, and there were very few people about; I was very much frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt at all? - A. I have not a doubt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What may you be? - A. I live with Mr. Packhurst, at Maidstone.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you live there now? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you his servant? - A. Yes; butler and valet. I have now lodgings in St. Martin's lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the gin-shop you speak of? - A. Somewhere in that neighbourhood, but I cannot say the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been in London before? - A. Yes, I have, at various times.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you lived in London before? - A. Six months and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live then? - A. With the present Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you a servant of the Lord-Mayor's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you discharged by him? - A. Yes. I was his Lordship's man and butler.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character from his Lordship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the 19th of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, and was pretty light? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. St. Martin's lane is a very great thoroughfare, is it not? - A. I have been so little there, that I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You pass through it every day, do not you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you pass through it that day? - A. I was going to Bloomsbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you alone? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Hall, who is an evidence here? - A. I was at St. James's, I went to see the King, and Hall made way for me to stand; and I asked him to drink some beer for his civility, and that is all I know of him, except that he was amongst these people at the time this affair happened.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said there was nobody there at all that you knew? - A. I was so flurried I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe that Hall is a soldier? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you happened to take a liking to him, and treated him? - A. It was for his civility, it was in a room with a great many people.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to a public-house with him? - A. Yes, in the public tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the Bow-street officers there? - A. I did not know who they were when they came into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with them about this business? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q.Upon your oath, has no one told you that putting in fear, and using force, would maintain an indictment for a highway robbery? - A. I do not want any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to treat this man at the gin-shop? - A. Yes; they forced me to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not a number of people in the public street at that time? - A. There might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the landlord of the liquor-shop? - A. There was a little old woman that could hardly walk.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some rum, which the prisoner paid for? - A. No; I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, when you got to the public-house, make a complaint to the mistress of the house? - A. No; but I called out, and said, was I to be robbed and murdered; there was only the woman of the house there, and another woman, which I believe was the prisoner's wife, and a man that went for the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Hall here? - A. No; he attended at Bow-street, and Sir William Addington said there was no occasion for his attendance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you meet a number of people from the gin shop to the public-house, to whom you could have told your story, and complained of what had been done to you? - A. I was so much alarmed that I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was it not in your power to have complained, and had him apprehended? - A. I could have got away from one, but not from three or four.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you not, at that time, by calling to the passengers, have extricated yourself? - A. I suppose my fright was the cause of my not doing it.</p>
               <p>Q.How many men were there altogether? - A. Three or four, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. One of them was a friend of your's, who went to Bow-street? - A. No; he was a man that came promiscuously into the tap-room while this disagreeable business was going on.</p>
               <p>Q. He was a soldier? - A. I believe he was, by his clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many where there in the public-house? - A.Four, besides the prisoner and the man who went for the officer, he took no notice, but upon hearing me cry out, was I to be robbed, he went away without anybody knowing it, for the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were five altogether? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. One of whom went for the officers, and another of them was Hall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And do you mean to say that you could not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180071"></xptr>have extricated yourself in the public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect a reward of forty pounds, now, if this man is convicted? - A. I have heard of such a thing, but I never was in any trouble.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you expect a share of that reward? - A. I have no expectation of any thing but justice.</p>

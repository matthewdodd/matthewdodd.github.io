                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 42.) I live in Brownlow-street, Drory-lane. On the 12th of December I had a person of the name of Griffiths in custody—he was drunk in Holborn—I took him to the Bow-street station—I stopped at the corner of Great Wild-street—the prisoner noticed me as we were going along—be said, "I know that man, I will lend you a hand"—in going across Drury-lane he said, "Which way are you going?"—I said, "Down Broad-court"—he then took hold of Griffiths's left arm with his right hand and put it behind him, and then I saw him take the pieces out of Griffiths's waistcoat pocket with his left hand—Griffiths said, "I know what you are about, you want to rob me"—the prisoner said, "Oh, he has not so much <hi rend="italic">blunt</hi> now as he had about an hour ago"—he lifted up his great coat and put the pieces into his pocket—I heard the sound of them—he did it quite openly, so that I could notice it—I heard three distinct pieces, one by one, drop into his pocket—I took Griffiths to the station—I did not give the prisoner in charge—I walked my to my beat with the prisoner—as we got to Lincoln's Inn-fields he said, "What do you think of that d—d wretch?—I should like to <hi rend="italic">fleece</hi> him because he wanted to charge us with robbery"—at the station-house Grif<lb></lb>fiths had pointed to me, and said, "I give that man in charge, and likewise that (pointing to the prisoner) for robbing me"—after leaving the prisoner I met Knight and told him of all the circumstances—I searched Griffiths at the station, and found on him one shilling, three sixpences, and 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you not, if you thought the man was robbing Griffiths, to mention to the inspector "This man has charged us with robbing him, but he has not been robbed, only the prisoner took some pieces out of his pocket, and put them in his own?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not think the prisoner came with that intention—when I came back, I thought two heads were better than one—I mentioned it to Knight, and he persuaded me to make a report of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waiter, out of place now. I was at the Blue Posts in Fulwood's-rents on the night of the 12th of December—I had been drinking—I have a faint recollection of being taken into custody by a policeman, but I do not know who—I had about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my left-hand waistcoat pocket—I think I left the Blue Posts about twenty minutes past three o'clock—when it was mentioned to me the next morning, that I had charged a man with robbery, I had some faint recollection of it—when Hancock handed over the money he took, he gave me one shilling, three sixpences, and eight-pence in copper—I said, "This will not do for me, I had more than double that money"—he took me across to the Inspector, and he said to me, "Do you mean to charge one of our men with robbery?"—I said, "I do not know—that is not the money I had in my pocket, that I will swear"—I have no recol<lb></lb>lection of the prisoner being about me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Inspector of the G division of police. I was on duty on the morning of the 12th of December—between three and four o'clock, the witness Griffiths was brought in by Hancock, and the prisoner, when they were trying to get his name, he was insensibly drunk—he mut<lb></lb>tered something about being robbed, and I desired Hancock to search him—he found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and then the prisoner and Han<lb></lb>cock left the place together—Hancock came back about seven o'clock, and said he wished to tell me what occurred between the prisoner and the drunken man—he said he saw the prisoner put back the man's hand, and put his left hand in his pocket, and take out his money; that he turned up his coat, and dropped three pieces into his own pocket.</p>

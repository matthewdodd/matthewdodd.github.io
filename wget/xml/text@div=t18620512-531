I am the wife of the last witness, who also keeps a tobacconist's shop, No. 47, next door to the beer shop—I always attend to the tobacconist's shop—on Thursday, 1st May, the prisoner came for half an ounce of tobacco, and gave me a shilling, and I gave him 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I put the shilling in the till for a moment till he was gone, and then took it out and examined it—there was no other shilling in the till—I found it was bad, and gave it to the policeman on the Saturday—I did not put it in the drawer again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the Tuesday evening, as I was returning home, I met three men, who asked me to go to a concert in Vauxhall-road; they said they would pay my share. We went, and stopped very late, and I drank too much, and was very ill the next morning. I went that afternoon to Notting-hill, and stopped there all the afternoon. As I was coming back, I met my brother, and stopped with him till about a quarter to 9, when I left him, and went to a house in Piccadilly to have some stout. I went home, and was in bed before the dock struck 10. On Thursday we started from home at half-past 10 to go to the Exhibition, where we remained till half-past 6 in the evening, and then my wife went home. I went to St. James's-street, and stayed there till about half-past 9. On the Friday, I went out to try and get something to do. I went up to the Edgeware-road. A man said, "I will give you half-a-crown and something to drink if you will help beat these carpets." I said, "Very well." It was about half-past 1. We stopped till nearly half-past 6, and then came back as far as Port-man-market, where I said, "I can't go any further," and we parted. He gave me the half-crown, and I bought threepenny worth of cheese with it, and received a two shilling-piece and a threepenny-piece change. I went to St. John's-wood, where I stopped about two hours and a half, and then I came back by this man's house, and, feeling rather thirsty, I went in and asked for a glass of the best ale. He drew it, and I was going to drink it when I saw him looking at something in his hand on the other side of the</p>

               <p>bar. I was going to ask him if it was a bad coin, but he came round and collared me, and gave me in custody. I have a seven years character from one of my employers, and it is not likely I should forfeit that for a two shilling piece.</p>

            . I sold the prisoner some nails; I don't know the day of the month when I sold them, but it was the beginning of March.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the beginning of March, was it a week in March?</p>
               <p>Lee. Thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. How many nails did you sell him?</p>
               <p>Lee. As many to the best of my knowledge as came to a 5 s. 3 d. and 5 s. in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Lee. In Whitecross-street, Bunhill-row. I have been an ironmonger almost 30 years.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of nails were they?</p>
               <p>Lee. I have some in my pocket out of the same bag they were out of; these are the three sorts he had of me (producing three sorts of nails); the other nails produced never a man in England can distinguish them to swear to his own work.</p>
               <p>Court. Yours seem to be thicker than the other.</p>
               <p>Lee. A whole bag of them nails are not made by one man, and so they will vary.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the nails, and see how they run in general; they appear to be considerably less to me than your's, how do you sell them, by the pound?</p>
               <p>Lee. They are not sold by the pound, they are sold by the thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they a thousand?</p>
               <p>Lee. They are dearer than when I was in the country: I came from Sturbridge: they are now sold at about 1 s. 9 d.</p>
               <p>Q. How many thousand did you sell to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Lee. About 4000; I received 5 s. 3 d. and 5 s. of him; we call them three-penny brads.</p>
               <p>Q. Three-pence a thousand?</p>
               <p>Lee. No, we give them that title.</p>
               <p>Q. Are your brads town made?</p>
               <p>Lee. No; they came out of the country; some I get from Sturbridge, and some from other places.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177304210024"></xptr>Q. How many of these nails have you by you now?</p>
               <p>Lee. I believe I have none of the inch and half brads at home now.</p>
               <p>Q. You have rot 5000 at home row if any body wanted them?</p>
               <p>Lee. No, and please your lordship; but I could help your lordship to 10000 if your lordship wanted them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner's business?</p>
               <p>Lee. He said he was a trunk-maker when I sold him my goods; he said the nails were for his own use in the making of trunks.</p>

                  </hi>. I have some land at West Bedford—previously to Saturday, 24th September, I saw the prisoner in my fields; I do not know that he had a gun then—on Saturday, 24th September, I saw him in my grounds with a gun in his hand—I should think I was about six or eight yards from him when I first saw him—I saw him on my land about 4 or 5 minutes, before I attempted to do anything with him—I did not say anything to him—as soon as he saw me he ran away, and I ran after him—I got within two or three yards of him, and he turned round and pointed the gun at me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the gun—he pointed it distinctly at me; I dropped on my knees, and be ran away again, and I ran after him and overtook him, and he turned round and presented the gun again, and I distinctly heard the hammer go down; upon that I knocked the gun on one side with my right arm, and seized him with my left; I secured the gun, and secured him, and threw him down on the ground; I brought him with me out of the field—he said he would get up and go with me, which he did till he got into the road; he then said I was choking him, and he released his handkerchief, and off he ran—I then took the gun into my own house and examined it—I went down to the Magistrate, Sir John Gibbons, and was very nearly shooting him—I examined the gun and found it was loaded—it never went out of my possession till I delivered it to the policeman; the look is one which you cannot make stand one way or the other, unless you hold it, it goes down; it will not remain on half-cock—there was a cap on the nipple when I examined it.</p>

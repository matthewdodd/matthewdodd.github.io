               <p>On Wednesday the 8th of June, I went with a search warrant to a house, <placeName id="t17960622-60-crimeloc346">No. 29, Rose-lane, in the parish of Christ-church</placeName>

               <p>Court. Q. What do you mean by edging? - A. To take the rough edge off; and here are some unedged, (producing them).</p>

               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. These blanks are for shillings? - A. Yes; I found on the table, in the same room, this blank (producing it), lying with a bit of sand paper over it, begun to be rubbed, and the sand paper was lying over it, with these three or four sixpences, which appear to be damaged, and were lying on the table; in the drawer, in the same table, I found a quantity of blank sixpences, which are in the possession of Ferris, who will produce them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the edge of the table? - A. It was rubbed, but we have the drawer here, which Mr. Ferris will produce; I found these scales in a cupboard in the same room, with these blanks in them, which are not in so finished a state as those that I produced first; and upon a table in the room where Mrs. Paget was, I found these blanks tied up in a handkerchief and in this paper, which Mrs. Appletree said was her handkerchief? these are blanks just cut out, neither the edge nor the surf of the copper taken off at all; I then had them secured; I went up stairs, and in the two pair of stairs front garret, there was a turning lathe fixed complete.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of that lathe? - A. To round the edges of metal; in that room were these two bowls with blanks, which appear the best part of them to be edged.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220077"></xptr>Q. These bowls of blanks, are they for shillings too? - A. I have no doubt, in my mind, that they are to be made into shillings with colour; in searching these blanks, I found three that bear the impression of the saint head of a shilling of King William's, (producing them).</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think these are blanks for shillings? - A. I think by the head on them, that they are for shillings.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Why do you suppose it is rather the head of a shilling than the head of a halfpenny? - A. Because I have compared halfpence with them, and have never seen any like it; in the room where the lathe was, there was a narrow weaver's loom, but nothing appeared from that, that it had been used lately; I have seen many, it was fixed in the front of the window, and the lathe at the back part against the wall, so that it had all the light of the window upon it; the loom was very dusty, it did not appear to have been used lately.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was there any kind of webb, or any thing of that sort in the loom? - A. The work had been cut out, and the hand-roll was loose, and the work too, there was silk in it, but not in that form a weaver's loom is when at work, the hand roll had been let go to cut that work that had been formerly made, but nothing appeared to have been used that day at lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether the loom and the lathe were fixed in such a manner, as to allow the persons at the opposite room to see the lathe? - A. No; they could not, on account of the loom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else that looked like the carrying on of weaving? - A. None; in the back carret, there was a vice which is used to bend any thing, a common standing vice, it stood against the edge of the back window frame; in the one pair of stairs room, that was empty, except some clean saw-dust.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of saw-dust in the coining of silver? - A. The clean saw-dust is used, if they rub them dry, because, if it was greasy, it would make them appear too black; for the halfpence, it is always oiled, but for silver it is always clean, and to keep them from scratching in the manner they would, if they were put in any thing else. I then came down stairs again, and going into this front room, I desired Mrs. Appletree to let me search a box in that room, she gave me the key, and I did search in that box; I found these, I think there are forty six finished shillings, and I scratched one, by order of the Magistrate, to shew whether the metal looked like this in the rough; in that same box, I found some farthings coloured, and these halfpence in that same box, (producing them), and in the same box a pair of blank dies for cutting out the blanks; there is no impression upon them; I then searched a cupboard in the room that we went in first, and in the bottom of that cupboard lay these two cloths(producing them); this had received some liquid of some kind, here is what I scraped off of one, Producing it); that I did in the presence of Mr. Wife; when rubbed, at the time they were apprehended, produced one of these blanks to the colour of silver; I did it by the order of the Magistrate; it was then wet, it is now dried.</p>
               <p>Q. The cloths were moist when you tried them? - A. Yes; from the person of Mrs. Appletree, I took this half-crown, (producing it), it was in her mouth; I desired her to pull it out, which she did; it is a bad half-crown; the prisoners were then secured, and I saw all these things brought out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a cutting engine? - A. Yes;(produces it), I saw it in the cellar, but left Wray and Blackiter in possession of it; they will tell you all about it; the use of it is to cut out blanks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any particular smell in the house? - A. Yes; I told the officers of it immediately; in the bottom part of the house was a smell which wherever there has been coining going on, it is like it; the windows were secured with a gimblet in one, and a piece of an iron candlestick in the other, and the door was locked.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What sort of smell is that? - A. Where any kind of aqua fortis is used, it will immediately throw such a smell that the persons going in directly may catch hold of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the hands of the men? - A. Their hands were as if they had recently been at work, very dirty, and they themselves in a heat without their hats or coats.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What kind of dirt? - A. As if they had been handling of metal; as for the women, I did not, till after we had been a long time there notice any thing about their hands; I cannot tell whether they had any thing to do any otherwise than their ordinary business; there was no kind of resistance from the men or women, and nothing but the greatest civility from all the prisoners that we could with for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask whose house it was? - A. Yes; Appletree said, that was his wife, and hoped we would leave her there; I believe he told me, he paid a guinea a month, but his landlord is here; the landlord came into the house while we were there, and wanted us to persuade Appletree to give up the key; and it was during that conversation that I think he said he gave a guinea a month for the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not another woman in the house? - A. Yes, the servant maid; she was discharged before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was any business carried forward in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220078"></xptr>this house, that you perceived? - A. None, but that loom up stairs; Mr. Appletree said before the Magistrate -</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was not examination taken in writing? - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not your examination taken in writing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The clerks were there for the purpose of taking examinations, were they not? - A. Yes; they took the examination from the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, they did not take the examination of the prisoners likewise? - A. I do not know that they do; they did not of these prisoners in writing, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was it you heard him say? - A. When I was producing the blanks and counterfeit shillings, he said, they were for whip handles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. From the appearance of the women there was nothing by which you could collect that they had been doing any thing more than the ordinary business of women about house? - A. Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Mrs. Padget, at the time you came in, was employed in dressing the child? - A. After I had been in, she had a child, and the mother had a child; I did not see any one act done by the women but going in and out.</p>
               <p>Q. Each of them had a child? - A. Yes; Mrs. Padget is mother to Mrs. Appletree.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your asking for the key of the box, Mrs. Appletree gave it you very regularly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to this loom, there had been evidently work there? - A. There was some silk in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Reynolds is a <rs id="t17960622-60-deflabel347" type="occupation">weaver</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17960622-60-defend650 t17960622-60-deflabel347"></join>, is not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the loom was placed so as to receive the front light? - A. Yes; it must be so for weaving.</p>
               <p>Q. The right way in which a loom ought to be placed for the purpose of working it? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Weavers work very often without their coats? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These blank dies are much too large for coining either a shilling or sixpence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to this stuff that you scraped off, have you the blank upon which you made that experiment? - A. No; it was kept by Mr. Wife; I do not know where it is.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know how long it keeps its colour? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. Were his hands in a condition that you would have expected from a weaver? - A. No; and his coat and hat were in the room below, where he was taken, and not up in the room where the loom was.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer: On Wednesday the 8th of June, I went to Rose-lane, with four other officers; before me not to the house we separated, Ferris and I to the back part of the house; and after we had been there seven or eight minutes, I observed two men with their sleeves up in the house, that we stood at the back of; they were in the room where the silver was; I saw one of them take up a paper parcel, as if he took it off the table; he came in sight of the window, and both of them began to put down their shirt sleeves; (produces a paper parcel with a great number of unfinished sixpences); I then said to Ferris, we are right, I dare say Armstrong has got into the house; then we got over the wall on the inside; I dare say it was nine or ten feet, and not above four or five on the outside; the back-door was open, we went in; Armstrong had the three men in custody, and this paper parcel, which I believe was the one that I saw in the hand of one of them, I can't say which, I went to the cupboard, and found these sixpences unfinished in this paper parcel; in the same cupboard where I found that paper parcel, on the left side of the fire-place, I found this, but I can't say what it is, (produces a hard white substance); I cannot say whether it is arsenic or not; and in the same room I found this blacking pot, with this blacking in it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. A common blacking-pot that they black those with? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. Do you know that blacking is used in the coining of silver? - A. Yes; to take off the brightness after it is finished; in the front room, upon the same floor, this bottle was found by Armstrong, in the presence of Mrs. Appletree and me; he gave it to me and said, he had a cold, and wished I would smell it; Mrs. Appletree immediately said, it is nothing but a small beer bottle; when I smelled it, I found it was not small beer, it was aqua fortis; to be further convinced I put some in my hand, and I called Armstrong to witness it; it is not all out of my hand yet, it comes off with the skin; (the bottle handed to the Jury.)</p>

               <p>I was in company with the rest of the officers, Armstrong and Blackiter; I went to the front door, after knocking a minute or two, the door was opened by Appletree; we went into the back room, and there were the other two men at the bar; we secured them; I then went to the cellar-door, which I opened, and went down; there was a cloth which is here, hanging before the cellar; there was a large press fixed, with a candle on each side a-light; I then turned myself round upon my left, and there I saw a cutting press fixed, which is here; there was a piece of candle and a candle stick fixed at the cutting press, but it was not a-light; I found these pieces of cecil on one side of the cutting engine, and these plates on the other; I found a great quantity of copper blanks in the cellar for half crowns,(producing them.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the cutting engine? - A. Yes; I observed the cutter in it, and compared it with some round blanks for sixpences which I found near it, and they corresponded exactly; I then went to the large press, and there was about five pair of dies by the side of the stamping press for halfpence; one pair was fixed in the press; I found a large quantity of blanks and a few halfpence struck, (producing them,) and some mis-struck heads for shillings, (producing them.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing between the dies? - A. I found a halfpence, (producing it); I compared it with the dies, and they matched exactly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The dies that you found fixed, were dies that would stamp nothing but a halfpence? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And they were exactly fixed as if they had been at work? - A. Yes; it appeared so.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you found several other dies near this press, which, from the candle, you judged had been at work, there were no dies for either shillings or sixpences? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. And that appeared to have been at work from the candle, and that sort of preparation? - A. Yes;</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you know, that a cutting engine is made use of for a variety of purposes? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. That stamping-press, where you found these dies fixed, they can take out and put in what dies they chuse? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>JANE EDGAR. My mother is laundress to Mr. Birch. On Wednesday, the 11th of April, I was at his chambers from a quarter past ten o'clock in the morning to a quarter past twelve; I then double-locked the doors, and left them quite safe - I went again, in consequence of information, about six, and found the outer door broken open, by taking off the iron plate of the door-post; there were several marks of violence on the wood work - I missed a counterpane and five sheets off the bed; they had just come from the wash, and were put there - I missed a shirt out of the drawer, a hat, and other articles, but I did not exactly know what was gone till Mr. Birch returned - I had seen all the things safe in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Does your master keep a clerk? A. He has a lad - he had not been to chambers that day; he called at out house at five o'clock, to see if there were any letters to sent to his master; he does not attend chambers when Mr. Birch is from town - his name is

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. You never saw these men about the chambers? A. No.</p>
               <p>JAMES RICHMOND FOLKARD. I am a pawnbroker, and live at Clerkenwell. On the 13th of April, about four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170020"></xptr>o'clock in the afternoon, Roberts pawned a gun in a wooden case with me for 4l.; I produce it - he was alone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. You had known Roberts some time, I believe? A.Between two and three years; he lived at the Horse and Groom, nearly opposite my house - he pawned it in his own name; I have been in the habit of taking pledges from him, which were sometimes redeemed by himself, and sometimes by others - he was ostler at the Horse and Groom, but I do not know whether he was so at that time.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CLEMENTS. I am a constable of Marlborough-street. I apprehended Roberts on Saturday, the 21st of April, in Albemarle-street, Clerkenwell, at his lodging - I went there about three o'clock in the afternoon; he was not at home; I waited till one in the morning - he then came home - I told him he must consider himself in custody, for pawning a gun at Folkard's, that he would have to account how he became possessed of it, and he might answer me how he pleased - I did not say it would he better or worse for him; he then said, that on the day he pawned it he was coming across Smithfield-market, and saw a gentleman carrying a gun and portmantean; he asked him if he should carry it for him; the gentleman allowed him to carry the gun, and afterward asked if he could pawn it; that he said he could pawn it where he was in the habit of pawning things; that the gentleman waited opposite while he went and pawned it for 4l. at Folkard's that he came out, joined the gentleman, and walked a little way with him - he gave him the 4l, and he gave him half-a-crown for his trouble; that he did not know the gentleman - he had never seen him before or since; I took him to the office; he was remanded for re-examination on Monday, the 30th, and that day, while he was locked up backwards. he said he wanted to speak to me very particularly, and I was to bring his old woman down with me - I took his wife down from the front of the office to him, at the lock-up place: he then said it was Sam Crowson who gave him the gun to pawn; in consequence of what he further said to us, his wife went with me and Goddard to a house near Canterbury-street, New-cut, Lambeth, to Crowson's, and found he had moved that morning - he was not there; I traced him to No.4, Glover's-hatch, and found him there - I told him he was charged with robbery, and we must take him into custody; he and his wife were there - they had only come in that day - there are only two rooms in the house. one up stairs and the other down; on searching a box up stairs, which was not locked, we found these stockings, and in his pocket I found three duplicates - I saw Goddard find in the upper room, a hat, which Mr. Birch afterwards identified; Crowson had claimed it as his - he said he had no other, and he would be d - d if he would walk through the streets without a hat - one of the duplicates is for a shirt, pawned at Stafford's St. John-street; the pawnbroker produced it at the office, and give it up - I brought a great many other things away out of the box; Crowson claimed some of them, and some he did not - I gave Mr. Folkard a copy of Stafford's duplicate; I have had the stockings ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are the pawnbrokers here? A. No; I went to the house in the Newcut in consequence of what Roberts and his wife said -I found three famales in the house; I do not know their names - it was not said, in my presence, that Mrs. Henson was owner of the house or furniture; I did not take the women into custody - I made them turn their pockets out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PAYNE. Q. How did you find Roberts? A. By Folkard's information; he did not tell me it was in consequence of his wife saying he had better tell the truth, that he said what he did - I found no stolen prpperty at Roberts,.</p>
               <p>HENRY GOODARD. I am a constable of Marlborough-street. I went with Clements, and waited at Roberts' till near one o'clock - I went with Clements, on the 30th of April, to a house in Glover's-hatch, New-cut: I knocked at the door - Crowson opened it; I told him a burglary had been committed that we were officers, and had come to search his place - while Clements was searching the room below, I desired Crowson to step up stairs; when we got up I asked him for his hat - he took a hat off the bed and put it on; I then took it from him, and saw the maker's name in it was as described in the Police reports; I then began to search, and in a cupboard upstairs found two crow-bars and a number of skelton keys, a phosphorus-box, and several files - I tried two of the keys to Mr. Birch's lock; they fitted it - also the key of a padlock, which Clements tried - I have had the hat ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were the women up stairs? A. They were in the room below, with Crowson - they came up after; I did not not hear the name of Henson.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he say any thing about the hat? A. He said it was his hat, that he bought it of a Jew for 8s. 6d.</p>
               <p>MR. BIRCH. This is the gun which was taken from my chambers; it is the property of Mr.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.You had worn the hat but little? A. No; I have not the slightest doubt of it - it was made specially to my own shape - I have no doubt it has been worn by another person for some weeks; I have a boy, but he does not attend my chambers while I am from town - he gives up the keys to the laundress; I was absent about six weeks - I ordered the boy to call on the laundress, to know when I was coming to town, or if there were any letters to send me - I had not lost these keys before I went out of town; I suppose they were taken at the times of the robbery - I lost nothing from the cellar; one was a key of the bin in the cellar - I returned to town on the 16th of April; I kept one key hanging up in the kitchen, and the key of the padlock in the drawer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170021"></xptr>of my bed-room - I missed the keys when I returned to town.</p>

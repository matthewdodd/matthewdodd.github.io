               <p>What were those goods? - They were different sorts of goods; two gallons of cordial wormwood; there was anniseed and peppermint; they were in two gallon casks, and one five gallon cask of geneva; there were two gallons of raspberry, and two gallons of bitters; the casks were marked; I should know my own mark; I have seen them produced at Mr. Wilmot's office by one of the men, named Armstrong; I cannot identify that they were the same casks, but they were some casks marked with the same mark that I sent out that very day; I saw them on the Tuesday following as I believe; I cannot say they were the same casks.</p>
               <p>Do you believe it? - I cannot say; because we sent out the same sort of casks, with the same sort of liquor that day.</p>

            ; I and another officer went to his lodgings in Rose-lane, Spital fields; we went up stairs, he was in bed; we took him to the office; there we secured him; then we went in further quest of some more of them; going along we received a further information against the prisoner Barker; we went to his lodgings, and he was just getting up; that was about twelve; we told him we had information against him, and we took him to Shoreditch watch-house; we then went to fetch the prisoner Mash, that we had left locked up at the office, and took him to Shoreditch watch-house; we got Harper to lock Armstrong and me in the watch-house in order that we might over-hear some conversation between the prisoners, who were in two separate cages which very near; the prisoner Barker says to Mash, who is that, you Jack.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it in the dark? - It was quite dark; there was a window, but we shut the window to, that they might not see; the prisoner Barker says to Mash, Jack, are you there, is it you; I hope you have not been a saying nothing? no, says Mash, I am not such a fool as that, they will get nothing out of me; they told me, they had got you, but I would not believe them; he said, that we had told him that somebody had seen them on the spot that night; this prisoner Barker said, sure that person could not watch us; Mash told him, mind, when you go before the Magistrate, we must deny knowing each other; and says he, do not own to nothing, for there is nothing to affect us, for you must not mind what they say; there was a great deal more discourse that I cannot recollect; then Harper came and opened the watch-house, then Armstrong and me came out, and spoke to Harper, for we had heard every thing but where the liquor was sold; and we were locked in again; then Mash says to the prisoner, d - n you, what do you think of it now? he said, I hope they have got the weeds out of the way.</p>
               <p>Court. What did they mean by weeds? - That is the goods that were stolen; Mash said, they had had time enough to get it out of the way; you have no occasion to fear nothing now.</p>
               <p>What was there between the place in which you were and the place in which the prisoners were? - A door, and there was likewise bars that looked into the place where we were; we were set down in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Could you hear distinctly what passed in the rooms where the prisoner and Mash were? - I could hear distinctly every word they said; we went and searched the house of Mr. Levy, in Frying-pan-alley, Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>How came you to search that house? - By what we told Harper when he locked us in again; he spoke to the prisoner, and said, Harper and Armstrong are gone to search such a house after the liquor; we suspected it was there; I searched the house, seeing a stone bottle, I took it up, and smelt it, and says I, here is some raspberry; there was very little liquor there; we found nothing else; then Levy was sent for; we told him, we had two such people in custody, and had heard such discourse from them that we were sure he had bought the liquor; he said, he could say nothing to it that night, he would come up to the Magistrate in the morning; this was about eight at night; accordingly on the Monday, he came up to the Magistrate; he produced one cask on the Monday morning, and I think the next he produced was on the Wednesday morning; then he brought another.</p>
               <p>Did he produce any more? - No, only the two.</p>
               <p>Did you search to know what had been in these casks? - There is one that we smelt that had bitters in it; the other had peppermint; there are the marks on the casks; the prisoners were under two or three examinations; they were locked up; the prisoner Barker wanted to come out, and said, he wanted to be admitted an evidence; we told him, we could say nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210057"></xptr>to it; there was a Magistrate there, and he must go and speak to him; accordingly we took him before the Magistrate, and he told the Magistrate he wanted to be admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Did the Magistrate consent to have him as an evidence? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Did he tell him he would not? - He told him he would not; he made him no promises; he said, he and Mash were drinking at the King's head, in Spital-fields, on the Saturday night, and Mash and the other asked him to go and do a little job with them; he asked them what? and they told him, to get into a house where they could get some liquors; he says, they all three went, and Mash and the other broke open the house, which he said was the Eagle and Child; he said, he and Mash and the other broke open the house, by breaking open the window shutter, and they got in at the window; he said, that he stood a little distance from the house, and they put out the casks at the window; he said, then each of them took their part and took them away; I think he said, there were eight casks; I cannot recollect whether he said, where he carried them; then he said, they went and drank at a public house in Shoreditch; I think it is the Star and Garter, facing Shoreditch church, till about six, and then they took the casks to Mr. Levy, and sold the liquor.</p>

               <p>Are you a pretty vigilant officer? - I try to execute every information that comes; it was out of our power to bring Levy, because he entered into recognizance before the Magistrate to surrender; we never knew that we had any power to bring him as he was out upon bail; I know his house of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210058"></xptr>abode; I saw him on Monday; he gave the prosecutor notice of the trial.</p>

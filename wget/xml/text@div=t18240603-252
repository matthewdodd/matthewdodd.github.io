            . I am a patrol of Bow-street; on the 17th of May I went to the shop, No. 84, Fleet-street - the name of</p>
               <p>"R. Carlile" is over the door. I saw the defendant, and asked him for No. 17 of</p>
               <p>"The Republican;" he handed to me a number, which I produce. I am not certain where he took it from. I asked him the price - he said sixpence, which I paid him. I am certain that this is is the number I bought of him. I marked it before I parted with possession of it - no other person was serving in the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. There was another person in the shop - A. I did not notice any other person. I was employed to buy this pamphlet by

               <p>The prisoner made a defence which lasted nearly five hours, in which he ridiculed most of the prophecies and miracles contained in the Holy Scriptures, and made the most indecent and shocking reflections upon the characters of the Prophets and Apostles.</p>

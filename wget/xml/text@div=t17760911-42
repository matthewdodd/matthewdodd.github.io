            ; we went to the turnpike the upper part of Deptford road, waiting for the smugglers that we expected with the run goods; two men that appeared to be in liquor came, one of them cried, Halloo, what are you? I said, I was tollman, that night, How many are there of you? said they; Pierson replied, what is that to you, we have nothing to do with you, go about your business? they passed on through the turnpike, and then they gave three loud whistles or halloos.</p>
               <p>Did they halloo or whistle? - What they call the war-hoop, I believe it is, and they halloo'd; then we went the road that leads towards Blackheath, expecting to meet the party coming down with the goods, a man followed us when he came up to the top of the road, one part of which leads to Lewesham, the other to Deptford; he turned to the right, and there gave two or three whistles more, that was the Lewesham road; he waited there for two or three minutes, and then returned and went up towards Blackheath; Burr, Bacon, Pierson, and I turned to the right, which leads to Lewesham, and from thence we turned round to Blackheath, and came back to the same place again; then we turned to the left to go to Deptford Lower Town; after which we came all the way up the road that leads from Greenwich to the turnpike; we waited there a little while and two men came up to the turnpike; they stood talking there about ten minutes, saying, Who are you, and how many are there of you? and such like; we told them it did not signify to them how many there were of us, we wanted nothing of them, they might go about their business; they said some rough words, I cannot recollect particularly what, and then went the space of forty or fifty yards from us; we followed and went down to <placeName id="t17760911-42-crimeloc214">Deptford Broadway</placeName>

               <p>How soon after? - When I heard him cry out O dear; I lost sight of him when he cried out, that was as he turned round the corner; he was then in the same part as I was; he went in between the posts and the houses, I was in the middle of the green on the other side of the rail, I was speaking to him at that time; he was then about twenty yards from me, I believe; I made the best of my way towards the green; they followed me, I ran under the chain; when I came to the corner two of them came and said, B - t them, here they are, just turned the corner, let's follow them: I got away, I did not see Pierson again till about two hours after; he was then going into a boat; he had many cuts in his head, his left arm was broke, and his legs much bruised; his left ear was cut in two, and he was all over blood.</p>

I passed him and went on to see if I could discover any body, but I could not; he was afterwards brought into my house; he was most terribly beat and bruised.</p>

             the removal here last Thursday.</p>
               <p>Whiting has been in custody ever since? -</p>
               <p>WHITING. I have been in custody four months.</p>
               <p>CORNE. It was the night I came in or the night after, July the 10th, that they went down to Portsmouth to take the two prisoners; Whiting declared to me, that the two prisoners never struck the man; he said that more that six times or ten times.</p>
               <p>JURY. Had you frequent discourses upon this unhappy matter? - Almost every night; strangers are brought in there of a night, and people come in and are inquisitive of what they are charged with.</p>
               <p>WHITING. I never told him any such thing, he has been bribed by George's mother; his mother came to me and offered me a guinea, and promised me 50 l. if I would say he was not concerned in it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination to Corne.</p>
               <p>What led you to Bridewell? - I was committed upon suspicion of stealing a silver tankard; the person is found out that took it; there will be no bill preferred against me.</p>
               <p>So you being a bed-fellow of this man, he used to tell you that the two prisoners were not guilty; how long ago was the first time that he told you that? - Three or four or five days after I was in there, as soon as he came back from Portsmouth.</p>
               <p>What had he been at Portsmouth for? - To apprehend or to look at these men, or something of that purpose.</p>
               <p>In order for their being apprehended? - I believe they were apprehended, in order for their being sent up here.</p>
               <p>So he told you he went down to fix upon these two men, and he did fix upon these two men, and as soon as he returned he told you that they were not guilty? - He did, that they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177609110049"></xptr> were not guilty of the murder; that they had not struck the man; the men were known by being advertised; he said, they were the men that were advertised.</p>
               <p>You understood that he had been down to Portsmouth, in order to give some satisfaction about these men for the purpose of their being brought up; and then after his return from Portsmouth, these men being brought up to take their trial, he told you in Clerkenwell Bridewell, that these two men were not guilty of the murder? - He has told me so three or four times in a week.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you what share the two men had taken in it? - He said they were not guilty of it, and he wished they might be acquitted.</p>
               <p>May-be that was all he told you, he did not tell you the particulars? - He said, that one Gipsy George was the material man.</p>
               <p>But did he tell you that these two men were of the partie? - He said they were there.</p>
               <p>What did they do there, did he tell you? - They never struck him.</p>
               <p>What did he tell you Harley and George did there? - He said they were not guilty of the murder.</p>
               <p>But curiosity leads one to ask: if you talked of this no less than four times in a week, as you said just now, the conversation therefore must last longer than merely telling you those two men were not guilty of the murder; did not he tell you the particulars how these two men came to be there? - No; I did not expect to be called upon; he said something before Justice Sherwood, that if they were acquitted, he should be in perpetual imprisonment.</p>
               <p>So he did not descend to particulars, what these men did in the business? - That they did not strike him.</p>
               <p>What did he tell you that they did? - Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Then he never mentioned their being there at all when the man was beat? - I cannot recollect every particular.</p>
               <p>What share did he say they had in this business? - He said they were there during the time the man was killed, but they did not strike him at all.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you what he had been down to Portsmouth for, or what he had said there? - He had been down to look at two men, and that they were the two men that were advertised.</p>
               <p>WHITING. I never told him any such thing; I always told him, they were the two men that were guilty of the fact.</p>
               <p>To CORNE. Did not you understand in July, that he had been here at the sessions, and had sworn, as he swears now, that

On the 6th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, in consequence of information, I found him in a public-house in the yard, where our stables are; he was rather intoxicated. I told him I had had several complaints<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070010"></xptr>of his being tipsy, and was come to discharge him. I desired him to give me up the key of the stable; he sent it to me by another man. I went there, and found a ream of brown paper in the manger, and asked how it came there; he said he had brought it from a customer, but it being late at night, he put it there instead of bringing it to the premises. I asked if there was any more paper in the stable; he said No. I got on the ladder leading into the loft, and he ran away; I did not see him till a fortnight afterwards, when he was apprehended. I owed him five days' wages, which were 1 l. I found all the property stated in the indictment concealed under the hay in the loft, and some in a box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who took care of the horse - A. He did. We had seven or eight persons in our employ, but he kept the key of the stable. He was never ordered to put goods in the stable when he came home late. I had told him that I should discharge to-morrow, which was Saturday. We dissolved partnership on the 25th of February.</p>

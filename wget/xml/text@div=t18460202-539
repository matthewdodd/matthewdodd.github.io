                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, Gillingham-street, and am clerk to Mr. John Kelk, a builder. He has works going on in King-street, St. James's-square—I had to give the plumber orders for what he wanted—his name is Watling—neither he nor the prisoner, who was in my master's employ, had any right to bring away lead, or anything else from the office without an order—on the 15th of Jan. I saw the prisoner come down from the plumber's</p>

               <p>shop at my master's—he appeared to have something in his jacket pocket—I called after him, and asked what he had got in his pocket—he said a bar of metal, which he had booked—I brought him back to the office—he threw the metal down, and begged to be forgiven, and said that the plumber had told him to take it—he had no right to take it without an order—I looked into the book, and it was not entered—it was solder.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plumber, in the employ of Mr. Kelk.

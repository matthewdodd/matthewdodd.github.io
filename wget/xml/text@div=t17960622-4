             in a coach to her lodgings, some where in Mary-le-bonne, I forget the name of the street; I had my money when I got into the coach, I felt it when I gave a shilling to the link-boy as I was getting into the coach; when we stopped at the prisoner's door, I missed it; I charged her with having my purse, and said I would drive her back to the round-house; she opened the door and jumped out; I laid hold of her by the gown, and she fell on the pavement; then the other prisoner came out of the house to her, and went back again into the house; she said I might search her, I said it was of no use to search her, I knew how the money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her hands in your pocket or about you in the coach? - A. I was hugging her in the coach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You had dined out that day? - A. I dined at Hornchurch, in Essex.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking? - A. Not more than common.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were you in liquor? - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came out of the play-house, there was a great crowd? - A. Not much crowd.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the Magistrate, I believe, you were at first a little incorrect? - A. The Magistrate was deaf, and took down my evidence wrong, I put him to rights directly.</p>
               <p>Q. In which pocket do you usually keep your purse? - A. The left hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Which side of the young woman did you sit? - A. On the left hand of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then her hand must come round you to get at the purse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a whip with you, had not she the whip in her right hand? - A. Not that I know of; I never saw my whip from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take your whip into the coach? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't remember whether it was in her right hand or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never found your purse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she desire and intreat to go into the house and be searched? - A. Yes; after the maid had gone in before her.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the coachman picked her up? - A. No, the maid picked her up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the coachman did not pick her up? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the maid servant come to her with a bonnet? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And repeatedly desired to come into the coach to her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And she followed the coach to the watch house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She had no hat or bonnet on? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you mentioned before she got out of the coach, that you had lost your money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she seem in a hurry to get out? - A. Yes; she jumped out of the coach, and fell on the pavement.</p>
               <p>Woodley's defence. My servant was never near me when I got out of the coach, till she brought my bonnet to the watch-house.</p>

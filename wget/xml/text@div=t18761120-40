                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 175). At 6.10 on Tuesday Morning, November 21st, I saw a light flashing through the cellar window of 257, Whiteclpel Road—it is a boot shop—I looked through a hole in the window and saw a glimmering light—I stood there a second or two, the flames seemed to enlarge very much, and I at once sent for the engines and fire escape, but I succeeded in putting out the fire before they arrived—after it was put out I went in—I saw an old stocking soaked in paraffin, some small portions of newspaper and some portions of a paper called "Bow Bells," also soaked in paraffin—the stocking was about half burnt—it was lying on the window sill in the cellar—the sill and window frame were burnt—that appeared to have caught fire from the burning stocking.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 257, Whitechapel Road, and am an engineer's apprentice—the house is occupied by my father, William Barrett, who-is a bootmaker—I sleep in the house—I was sleeping there last Tuesday, the 21st; I was awoke about 6.15 a.m. by a loud knocking at the door and a shout of "fire "—I went downstairs, went to the front of the house and saw that the cellar window was in flames; it appeared as if the Whole window was in flames—I went back into the house and by the time I had opened the two doors the fire was out—I called Hiron the foreman and went down into the cellar with him and the policeman—I found this stocking soaked in paraffin and these numbers of "Bow Bells"—the stocking was on the edge of a basket filled with leather, just under the window sill, it had been blazing, it appeared to have been burnt—the prisoner has been in-our service, he was discharged on Monday night, the 20th, by my father—Hiron lives in the house—I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody at the police-station, in Leman Street—he said he would not hurt a hair of my head, but that fellow Hiron he would be the death of him—Hiron had nothing to do with discharging the men, my father does that himself—no paraffin was kept in the cellar.</p>

On the—night of 21st November the prisoner came to the Leman Street station and said "I wish to give myself up for a fire "—I asked him when it was and where—he said "Mr. Barrett's boot shop in Whitechapel Road, at 6 o'clock this morning "—he said that he bought a pint of paraffin with a number of" Bow Bella," broke the window, and put the paper in alight—he said "I intended to do it last night, but I got some beer and went to sleep"—he said, he had worked eighteen years, and he was discharged last night, and the foreman, had been an enemy of his for many years—Mr. Barrett came in just after<lb></lb>wards, and when the prisoner saw him he said he would not hurt a hair of his head.</p>

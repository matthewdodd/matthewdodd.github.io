                  </hi>. I am a mariner, and live in Ratcliff-highway. I came home from Van Diemen's Land on the 26th of July—I met the prisoner in a public-house in Ratcliff-highway—we had something to drink—I went home and passed the night with her—next morning, on getting up, I missed my jacket, waistcoat, and silk handkerchief—I asked her where they had gone to—she said she had put them down stairs—I said, "Go and fetch them up"—she said, "I put them in a drawer; wait till mistress comes home, and I will get them up stairs"—I sat down and waited a long time—she stopped in the room—I said, "I have stopped long enough, go and fetch them now, I want to go home"—she went down stairs—a constable came into the room—she did not bring the things—I saw them at the station—the prisoner was in the room when the policeman came—I gave the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at night, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to fetch drink next morning—if she said I gave her nothing, it is not true.</p>

Between seven and eight o'clock on the morning of the 27th, the prisoner Bays came out of Palmer's-folly, in a direction from where the prosecutor slept, with a bundle under his arm—he went into a pawnbroker's with it—in a few minutes he came out with the same bundle under his arm—I went and asked what he had got there—he said a coat, waistcoat, and silk handkerchief, which a girl gave him to pawn—he told me who and where she was—I took him to the station, came back to No. 2, Bluegate-fields, and found Webster—I asked her if she had any lodgers in the place—she said a young man was stopping with her—I asked to see him—she said I should not go up stairs without a search war<lb></lb>rant—I said I should—I went up—she followed me—the prosecutor was sit<lb></lb>ting in his shirt smoking a cigar—he said he had lost a jacket, waistcoat, and handkerchief—Webster then asked him what she was to do for the bed money—I took them both to the station—he claimed the jacket and waistcoat—she said he had not given her a farthing—he said he had given her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when first went up she asked me if I had come about a pledge, and laughed—she did not say in the room that he had authorized her to pawn them—this was a quarter of an hour after I stopped Bays—he only went to one pawn<lb></lb>broker's</p>

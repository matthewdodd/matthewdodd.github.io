               <p>ELIZABETH HUDSON. I live at Mr. Samuel Jones'; No. 6, Canonbury-lane. On the 29th of November, about twelve o'clock in the day, I was at the second floor front window, and saw the prisoner in the front garden - he asked if I wanted to buy any black-lead pencils; I answered No, and he left the garden; I immediately came down stairs into the front parlour, and observed the window a little way open; the bottom sash was about two inches up - there was not then room for any one to get in; I had seen it about eight or nine o'clock that morning; it was then quite shut. I went from the parlour into the kitchen; the silver wine-strainer was then safe on the parlour side-board; I returned from the kitchen in about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060017"></xptr>five minutes, and found the sash thrown quite up; a chair was moved from the window, and I saw the prisoner walking from the side-board as I entered the room; I laid hold of him, till Mrs. Jones came to my assistance; she took hold of him, and before I had time to look at the side-board, she took the wine-strainer from his waistcoat pocket; I sent for a constable, and he was secured. I had not observed the window after nine o'clock; it was shut then, for I opened the shutters.</p>
               <p>MRS. JONES. I was not in the front parlour, to my knowledge, till Hudson called me up, and I saw her struggling with the prisoner, to hold him; I took hold of him by the collar, and secured him; he struggled a little, to get away, and I observed the wine-strainer under his coat, in his waistcoat pocket, and took it out - it is my husband's, and worth at least 10s. I had not opened the parlour window at all that day.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Mary, Islington. On the 29th of November I was fetched to Mr. Jones', and found the prisoner in the parlour; I searched him, and found two bundles of pencils in his coat pocket, and outside the window, on the cill, two more bundles; I asked if they belonged to him - he said they did. I found a bag in his hat; Mrs. Jones delivered me the wine-strainer, and said, in his presence, that she took it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>MRS. JONES. This is ours, and what I found on the prisoner; nobody was in the house besides me, Hudson, and a char-woman, who was in the bed-room; she came about seven o'clock, and was there till after the robbery; she was entirely occupied in the bed-room. My husband was not at home.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no Defence.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>
               <p>GUILTY. Aged 15.</p>
               <p>The Jury stated it to be their opinion that the prisoner did not open the window in the first instance. Recommended to Mercy by the Prosecutrix, on account of his good character.</p>

I am barman at the Swan, in the Old Kent Road—on 26th October last, the prisoner was there about 7 o'clock, with several men—I served him with some beer—he paid with a shilling, and I gave him the change—he then had some more liquor, and paid with another shilling—he gave me seven shillings during the evening—I put them in the till as I got them—there were only 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the till when I put the first shilling the prisoner gave me in—they were good—we take the money out of the till every two hours—I examined the till at 8 o'clock, and found the seven shillings the prisoner had given me were all bad—the prisoner was still in the house, and while I was looking at the shillings he bolted out—I am sure he was the man that came in on the 26th—I saw him two or three times between the 26th October and 2nd December—he came in once or twice—he did not pass any money then—on the 2nd December he came in and was served—he paid with a bad shilling—I jumped over the bar and caught hold of him—he said he knew nothing about it—he offered to pay a good shilling—a constable was sent for, and he was given into custody—I gave the eight coins to the head barman, and he gave them to the constable.</p>

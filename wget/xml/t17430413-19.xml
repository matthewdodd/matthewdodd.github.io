            . I put the Money into a Box last Saturday in the Afternoon, between four and five o'Clock. There was one 6 l. 15 s. Piece, two 36 s. Pieces, two Queen Anne's Guineas, one King William and Queen Mary's Guinea, and two King George's Guineas, and one Half-Guinea; it was in my Mistress's (Mrs Bates's) House, and was her Money, but I cannot say the Prisoners took it. The Linnen, &amp;c. was taken out of a Trunk, but I do not know any thing of their taking it. - I do not know whether the Trunk was there between four and five that Afternoon. - It is about a Fortnight since I opened it. About three or four of the Clock on Sunday Morning, we had Notice given by the Watch, that the Door of the House was open, and we found that the Prisoners, who lived in the House, were gone, and, upon a Search, the Money and the Linnen were missing -

About Nine o'Clock on Sunday Morning, Mrs Bates sent to let me know, that she was robbed by one of my Servants, (she is a Bed-ridden Woman and cannot stir) and that my Servant lay with her Apprentice, and that they were both gone; I bid her be easy, and said, I did not fear but I should lay hold of them presently, and about Twelve o'Clock on Sunday, I found them drunk and in Bed, at the Bull, at Tottenham-high-Cross; when I charged them with the Fact, they fell into a Flood of Tears, and said, they were sorry for what they had done; like those unhappy People who are detected; I desired them to make Satisfaction to this Woman, upon which they readily gave me a Pocket, in which was one five Moidore Piece, one 36 s. Piece, 2 Guineas, and 41 Shillings in Silver; I asked them, Whether that was all; they said, Yes, there is all: Said I, Mrs Bates says you have taken more; they said, there was no more: Said I, Be ingennous, do do not conceal any Thing, it will be the worse for you if you do: They said, there was no more Money; I asked for the Linnen, and they said it was given to a Woman to wash; I went to the Woman for it, and she delivered it; it was in a miserable nasty Pickle; it is not fit to be seen in Court; said I, You took it away clean, how came it in this Condition? They said, they had the Misfortune to let it fall in a Ditch; I asked them, how they came at the Money; Ellard said, she did not know how Cannon came by it; and that she brought it to her. I have known Ellard a great while, and did not think but that she had been very honest.</p>

Mr Sanders came to me on Sunday, and told me of a Robbery that was committed on a poor old Woman of his Acquaintance, and desired I would go along with him to endeavour to find out the Thieves; I went with him to the Sign of the Black-Bull, at Tottenham-high-Cross; we made what Haste we could for Fear they should be gone; and when we came there, made what Haste we could up Stairs, and found them both in Bed, and desired they would return the Money which they had taken from Mrs Bates, and without any Hesitation at all they returned the Money, as related by the former Witness; I was with them several Times afterwards, and they did not deny it: I asked the little one (Cannon) how it came into her Head; she said, It came into her Head as it did into other People's Heads, and that she had a Design to do it some Time before she committed the Fact.</p>
               <p>Cannon had no Witnesses, and Ellard said, she had none but her Master Sanders, who said, he never knew any Thing amiss of her before. <rs id="t17430413-19-verdict123" type="verdictDescription">

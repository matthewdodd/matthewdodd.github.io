               <p>Q. On the 5th of July last, were you in Whitechapel with any cattle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way were you going? - A. To Rumford.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-35-person424">A. </persName>
            About ten o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of bullocks had you under your care? - A. I had sixteen.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at Whitechapel, did you see the prisoner at the bar? - A. No; I did not see him then.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him? - A. Just by the London Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do? - A. He went into the drove, took one out, and took it down Duckingpond-lane with his hand upon the rump of the beast, and a knife in his other hand; after that, he came into the drove again.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the beast he took out? - A. That bullock returned into the drove again after some time; he then said to some of his companions, draw your chives, that is, knives.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of companions had he? - 
               <persName id="t18020714-35-person425">A. </persName>
            Twenty, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of them draw their knives? - A. Yes; I saw three or four knives drawn; I cannot tell exactly the number.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he drive the second bullock? - A. It was the same bullock again; he drove it towards Whitechapel; I sent my dog after it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner do when he got a second bullock from the drove? - A. He followed it some rods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you raise any alarm? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, did any persons come to your assistance? - A. A great number.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and they pursue him? - A. I did, myself.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came hear him, what did he say to you? - A. He made a stop, and then made three stabs at my left breast with a clasp knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the knife penetrate it? - A. No; I felt my breast painful three or four days after; he then took to his heels, and before I could recover, he got a few yards from me; then I went after him, and called, stop thief, and when he found he was near being taken, he sat down on the but end of a tray with his knife out; he then said, the first b-r that comes in the way, I will let his b-y intrails out; upon that, some gentleman threw a brick-bat at him, struck him on the side of the head, and knocked him down, and then I seized him, and took him away to the Police-office.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards recover your bullock? -One Mr. Young did for me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. These bullocks belonged to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On that day you were driving them from Smithfield? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not observe the prisoner in Smithfield? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in the habit of coming into Smithfield frequently? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a very wanton, but I believe a very common thing, for people of the description of the prisoner to drive bullocks out of the drove for amusement? - A. Yes, they do; I don't know what they mean by it.</p>

               <p>Q. The first bullock returned to your drove? - A. Yes; and it was the same bullock that he took out again.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner did not continue to pursue the bullock? - A. No; they all dispersed.</p>
               <p>Q. The bullock has been returned to you again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in the middle of the day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Coming down Whitechapel-road, Mr. Harper said to some of the chaps, he would treat them with half a pint of gin, because the beasts belonged to a very good master; he knows very well it was not taken with intent to steal it.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Harper.) Q. Do you know who this man is? - A. No; he goes by the name of Belcher, being a resolute man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what way of life he is in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see him before? - A. Not to my knowledge; I have heard a great deal of talk of him. <rs id="t18020714-35-verdict190" type="verdictDescription">

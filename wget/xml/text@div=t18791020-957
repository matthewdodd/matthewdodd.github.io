                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Horsham Division of the West Sussex Constabulary—I was at the Horsham police station on the morning of 6th September—Matthews brought the prisoner there about 2 a.m., and said "This man has confessed to a murder"—the prisoner made no reply—I ordered him to be locked up—about 8 o'clock that morning I visited him in his cell—I said "What is your name?"—he said "Jonathan Geydon"—I said "Spell it?"—he said "G-e-y-d-e-n"—I said "How old are you?"—he said "Somewhere about 50"—I said "Where do you come from?"—he said "Walthamstow, Essex"—I said "I am going to ask you a question, you need not answer me unless you like, but whatever you say I shall use in evidence against you"—I then said "Early this morning you have confessed to one of my constables having murdered a woman at Chingford; do you still adhere to that statement, as it is a most serious charge?"—he said "Yes, it is quite true what I have told your con<lb></lb>stable; I murdered a woman at Mr. Small's house, on a Sunday morning, when Mr. and Mrs. Small had gone to church. I left the place and I have not been back since"—I then communicated with the police in whose district Chingford is, and about 6 o'clock that evening Inspector Todman arrived—he saw the prisoner in my office in my presence—I said to Inspector Todman "This is the man who has charged himself with having committed a murder at Chingford"—I saw that the prisoner was going to say something, and I said "I caution you that whatever you say will be used in evidence against you"—the prisoner then made a statement which Inspector Todman took down in. writing from the prisoner's lips—Todman sat down at my desk and wrote as the prisoner uttered the statement—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the statement that Todman wrote down—after taking it Todman read it over to him—the prisoner said it was quite true, and Todman and I signed it—that was all that passed—the prisoner was then removed—he was handed over to Todman that same evening—in passing from the police station to the railway station the prisoner said "I have been out to</p>

Chelmsford Gaol to him; he did not say "Were you ever in Chelmsford Gaol?"—nothing of the kind—I have no doubt that he spelt his name "Geyden"—I stated so before the Magistrate.</p>

I was in Chelmsford Gaol for 18 months for horse stealing, and com<lb></lb>mitted the murder directly after coming out.")

I am a retired farmer, living at Chingford Hatch—in the year 1857 I was living at the foot of Friday Hill, Chingford—I left it 12 or 13 years ago, but I still live within a few hundred yards of the place—my wife's sister, Mary White, a single woman, lived with us for 20 year or more prior to her death, in June, 1857—she was 70 years of age—I remember on Sunday, 21st June, 1857, going to church with my wife; we left home about 10.30, leaving Miss White alone at the farm—she then appeared to be in good health and good spirits—she had a mark on her right eye, occasioned by a knock against a door some days before—I was sent for out of church about 12.30, before the service had finished—the church is about a mile from my farm—when I got home I found Mrs. Sapsford there and my niece, who had arrived from London while I was at church—she is now in Australia or New Zealand—I did not see my sister's body, nor did my wife—I first saw this knife at the Coroner's inquest that was held on the body of my sister-in-law shortly afterwards—I had never seen it before—I gave evidence before the Coroner—after I returned home on the Sunday I went upstairs into the deceased's room—most every drawer in the house was pulled open and ransacked—there had been a silver watch and silver guard chain of mine in the deceased's room—I had given it to her on the Saturday night when she went to bed—that has never been found—I also missed two gold rings, a pearl brooch, a jewel box, a whole suit of clothes, and various other articles—I quite forget whether I found upstairs a screwdriver, a hammer, and a bunch of old keys; I don't remember that; I might have done—I knew a man named Jonathan Geydon—his father was a small farmer in our parish—I had lost sight of him for something like two years before the murder—he was living in our parish—immediately after the dis<lb></lb>covery of the murder the woods were searched and the neighbourhood scoured for Jonathan Geydon; all the country round was searched—before the two years he had been in the habit of coming to my farm at different times, when he was a lad; he used to come backwards and" forwards to the farm, and had done so for some years—the first time I saw him after the murder was on Sunday, September 7, this year, at the Woodford Police-station—I saw 10 or a dozen men there together, about 3 or 4 in the after<lb></lb>noon—they stood in a row, and I picked out Jonathan Geydon—I see him now in the dock; he is Jonathan Geydon, the same that I had known prior to June, 1857—he is the man for whom I searched; the same Jonathan Geydon I have been speaking of.</p>

I knew the deceased, Miss White, and remember her death. On Sunday, June 21st, 22 years ago, I accompanied police constable Holden to Mr. Small's house about 12 o'clock. We went in at the back door, and saw the dead body of Miss White lying in the kitchen—I saw her throat had been cut. There was a quantity of blood against the sink covered over with a bit of mat. That was on the other side of the kitchen from where the body lay. The house appeared pulled about. I remember seeing Mrs. Sapsford find a knife in a bowl of water in the sink; she handed it to ma I showed the knife to Mr. Small in the others' presence, nobody claimed it I gave it directly afterwards to police constable Trivett I identified the knife produced before the Coroner as the knife I handed to Trivett.

I am now a letter-carrier at Enfield Highway—in 1857 I was a metropolitan police constable stationed at Chingford—I remember on Sunday, 21st June, 1857, being called to Mr. Small's house—I there saw the body of Miss White lying in the kitchen—I knew her personally some years before—I took hold of her hand and found it was cold, and I noticed that her throat was cut both ways—she was dead—I examined the house in the presence of Charles Turner; every place upstairs was ransacked—I went to Waltham Abbey and fetched Sergeant Lock; before going for Lock I saw a knife in Turner's hand similar to this—I apprehended Jonathan Geydon in 1855 for horse stealing—the prisoner is the man—I took him into custody, and kept him in my custody at the police-station at Waltham; I left him at the police-station and took him to Ilford on remand—I saw him when he was before the Magistrate on remand—he was committed for trial, and was tried at this Court and received eighteen months' imprison<lb></lb>ment—I was present at the trial, he pleaded guilty—I was present when he was sentenced in December, 1855—on 16th September this year I was at the police-station at Waltham Abbey, I there saw six or seven persons standing together, and I picked out the prisoner as being Jonathan Geydon—I have no doubt whatever about it; he is the same man I had in custody for horse-stealing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I never heard him spell his name, but that was the name he used to go by; all the family have—I never saw him write his name; I believe he can write and read—I say his name is Geyden from the sound—when I went to the police-station to see this man I had heard that a Jonathan Geydon had given himself up; I did not believe it—there were six or seven people at the station with him, I will not be sure which.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Deputy Governor of Springfield Gaol, Chelmsford—I have held that office since 1853—I had a man named Jonathan Geydon in custody there, he was brought to us on 24th December 1855—he remained in our custody there until 16th June 1857; he was there on a charge of horse stealing—he was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment with hard labour—I can't say that I saw him from day to day, sometimes I would see him every day, sometimes only two or three times a week—I saw him a great many times during the 18 months—he was employed as a shoemaker under a warder named James who is since dead—I think Geydon knew a good deal of shoemaking before he came there; he was employed at shoemaking—I saw the prisoner at Waltham Abbey in September, when he was there for re-examination—he was so altered that I had hesitation in swearing to him being the same man, although when I saw him walking to the station I recognised him by his walk, more than by his face; his face was very much altered, very much changed—he had a sort of waddling walk—to the best of my recollection he had not any moustache when he' was in the gaol, and I don't think much beard. Q. Have you formed any belief about him now? A. Well, it is hardly fair to say, because I have heard so much now; I have had nothing to shake my opinion that he is Jonathan Geydon—I produce a leaf out of the prison book containing a description of Jonathan Geydon—I tore it out for convenience, but it was in the regular book—I enter the prisoner from the warrant, then the book is taken into the gaol and he is described by another officer; I don't describe a prisoner, I never do—this entry is John Clark's, who is here—this purports to be signed by the prisoner; it is our usual custom for a prisoner who can write to sign his name—I did not see Jonathan Geydon sign it—I remember this knife being brought to the gaol and shown to the warder James; it is an ordinary pocket knife—it was identified in my presence as being shown to James.</p>

Geyden." Q. Do you see that man, Jonathan Geydon, here to-day, the same man that signed the book?—A. No, I am not certain, I cant say; I have seen him for the purpose of identifying him—there was no other Jonathan Geydon in the prison for 18 months for horse stealing to my knowledge—I saw the prisoner this morning, and I see him now—I certainly thought in my own mind that he was the man, but I don't feel confident, and should not like to swear it—I believe he is the man, as far as I can judge he is the man.</p>

I am now a gardener at Grosvenor Rise, Walthamstow—in 1857 I was a constable in the Metropolitan Police Force, stationed at Walthamstow—I remember the death of Miss White on Sunday, 21st June that year—on that morning I was on duty in plain clothes at Church Hill, Walthamstow, about 8 or a little before—I knew Jonathan Geydon well for about 15 years—I had him in my custody twice—I saw him that morning</p>

               <p>at Church Hill; he passed me—he nodded to me, and I nodded to him—he was then going in the direction of the New Road, Woodford; that would take him direct to Mr. Small's house, which was about two miles and a half from where I saw him—he had on a kind of a white frock-coat with little blue stripes, a dark cap with a peak to it, and black or dark cloth trousers—later that same day I heard of the murder—it was out of my district, but I was sent specially to inquire into the matter—I searched about to try and find Jonathan Geydon—I communicated with the other police, and we were all at work trying to find him—some of the detectives from Scotland Yard were with me—I was engaged for about 12 months in the affair—I next saw Jonathan Geydon on Tuesday, 16th September, in the present year—I got into a train from London at Hackney Downs Station to go to Waltham Abbey, about 9.30 a.m., and in one of the carriages I recognised Jonathan Geydon—the prisoner is the man, and no other—he is the very Jonathan Geydon that I saw on 21st June, 1857; I have not the slightest doubt about him—when I got into the railway carriage my attention was not called to him at all; I was not aware he was there—a man named Quinney was in charge of him—I had seen him once before; I knew he was a police-officer stationed at Woodford—I did not notice whether the prisoner was handcuffed or no.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener living at Woodford—I remember the murder of Miss White at Chingford; I was living at Chingford at the time—on that Sunday morning, 21st June, 1857, about 10.30,1 was on the footbridge over the Ching Brook, about 50 yards from Mr. Small'i house, and saw a man coming from the direction of Woodford Cross—thai man was Jonathan Geydon—he went straight over the little bridge tip towards Mr. Small's house—I lost sight of him when he left Mr. Small's gate—he went to the back gate of Mr. Small's house, and there I lost sight of him—I next saw that man at Woodford Police-station on Sunday, September 7th, this year—I see him now, it is the prisoner—I had worked with him finishing a stack of hay—I identify him by his features and the turn of his eye—when I saw him at the Woodford Police-station he was amongst others, I should think there might be 10—I picked him out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was two years before the 21st June that I had worked with him at the haystack—I did not speak to him on the morning of the 21st June—he passed me within 7 or 8 yards I should think, not in the road, he passed over the bridge—I saw him go to the gate of Mr. Small's premises; there are three gates to Mr. Small's premises all together; the one I saw him go to was the middle gate that goes to the cow yard—I said before the Magistrate "He went to the gate of the field adjoining Mr. Small's premises"—I mean one of Mr. Small's gates—he did not go in at the gate, he turned on to the opposite side of the road—I was sent for by the police to go to the Woodford station—I did not know that a man had given himself up, and said that he was Jonathan Geydon; I did not know that any man had given himself up; I did not know that it had anything to do with the Chingford murder; I did not know what I was going for; it was about 3.30 on the Sunday afternoon—I did not ask what I was going to the police station for, and I did not know, I had no idea till I got there; I then knew it by others; I did not see him when other people did; a lot had gone in to see him, but I did not see him at that time—before I went in to see him I heard what I was there for; I heard that a man had given himself up, and that he had said he was Jonathan Geydon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of Her Majesty's Gaol of Newgate, and have been so for nearly 25 years—I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons—during the adjournment of the Court to-day I have examined the prisoner with a view to see whether he is ruptured on the left side—I found no rupture—it is possible that he may have been ruptured 24 years ago and there be no trace of the rapture now; it would depend upon whether the rupture was a bad one or not, and how it was treated; not only as to the size, but whether or no it was treated with care and attention—if treated with care and attention the rupture might be cured—there are two very undefined marks on the left arm, low down—I think they are vaccination marks; they are unusually low down for vaccination marks—I saw no marks of smallpox.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I say it is possible he might have been ruptured 24 years ago, whether it is probable would depend upon the extent of the rupture, whether it was taken in its incipient stage and properly treated—in a man of the class such as Jonathan Geydon has been described I should not think a rupture would be likely to disappear, because in all probability it would not receive the attention and care which would be given to a person in such a position in life—he would no doubt receive every attention in the prison; he would have a truss, and everything would be done to remedy the mischief, it would depend entirely on circumstances; a year would be sufficient to effect a cure; if the rupture was entirely kept of adhesion of the parte might take place, and effect a cure; that is if treated, certainly not, if not treated, because it would increase from day to day—unless he was actually treated for it it would certainly be most improbable that he should be cured in a year—I did not find anything in the prisoner to account for his being lame—his knee joints are perfect—there is nothing to indicate that he has been lame for many years—I do not discover that he is lame—he walks with a degree of stiffness, but not with any lameness certainly, not with any limp or inequality of motion—there is no stiffness in the knee joints at all, I examined them carefully—he came in in a wretched con<lb></lb>dition of health—I could not form any opinion of his age except from what he tells me—I should think he was between 50 and 60; that is my impression.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I think it is difficult to form an accurate opinion as to a man's age from merely seeing him—it depends very much on his previous life—a rupture might cause some degree of lameness, if it was a large one, and down—rheumatism and many things produce lameness, from which a man may perfectly recover.</p>

There is a stiffness in his walk; he does not walk with agility, freedom, or elasticity—with proper care and treatment from an ex<lb></lb>perienced person even a bad rupture might be altogether cured—the rule is, when they are largely developed they are not cured, except by operative methods—persons very often neglect their truas—I think with proper care, supposing it is constantly continued, a rapture may be cured.</p>

Some of the questions I put to the prisoner were about what had occurred in India—I asked him what year he joined us and where—he said in 1858 at Allahabad—we were at Allahabad in 1858—he did not say what time in 1858—I simply confined myself to the question what year he joined us and where—if he joined us at Allahabad in 1858 I conclude that he would have enlisted in England and come out—I asked him when we left Allahabad—he said in 1859; that was right—I asked him how we came down the country, by road or by rail, or was there anything peculiar about it that he could remember—he said we marched the distance down; that was correct; it was a long march, about 600 miles—I asked him then about his knowledge of the officers and non-commissioned officers in the regiment, and he answered the names of several that I knew to be correct—I asked him the name of his colour-sergeant and he told me Lefevre; that was correct—I asked him the name of the captain and he gave it correctly—I was about 10 minutes conversing with him—the questions I asked were all about the regiment, I had nothing else to test him about—at the time of the Indian Mutiny there was a great pressure for recruits—when a man enlists he signs an attesta<lb></lb>tion paper, in which he is asked questions about himself, where he was born and so on—he is taken before a Magistrate to be enlisted—those papers are kept as records—the recruits would be drilled here and stmt out when fit to go into active service—if a man were found in India willing to serve, he would only be taken under special authority from the general officer commanding the district—the rule is to recruit where the depdt is; if we found a man in India capable and willing to join, we should not be glad to take him; we would rather have a man drilled in England and sent out fit for service—we have them drilled in India.</p>

I am a pensioner in the army, and am employed as a clerk at the Soldiers' Daughters' Home—I left the army in January, 1875—I was in the 1st Battalion of the 5th Fusiliers from 1854 to 1875—during part of that time there was a Charles Wilson in my company, No. 10: I was posted to No. 10 at Portsmouth in 1861 from another company—I knew Charles Wilson thoroughly—I remember his deserting at Woolwich;</p>

               <p>I can't exactly remember the date; I see the prisoner, and recognise him well as Charles Wilson, the same man who was in my company for some years—I never noticed any limp on him; he was a very quiet man, rather a retired and reserved sort of man, not quarrelsome in the slightest; I do not remember his getting into any trouble while he was there.</p>

"Protestant"—'Age, 49"—"Marks on his person," "on the right thumb he has an anchor, faint, in Indian ink, and on the left arm a crucifix, and he has rather a large scar on the centre of his breast, about the size of a walnut"—that was all the account he gave of himself—he did not sign it—I have no signature of his in the gaol—he has not written from the gaol—he told me he had no one to write to, no friends at all—he has greatly improved in his appearance since he has been with us—as far as I know he has not written to anybody—the High Sheriff of Essex has been kind enough to send a solicitor to do the best he can for him; that is Mr. Gepp—I have not heard of the name of Charles Wilson till this afternoon.</p>

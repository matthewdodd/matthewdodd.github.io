                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph William Bunbury, a licensed victualler, of Great Tower-street—I know the prisoners—they were at my house last Tuesday week, 29th March, between 9 and 10 o'clock, as near as I can guess—they were in a side bar, in a small box, by themselves—Bone called for a pot of porter—the little girl served them, and took the money—I was just inside the bar parlour at that time, and I saw Holmes get up on the shelf over the bar, and take 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver off a shelf—he dropped some of it as he was getting away—1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on the floor afterwards—he got down into the side box, and ran out into the street—I asked Bone twice</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186404110053"></xptr>
               <p>to stop him, and be would not do so—he stood and looked at him—Holmes must have had assistance to get where he did—he could not hare got up without help—they were both close together—Bone was in such a situation that he could have helped Holmes up, no one else could—there was not a soul there but Bone—I next saw Holmes at the station-house, about 12 o'clock the same night—I knew him again—I have known him two or three years—we kept Bone and gave him into custody—I said to my husband in his hearing, "Hold him there till we get the other man as he is as bad, because he must have assisted him up, and would not stop him when I asked him," and my husband kept him till the policeman came—he then said he was only lighting his pipe, and he did not see any man come in and take the money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Bone. Q.</hi> Did you see me take any money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I saw your arms moving as if you were helping the other man up—you did not offer to run away, because I would not let you. <hi rend="italic">Holmes.</hi> I deny being there at all.</p>

                  </hi>, I saw the prisoners at the public-house on this night; I served them with a pot of porter—I afterwards saw Holmes's head and hands over the bar; that is a place where he ought not to have been—Boue was standing by the side of him at that time—I heard the money drop, and saw Holmes run away.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in this public-house, and saw Holmes take the money from the bar—he went out at the side bar and went up Barking-churchyard steps—he came back in three or four minutes afterwards, and went towards the Tower-stairs, where he was taken—I saw Bone at the public-house; they were both standing and drinking together.</p>

We went into this lady's house, and he called for a pot of beer. I turned round to light my pipe; whether he was on the bar or not, I can't say. The landlady hallooed to me to stop him. I did not know what was the matter till I saw him outside the door.</p>

I am a waterman—I have known Holmes-for seven or eight years—at 9 o'clock, on the evening of the robbery, he was in a boat with me; I can't say the day of the month—it was on a Tuesday, because I was up at the Mansion-house for him on the Wednesday and Friday following—we were mooring a ship from off Brewer's-quay—just before 10 o'clock I got Holmes to row me over the river to Horseleydown Upper Stairs in my boat; that was to save time in walking home—Horseleydown is on the Surrey-side, where I live—he then went back to stow my boat on the City<lb></lb>side, close to Great Tower-street—I know the time, because I heard the clock strike 10 when I landed—I lent him 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. just before 9 o'clock to get</p>

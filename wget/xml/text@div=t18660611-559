I live at 14, Parker-street, Drury-lane—the prisoner lodged in the same house—on 6th June, from half-past 1 to 2, I was going to bed with the prisoner's sister—the young woman he was living with was screaming out "Murder!"—we were laughing of our own accord—the prisoner came out when he heard it, and deliberately struck me in the eye with his fist—he then struck me with the handle of a knife in the eye—a girl said, "Polly, you're going to be stabbed—I turned my hand like that, and the knife caught me in the finger—the prisoner did it—</p>

I live at 4, Parker-street, Drury-lane, the same house as the prisoner—I heard screaming on the night of 6th June, and went to the landing—I there saw Mary Ann, M'Gavin, and the prisoner's sister—I don't know whether they were going up stairs—the prisoner opened the door and called her very bad names—he hit her in the eye with his fist and struck her with the handle of the knife—she said, "I will lock you up"—the young woman who was with him called out, "Polly, you're stabbed"—he said before he stabbed her, "You b—I'll stab you"—I ran down for a policeman—I saw the prosecutrix's forehead bleeding; a little, not much—she had not a poker in her hand.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. About half-past five o'clock in the morning of the 3rd of January, I was coming down my beat in the New-road, and saw a man standing at the gate of No. 2, Egremont-place; as soon as he saw me he crossed the road - I immediately went up to the house, looked down the area, and saw a bag; I took my lamp, looked into the area, and the prisoner was standing under the step of the front door; I sprung my rattle, and Goodyear came to my assistance - he got down the area, gave me up the bag, and assisted the prisoner up, for there are no steps to the area; the bag contained bread, beef, and butter, which the servant saw and claimed - the safe in the area was emptied; the prisoner said at the watch-house that a person with a frock on had thrown his hat down the area, but it is about eighteen yards from the road.</p>

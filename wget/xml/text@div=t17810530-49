               <p>The prisoner came to me in distress on Shrove-Tuesday, in the afternoon. I was going to lay down. I asked her to wash me out an apron. When I awaked, I missed the prisoner, and the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them). I left nobody in the room but her when I fell asleep. I went to Bow-street, and gave an information of it, but never found her till Wednesday fortnight; then I heard she was in Tothill-fields. I found one of my gowns at Richards's, a pawnbroker, in Drury-lane.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came upon Shrove-Tuesday to me, where I work, and asked me if I would have any thing to drink. She had lodged in our house about a fortnight. She went over to the public-house, and wanted some gin. I said I had rather have beer. I called for a pot of half-and-half. She went out, and said she would come again. She came again in about ten minutes. She had three gowns, a petticoat, and an apron, in her apron. The prosecutrix came the next day to our house, and asked for her.</p>

               <p>On the Tuesday before Shrove-Tuesday the prosecutrix and another woman, who are both women of the town, went out and brought in a man, and got a guinea of him. They were both infatuated in liquor. The prosecutrix desired me to pawn the gown for half a guinea, which I did, and stopped the half-guinea, because she owed me 18 s. She was very much in liquor; and so was I. As to her other gown, she lent it to Yorkshire Poll.</p>
               <p>To Vaughan. By what do you know the day of the month on which the gown was pawned? - By the book. The prosecutrix came three days after it was pledged, and said

             had stole the gown, and she would have a ticket of it, lest the other should fetch it out. I have the ticket here. It is dated the 22d. She has the fellow ticket.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutrix. You say the gown was stole on Shrove-Tuesday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was pawned a week before, and you went after it two days after? - It was above a week after before I found it.</p>
               <p>Had not you sent her before that to pawn the gown? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>How came that one at the pawnbroker's on the 20th? - I do not know. They said it was Shrove-Tuesday. I am almost sure it was Shrove-Tuesday.</p>

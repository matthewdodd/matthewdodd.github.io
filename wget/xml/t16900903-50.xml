               speaking Scandalous and Seditious Words against the King and Government. (that is to say) That a great number of French were landed in England, and that they were come to place the Rig hteous King in his Throne; and that the Land would never be blest till that was done: And that the Nobility of England were a parcel of Fat Rogues, and what they did for King William was not so much for the sake of Religion, but to save their wealth and Honor: And that the King, (meaning King William) was a Villain, a Dutch Dog and an Usurper, in coming to take his Fathers Crown from him
            </rs>. This was the substance of the Matter that was sworn against him, on the King's side. To invalidate which, the Prisoner produced numerous Evidence, who knew him very well, giving a particular and clear account of the Prisoner's Reputation: That he had always been a very zealous Protestant, and very well affected to the Present Government, as might appear divers ways; witness his forward Zeal in New-England (being sent thither under the Command of Sir

But, you must note, That the Prosecutor swore against him out of meer Revenge, as may appear thus: The man who swore against him was his servant in New-England, but behaved himself there very ill; upon which his Master the Lieutenant, gave him some small Correction, after which the Fellow was heard several times to threaten him, That if ever he returned to England he would be revenged on him, or to that effect. But besides this, the Lieutenant returning to England, he had frequent communication with the Witness, and had a Trunk at his House which the Witness kept from the Prisoner, upon some slight occasion; upon which the Lieutenant arrested him, and there was an Agreement made: But the Witness after that was heard to pronounce more Threats against the Lieutenant; and so upon the whole matter, the Court looking upon it to be a malicious and base Prosecution, the Prisoner was <rs id="t16900903-50-verdict220" type="verdictDescription">

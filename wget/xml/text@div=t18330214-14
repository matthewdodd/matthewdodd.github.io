            . I am constable of Norwood, in the parish of Hayes. I went with a search-warrant on the Sunday to the prisoner's house, and found a quantity of mutton, I took it before the Magistrate, all that I found there; there was the four shanks, part of the breast, and part of the neck in the pot; and up stairs I found all the rest, except two loins - I found nearly the whole sheep; the prisoner was a labouring man - I took all the mutton before a Magistrate; a butcher attempted to put it together with the skin - in my judgment it answered to the skin; it was very much haggled, not as if it had 
been done by a butcher; I was not present when the skin was found.</p>

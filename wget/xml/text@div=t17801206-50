On the 7th of November, before nine in the morning, I went out of my shop into the parlour; a gentleman, who was in the parlour, told me there was somebody in the shop; I left no person in the shop, and had not been out of it two minutes; I turned my head immediately, and saw the prisoner and another man in the shop; I turned to go into the shop, and they ran out immediately; I pursued the prisoner across Oxford-street into Gee's-court opposite; I overtook him there; as I was going to take hold of him, I saw him drop a piece of muslin containing, about fourteen yards, a piece of lawn, about eight yards, and eight yards of handkerchief; he had them in a working apron which he had on; I immediately seised him; he asked me, what I took him for, that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060045"></xptr> never had the goods; I brought him and the goods back into the shop; all the goods had my private mark upon them; he was taken before the magistrate in Litchfield-street, who committed him.</p>

               <p>To the Prosecutor. Was the prisoner ever out of your sight, from the time he went out of the shop, till you took him? - Never; I knew he was the person who had the goods, and I followed him.</p>

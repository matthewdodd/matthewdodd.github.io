            . I am a salesman, in the Minories. On Monday, the 9th of August, between twelve and one, the prisoner came to me; he asked me whether I would buy a few clothes; I said, yes. In about half an hour afterwards he brought the articles in question; I agreed to give him seven guineas for the whole; four pounds he took in money, and the remainder he was to have the next day in two jackets and a pair of trowsers. I did not buy the watch, nor did I see the watch. He called on the next day; I said, I do not like these goods, if you will return me the four pounds you shall have the things again; he said he would bring the four pounds if I would give him the goods back, he could get a ready market for them any where; when I paid him the four pounds I saw him give the money to somebody at the door; he told the Lord Mayor that he sold them for another person. On my seeing the hand-bill I gave the description of the man to Mr. Cook.</p>

               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Is that your property - A. Yes; there is a coat deficient, and the marsello quilting.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Dyer. All these these things you were to give seven pounds for; I would advise you not to be so fond of buying bargains for the future - A. No. I told him the next day they were things out of my way.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brewer-street, and am a woollen draper. On the 9th of April, the prisoner came in with two patterns of silk, and asked if I could match them—I said I could not—he then untied a piece of, cloth, and asked if I could match that—I said I could not—he asked me to show him the nearest I had, and while I was getting that, there was a remnant of cloth on the counter, which he tied up—he said the cloth I showed him was not near enough, and was going out—when he got to the door, I asked him to walk in again—he came in and said, "For God's sake Mr. Daniels don't do it, I will give you it back."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 106.) I was sent for—when I got to the shop, the prosecutor was holding the prisoner by the arm—he said he had taken a piece of cloth—Mr. Daniels went behind the counter and picked up the cloth—I searched the prisoner at the station-house, and found no money on him, but a pocket-book, and a flash note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I said I had a half-sovereign and a half-crown. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, you did not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had a little portion of a tunic coat in the bundle, and I wanted to make a pair of towsers to match it for my own child, and to match some waistcoats—he said he had not got it—my little coat was then lying on the pieces of cloth. I took the coat and tied it up in my bundle—he was looking at me all the time—it is not likely I should take any thing else—I had not stepped beyond the threshold of the door—he took me and told a young man to fetch a policeman—I said, "For what?"—he said. "If you don't know what is your own, I will tell you"—I said, "I have nothing but what I paid for"—I did not say, "I will pay you"—he se<lb></lb>lected this from a quantity of pieces, and I said, "If you are so inclined, why not take the first piece that comes to hand?"—that note was put into my hand one day in the street.</p>

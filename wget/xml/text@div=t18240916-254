I had gone out to an adjoining house, and on my return my jacket was gone. My handkerchief was in my hat, which was lying by the jacket. I received some information, and laid hold of the prisoner in an adjoining field; I charged him with stealing the jacket and handkerchief - he said he had done no such thing. I took him to the watchhouse. As soon as he saw me in the field, he dropped the articles, and went on. When I saw him first, he was rolling them up, and then ran away. I am quite sure he is the person. The field is about a quarter of a mile from the place where I was at work.</p>

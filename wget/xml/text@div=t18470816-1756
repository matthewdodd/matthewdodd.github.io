                  </hi> I am warehouseman to Mr. William Wightwick, of No. 105, Fleet-street. On the evening of the 31st of July I saw the shadow of a man in the shop—I went to the side door, but saw no one—I went out and saw the prisoner walking down Fleet-street with this flannel and coun<lb></lb>terpane—I went, collared him, and brought him back to the shop—I had seen this property safe in the shop a few minutes before—it is my master's, and is my own marking.</p>

Thorpe was brought to me about six o'clock—I examined him—found a quantity of con<lb></lb>gested blood on his face—I removed the hare from his head, and found a long superficial wound at the top of the head, and a very slight wound at the back—he was stripped, and I found his back very much bruised with long wheals and stripes—I attended to him—the injuries were such as could be produced by this whip.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I sincerely regret that I suffered my feelings, deeply wounded thought they were, so far to overcome me as to be induced to chas<lb></lb>tise this undutiful and cruelly bad boy so severely; but I most positively deny using the thick end of the stick, and respectfully beg you will allow me to state the circumstances which occasioned me so to act. He is in the habit of running away, and stopping two or three days and nights, robbing me of what money he can lay his hand on, or taking such small articles as he can easily convert into money, with him. I have adopted reproof hitherto, and have talked to him earnestly and repeatedly on the probable result of such a wicked course of conduct, in the hope of keeping him from the place were (through him) I now stand, but to no purpose. I cannot send him out to fetch anything in, for fear he should steal something; for, not content with being a little villain himself, he tell the people I send him out to steal. He was sent for some wood a short time since; he spent the money, and stole some wood, and said he was sent on purpose; a mob came round the door, and we were shamefully abused. Such tricks does he frequently play me. On this last occasion, when he ran away from home, he was taken in by some most esteemed friends of mine, who keep a coffee-shop. He told them the most diabolical falsehoods; that I had impugned the character of all the females of their family; and told a shop full of customer that his mother had six man in bed with her at once, and such-like vile slander, merely to make the men laugh, and to get money. Through this, I have found out that for months past he has been in the habit of telling the most abominable false<lb></lb>hoods to my lodger; that I gave her the worst of characters, searched her chamber, beat her baby, and indeed, lies beyond all endurance; and when asked by her (the lodger) why he did so, he said, because he wished me to be thought as bad as himself. Under these circumstances, I trust that my previous unblemished character for honesty, industry, and general good con<lb></lb>duct; the deep disgrace he has brought upon me, the loss of my situation, my long confinement in prison (nearly three weeks,) and the destitute condition of my wife and three little children at home, may be considered ample atone<lb></lb>ment for my intemperate or inconsiderate conduct.</p>

             to get change at next door; the prisoner bit the two, and said they were bad, that I dealt in bad money; she laid them down on the counter, and then I gave her another.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do with the third? - A.She put it to her mouth and bit it as she had done the others, and then she swallowed it, I suppose, for I never saw it after; I then desired her to go about her business; a constable came from Marlborough-street, she was taken there, and was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How many seven-shilling-pieces might you have had that morning? - A. Four.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people might you have given change to that day? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces did you take in the course of the day? - A. Not one; them I had in my pocket in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said that you gave change to another woman? - A.No; I gave Mrs. Hart one to get change.</p>
               <p>Q.What was done with the guinea - you had the guinea? - A. No, she took it up again.</p>
               <p>Q.When she found she did not get her full change she took it up again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told her to go about her business? - A. I told her to give me my money, and go about her business.</p>
               <p>Q. She was searched, but no seven-shilling-piece was found upon her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say before the Magistrate, and was it not upon that that she was let out upon bail, and has been ever since, that you could not ascertain how many seven-shilling-pieces you had that morning? - A. No such thing, I never said so; that one seven-shilling-piece I never had back from her.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave her first two seven-shilling-pieces, did she lay them down upon the counter before you gave her the third? - A. She laid down one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many had you after she went away? - A. I had two seven-shilling-pieces, and seven-shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask again - did you not take off the counter one, or two, of the first seven-shilling-pieces, before you gave her the third? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know that the third you gave was not one of the other two that you had given her? - A. I can swear I gave her three, and had but two back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you carry on business on your own account? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband has nothing to do with it? - A. He is a tradesman by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell whether you took up two or one before you gave the third? - A. I cannot.</p>

             sworn. - I went to Mrs. Wallis's for some tobacco for my husband; when I went in, Mrs. Wallis weighed my tobacco; but before she finished with me, this woman came in for snuff and tobacco that came to about one shilling, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179901090029"></xptr>she wanted change for a guinea; Mrs. Wallis took out her purse, and laid down three seven-shilling-pieces; Mary Smith gave them all back, and said they were bad money; she bit them all three.</p>
               <p>Q.Did she give them back one at a time, or how? - A. She gave them all three at once; then Mrs. Wallis threw her down another to chuse, that was the fourth; and then she picked out three from the four that she was satisfied with; Mrs. Wallis took one of them out of her hand, and asked me to get change next door; when I came back, Mrs. Wallis took the tobacco and snuff, and gave her a guinea, and told her to take the guinea and give her the other two seven-shilling-pieces; I saw Mrs. Smith give another of the seven-shilling-pieces back; Mrs. Wallis desired her to leave the shop, for two months ago she wanted to cheat her out of a guinea; a great many words ensued because she did not give up the seven-shilling-piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you hear the story that Mrs. Wallis told? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not seem at all agreed? - A. I cannot help that.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Wallis gave her a fourth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you came back, Mrs. Wallis was quarrelling about this seven-shilling-piece? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Wallis had the guinea in her hand, and desired her to go about her business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Wallis had the guinea in her hand after the dispute had arisen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And she threw it down, and desired her to go away? - A.She did not know then whether she had lost the seven-shilling-piece or not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am quite innocent of the charge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley contended, that the prosecutrix having a security in her hand it could not amount to a felony, for she returned the guinea before the transaction was compleated, and therefore it was in her own laches.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Wallis.) Did you desire her to take up her guinea? - A. No; I desired her to give me my money and go away; she took it up, I did not desire her.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Hart.) You say Mrs. Wallis desired her to take up her guinea, and go about her business? - A. I cannot say; I think it was so.</p>
               <p>Q. You said she desired her to take up the guinea, - now are you accurate as to that? - A. I think I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner take it up, or did Mrs. Wallis desire her to take it up? - A. I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character. <rs id="t17990109-21-verdict133" type="verdictDescription">

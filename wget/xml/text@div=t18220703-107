            . I am a headborough. On the 12th of June, about three o'clock, I was in John-street, and saw the prisoner and another boy; they passed me, and looked back. I suspected the prisoner had something in his apron, and followed them; the other touched him on the shoulder, and they ran off into Flying Horse-yard; I laid hold of the prisoner with this soap. He said his mother gave it him, and he was going to take it to her again - he threw it all down; I gathered it up, put it in my pocket, and took him to the watch-house. I went in the direction he had come, and found out Morris.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he work with you there?</p>
               <p>Bayton. No; I have heard since that he had worked there, but he had no business there then; I got a warrant against him on suspicion of stealing it, and took him up and charged him with it; this was on the Thursday following, he at first deny'd it 'till he saw the labourer come that let him in, then he own'd it, and cry'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that labourer's name?</p>
               <p>Bayton. I do not know.</p>

               <p>Bayton. No, but he own'd he took the coat that I was enquiring after.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other coats with yours.</p>
               <p>Bayton. There was none but my partner's, and that was not taken away; there were two books in my coat-pocket, I ask'd him what he had done with them, he said he had taken and hid them.</p>

The prosecutor mentioned two pocket-books being in the coat-pocket; the prisoner said he had hid them in Whitechapel, we went to the place he mentioned, but could not find them.</p>

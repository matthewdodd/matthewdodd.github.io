I have known Cross a long time; she was there; I gave her some beer - Wiggins came in and she asked him to drink with her, which he did; she asked me to give her some dinner, I agreed, she was to go home with me - they both walked with me; she took my arm, and Wiggins walked by her side. When we got near my lodging, she said,</p>
               <p>"I hope Joseph you won't deceive me," I said,</p>
               <p>"I will not, you shall both have some dinner - I have no money in my pocket, but I have some half crowns in the table drawer, we will get something with that;" when I came to the door, I took out the key from my pocket, they both shoved against me, and said they would unlock it for me - I opened it myself, and both came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090071"></xptr>in; Wiggins said,</p>
               <p>"Go on, I'll be with you in a moment" - Cross and I went up stairs; I got the box to strike a light, to make a fire - the tinder-box was in the drawer with the money, which was safe when I took the box out. I was striking a light, and Cross pulled the drawer out, took something out and turned round, saying she wanted to go into the back-yard - I directed her to the yard; she said I had better lay down and have a sleep; I was rather fresh; she said she would be up in a moment, and as soon as she was out of the room, I felt and found my watch gone from my fob, and the money from the drawer. I went down, and they were both gone, and the door shut. I found them in custody afterwards.</p>
               <p>WIGGINS Defence. He came to the public-house and asked us to drink, and tossed for five half quarterns of gin; he got very much in liquor - I thought I would see him home, but did not go up stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, and live at No. 24, Frederick-street, Gray's Inn-road. My brother, Francis Azzoni, has a counting house at No 57, Old Broad-street—I am in the habit of going to that counting house—I attend to my brother's business when he is absent—I was at the counting house on the morning of 2nd Nov., at 10 minutes past 10 o'clock—I found this letter in the letter box, it is addressed to Mr. F. Azzoni—it is in the Italian language—I do not know the writing—(<hi rend="italic">a translation of the letter was read, as follows</hi>: "Signor Fernandino Azzoni, considering the success you have had in business a short time through commerce, the Secret Italian Society, established in London in connection with all the other united societies of Europe, with the severest rigour, have decreed the appli<lb></lb>cation of a forced tax upon you, Sir, of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling, in gold, to be consigned as underneath expressed. Mr. F. A., precisely at midnight, between 2nd and 3rd Nov., shall find himself opposite the General Post-office of this city with a packet containing 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sterling, in gold precisely, which has been taxed; in which place he will find an individual who will</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185511260042"></xptr>
               <p>ask him in these precise words, <hi rend="italic">La parola did Mario</hi>? To which question h shall answer precisely as written underneath, <hi rend="italic">Primo Mercurio</hi>; at which sig; of convention you may be certain it is our clerk, and to the same you will con sign the packet, without any word or noise, under the penalty of being imme<lb></lb>diately killed by an emissary, who on that night will be in that locality purposely to watch for you. If your life be of any consequence to you, we advise you to punctually execute all that which is here described, because perhaps you will not believe that our societies are well united and in full relation with all others; therefore, if ever it should come into your head to escape from here, in whatever place you may go, or soon or late, you will be taken and killed. So if you should attempt to avoid it by advising the police, you may be certain of walking very little longer; but, on the contrary, we assure you that if you will execute the above, you will be able to travel where you wish; that no one will molest you, neither will they ask you for anything further"—I opened that letter and read it—I went to the Justice room at Guildhall, and communicated with the police—on the night of 2nd Nov. I went to the General Post-office in St. Martin's-le-Grand, at 12 o'clock precisely—I found nobody there at the moment, but shortly afterwards I saw the prisoner—I did not know him before—he was walking towards me when I first saw him, he was alone—he spoke to me, and said in a very impudent manner," Have you received the letter?"—he spoke in Italian—I said, "Yes"—he then said, "You know the word?"—I said, "What word?"—he said, "Mario "—I replied, "Primo."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I merely asked him the way to my house? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He did not ask me any question of that sort—I put my hand in my pocket where I had a bag containing 300 farthings—on my putting my hand in my pocket, the prisoner looked frightened, and fell back, and said, "Be so kind as to come with me"—he said that three or four times—I said, "No, according to the letter I am obliged to pay here "—he said, "No, no, no, be so kind as to come with me," drawing back—I had some officers in attend<lb></lb>ance, not far from me, on the opposite side of the street—when I saw the prisoner fall back and like run away, I made a signal to the officers, and they came in a moment and arrested him—they asked him, "What do you want with this gentleman?"—he said, "Oh, nothing! I want nothing."</p>

In consequence of a communica<lb></lb>tion from Mr. Azzoni, on the night of 2nd Nov., I placed myself in St. Mar-tin's-le-Grand, near Newgate-street, opposite the General Post Office—I was there at a quarter before 12 o'clock—about four minutes before 12 o'clock I saw the prisoner—he came from Newgate-street, and turned round the corner into St. Martin's-le-Grand—I watched him—he walked towards the north end of St. Martin's-le-Grand, looking very attentively across to the east side, towards the General Post Office—he walked about ninety yards on the west side, and then returned back towards the south end, looking attentively, and nearer the kerb towards the Post Office—he passed by me on coming back—he then crossed by my right shoulder to the opposite side, to the General Post Office—I saw Mr. Azzoni—the prisoner and he met—they appeared to be in conversation for about two minutes, I should say—I then saw the prisoner leave, walking towards the south end</p>

               <p>of St. Martin's-le-Grand in a beckoning position, that it, enticing Mr. Azzoni to follow him—he walked sideways with his face towards me—a signal had been agreed upon, between Mr. Azzoni and me—at that time I observed the signal, and I immediately crossed over the road as fast as I could go—my brother officer (Russell) had got hold of the prisoner by the right hand—I took his left and he was taken to the station—he was searched in my presence—this large clasp knife was found upon him, (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it was closed, in his right hand pocket—there was also a snuff-box containing a passport, and two small memorandums in the Italian language—I did not see any person with the prisoner—I saw no person besides the prisoner meet Mr. Azzoni, or speak to him—when I took the prisoner I asked him what he wanted with the gentleman—he made some answer in Italian, and also said, "Me no speak English."</p>

            . Q. Are you the brother of the lady to whom the prisoner was married in 99 - A, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father I believe is dead - A. He is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that register, and say whether you believe the signature of that marriage to be your father's hand writing - A. It is his to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your sister now living - A. She now is.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did your father live - A. At Eston, ten miles from Canterbury, near Ashbourne, it lies between Ashbourne and Canterbury.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did your sister live with him after her marriage - A. He was with her two years nearly, at times with my father.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he knew your father's residence well - A. He made my father's house his home.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long after the marriage it was that he left your sister - A. That I cannot rightly say; he left her several times, I think it was about three years that he left her, I believe at Margate or Ramsgate he left her.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had he lived with her, before he finally deserted her - A. About three years, to the best of my knowledge: from the time of his deserting her, she lived with my father during his life, and with my mother since his death. They have removed since to Ashbourne.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body was to enquire for your sister, there would be no difficulty in finding her - A. No. She had one child by him, dead born.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I wish to ask him one question. As he says that I have deserted this lady, his sister, is he aware of the cause of my leaving her at Ramsgate, in the year 1801 - A. I am not certain of it, he left her in great distress.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to ask you in what kind of distress I left this lady - A. He went away and left her without any money in her pocket, and also took her clothes from her, and pawned her clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not wish to take the witness by surprise; will he swear that I pawned his sister's cloathes - A. From what I heard my sister say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had I any marriage portion with your sister - A. That I cannot say; my father frequently supplied you with money, to my certain knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Speaking within the mark, do you know what was the amount - A. I cannot speak to that exactly; he advanced money several different times; to what extent I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath to what extent he may suppose, does he imagine to the amount of one hundred pounds, or any such sum - A. Considerably more.</p>
               <p>Q. More than five hundred pounds do you imagine - A. I cannot say that it was more than an hundred.</p>
               <p>Court. What way of life was your father in - A. A farmer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask the witness whether he means to maintain, upon his oath, that I lived with his sister three years: as I was an officer in the South Loyal Gloucester militia, whether I did not leave this lady in my military character - A. I never saw him until after they were married. I never saw him in uniform; he was a military man at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. As seduction seems to be laid to my charge more than bigamy, is he aware that I met his sister about six o'clock; and went away with her the same night - A. He did, but not the same afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he mean to swear that she did not come away at twelve o'clock at night, from her father's house; does he mean to contend that it was not the same afternoon</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I object to that question.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any reason to know that your sister came away with him the first day that she was acquainted with him - A. To the best of my knowledge she was acquainted first with him at Canterbury, and at this time the regiment laid at Ashbourne.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How long were they acquainted before they were married - A. About a month before they went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. Your sister eloped from your father's house with the prisoner, upon which your father came to London, and sanctioned the marriage with his presence - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. After leaving your sister two or three times, distressed, he finally left her - A. Them were not the only times he left her.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MOSS. I am a clerk in the Bishop of London's office, Doctors' commons. I produce the affidavit upon which the license was granted.</p>

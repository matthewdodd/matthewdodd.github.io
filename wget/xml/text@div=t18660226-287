                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at King's College-hospital, and was so on the morning 21st January—I examined Fitzgerald when he was brought in—his left arm was very much swollen about the elbow—he was evidently suffering a great deal of pain, and there was a mark and a bruise on the near side of the elbow—I suspected the artery was ruptured—I sent for Mr. Moore, the assistant-surgeon, who secured the artery, which was found broken slighty above the elbow—the rupture corresponded with the bruise—everything was done to make him comfortable—I saw him again at 4 o'clock in the morning, and again at half past 11—he died about 4 o'clock on Tuesday morning—mortification of the arm set in on the Monday—he became delirious, and I was obliged to take him down to the refractory ward—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post<lb></lb>mortem</hi> examination—both bones of the arm were dislocated at the elbow, backwards and outwards, and the main artery was ruptured clean across, the veins and muscles were torn, and the nerves were stretched, but were not torn—the ligaments were all torn—the inner ligament inside the elbow was whole, but all the rest were torn—I thought it was done by a violent twist, the force being given in a direction back<lb></lb>wards and outwards—it was a most curious injury, but that would account for it, and I think that would account for the bruises from the rupture of any superficial vessel—the cause of death was the injury he received to the arm; but the reason he died then was failure of the heart's action—I think he had the commencement of fatty degeneration of the heart—I suppose that the failure of the heart's action to be brought about by the injury—he had an enlarged liver—the bruises inside the elbow might be caused by a kick.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of No. 5, Staple Inn. The pri<lb></lb>soner was occasionally employed by me to do copying at my office—on 9th Dec I received from my father this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by Mr. Dalton—I had received two other cheques before, and I put the three into my table desk, in the prisoner's presence, and locked the drawer—I gave one of the cheques to a gentleman named Walthew, put the other into my pocket, and left the third in the drawer—the prisoner had the opportunity of seeing that it was left there—I left the office between 12 and 1 o'clock, leaving the prisoner there, and Charles Wheeler, my clerk—I was absent about half an hour—I returned, waited in the office not mere than ten minutes, and then went out, and was absent for about half an hour again; I then immediately went to the drawer, and the cheque was gone—when I returned the first time the prisoner was in the office, and Wheeler was out,; he came in, to the best of my recollection, before I left the second time, but I am not quite positive—the prisoner was not in the office when I came back the second time, and I did not see him that day, or the next—he had finished the work he had in hand, but he ordinarily attended every day—he had been paid for the work which he had done, except the last, but I had lent him much more than what was unpaid—he came to me on Friday morning, the 11th, at the Bankruptcy Court, in consequence of a letter which I wrote to him to come there to work, and after his work was finished I gave him in charge; I could not get an officer before—when I went out that day, he had whiskers half down his face, and a good deal of hair under his chin, but on the Friday morning it had all disappeared, and he was as he is now.</p>

               <p>are bringing a false charge, Mr. Spicer; I am too innocent to do anything of the kind"—I said, "I hoped you were, but the Bank clerk identifies you distinctly"—he then requested to speak to me—he appeared rather astonished, not particularly agitated—he said at the station house that the charge was untrue—his appearance was different on the Friday morning; his hair had been shaved off, and the hair under the chin also—I did not say anything to him about it, nor to the bank clerk, nor did he to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Spicer—on 9th Dec. I was in the office—I remember Mr. Spicer going out about the middle of the day—at that time the prisoner was in the office with me—while Mr. Spicer was out the prisoner's wife came to the office; that was about 10 minutes to 1 o'clock, before Mr. Spicer returned the first time—the prisoner told me to go to my lunch, and I left him and Mrs. Scott in the office together, and nobody else; when I came back Mr. Spicer was there, and the prisoner, Mrs. Scott was gone—Mr. Spicer afterwards went out—after that the prisoner seemed as if he was looking for some paper—he opened the drawer—I was standing by the fire place, and I saw the cheque in the corner, rolled up; he then shut the drawer—I had seen Mr. Spicer put the cheque into the drawer, and I had seen him pay one to Mr. Walker, and put another into his pocket—I saw the third cheque safe in the drawer when the prisoner opened it—he did not take anything out then—he then said he was going to his lunch, and while he was gone, Mr. Spicer returned, and went to the drawer—it was directly after Mr. Spicer had gone out that he opened the drawer; before Mr. Spicer came back the first time, and directly after Mr. Spicer had left the second time, the prisoner said he was going to his lunch, and went away—while he was away Mr. Spicer returned—the prisoner came back that evening while Mr. Spicer was out, and he wrote this note, and told me to give it to Mr. Spicer, and ask him to leave an answer—I told the prisoner that Mr. Spicer had lost a cheque, and that he had gone down to the bank to stop payment—he told me to ask Mr. Spicer to be sure and leave an answer to the note, as it was very important, and he would return in half an hour, as Mrs. Scott was waiting for him—I gave the note to Mr. Spicer—I did not see the prisoner again till I saw him at the Bankruptey Court—(<hi rend="italic">Note read</hi>: "Dear Sir,—I enclose you two bills for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, which, if you will cash for me, I shall feel obliged. I hope what the boy tells me about your losing a cheque will prove incorrect, and that you have mislaid it. Yours truly, Robert Scott. Mrs. Scott has just called for me, but I shall be in directly.")—On the Wednesday I noticed that the prisoner had whiskers, and a quantity of hair under his chin—when I saw him at the Bankruptey Court he had not any.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined Q.</hi> You say you saw this particular cheque rolled up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was crumpled up, as cheques generally are—it was in the corner of the drawer—there were other papers there—the prisoner usually told me to go to lunch—it was twenty minutes past 1 o'clock when I came back—Mr. Spicer said that he was going into the City, and would get his lunch; and directly he had gone, the prisoner went out also—Mr. Spicer came back before going to the City, and went to the drawer—it was about half past 1 o'clock that the prisoner left for his lunch—I am quite sure that he had whiskers—I had noticed them before, when he has been sitting in the office—my attention was not directed to them in any way—he had hair under his chin—it was not very bushy—it was a kind of brown colour—I have always seen him wear those whiskers since I have been there—I went</p>

               <p>on the 1st of Dec.—he had no whiskers at the Bankruptey Court on Friday—I noticed that directly I saw him—I mentioned it to the banker's clerk when I fetched him—I went to fetch him from Currie and Co.'s, Cornhill, and walked with him from there to the Bankruptey Court—I told him that the prisoner had no whiskers, and no hair on his face—what I said was, that Mr. Scott had shaved all the hair off his face—I did not tell him that Mr. Scott was the man who had taken the cheque—I suppose he knew he was going to identify the prisoner—I did not tell him so—I did not tell him that we had got the man who stole the cheque—Mr. Spicer had been to the bank before that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier at Currie's, the bankers. On 9th Dec. this cheque was presented to me—I cashed it with five sovereigns—to the best of my belief it was the prisoner who presented it—it was only five minutes after I had paid it that Mr. Spicer came and inquired if I could identify the party, and I described him as having whiskers—the person who presented the draft certainly had hair on his face, but whether they were whiskers adjoining his hair, or merely hair on the chin, I cannot say, because he had his hat on—to the best of my belief the prisoner was that person.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined Q.</hi> You had never seen him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my knowledge—I cash a great many cheques during the day—I do not under<lb></lb>take to speak positively to the prisoner, since he has been shaved—I could speak with more certainty to a man with hair on his face—I noticed hair on the chin, and whiskers, as I thought—I described him to Mr. Spicer as having hair on his face—I did not observe whiskers on the side of the face—it was not a beard—the hair was on the chin, or on a portion of the cheek, possibly—I did not notice under his chin, he did not hold his head up—I cannot tell what colour it was—I believe it was rather a darkish dye—Wheeler came to me from the Bankruptcy Court—he told me that Scott was at the Bankruptcy Court, and I was to come there to identify him, but he had been shaved—I went there—he was not shown to me—I saw Mr. Spicer walk up to him, and directly I looked at him I thought by his features he was the same person.</p>

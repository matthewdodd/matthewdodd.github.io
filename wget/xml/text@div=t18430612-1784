                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, and live in Princes-street, Leicester-square. On the 12th of March, last year, the prisoner came to my shop in company with another person, and asked to look at some gold watches—I showed him forty-two watches—he was about ten minutes looking at them—he afterwards selected one, and wished me to keep it going till the following Monday—it was not going at that time—I turned my back to go and get a key to wind it up, leaving the gold watches on the counter in front of the prisoner and his companion—I came with the key, wound up the watch, and he went away about half a minute after, and in half a minute I missed two gold watches, worth about twenty guineas—I never saw the prisoner again till he was in custody on the last charge.</p>

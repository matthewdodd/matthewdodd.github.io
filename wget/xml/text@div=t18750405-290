                  </hi>. I am a furnace-man at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich—the prisoner was a police-constable there—on 19th March, at 10 o'clock in the morning, I went to one of the coal bunkers and found there two pieces of tin like this which I produce, with some coals covered over them—I spoke to Keefe about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have worked at the Arsenal about ten years—I have known the prisoner as a constable there the last three years—the coals in this bunker are used for the furnaces, they are only kept alight in the day-time—sometimes there is metal kept in the lead room, not far from the bunker, not close by—there were two furnaces alight on 19th March, we fetch the coals ourselves to work the furnaces, two men work at each furnace—the men leave the Arsenal at meal times, except Keefe, he worked at his furnace at meal times—the men are searched as they go out of the gates—I am not aware that men have been found going out with property upon them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furnace-man employed in the Arsenal—on the morning of 19th March English came to me in the laboratory and made a communication, in consequence of which I went to the coal bunker and examined the place he pointed out—I found there four ingots of tin, one a-top of the other, and coal placed over them—I immediately reported the matter to the foreman—I was in the Arsenal at work all that day, I never went out; I was working near this coal bunker, I did not see anyone go to it during the day; I was in a position to see if they had gone there, I kept watch up to 9 o'clock at night, when the workmen left; they were working late that week; the constables came on duty at 10 o'clock—about 9.30, as soon as the workmen had left, I and Newton went into a furnace in the wall, in order to watch this coal bunker, and about 10.30 I saw the prisoner go straight to the coal bunker, he looked and stopped there for a minute or two, and then walk away; he came back again, and I saw him take the coals off, take the ingot, put it under his arm, and walk away with it in the direction of the hole in the wall—I and Newton then came out and followed him—there was a ladder there, whether that made a noise as we came out or not I don't know—when the prisoner heard us he walked two or three paces on to a furnace, and laid the ingot on the corner of it, it was not alight, it was the third furnace from where we were planted; it is shown on this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we went up to him, and Newton said "What are you doing with that?"—he said "I saw it there last night"—Newton said "Did you report it to your inspector?"—he said "No"—when we went up to him I was first, but I stepped back and let Newton come before me—I did not hear anything when the prisoner put the ingot down on the furnace—I did not see anything afterwards where the ingot was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The edge of the furnace is a cast iron frame made up with brick-work—it is hollow inside—I heard the ingot put down on the iron, that was all the noise I did hear—I was present when a conversation took place between the prisoner and Hunt at the main gate, about 11 o'clock; Newton was there—Hunt asked the prisoner if he had any keys about him—he said he had two—he produced two keys, to the best of my belief, and took off his coat—I heard him say "I saw the metal there last night, and I placed a piece of coal and a piece of coke upon it"—I don't recollect hearing him say "When I looked at it to night I found it had been dis<lb></lb>turbed;" he may have said that he was going" to report the matter as soon as he found out what kind of ingots they were—I can't swear that he did</p>

               <p>say so, I did not hear all that passed, I was in another room part of the time—there are ingots of different metals and different sizes in the lead-room, I have never seen any ingot temporarily stacked near the coal bunkers; the bunkers are of brick-work and iron, <hi rend="italic">level</hi> with the ground—there have been as many as fifty or sixty tons of coal put in the bunker; the coal is separated from the coke by an iron plate 4 or 5 feet high, when they got too high the coke runs over to the coal—I watched the bunker on 19th. March from about 10.30 or 11 o'clock in the morning till 10.30 at night—I was not away during that time; I went to put my ticket in, and Newton sent a man, and I came back again, I was relieved for three or four minutes—I was to watch to see that no one took the metal, nobody took coals from that bunker but me—the other men used coke—some hundreds of men are employed at the laboratory.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warder in the laboratory at Woolwich Arsenal—on the morning of 19th March, I received some information about the ingots of tin—I gave some directions to Keefe, and afterwards watched with him from about 9.3—the workmen left at 9 o'clock—about 10.30 I saw the prisoner go to the coal bunker, that is the coke bunker, and I saw his hand moving; he then left the bunker and walked away about 14, 15 or 16 yards; he faltered for about half a minute, and then returned to the same spot, took out the ingot of tin, placed it on his arm, and walked away to the same spot from which he had previously returned—I then rushed out of my hiding-place; he made a sort of turn to the right, and placed the ingot on a furnace which stood about in a line with his breast—I asked him what he was doing with it, and with the flurry he said that he had been watching it previous to this—I asked him if he had been watching it, what made him take it out; he said he was not sure what it was, and he took it out to have a look at it—I said "Why did you take it from the light into a dark place to look at it? that won't do for me, you will have to go to the gate and see the inspector on duty; take up the tin and come along"—he said "No, if I have to go to the gate you can carry it yourself"—I said "Well I am not above doing that"—I carried it to the gate, at the same time that he placed the tin on the furnace I heard a slight gingle as if something had dropped with it—I said nothing, but afterwards went back to where I heard the gingle—the superintendent and I got a lamp and saw this small key lying on the furnace, which has an iron frame with a brick top; there is a hole in the wall where the hose comes through; these ingots are worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound, and they weigh over 30 lbs.—this is worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and sometimes a good deal more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of the Royal Arsenal—the prisoner was on duty there on this night and he came into my office between 10 and 11 o'clock followed by Keefe and by Newton who carried an ingot of tin in his arms and said "Four ingots of tin were found concealed in the coal bunker in the lavatory yard this morning, I received directions to have them watched during the day and when the workmen left at 9 o'clock this evening I concealed myself with Keefe behind a furnace and at 10.30 I heard some person coming, and I could tell by the walk that it was a policeman, he came up and walked into a coke bunker and put up his hand, and I saw his hand moving among the coals, he walked away into the lavatory-yard and halted and came back again, took out this ingot in his arms, and was walking back to the tap, and we rushed out and I said "What have you got there?"—he said "I was not aware what it was, I was taking it to the light to examine it"—he also said "I saw it there last night and was watching it"—I said "If you were watching it why did you take it out?"—he said "I was not quite sure what it was, I saw the metal there last night and I took it out and was taking it to the light to examine it—I said "You did not report having found anything last night which you should have done if you had"—he said "No I did not as I thought I should have been suspected of having put it there"—it was his duty to have reported it the night before—I took the light and Newton picked up this key which fits the padlock which secures the hole in the wall—he had no right to have such a key—there are seven keys; three of the inspectors have them, the superintendent has one, and there is one at each of the three gates in the lobby—the prisoner would have access to the key kept at the gate—the seven keys are safe, this is not one of them, it is a different metal, it has been filed—it is really a skeleton key.</p>

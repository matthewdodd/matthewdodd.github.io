               <p>ROBERT WINTER sworn. - I received an alarm from the last witness, on the 17th of February; upon coming to the door, Duncan was standing on the threshold, he desired me to follow those two men, pointing to the two prisoners at the bar; I pursued them immediately; they had each of them a large bundle upon their backs; I followed them till I got round the corner, into St. Alban's-street; I was then out of breath with running so fast, and immediately called stop thief; I was then within from twenty to thirty yards of the prisoners, they were, as near as I can recollect, six or seven yards apart; on calling out, stop thief, Smith, who had a blue coat on, turned his head round quite facing of me, and upon seeing me so near him, he threw down his bundle immediately; Yeomans turned round also to see from whence the noise proceeded; he carried his bundle five or six yards further, to the other side of the Strand; he threw it down in the kennel, just by the side of the pavement; he then ran as fast as Smith, towards Market-street, in going out of St. Alban's-street, I turned to the right; I pursued them a little further along Market-street; Yeomans, and another person, that ran with them, turned to the left hand, that was a person that I suspected of being an accomplice, he was in my house not half a minute, before Duncan gave the alarm; Smith turned to the right towards Market-lane; I pursued Yeomans into Norris-street, and there I recollected the goods, and I went back to look for them, about one hundred yards, and I found them where they had been thrown away; a soldier assisted me in carrying them; upon going up stairs, I found my own key in the room door, a back-room, up two pair of stairs; I found the room stripped of all the linen that was in it, and every thing, excepting the beds; a female servant had been the last person intrusted with the key; the next observation I made was, that one of the bureaus, there were three in the room, was broke open; I missed some new silver coin, to the value of four shillings, but I cannot say so many pieces; I then missed my watch off the window; I had laid it there when I got up, the key used to be kept in the bar; I can speak to the property when it is produced; as soon as I had secured the property, I came down stairs, and Duncan came in at the same time at the outer door; I was then informed that Yeomans was taken with my watch to St. Martin's watch-house; on coming there, Yeomans was sitting on a seat, I said, that is one of the men that had part of my property upon his back; there were a great number of other people there, eight or nine to the best of my recollection; I gave a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020022"></xptr>description of the maker's name and number, and a bruise in it; then the watch was shewn me, and I knew it to be mine; in about ten minutes after that, Smith was brought in, and I immediately said, that is the first man that threw down my bundle; I am very sure the two prisoners are the same men that I saw with my property.</p>
               <p>Yeomans. Q.What coloured coat had I on? - A. I cannot take upon me to say the exact colour, it was a dark colour, something like a snuff colour.</p>
               <p>Yeomans. Q. How was the person, you suppose to be the accomplice, drest? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.You are positive to my being one of the persons that carried the bundle? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you not say that he turned round and looked at you? - A. Yes; I saw his face at that time as plain as I see your's now; I was not then further than 30 yards from him, it was then nearly as light as it is now.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the lamps lit? - A. No; I had never seen either of the prisoners before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Keeping a public-house, I suppose your outer door generally stands open? - A. Always.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 22, St. Alban's-street, with Messrs. Scott and Randall, apothecaries: On Monday the 17th of February, I think, a little after five, I am not quite certain; I saw two or three men on the other side of the way, in St. Alban's-street, two of them had bundles on their backs running fast; they were running from Charles-street; across St. Alban's-street, towards Market-street; I looked down the street, and saw somebody crying stop thief; a man ran first without a bundle, Yeomans ran next, and Smith a few yards after him; when they heard stop thief called, they each of them threw down their bundles about seven or eight yards distant from each other; they turned the corner, and ran towards Norris-street, Smith ran down Market-lane; I saw no one follow them, and therefore I followed Smith, calling stop thief, but no one ran after him but me; I pursued him round Pall-mall, and into the Hay-market; I then saw him reeling from one side of the pavement to the other, like a drunken man; I pursued, and called stop thief; as soon as he heard that call behind him, he looked round, and seeing me, he ran across the Hay-market, and down Little Suffolk-street; I pursued him, calling stop thief; a great many people were collected together, running after him; I pursued him down Great Suffolk-street, and there I lost sight of him, and did not see him again till he was in Mr. Amies's shop in Whitcomb-street; he was secured in Amies's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time you first saw him, till you saw him in Amies's shop? - A. Scarcely five minutes, for I ran as hard as I could; I can speak positively to the face of Smith; I cannot speak so distinctly to Yeomans', it was Smith that I followed; Smith had a blue coat on, with a velvet collar; the other had a brown coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been reeling before he got into the Hay-market? - A. No; he ran as fast as any sober man could do.</p>
               <p>Q.And that you are very positive was Smith? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. How came you not to come to the second examination at Bow-street? - A. My master could not spare me from business; I was there at the first examination.</p>
               <p>- AMIES sworn. - I keep a broker's shop, in Whitcomb-street: The prisoner, Smith, came into my shop about a quarter past five o'clock, he appeared very much agitated and frightened; I asked him who he was, and what he wanted; he gave me no answer; I asked him a second time what he wanted, and who he was, and then I seized him by the arm; at that moment two or three people came rushing into the shop, and Williams said, that is he, this is the man; there were a great number of people at the door, and several people asked him who he was, and he said he was a gentleman; and then he was taken out of my shop to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Smith. Q.Was I not very much in liquor? - A. He appeared very much agitated; I cannot tell whether it was from agitation or liquor, but he smelt of liquor certainly.</p>
               <p>ROBERT RITCHIES sworn. - I am a watchman in St. Martin's parish: I was coming from the Hay-market, across St. James's Market, I heard a cry of stop thief; I looked up, and saw the prisoner, Yeomans, running; that is the man, (points to him); he was coming from the bottom of the Hay-market up James-street; I immediately pursued him, and about the middle of James-street, somebody crossing obstructed his running, and I immediately caught hold of him; when I had laid hold of him, I saw him throw away a watch; I saw the watch perfectly, he threw it into the middle of the street, near to the kennel, with his left-hand; the watch was picked up immediately, by some man who said, here is your watch, I cannot say who it was; the watch was brought to the watch-house by a person that is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure, that what the person threw from him was a watch? - A. Yes, perfectly.</p>
               <p>Yeomans. Q. Did I not come up the east side of St. James's Market with you? - A. No; I never saw him till I got almost into James-street.</p>
               <p>Yeomans. Q. Did you give the same account at Bow-street? - A. Yes, I did.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Winter.) Can you undertake to say, that every article in these two bundles came out of your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Among these various articles, what value do you set upon that property, independent of the watch? - A.The value I have set upon them is about ten pounds, but they are worth more than double that.</p>
               <p>Yeomans's defence. On the evening of the robbery, I had been down to Pimlico to see a friend of mine, in Eaton-street, that keeps a baker's shop there; on my return home, crossing St. James's-square, I came up Charles-street, and getting towards St. Alban's-street I saw the watchman, and two or three people; somebody said, that is him in blue; and running along Norris-street, I crossed over the Hay-market, a considerable crowd of people were running, I crossed over into James-street, and crossing the bottom of Oxendon-street, a stout man, with an apron on like a butcher, caught hold of me by the handkerchief, and stopped me; says I, you are mistaken, my friend, and he let me go; I stood still, and presently after, this watchman, and two or three more people, came up and collared me.</p>
               <p>Smith's defence. I have hardly any thing to say, I was fuddled; we neither of us expected our trials to come on so soon, and our friends are not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Clapham, and am one of the firm of Standing and Martin, carrying on business at Nine Elms—I know the prisoner—before January, 1864, I supplied bricks to him—he said he had</p>

               <p>taken a piece of ground in the Barking-road, and he was going to build a house there, and if we would supply him with bricks he would give us an assignment of the ground as security for the payment—we supplied him with two barge loads to the amount of about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we also made ourselves liable for building materials to the amount of about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received an assignment of the land—it is of no value until the house is built—I after<lb></lb>wards went to see the land; there was no building on it, and everything was moved away that had been taken there—the prisoner wrote to me about December, and I went down to him—he wanted us to send some more bricks—I said, No, I should not send any more bricks till I saw the others put in position on the ground—he came to us again in about a week's time—my partner was present—he repeated his request, and said, "Will you let me have another barge-load of bricks?"—I said, "Mr. Lowndes, this is the first transaction, you have done nothing at the work yet; you may be an honest man, but until I see you begin building I will not allow you to have any more bricks; when we know you are building, we will send you some more bricks"—if he had gone on in a proper way we should, of course have been glad to send them—my partner was sitting on the opposite side of the table and heard this—we had a customer of the name of Cham<lb></lb>pion of Mile-end, who was going to build at West Ham—I sold to him 30,000 bricks—I ordered those bricks from Messrs. Bazley White and Co. of Millbank and Erith—they were to be sent to Abbey Mills Wharf, West Ham—they were rough stocks, worth about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per thousand—the prisoner had no authority from us to receive those bricks; we informed him most distinctly that we would not let him have any more—shortly afterwards I received a complaint from Champion, in consequence of which I communicated with Bazley White and Co.—I then went to the ground in the Barking-road, where the prisoner was to have built—I did not then find that everything had been taken away; at my second visit I found all carted away except about 5,000 bricks; carts were then carting them away—the whole contents of the three barges had been carted away except about 5,000 stocks, and sold in various directions; I mean those that we had previously supplied as well as these—we have never been paid for the first lot.</p>

               <p>say that 30,000 were coming—I could not have said so, because they had not been ordered—I swear most distinctly and emphatically, that I said nothing of the kind—when the land was made over to me, I knew who the landlord was—I gave him notice of the assignment—the prisoner represented himself as a chemist—I supposed he wanted to build this house—I never knew him before—I never saw him building—the only thing I know about him is that he served some one at old Ford the same as he did us—I am not aware that we wrote to the prisoner demanding payment for the bricks when we found that they had not gone to the party they were intended for—I am sure we never asked him for the payment of these bricks, the subject of this indictment—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my partner's writing, and this other also—we did not at first treat this as a debt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer—I have worked for Mr. Lowndes, unloading bricks—on 12th January, I recollect the captain of a barge coming to my house—he asked me whether I knew who these bricks be<lb></lb>longed to—I told him I had been unloading bricks for Standing and Martin—I did not know Mr. Lowndes at the time—he showed me a paper—I told him I had unloaded some in that name—the captain said they were for the same party—after having this conversation I made a communication to the prisoner at his house, and told him about the captain coming to my house.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Fox-street, Aldersville—I went into the prisoner's employ on 31st December—on 4th January, Mr. Standing drove down to where I was at work, close against the Northumberland Arms, Bark<lb></lb>ing-road—he told me his name was Standing, and said, "Is your master here?"—I said, "No, sir"—he said, "You will do as well, "and he beckoned me, and I went out to him—he said, "You have not begun building yet?"—I said, "No, sir, we are waiting for rough bricks; there are 20,000 rough bricks coming, and 10,000 face bricks"—he said, "I can't see that there is any necessity to put the gentleman to that expense; there are plenty of face bricks here out of this lot, and there is a full freight coming up of 30,000 rough stocks"—he gave me sixpence for a pot of ale or porter, and said, "The barge of bricks will soon be up; as water will bring them up quick"—I went to meet the barge—I asked the captain who the bricks were for—he mentioned some names, but I cannot tell whose—I did not tell the prisoner afterwards what passed—I told the prisoner that Mr. Standing had been down, and that he wanted to see him, and I believe he met him that same afternoon—I afterwards told the prisoner what had passed between me and the captain of the barge; that was before the bricks were received—I met the barge coming up the creek, and I said to the man, "Are these bricks for the same man as the stocks were delivered for that were finished unloading on the Christmas morning, "and he said "Yes"—I think it was on the 4th that I saw Mr. Standing, and I think the barge came up on the Tuesday week following—I did not see Mr. Standing after the bricks were landed—I am not in the prisoner's employ now.</p>

               <p>layer; I am a labouring man—Beadle is the captain of the barge that brought up the 30,000 rough stocks—when I said to the captain, "Who are these bricks for?" I can't say what name be mentioned; I think it was Standing and Martin, or some name like that, and then I said, "Are they for the same man as had the barge delivered that was finished on Christmas<lb></lb>day?" and he said "Yes," and his mate said so likewise—I was not examined before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I recollect hearing a talk between Newman and a gentleman in January—I was listening to what they were talking about from where I was at work—Mr. Standing is the gentleman; he had a cigar in his mouth, and he was sorting the bricks, looking to see whether he could get any face-bricks out of the lot that was there—he said he did not think it was necessary for him to send any more bricks of that sort, for he thought there were face-bricks <hi rend="italic">enow</hi>, if they could be sorted out—Newman, who I have known to work in a brick-yard, said there could be some face-bricks picked out of them—I heard Mr. Standing tell Newman that there might be a barge load of hard stocks on the road, and if there was not, he would forward them on, for he could see they were wanted—I don't know whether he mentioned the number—he said they would get up as soon as the tide was big enough to let them—he gave Newman sixpence, and I helped to drink part of the beer.</p>

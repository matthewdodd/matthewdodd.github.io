                  </hi>. I am a ship's husbandman, and live at No. 1, Harbour-square, Stepney—on the 9th November, about 20 minutes past 12, I was at the top of St. Mary Axe, stopping by the Lord Mayor's procession, which was passing—it was not particularly crowded—the prisoner</p>

               <p>was standing on my left—I felt the guard of my watch jerked—my watch was in this position—upon looking down, I observed the prisoner's hands covering the guard in this manner—he called to some one by name, and stretched out his hand—I caught him in the act—I seized his hand, and called a policeman—I did not see anything in his hand at the time he was stretching it out to this other person, or before that—I observed the guard fall loose down from my waistcoat pocket—that was after he had stretched his hand out—I lost my watch—I never saw it again—I had seen it safe a few minutes before—I then gave the prisoner in custody—I could not recognise the other man, he was close to the prisoner, and a similar looking person in dress—I did not sec that man do anything with his hand.</p>

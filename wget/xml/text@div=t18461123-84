                  </hi>. I am a watch-glass maker, and live in Leman-street, Goodman's-fields; the prisoner was my apprentice; I employed him to cut the edges of watch-glasses, and paid him so much per gross for it. On the 29th of Oct. I delivered him two gross of watch-glasses—he said I might as well give him six dozen more—I handed them to another apprentice in the shop, and he handed them to the prisoner—there was no time specified for his bringing them back, but on the Saturday night he brought twenty-four dozen back—some of them were small ones, and mine were all large—I asked where the six dozen were—he said that was all that he had—I looked the goods over, and asked him about these small ones—he laughed at it, and said they were what I gave him—if these small ones had been mine there would still have been seventy-two wanting—I told him to receipt his bill,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184611230069"></xptr>
               <p>and I would pay him for what he brought, but I should expect the others to be brought forward—(he was still my apprentice, but he had been a bad boy, and sold his clothes, and I was to pay him for what he did out of doors)—he went away—I afterwards found him at No. 1, Bluecross-street—I found a man working at the same bench—I asked who had authorized him to work at that bench—he said he did, and he had set up in business—there are still six dozen of glasses unaccounted for.</p>

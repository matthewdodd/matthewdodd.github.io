                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler in Dudley Strret—a friendly league is held at my house—the prisoner was at. This meeting on Saturday, June 2nd—I closed my house about 12 o'clock that night—I was going to bed about 1 o'clock when a door was opened, forced by a chisel—I afterwards found this piece of candle which had been lighted—on going into the parlour I found the cheffonier had been opened, and the room was in a disordered state; I then went upstairs and found a chest of drawers had been broken open and things thrown about, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and two watches taken, one gold, and one silver; also two Albert chains, one gold and one plated, a silver guard, a locket, and a small knife—the articles produced are some of those I missed—the total value would be about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I mentioned the knife before the Magistrate on the first occasion; I do not remember being asked about it on the second—about thirty or forty persons attended the league—I found some of my property in possession of the police about 6 o'clock on the Sunday morning—the gold watch and chain are my wife's; I have known the chain eight years.</p>

On Sunday, the 3rd June, the prisoner was brought to Bow Street, about 12.30, I received information of this robbery from the last witness between 1 and 2 o'clock—I searched the prisoner and found on him a gold watch and chain, a gilt chain, two knives, a little knife and a sovereign, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and a shilling in bronze—he said he was in charge for disorderly conduct and did not see why he was</p>

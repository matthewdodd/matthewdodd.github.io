I had a boy in the month of March last: the boy had been ill, and went away. Some time about the beginning of March the prisoner took care of the bedding of the house. On the 15th of March, I turned her away, because she had grown lazy; she had been with me not more than three weeks. On the 17th of March, my wife missed a sheet that had been upon the boy's bed: the prisoner was found, and charged with taking the sheet; afterwards the other maid came to me, and desired three shillings upon the account of the prisoner at the bar; that the sheet had been pawned, and she wanted three shillings to redeem it. I gave the other maid three shillings, and I went to watch at a pawnbroker's; soon after the prisoner came there; she threw down the three shillings, and had the sheet, upon which I seized her, and charged her with stealing it: the sheet was pawned in my wife's name.</p>

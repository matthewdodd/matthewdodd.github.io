               <p>some which were not very expensive; he wished to look at some others, and I showed him a case containing more valuable ones—he examined many of them, and the young woman tried them on her finger; at last they selected one which they preferred, and, it being too large for her finger, it was agreed that it should be altered, and she gave me her wedding ring as a guide for the size—it was to be ready the next day—they were to call between 12 and 1 o'clock—before he left, the prisoner gave his name, Le Blane; I did not ask any address—the young girl addressed him as father—he shrugged his shoulders, and said the ring she preferred would be too expensive, and she said, "You told me, father, you would give me a good ring"—they were not very long in the shop—I have not the slightest doubt that the prisoner is the person—I saw him in Scotland Yard on the Saturday afterwards, amongst other persons; I identified him imme<lb></lb>diately—he was not pointed out to me, I selected him.</p>

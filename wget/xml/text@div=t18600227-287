Webb, Denison's Crown Cases—the allegation here was merely that it was in a certain public carriage; it did not go on to state that that carriage was then and there used for the conveyance of passengers, or for any public purpose, and, consistently with such an allegation, the carriage, though generally used for public purposes, might then be lying under some shed, or undergoing some repair in the carriage-house: the indictment was also bad for the further reason that although it alleged the exposure to be in the presence of another person, it did not allege that it</hi>

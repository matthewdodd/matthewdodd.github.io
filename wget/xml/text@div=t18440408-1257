                  </hi>. I am in the service of Thomas Cockett, a linen-draper, in Holborn. About a quarter to twelve o'clock, on the 12th of April, the prisoner came in the shop, and asked for some printed dresses—she was shown a great many—I beard what she said, and saw she declined purchasing some things—I saw her purchase four yards of lining—she was then about the centre of the shop—I was directly opposite her on the other side—I saw the young man measure the lining off for her—it came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she tendered a half-crown, but previous to that I had observed a projection under her cloak, and spoke to one of our apprentices, who told my employer—when she had received the parcel, and was about leaving, my employer went up to her, lifted her mantle, and taxed her with having some articles which were stolen, and he took from her these ten yards of cotton print—he asked what could induce her to do it—she said, "I wish to compromise the matter, and will pay you anything you think proper to set upon the dress"—the policeman was sent for, and she was given into custody—this is the dress—I saw it taken from under her shawl—it is my employer's.</p>

DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has Mr. Cockett any partner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the young man who served the prisoner is not here—I presume he showed her from sixty to a hundred dresses—she did not purchase any dress—I think it was not threatening for rain at the time—it rained that evening, but it was some hours afterwards—the article the prisoner has on now is what my master lifted up—it is what is called a cardinal; it comes down to her knees—she had no shawl on over that—she had a little shawl handker<lb></lb>chief in a small parcel, wrapped up—she gave it to the young man to enclose in her parcel, and he did so—I do not know what she said, as I was not pre<lb></lb>sent—I saw the young man fold up the shawl in the parcel with the lining, and it is here now—they were both folded in one piece of paper—I and my employer took this dress from the prisoner—it was just as it is now, as we keep it in the shop, not wrapped in any paper—she appeared very much flurried indeed when she was charged with having stolen this—her observation was, she did not know what tempted her to do it, and she offered to pay any sum—she said she would pay any sum, rather than go through the disgrace of having it known that she was charged with robbery.</p>

On the evening of the 9th of November I went into the bed-room on the ground-floor, and found the windows thrown open nearly to the top—I had not been into the room seven eleven o'clock in the morning—it was then a little way up—I missed from the bed the quilt, blanket, sheet, and night-cap, my husband's pro<lb></lb>perty—those produced are them.</p>

Between four and five o'clock, on the 9th of November, I went into the room—the front window was about four inches up—there was a nail which stopped it going up higher—I shut the window and door, and left it shut—there was a catch to it, but it would not hold—the things were safe in the room when I shut down the window—when I missed the property the nail was forced right out—I could not get the window down without taking the beading off—it was a strong nail driven into the wood, to keep the bottom sash from going above for inches from the bottom—I occupy the whole house.</p>

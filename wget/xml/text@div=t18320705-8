            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty at Colnbrook on Sunday night, the 27th of May, at eleven o'clock, and the prisoner came up to Colnbrook gate, with this pony; I asked where he brought it from; he said from Colnbrook, and was going a little further on the road, with a message, and to return again; about half-past twelve o'clock I overtook him again, within a mile of Hounslow - I then asked where he brought the pony from; he said out of Oxfordshire, but he did not say where, and in about five minutes he said he had been from Notting-hill to Eaton school, to deliver a message to a young gentleman; he was then going to London: I detained him, seeing the pony had neither bridle nor saddle, and in the middle of the day I had information that the pony belonged to Jones; I wrote to him - he came to Brentford next morning; I kept the pony till I delivered it up to him - I apprehended the prisoner in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been living with Lady Compton at Notting-hill; I went to Eaton-school, as mistress had turned me away, to beg his Lordship's pardon, and get myself back to my place again - I saw the pony in the road, and it being very late, I had a bit of string, and thought I would tie it round its neck and ride a little way - I never meant to make a property of it.</p>

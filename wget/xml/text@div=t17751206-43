               <p>Yesterday was three weeks (Friday) in the evening, the prisoners and myself, together with Grant and Bean, who are not taken, were all at one Mr. Hutchinson's, a wine-house, in Colchester-street, Whitechapel; we fat drinking there till two or three in the morning, then we talked of going home together: Davis, Bean, Grant, and I went on first, and Smith said he would follow us; we went on till we came to the dye-house: Grant said, here is a nice place to get some silk; we all consented to it, upon which Grant, who lived within forty yards of the place, went home and got an iron crow and some pick-lock keys, then we went up to an empty house, which is the next door; Grant undid the door, and we all went in: Grant opened a little window of the dye-house that looks into the yard; Bean and Grant got in, I stood by the window on the outside, Davis staid in the empty house: Bean and Grant gave me as much silk out of the window as they thought would be enough, and then they came out: we put the silk into a bag, and carried it to Grant's house, which is very near the place; I cannot tell the name of the street, and from thence we carried it to Stepney, and there Bean and Grant proposed to put it in a summer-house in a garden belonging to an empty house: Bean and Grant got over the wall; I handed the silk up to them, and they put it in the summer-house, where we left it.</p>
               <p>Was it wet or dry? - Quite wet: then we went to the Ship at Stepney, where we breakfasted; we staid there two or three hours, after which we went to an alehouse in Stepney Church-yard, and staid there till pretty near dark: then Grant said he knew a person that would buy it, one Wagstaffe, in Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street; he said he was a man that got his living by buying stolen silk: I asked Grant to go down to Wagstaffe and ask him if he would buy it; he said he did not like to go because the thief takers knew him, and if they saw him they would stop him: then I agreed to go, and they said they would go to the Black Dog, Mile-end Turnpike, and wait there while I went to Wagstaffe; we all came together to the Black Dog; it was dark when we came there: I bid them go in and wait till I came to them: I went to Whitechapel, and down Petticoat-lane, there I met Lamb Smith; I asked him where he had been, he said he had been to his sisters; I asked him to go with me to Angel-alley: when we came there, I desired Smith to go into the alehouse and ask for one Wagstaffe: Smith went in and enquired; Wagstaffe came out of the alehouse to me; I called him aside: I told him I came from Grant, who wanted to know whether he would buy this silk: Grant said he had sold him things several times; he said he had not money enough about him then to go with me, but any place I would appoint in two hours he would come to me; I appointed the Black Dog at Mile-end turnpike: then I called to Smith, who was about thirty yards off, and asked him to come along; he came with me to the corner of Bishopsgate-street: I then asked him to go with me to Whitechapel: as we were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060076"></xptr> going along in Whitechapel, I asked him to go to the Rose and Crown, next door to the White Raven in Whitechapel road, and wait about an hour till I came to him: I told him before I left him, that a gentlewoman was to come there to ask for me, and if she came before me to keep her there till I came: I then left Smith; he crossed the way to the Rose and Crown, and I went to the Black Dog, and told Bean, Grant, and

             I had seen Wagstaffe, and he would come in about two hours: in about an hour and a half, as nigh as I can guess, he came: Grant seeing him, went out to speak to him; after which Grant called us out, and bid me and Wagstaffe take a coach: there was a coach standing over the way: Wagstaffe and I went into the coach, and bid him drive us to the White Horse down the road: between the turnpike and White Horse Grant came up to the side of the coach, and said he would have us get out; I asked him the reason why, he said he believed Wagstaffe had beset us, in order for the thieftakers to take us: I said I did not believe any such thing; the coachman drove on to the corner of the White Horse that leads up to Stepney Church: I asked the coachman to drive up the lane that led up to the church, but he refused; he said he did not like to go out of the road; we paid him a shilling: Wagstaffe and I got out; then we met with Bean, Davis, and Grant, and we all five went along the fields to go to the summer house: Grant and Bean got over a fence to go a back way to the summer house, they got within twenty yards of the garden; then they came over the fence again, and said they had been robb'd: we went the same way we had been in the morning; when we came to the place there stood a coach; says Grant, I wonder what this coach is standing here for, I am sure it is for no good: they made a stop, and said they would not go for the silk at all: going by a public house I said let us go in and drink; we went in to drink, and there set Smith: after we had drank about a pot of beer, Bean said we will go up and see if the coach is there still, which we agreed to; they went: Wagstaffe staid about a quarter of an hour, and then went away, and left Smith, Davis, and me in the box together: we had not sat there half an hour before justice Wilmot's men came and took us three.</p>
               <p>Lamb Smith was not at the house when the house was broke open, and the silk taken away? - No: I did not see him till the next day, when I met him in Petticoat-lane.</p>

               <p>Was it Smith that told you this? - It was Lamb Smith that told me: I left him and went into the public house again, and told the landlord what had happened: he advised me to make an information before a justice, and he went with me to Mr. Wilmot's office; where I laid an information against Lamb Smith: I did not know any others that were concerned at that time. Mr. Wilmot's men and I went to the Black Dog, at the corner of the Dog-row, Whitechapel; when I went into the house, Lamb Smith came to me and asked me what money I had brought with me? I told him I had not above four or five guineas; he said I might leave the money with them and take the silk, and they would call for the rest in the morning; that the silk was in a summer house, and they must have a coach to fetch it away; I told them I would go and get a coach: justice Wilmot's men were round the house; I let them know the silk was in a summer house at Stepney, and bid them follow the coach to find it out: Fryer and I got into the coach and the rest walked.

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I attend justice Wilmot's office. On Saturday night, the 11th of November, I went in company with Ryder and Wagstaffe to a place they call the World's-end, at Stepney; there I saw Ryder take a quantity of silk out of a summer house; we brought it away.</p>
               <p>Do you know Fryer? - I do.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him you would give him two or three guineas to swear Smith was in this robbery? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never say what Wagstaffe was to have? - No.</p>
               <p>Not that he was to have six guineas, and had part of it already? - No.</p>
               <p>DAVIS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Somebody persuaded Fryer to swear against me to get the blood money of me, as they call it.</p>
               <p>SMITH's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I did no more than what Fryer asked me to do: I went with him to Angel-alley, he called this man out, I did not know what he said to him: there was a dyer's coat left at my mother's all over dye; I having that coat, which was proved to belong to Fryer, Ryder and Lewin swore it was my coat, and committed me to prison.</p>
               <p>LEWIN. I never was in his house.</p>
               <p>RYDER. Manwaring and I were at his house; we took up a dyer's coat, and his wife said it was his, I did not swear it was his.</p>
               <p>Davis called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wagstaffe. When you went towards the summer house, was Smith in company with you? - Yes; we went to a public house to drink.</p>
               <p>You did not find him sitting there? - No; he went with us.</p>

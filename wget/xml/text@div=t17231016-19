The Prosecutor depos'd, That the Prisoners came to his House one Night when he and his Wife were Abroad, and went up stairs, and that there they took his Buckles out of his Shoes, and that they were delivered to him afterwards by Daniel Soams. That when he, being at a Neighbour's House a drinking, came home, and being told by a little Boy, that Quilt Arnold took his Buckles out of his Shoes, and asking by what Authority they came there, Arnold reply'd, That they had Authority from Mr. Wild to take up the Prosecutor's Brother, who had forg'd a Note of 9 Guineas in his Name; that their Authority was such, they would have broken open the Door if they could. That his Door had been tampered with, and sending for the Smith to open the Door, a Key had been broken in it. This in part, was confirm'd by another Evidence. Soams pleaded, That he was desired by Mr. Wild to take one Bellamy, the Prosecutor's Brother, who had forg'd a Note of 9 Guineas in his Name; that going up to the Garret, and his Shoes standing there, Arnold said, he was in the Room, and seeing also his Clothes, he would have taken them; but took the Buckles out of the Prosecutor's Shoes, and push'd them upon him, and when the Prosecutor came and enquir'd for his Buckles, he gave them to him. Arnold pleaded, That be being drinking at an Ale-House, Mr. Wild desir'd him to go along with the Prisoner Soams to apprehend the Prosecutor's Brother, who he had been inform'd had forg'd a Note of 9 Guineas in Mr. Wild's Name, and that a Boy going up with them said, if he was not within, he was not far off, for there was his Shoes, and brought them to him; that Soams took the Buckles, and would have given them to him, but he return'd them to him again. Mr. Wild depos'd, That a Person came to him, informing him, That one Bellany, who it appears to be the Prosecutor's Brother, had forg'd a Receipt in his Name, and he, upon that, resolving to get him apprehended in order to bring him to Justice, the Prisoner Soams came and undertook to get him secur'd, upon which he sent the Prisoner Arnold with him to have got him secur'd, but gave no Order for the Searching the House. That their having enter'd the House rashly, and the taking away the Buckles, he could not justify that; but, that the Prisoner Arnold had been assisting with him in the apprehending One Hundred and Fifty Persons, the greater Number of which had been prosecuted according to Law; that he had been with him in the Houses of Persons, where were Things of very great Value, and never had known him guilty of taking any Thing. Soams call'd several Persons to him Reputation, who gave him a good Character, the Jury <rs id="t17231016-19-verdict105" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. My father, Lewis Cowan, is a soap manufacturer, in New Gravel-lane, Shadwell. The prisoner was in his employ about two years, and it was his duty to attend the soap while it was cooling—in consequence of information, on 9th Sept., in the morning, I concealed myself in the factory when it was his duty to come—he came, and after he had done his duty, he put on his coat, and took from a pile of soap three pieces, and deposited them in his pocket—I went out of the factory, and went after him, but lost sight of him—I found an officer, came up to the prisoner, and asked him if he had done his duty—he said, "Yes"—I said that with a view of detaining him till the officer came—the prisoner avoided me as soon as possible, and went down a court—I saw him again in a few minutes, went up to him with an officer, and he was taken into custody—I accused him at the station of stealing the soap—he said he did not take it—he was searched, and nothing found but a few crumbs of soap.</p>

I went with last witness's brother after the prisoner, and met him turning into the Highway—I told him I wanted him for robbing his master—I took him to the station, searched him, and found a few crumbs of soap in his coat pocket—he said all the men that worked in the factory were liable to have the crumbs in their pocket. (The prisoner received a good character.)<hi rend="smallCaps">

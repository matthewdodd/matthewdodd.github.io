                  </hi> I am a tailor, and live in Dolphin-place, Holborn. On the 17th of Aug. the prisoner and Jane Forfy came to my room, which is on the first floor—the prisoner struck her, because she would not go home with him when he desired her—I told him he ought to be ashamed to ill-use her in that manner—he then struck me in the mouth, and knocked me down—I had given him no provocation—I got up, took him by the collar of his coat, and wanted to put him out of doors—I half opened it—he put his foot to the door, closed it, and turned into the room again—he dropped on the floor, and picked up a pair of button-hole scissors—in wanting to get away from me he fell on the floor—I did not knock him down—he ran at me with the scissors, and stabbed me on the forehead, breast, arm, and groin—I still insisted on getting him out—I got him to the door several times, but could not get him out—he had the scissors in his hand all the time—I wrenched them out of his hands—he then fell on the floor, and picked up the large pair of shears, and stabbed me with them in the back, in two or three places, and on the left side—having so many stabs, and the blood pouring from the wounds, I was</p>

On Saturday night, the 17th of Aug., about a quarter to twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of Dolphin-place, saying, "Oh, dear! oh, dear! what shall I do?"—I said, "What is the matter?"—he said, "Oh, dear! a man has been knocking me about"—his hands were covered with blood—I asked him to show me where the man was that had been knocking him about—he went into Dolphin-place—directly he got in sight of No. 2, he pointed up his finger, and said, "That is where the man is that has been knocking me about"—he directly turned round, and said, "Oh, dear! oh, dear! what shall I do? I must go home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> "—about ten minutes after he was gone away in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, I went down my beat, went into Dolphin-place, and heard loud cries, "The man is stabbed"—I went into No. 2, and saw the prosecutor lying in his own blood—he was quite insensible—a surgeon was there at the time, and three or four women—the room appeared all overflowing with blood, a yard or more each side of him.</p>

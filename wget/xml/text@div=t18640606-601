                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector</hi>) On Saturday, 9th April, I went to Mrs. Enderby's house, and found that it had been broken into—on the 11th I saw Uppell at the police-court—I received a pair of boots from Booking, which I compared with the footmarks on the garden-bed by making an impression by the side, and they corresponded—I had them carefully preserved, and there was also a mark of a smaller foot—on Monday, the 16th I went to the house of Watts, in the Edge ware-road, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner, Mrs. Watts—I told her I had a search-warrant, and had come to search for stolen property—the man she lives with was not there—she went to a drawer and brought out a case, from which I took this tortoise-shell needle-case—I said, "This is very much like the one I am in search of, part of the proceeds of a burglary at 12, Neville-terrace"—she said, "That can<lb></lb>not be; it was given to me by my aunt at Dublin"—I said, "I must take you in custody, and make a further search"—I did so, and found in the drawer this cameo, these coins, some Roman pearls, and this pin-cushion—she said, "Do not take me, I will make a clean breast of it; they were given me by a man under remand at Hammersmith police-court; I do not know him by the name of Uppell; I believe his real name is Fletcher; I believe him to be a respectable man"—on a further search in the bedroom Sey<lb></lb>mour, in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> presence, found this little silver seal; in a box in another drawer I found this looking-glass—I said, "I shall take this with me"—she said, "Do not, it is my property, it belongs to my work-box"—I said, "Where <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the frame?"—she said, "It is broken up"—this chisel and other tools were found by Seymour, in my presence—I asked her about her hus<lb></lb>band; she said that he was at work—I sent for him and took them both in custody, but he was discharged on remand, having brought his master to prove he bore a good character—I received a pincushion from the female prisoner—when Uppell was brought up on remand, he said that he gave her the cameo and pincushion.</p>

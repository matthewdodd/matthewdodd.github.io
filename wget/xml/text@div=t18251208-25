In consequence of losses I gave him in charge, as he came out to go to dinner, in the passage, and called him into the parlour, where the officer was; I said he was wanted; he immediately put his hand into his breeches' pocket, and there we found two pieces of gold, weighing 1dwt.; he did not work at home; he admitted taking them from the melting pot two hours before, to give them to the foreman, who has the charge of the gold - the foreman works in all the workshops - there are four; I think he was in the upper shop; he said he intended giving them to the foreman when he saw him: they are worth 2s. 6d.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutor. Two days before the prisoner was taken I was melting, and left the pot with a small piece of gold in it, and on Friday morning I told the boy to take the pot out; the gold was then gone; this was about one o'clock, and the workmen had just gone to dinner; I had not seen it for two days before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was going out at the usual dinner hour? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there any difficulty in his telling you where the gold was? A. No; I was in the melting-room; I do not know when I last saw him that morning.</p>

            . I am street-keeper of Cripplegate. The prisoner was coming through the passage to go out, when I stopped him. Mr. King said he had lost a great deal of gold, and told me to search him; he seemed agitated; I found the gold in his pocket; he did not tell me what he was going to do with it; he said he found it on the bench, and meant to return it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked it up on the forge, and put it into my pocket, to return it when I saw the foreman - I had not seen him when I went to dinner.</p>

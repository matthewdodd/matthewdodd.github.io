                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist, in the Queen's—road, Dais ton. I have known Miss Johnson, the prisoner, since the early part or the middle of April—she has been in the habit of coming to my shop and having prescriptions dispensed—on 27th May, she came and asked me to cash this promissory—note (<hi rend="italic">produced—read</hi>—"London, 27th May, 1851. Ten days after date, I promise to pay to Mary Johnson, or order, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. J. Black wood and Sons—at Messrs. Childs' and Co.)—I gave her 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and gave the note to somebody to present—it was returned to me unpaid—it was due on 7th June—I made inquiry about it, and about 16th June had reason to believe it was a forgery—Miss Johnson soon after came to the shop; I told her I had sent it to Black wood's, and they declared it to be a forgery—she seemed quite alarmed and surprised, and not at all aware of it, and made some remark that she must have been imposed upon, or something of that sort, and that she would go immediately to Black wood's—I wished a friend of mine to go with her; and Mr. Davis, who is now here, went—I saw her again in the evening, and she professed her readiness to go next morning to ask the advice of friends, and seemed in great distress about it—she came next morning, and I went with her in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the house of a baronet, in Cambridge—square—she went into the house (I waited in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>), she stayed about twenty minutes, came out again, but said nothing; and we went to the house of another gentleman, in Mount—street—she was told he was not at home; and we went to the house of a nobleman, in Charles—street, Berkeley—square; he was not at home, and we returned to Dalston—she then proposed going to ask the advice of a Mr. M'Kenzie, an attorney, living at River terrace, Islington—I drove there with her; she went in, and when she returned, Mr. M'Kenzie came to the door with her—that was all I saw of him—we then returned, and I gave her into custody.</p>

I happened to be in Mr. Senior's shop when the prisoner was told these bills were forgeries, and in consequence of her saying she would go to Black<lb></lb>wood's, I went with her—we did not take the bills—we there learnt that Mr. Langford, the manager, was gone to dine with Messrs. Blackwood's, in Pall Mall—I did not say anything about the bills, but we went to Pall Mall, and saw two of the Messrs. Black wood's—I mentioned the circumstance that brought us there, and they said they could say nothing about it; they had placed the matter in the hands of a solicitor—they had heard of it before, as I had previously presented the bills there—the prisoner said she had received the bills from them.</p>

I am the prisoner's mother, and am the widow of the rector of Out well, in Norfolk; he died in 1848, having pre<lb></lb>viously gone to Leamington for his health—I have one son, and three daughters; the prisoner is the eldest daughter—about four, or five, or six years ago, I first began to notice a peculiarity in her manners—she has been very highly educated, and for the last two or three years has taken very much to literary pursuits—she has been constantly reading and writing, but prin<lb></lb>cipally writing, night and day—she was too restless at night to remain in the same room with me—in consequence of noticing her excitability and restless—ness, and her getting no rest at night, I called in Dr. Babbington, of Leamington, who had attended my husband—before I noticed these peculiarities, she was of an affectionate nature, but excitable; and, for the last few years, has fancied that I ill-treated her, and was always injuring her—there was no ground for imagining that—she has told me that I was not a fit person to be with her, I was not of sufficient literary attainments—once, when she was in an extreme state of excitement, she bolted me and her younger sister in my room—I have often heard her mention "Blackwood's Magazine," and she has put it down on paper that Blackwood's owed her money for writing—she</p>

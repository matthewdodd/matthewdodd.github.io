                  </hi>. I live at No. 108, Pennington Street, and am a widow. On the night of 9th April, I went to bed, leaving my house locked up—I was the last person up, and saw everything was fastened—my attention was called to my kitchen the next morning, about half past 6 o'clock, by one of my lodgers—the kitchen window was open—I had fastened it the night before—threepanes of glass were broken—there was no latch to the window—I missed a shirt that was on the line in the back kitchen—when I went to bed the water pipes, were quite safe—they laid upon the wall in the morning—theywere cut clean off—I afterwards saw the shirt; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—thewater pipe, and the pieces which had been taken off, fitted together.</p>

I took him to the station, searched him, and I found on him a blue shirt, ten keys, a knife, a tobacco box, and a parse—at the station house, he said he was guilty of taking these things—the keys are skeleton keys, used in enter<lb></lb>ing houses—he got in at the back wall into the yard, and then into the back kitchen—it might be done with very little trouble, and would not take long—Iwas at the Police Court when he was examined—he said he would be the death of "Childs," if ever he was set at liberty again.</p>

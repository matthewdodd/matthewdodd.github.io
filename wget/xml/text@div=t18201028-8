On the 16th of October, about nine o'clock in the evening, I was coming from the stage, which I had been to meet to get a newspaper, and close by my gateway the prisoner rushed violently against me, and with one hand struck me, and with the other drew my watch out. I called Stop thief! and followed him, but I being lame he got off - it was very light. I am sure he was the man - he lived in the neighbourhood. I described him to Upton.</p>

            . I am an officer. Ricket informed me of the robbery, and described the prisoner; he said he thought he could swear positively to him. I waited at his father's house till one o'clock in the morning, he did not come home. I found him next night at home, abed; I found nothing on him. Ricket identified him immediately at the office.</p>

            . On the 23d of May, about six o'clock in the evening, I was at the <placeName id="t18130602-127-crimeloc680">Adam and Eve, Tottenham-court-road</placeName>

After he drank what they had got he came and took my hat off my head; he wanted to put another hat on my head, but I would not have it. The prisoner went out of the tap-room with my hat on his head. I went after him; he said, I am not gone, you need not walk after me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay hold of him - A. No; I did not like for fear I might be ill-used. There was an officer on the other side of the way. I gave charge of one of the men that was with the prisoner; he told the officer where the prisoner lived. The officer went after the prisoner and took him.</p>
               <p>- HOOPER. I am an officer. I received information that a person had lost his hat. I immediately ran over to the Adam and Eve. I apprehended a man on suspicion; I told him I should take him to the watchhouse; and as we were going along to the watchhouse, he told me if I would not take him there he would tell me where the hat was. He told me the hat was at Paddington; the person was gone there. I went to Paddington. I met the prisoner with the hat on his head. I asked the prisoner if that was his hat on his head; he said, no, it was not his hat, he had taken it from the prosecutor in fun; he was going to return it. I took him in custody. I asked him if he knew the prosecutor; he said no, he had never seen him before.</p>

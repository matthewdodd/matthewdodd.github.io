               <p>Q. Did you lose a glass oil cover at any time. - A. Yes; the last time I saw it was within three months of the present time; it was not sold, because a part of it was defective; it was put in a glass case in the back shop; it is worth about six or seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Arabin. You had not seen this for some time before the 10th of July; you say it is defective, and therefore it being not a complete article it could not be sold; have you not many servants that serve in the shop - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They may have sold it for any thing you know, though it is not usual. - A. All the servants that ever sell are here, they can speak to their own knowledge; the prisoner was a <rs id="t18070701-90-deflabel550" type="occupation">cleaner of glass</rs>

            . I am an officer of Hatton Garden. On the 10th of June, about ten o'clock at night, I received information that a parcel of people frequented the lodgings of the prisoner, at his mother's in Lilley-street, Saffron-Hill; they have only one room in the one pair of stairs; there I found the glass article in a box, among some old rags. The prisoner was laying in bed, there was two bed, there was two bedsteads there; I asked him whose glass oil cover that was, he said it was his, and he worked for Mr. Parker and Mr. Perry. I have shewed the glass oil cover to Mr. Perry, he claimed it. The prisoner said he was allowed all the glass that was cracked; I said here is not all cracked glass here.</p>

The prisoner slept in the same room, but not in the same bed, with me, for about a month. On the 26th of May I got up at half-past six o'clock in the morning, and went out, leaving my watch and the other articles stated in the indictment, locked in my box - the prisoner was then in bed - an officer came to me afterwards. I went home, found my box broken open, and the property gone. I saw my watch found, concealed in the knee of the prisoner's trowsers, at the office.</p>

            . My husband, Matthew Hayden, rents this house - it is in St. George's parish; the prisoner and prosecutor lodged in the same room. On the 26th of May, I heard the prisoner go out at a quarter-past seven o'clock. I went into the room about eleven, and found Bulkley's box broken open, and the things strewed about. I went and informed the officer - the prisoner was taken that day.</p>

            . I am a constable of the Thames Police. I received information of the prosecutor, who is my brother, being robbed. I went and informed him - then went and found the prisoner at the Three Crowns, public-house, Wapping - he had shifted his dress, and held his head down but, I shoved his head up, and my brother identified him - he resisted a good deal, and would not be searched but - at the office we at last found the watch in his trousers - after we had got him, before the Magistrate - it took four of us to hold him to be searched - the other property is not found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not search him before he was examined? A. I tried to do it but could not.</p>

            . This is my watch. I have had it twelve weeks - it cost me six guineas, and is worth 4l. - the property together is worth 15l. He had come from the country a month before, and I allowed him to sleep in my room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went out about a quarter of an hour after him, and left the door ajar. I went to two shops for work - could get none, and in returning I found the door open - the watch laid on the mat, and I took it - not thinking anything of it - but at last, as I had left the door open, I thought it might be laid to me - fear over came me, and I did not know what to do - if I had taken the clothes some money would have been found on me. I have only been from Scotland a short time.</p>

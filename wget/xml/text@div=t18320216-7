On the 11th of January I had occasion to go into the Manchester warehouse, and observed a piece of silk placed in a box there which had been done with; I never knew a piece of silk kept in that warehouse before - this created my suspicion, and I gave information to Mr. Pearce; he took it out, unrolled a few yards of it, and I marked it - Mr. Pearce replaced it in my presence, and next day I was watching; about five o'clock I observed the prisoner standing in the warehouse - he came nearer to the box, and took out the piece of silk; I was concealed - he forced out the block on which the silk was rolled; he put the silk up the back part of his coat, under his coat, and walked away; I gave information to Mr.

I was sent for on the 12th of January to the prosecutors' counting-house; the prisoner was present - Mr. Stone said he suspected him to have a piece of silk under his coat; the prisoner said nothing to it - I searched him, but did not find the silk or any thing which could be identified; I went up to his bedroom with him, and searched a box which he pointed out as his - it was locked, and he had the key in his pocket; I asked him to point out his box - I opened it, and the first thing I found was this piece of silk, which I have had ever since, and now produce; I found other property there.</p>

            . This piece of silk is our property - I know it by this mark, which was made by Martin, in my presence; I was present on the 11th of January, when he found it in the box - it was taken the next day; there are seventy yards and three-quarters of it - the cost price is 2s. 3d. per yard, which would amount to between 7l. and 8l.; our warehouse is under the same roof as the dwelling-house, and in the parish of St. Martin in the Fields.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you not more than one house? A. One front is in Cockspur-street, and the other in Pall-mall, East - it is the same house; I reside in the Cockspur-street front - all the young men belonging to the establishment sleep in the house, but neither of my partners sleep there; we have ninety-one young men - part sleep in one front, and part in the other; I pay to the firm the same amount for rent as they are allowed for their houses elsewhere - the whole building belongs to the firm, and is charged to the firm; we pay a ground rent to the Crown - the firm charge me 225l. for rent, and my partners are allowed that amount for their dwelling-house elsewhere; the firm pay the ground rent, which is 400l. and odd: the firm built the house - the warehouse is on the basement story.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do the young men feed in the house? A. Yes, at the expence of the firm: the prisoner came to us on the 16th of September last, with a good character.</p>

               <p>at Woolwich. The prisoner was employed there under me for about three years and a half—I have examined the pieces of leather produced—I believe they belong to the Queen—there are two pieces distinctly marked with the broad arrow—an attempt has been made to efface it—they are such as the prisoner would have access to.</p>

I let out four rooms ready furnished; the prisoners hired one room furnished of me about four months ago; they came together and passed as husband and wife; they owe me five weeks' rent; on the 24th of February they were taken into custody; I had asked them several times for their rent, and they answered me snappishly, that they would pay me one of these odd days; a number of loose characters came there, which I did not like, and I spoke to them about it; they said they would have who they pleased; I went up into the room when they were not there, and missed these articles stated; I spoke to an officer, who took them while they were at the street door, just going out; they said they should replace the things if I had patience.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. Were you the person who let these lodgings? A. Yes; I and my wife together; I brought in a new bed, which cost me 3l. 10s., the same night they said they would replace the things; the man was away nearly all day; I believe he had a good character; he worked for a Mr. Cundy.</p>

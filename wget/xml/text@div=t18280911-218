The prisoner lodged with us from the 26th of April last - I believe she is married; I had a pelisse, which I kept in a chest under the counter - she saw me put it in there about two months ago, and she said "I wonder you are not afraid of trusting your pelisse there;" I found it on the 30th of August at a public sale shop; the prisoner had not left my apartment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You know that this young woman surendered himself up? A. Yes - I believe the Magistrate bailed her; I saw a woman named Campbell when I went for the pelisse; it was in consequence of her describing the prisoner so plainly, that I had her taken up - she said she was a tallish genteel person, with a smiling eye, and a pleasant countenance, and followed the dress making; I do not know that there was another woman who saw me put this pelisse into the chest - I never wore it; I have only men cooks and butlers, and such people in the house, except a woman and her daughter who sell milk; the daughter saw me put it into the chest about a week before I lost it, which was on the 27th of August.</p>

            . My husband is a butler in a family, and I keep a sale shop. This pelisse was sold to me on the 27th of August, by the prisoner for 10s. - it is a crimson silk velvet; I am sure she is the person I bought it of - I had not known it before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know her name before? A. No - I always said she was the person; I was examined before the Magistrate, and I said the first time that I was positive she was the woman - I did not say I only believed it, but could not swear positively to her - I never said so in my life; I said once I was not positive the woman, because she was in a disabille.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you mean by saying you were not positive as to her person? A. I said to Mrs. Atkinson "I don't think she is the person;" but I knew at the same time that she was the person.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Upon your oath, were you not so little convinced that she was the person that you went to look at another? A. Yes, I did not want to go, but Mrs. Atkinson said "Would you like to go and look at another person."</p>

            . I lost my Horse the 20th of March, and advertised him, but could not hear any thing of him: But on the 4th of April, as I was going from my House towards Turnham Green, I saw the Chesnut Gelding going by me with a Clog on; the Prisoner met me at the same time, and both he and the Gelding went out of the Way I was walking; but I cast my Eye after him, and saw him pull a Bridle from under his great Coat, or from under his Arm, and put it upon the Horse:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173905020009"></xptr> Then I went up to him, and he call'd me by my Name; I asked him his Name, and where he lived? He told me his Name was Sedgewick, and that he lived hard by one

             upon the Green. I told him, I had lost a Gelding some time ago, and if he could give me any Account of it, I would satisfy him for his Pains. I likewise asked him if he knew of a low-pric'd Horse fit for my Business, that was to be disposed of: Why, (says he) here's a Horse that will do your Business very well; and that was Mr. Hall's Horse, that I had just seen him put the Bridle upon. When the Prisoner was put into the Round-house at Chiswick, he told us he would make an open Declaration if we would take him to a Publick House; we carry'd him to an Alehouse, and there he told me he had disposed of my Horse at a Place call'd Plumb-street, about a Mile beyond Woolwich, to a Man whose Name he did not know, but his Wife (he told me) lived at the Bell in Kent-street. I went into Kent-street, and by enquiring in the Neighbourhood I learn'd that the Woman's Name was Battersea, and that her Husband kept an Ale-house in Plumb-street. My Horse was not a Brown-bay; it was a Dark-brown, almost a Black; and I found him in Plumb-Street, in Battersea's Close, upon which I had a Warrant for him, and the Justice order'd me my Horse again, and I brought him home; but he was again stole away last Saturday was se'nnight.</p>

            . I have had Satisfaction for my Horse; I never had him again: But I lost him on or about the 16th of January out of our Grounds. When the Prisoner was taken, he was had to the Constable's House, and confess'd that he and his Comerades took the Horse out of our Fields at Chiswick. Ours was a grey Gelding, and was in a Field call'd Manor-house-Field: The Prisoner told me, that as there were more Horses in that Field, his Companions would have taken more, but he would not suffer them. He own'd he had sold our Horse to a Man that keeps a Linnen-draper's Shop at Rochester; I went down to him, and he told me, he believed he had bought the Horse of the Prisoner, and rather than have any Trouble, he was willing to make me Satisfaction for it.</p>

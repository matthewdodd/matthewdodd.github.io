                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—we have been married ten years next Oct.—he is a coal-porter—on Tuesday, the 17th of March, I sent my little girl to him for a penny to get a pennyworth of bread—he came to me about three o'clock in the afternoon, as I was sitting at the Oxford Arms public-house in Church-street, Deptford—I then asked him for a penny—he did not give it to me—he went and brought in a pint of beer—he drank it himself—I had none of it—he then knocked me down, and tore my bonnet and my things off my back—I had said nothing to him, but asked for a penny to get a pennyworth of bread for the child—on my asking him for a penny, he knocked me down—I left the house and went towards Deptford-bridge—he did not follow me, but I heard he was in the Clock-house, and I went to him—he was having part of a pint of beer—this was at night, and quite dark—I cannot tell the time exactly—it might be between six and seven o'clock—he ill-used me two or three times there, and knocked me down two or three times, and I ran out of there—I had only asked him if he meant to give me the penny, and he said, no—I remained all night in the street—the following morning I saw him again at the Coke-ovens—I did not speak to him—I had not time, for he came up and ill-used me again—he knocked me down—about nine o'clock the same night, or later, I went to the Oxford Arms, in Church-street, and the pri<lb></lb>soner came in—he beckoned to me a great many times—I did not go to him—he</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the landlord of the Oxford Arms, Church-street, Deptford—on Wednesday, the 18th of March, I saw the prisoner and his wife in the tap-room—I saw them close together—they were quarrelling—I saw the woman with her hand to her throat—I said to the prisoner, "Mr. Thorpe, what are you going to do, are you going to murder your wife, you ought to be ashamed of yourself"—I put my hand to him, and said, "Get out of the way, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, I will go and fetch a policeman"—he did not make any answer, I went and fetched two police<lb></lb>men, but he was in custody before we returned—I followed them to the station-house—as we were going there he said "I do not care if I get three months, when I get out I will do it for you—it is not the first or second time that I have attempted it, "and he said, "If I get seven years, when I come out I mean to do it for you, for I mean to be hung; I mean to do it for you if I am hung for it"—he had been drinking—he was not sober; the knife was taken from him at the station-house—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I think he has been driven to it by his wife; she is a very bad character.</p>

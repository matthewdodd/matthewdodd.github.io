               <p>I live at the sheeps head shop, in Turnmill-street.</p>
               <p>How far is that from Broad-yard? - Close to it, the last witness is my sister; on Sunday the 19th of October, she and I were looking out of window a little before four o'clock, I saw two men go down the street with large bundles under their arms, and in about ten minutes after, they came down the street again.</p>
               <p>Do you know any of them? - To the best of my knowledge I think the prisoner was one of them.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he was one of them? - To the best of my knowledge I think he as.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him before? - Not to notice him much, I do not think I ever have; I saw him at the Rotation-Office about a fortnight ago, I then said, to the best of my knowledge I believed him to be the man.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by the best of your knowledge; can you be sure that he was the man, or that he was not? - I think to the best of my knowledge that he is the man; when I saw him again, I thought I knew him again.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man, or have you any doubt of it? - No, I have no doubt of it at all but he is the man.</p>
               <p>You are sure he is the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say so at the Justices? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What opportunity had you of observing him at the time? - Because seeing them pass in sermon time made me take more particular notice of them, as they went down the street, and came up again, and the other stopped and tied up his garters, and Rich crossed the way.</p>
               <p>Did you see these men's faces? - I could see Rich's face very plain, he had a cocked hat on, but the other had a hat over his face.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She said at the Justice's, that she could not swear I was the person, she said I had my hair curled? - His hair was in curls in his neck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never wore my hair any otherwise than it is now.</p>
               <p>Court. What clothes had he on? - A white coat, a black waistcoat, and a cocked hat.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing further? - Nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman. On the morning of the 3rd of De<lb></lb>cember, about two o'clock, I met the prisoner—I went with her to Mrs. Bryant's, in Unicorn-square—I had my watch and five sovereigns, six half-sovereigns and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver in my watch-pocket—I did not give her any thing—we disagreed about money—I went to bed—she was the only person then in the room—I awoke about eight—the prisoner was then gone, and I missed my money—I was rather intoxicated when I went there—there was no one in the place, but the landlady put the key under the door—I then got out, went to a public-house, and made my complaint.</p>

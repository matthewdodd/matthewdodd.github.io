            . I am servant to George Smith, the prisoner; he lives at Woodcock-hill, near Edgware, and keeps a beer-shop - I have been with him half a year. I saw Wells come to my master's house on the morning of the 16th of December, about half-past six o'clock; he brought a black mare - I saw him riding her; he came up the gateway into the yard - she had no saddle; she had a bridle on - I took her in; Freeman was in the house at the time - Smith was not up; I took the mare into the stable, and tied her up; she remained there all that day, and the next night - my master got up soon after Wells came; I saw them together afterwards - they went to the stable, and just looked at the mare as they passed by - my master said something about the mare, but I did not rightly understand it; he said something that I was to do with her, but I did not hear what he did say; she was afterwards put into the hog-trough field, which is one field from the road - I know all Smith's fields; he has no other field, but what comes up to the road; he had his own cows and beifers in a field adjoining to this one - I saw the mare in the field, but I had no charge of her; I did not hear any thing said about her breaking out of that field - I did not turn her on the common; the last time I saw her in the field was on the Saturday before Christmas, to the best of my knowledge; she was brought on the 16th, and turned out on the Saturday; she staid there till the next Saturday - I did not turn her out, but I saw her after she was turned out by some one; there was a gateway, leading into the field she was in, before she went in, but no gate; after she was in there were two rails and a post put up - there is a wood by the side of that field; I do not think cattle can be seen in that field from the road without people take particular notice; I think I saw Wells at my master's about three months ago, the first time, and he has been frequently there since - he has stopped there two or three times: he sat in the same room, and drank and associated with my master - I remember Mr. Bull coming to my master's on the Monday morning after Christmas; I cannot say what time it was - no, it was Tuesday morning; I saw Bull and my master talking together as I went by the door; I did not know that Mr. Bull came to arrest my master - my master sent me down the road to call Mr. Morris; I have seen Mr. Morris at my master's, but not very often - I went to Wilsden, and Mr. Southernwood showed me the same mare that Wells brought to our house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How much room have you for horses? A. Enough for about three or four in the stable; the mare did not have any corn - I did not hear what my master said about her, and cannot exactly say whether he spoke to Wells or to me; I did not put her into the field; my master had no other servant but me - I did not see any carpenter or labourer at work; I thought Mr. Freeman and master put up the rails and post at the gateway; Mr. Freeman was there that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are your master's fields all grass? A. Yes; he takes in cattle to graze - I was with him at the time of Barnet-fair; he might have one hundred cattle there then - none of them belonged to Wells- this hog-trough field is drier than the others; there were cows in the further field - the mare might be put in the hog-trough field, because it was dryer; my master's house joins the road - his stable joins the house, and there is a gateway by the side of the house, which leads to the stable - I do not know whether they wanted to conceal the mare; I would not have taken it in if I had known it had been stolen - I have seen other persons drinking with my master besides Wells; he has drank with drovers - many people, who keep public-houses, sit down and drink with their customers; I was in bed when Wells went away - the mare remained there; a rail or something must have been put up to prevent her from getting from one field to another, and these rails were put up after she was turned into the field; all the fields were wet, but that was the driest.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then your master preferred this mare to his own cows? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by saying just now that you believed Freeman put up the rails? A. There was no one there but him and master.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sworn before the Magistrate that Freeman put them up? A. No; I made my mark before the Magistrate.</p>

            . I am constable of Tring. On the 26th of December I went to Mr. Child's, at Edgwarebury, about half-past eleven o'clock at night: I got assistance and started again at twelve, to find this mare - from the information I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050021"></xptr>received, I and three assistants beat all the fields round this hog-trough field, till four in the morning: about four we came to Smith's house - I called him up, and said I wanted a mare that Wells had brought to his house; he looked out at window, and said he did not know a man by the name of Wells - I am quite certain of that, but he said he knew a man of the name of Shepherd - he got up and came down, in as short a time as a man could well get up; he came down, and I went in and told him he was my prisoner - he immediately called up Kirby, to go and fetch Mr. Morris, and after some considerable time Morris came, but I told Smith I could not stop any longer, and I should go if he did not come; after I got him out in the lane, and made him secure as a prisoner, Morris came- there was some conversation between them, but I cannot tell what they said; he said before Morris came, that the mare had been brought there, but he had never seen it since Saturday evening - I said, "It is very odd you should take in a mare to keep, and not know what has become of it, and a mare of the value of 20l. or 25l.;" he still persisted that he did not know what had become of it from that time - I then took him, as a prisoner, down to Edgware, and then to Tring: he said we might have his horse and cart to go to Barnet to fetch Freeman - I knew Wells; he is a man who goes about buying rotten sheep and such sort of things, and is sometimes on the parish.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ask him who took the mare away? A. Yes, over and over again, and he said he did not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say Smith got up as quick as a man could? A. Yes; we had been hunting about in the dark for this mare, but could not find it - I do not think that was because it was dark: we beat the fields almost as close as a gentleman would for game - Smith said he knew a person who went by the name of Shepherd; he did not deny having had the mare there - he did not offer me every assistance to find it; I do not remember that I was asked that question by the Magistrate - I swear he did not offer me any assistance to go round his grounds to see for the mare; he offered me his horse and cart to go to Burnet to find Freeman - he acknowledged the mare was there till the Saturday night before Christmas, about four or five o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he mention when she first came there? A. He said a man of the name of Shepherd brought her there, but I do not believe he mentioned the day of the week or the month.</p>

               <p>Smith's Defence. Wells brought the mare to me three weeks ago last Friday morning, before I was up; my man took her in, put her into the stable, and gave her a bit of hay - I said, when I got up, "Shepherd, you are forward;" he said, "Yes, I have brought up a horse for a friend of mine, who has been distrained on for rent, and he wants to put it here for a few weeks;" I said, "I don't know what to do, I have but one field that is dry;" I said to him in the course of the day, "Shall I turn her out?" he said,"No, the mare is hot, she may as well stop to-night," and she was turned out the next day into the hog-trough field, which is the driest I have got.</p>
               <p>MRS. GOODMAN. I live at Smith's; I am his wife's mother - he keeps a public-house, under the new Act. I remember Wells going away after he brought this mare, and I heard him say to Smith, "Take care of my mare Mr. Smith till I come again, and that will be in the course of next week" - he paid me his reckoning; Mr. Smith often drinks with his customers; he is in the habit of taking in cattle - he uses his grass-land in that way after he has got his hay in; I think he had six or seven hundred cattle at the time of Barnet fair - I knew Wells by the name of Shepherd.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Wells was well known to you? A. No, not very well, I have known him from eight to ten weeks - he may have been there five or six times; Mr. Smith has kept this beer-shop since April.</p>

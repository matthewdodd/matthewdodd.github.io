I knew the deceased Daniel Mathews—I worked with him—I saw him at Mr. Collins', where he worked, on the 26th of March, the day this happened—I saw him every day—he had been complaining of ill health before that time—he had been complaining for a week before the blows were struck—he was complaining of a pain in his head—he said he had been ailing in his head for some time—I do not know how long before his death it was that he began to complain—I did not see the blows struck.</p>

                  </hi>. I knew the deceased many years—on Friday even<lb></lb>ing the 26th of March, he came to the Hare and Hounds North-End, Hamp<lb></lb>stead—he called there coming home from Smithfield Market—he was not tipsy, he had had a little drop of drink—a few minutes after, the prisoner and Moss came in—they had a pot or two of porter together—Smith went away and returned afterwards rather the worse for liquor, and seemed very quarrel<lb></lb>some the deceased was still there—I heard Smith call the deceased a b—y old <hi rend="italic">snot</hi>—deceased said, "You <hi rend="italic">snotty</hi> old monkey, do you know you are calling a man names, old enough to be your father and grandfather?"—the prisoner then went across and struck him over the eye and twice on the head, and with the second blow his head went against the boards—there were only two blows struck—I went to my seat to assist him—he got up as well as he could and went out and called "Police"—he looked very pale indeed—I do not think I saw him on the Saturday—he complained on the following Thursday—he never complained to me, but he looked very white when he went out.</p>

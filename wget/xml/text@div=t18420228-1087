I am a seaman of the Abercrombie—I was at the Fishing Smack public-house at Deptford, on the 9th of February—the prisoner and another soldier came in—I then went to the King's Arms public-house—I sat between the two soldiers—the prisoner was on my right hand—in my pocket I had a sovereign, two half-crowns, some shil<lb></lb>lings, and some halfpence—I counted it at the fire, and sat down and called for a pot of beer—the soldiers drank it—I called for another—I put my hand in my pocket and missed my money—the prisoner got up and was going away—I caught hold of him and gave him to a policeman—while I was sitting down I had felt him rub against my jacket pocket—then was no other person by my right side but the prisoner—there was a penny</p>

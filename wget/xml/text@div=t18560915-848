                  </hi>. I am clerk to Croskey and Co., ship brokers, Gracechurch-street. About 6 o'clock in the evening of 29th Aug., I was standing in Crutched-friars, looking at two or three men who were putting up a crane at a warehouse—I was speaking to a man on my right hand side, a stranger; after I had done speaking to him, I turned my head round, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150003"></xptr>
               <p>found my watch in the prisoner's hand—I turned round partly to look at the crane again, and partly feeling my waistcoat pocket a little lighter than usual, the prisoner was standing on my left hand side; the watch was taken from my left hand waistcoat pocket—I took the watch from him, and gave him into custody—I called a policeman, and held him till the policeman came—I did not hear what he said to the officer—there was an Albert chain attached to the watch—it was hooked into the button hole of my waistcoat—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is silver, the chain is gold—the chain was not broken, the watch was in the prisoner's, hand, and the chain still hooked in my waistcoat; it was not separated—the chain remained in my waistcoat, and the watch was in his hand, attached to the chain—I felt no pull, only my pocket lighten; the watch is rather heavy, and I missed it.</p>

On Saturday, the 1st of June, about half after three, the tea-pot was sent to me, by Mr. Stroud in Burleigh-Street, Exeter Change, The boy left it, and desired it might be done on Monday, I promissed it should; the boy went away. About five o'clock the same day the prisoner came to me in a violent prespiration, and said he came from Mr. Stroud; I asked him what he came for, he said a silver tea-pot; I asked him who brought the pot, he said a boy; I asked him what kind of a boy, he said a boy that was commonly called cribbage faced; I asked him why he called him cribbage face, he said because he was pitted with the small-pox.</p>

            Was the boy pitted with the small-pox - A. Yes, he is. I asked him then, what dress the boy had on, he said a brown jacket; I asked him to describe the nature of the tea-pot; he said certainly he could, for a shopmate of his which stood by gave it the boy. He described it as hear upon the interogations for me to suppose that he had a knowledge of the pot and that he was sent. I asked the prisoner why he came in so short a time after it was left, when it was promised on Monday, he observed that the pot came from Mr. Ellis, in Oxford-street, and Mr. Ellis finding that it would not be done till Monday, he had sent for the pot. Then I delivered him the pot. My wife looked out of the two pair of stairs window, she asked me whether the prisoner had the tea-pot; I said yes, she said that man spoke to the boy at the door before the pot was delivered. I immediately went to Mr. Stroud, he said he had not sent for the tea-pot.</p>

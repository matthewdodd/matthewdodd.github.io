I was answered it was not, then I took measures to apprehend her; she was met with in the street by one of our clarks, who followed her to a tavern, where she was apprehended; the day after I had word brought she had confessed her guilt, and wanted to tur evidence; I attended her at Wood-street-compter, there she told me Barlow, Richardson, and Lloyd were the men that forged it, and she uttered it, and was to have a guinea for so doing. Some days passing, and nothing done in apprehending them, I obtained permission of Mr. Alderman Cokayne to carry her before Sir John Fielding, that she might give the like evidence before him, to enable him to set his officers to look after the men. She gave the same information there, she said one of the three men made a mark, the other two signed the names of the two witnesses; Sir John advertised a reward for apprehending them. Soon a message was brought me that Barlow was in Wood-street-compter, I went, and found him with the keeper, who knew him. he having been in custody before, for a similar affair; he declared he could open a very large scene of of this kind, and desired to be admitted evidence; at that time he neither denied nor confessed it; we told him we apprehended we had evidence sufficient in the woman to convict every person concerned in this fact, and it was clear he could not be admitted; this was repeated to him often. Mr. Kirby, the keeper, was present. Barlow said, the woman was a very bad woman, and had not been candid in her information, for one

               <p>Atkerson.

            , then he put it down on the back of the other power, then I carried that to the Crown on the other side of Moorfields, but Richardson was waiting in the Street at Mr. Mure's for me, as he always did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who prepared that?</p>
               <p>Clark. Barlow, Lloyd and Richardson did. Barlow and Mrs. Richardson met Mr. Richardson and I at the Crown, I told them what the gentleman said, then they said they had made a mistake in the christian-name; we parted at that time, and in a day or two after they left a line for me at the Three Tuns in Brooke's-market, to go to them the next day at the Crown ale-house again; I went, there were Mr. and Mrs. Richardson, Mr. Barlow and Mrs. Durant; Richardson pulled out a power of attorney and gave it to Barlow to fill up, which he did in a little room joining the bar, I saw him do it, he signed Thomas Coleby to it, and Richardson signed the other witness to it, Mrs. Durant made the mark, she asked if she should make the mark, or sign the name, they bid her make a mark, she can write extremely well, when she made the mark she said it was as particular a mark as could be made; Barlow put a wafer in it, and it was carried into the tap-room before they signed it; then I carried it to the office, there Mr. Dickson told me the gentleman was not in the way, and I must come again in half an hour, or the next morning; Mr. Richardson was at the door, I told him what had passed; we went to the Crown, there they were all waiting, Richardson told Barlow it was stopped, they said they must make use of some scheme or other to get it out of their hands, as it was a bad affair to lie in their hands, Barlow said, I should not have let it go out of my hands till I saw the gentleman myself. In about four days or near a week after Richardson called upon me again at the Three Tuns, and desired, I would meet him at the Crown the next morning, I went, there was Mr. and Mrs. Richardson and Barlow, there was a letter wrote to be sent to Mr Mure, Richardson had wrote it; Barlow said it was a very improper one, Richardson desired him to write another, Barlow said his hand would be known again, as he had filled up the power of attorney, he was very loth at first to do it; Richardson said he could write a different hand to that, as the power was filled up in a very small hand: with a good deal of persuasion Barlow did write one, which was sent to the gentleman; I gave it to a porter, and he carried it, I was to wait at a public-house for the porter, Richardson went part of the way with the porter; the porter came back no more, Richardson came and said, the gentleman had taken up the porter.</p>
               <p>Q. At what house did you wait for the porter?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176309140033"></xptr>Clark. I do not know the sign, it was on this side Moorfields. Barlow went out of the Crown, and said he would go and see for Richardson, we saw one another no more that night; Mrs. Durant called upon me once or twice after, but we had no talk about it, till I went to her one day, and said, Barlow is gone out of the way on account of the power.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Durant?</p>
               <p>Clark. She is a gold and silver button maker. Richardson and I were upon Tower-hill about a month after I went with the power of attorney, we called at a public house, I went from thence to the Castle tavern, I saw the gentleman come in with a constable, he said, that is Mrs. Cox; (directing him to me) I said, my name is not Cox; he said he did not care whether that was my name or not, I was the woman. I was taken before the Alderman, and had been in Wood-street compter three or four days before I made this discovery; the first I mentioned, Richardson, Barlow, and Lloyd were concerned, and the other, Barlow, Richardson, and Durant; I did not at first know it was a separate thing, Lloyd had no concern in this, nor Mrs. Durant in the other. I was three times at Mr. Mure's with powers of attorney; Lloyd, Barlow, and Richardson were in Soaper's; the second was Barlow, Richardson, and Lloyd; and this, Barlow, Richardson, and Durant.</p>

            , and others, I made fruitless attempts to take Barlow, but on the 30th of July he was brought into my custody; I sent for Mr. Atkerson, we went into the lodge to Barlow, I said, I have seen you before, I am sorry to see you in this case again; said he, I have been a very great cat's paw, and shall be glad to know who is in the information of that woman; I told him the warrant expressed Barlow, Richardson, and Lloyd; said he, she is a very false woman, for Lloyd was not concerned in this power of attorney, it was one Durant that made the mark to it; Durant was not in custody then. Soon there was an information they were at Durant's house, Clark went and shewed us the house in a court in White Fryers, we went and took Durant; I kept her separate from Barlow, I mentioned this power to her, I think she said she did make her mark, but was ignorant what it was. I had not seen the power of attorney then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know what she was taken up for?</p>
               <p>Kirby. She did.</p>
               <p>The letter sent by the porter to Mr. Mure's produced in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. to Thorley. Look at this letter.</p>
               <p>Thorley. A great many of these letters are pretty much alike. I don't look upon this to be a person's common hand-writing, it is much like to Barlow's, it seems to be a fictitious hand.</p>
               <p>Ananias Wares. A woman gave me a letter to carry to Mr. Mure's, a man was with her, at the Swan alehouse, Coleman-street, I never saw her before or since. (He looks at Clark.) I can't say whether this is the woman or not. (He is shewed the letter.) This looks much like the letter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Atkerson. This is the letter that this evidence brought.</p>
               <p>Clark. (Looks on the letter.) This is the letter I sent by this porter.</p>

            . I am constable, I was employ'd in taking Durant. Barlow gave me directions where to find her, I took her in Ashentree-court; I asked her no questions till I got her into Fleet street, then I told her I took her on the information of Barlow for having a hand in forging a power of attorney; I said there was a mark made; she said if she did make it, it was done in a hurry: When it was shew'd her by the magistrate, she said, I do not know but I might do it; I believe I did, but if I did, it was in a hurry.</p>

               <p>The power of attorney is not my hand-writing. The evidence Clark is perjured in the Commons, I think such an evidence should not be heard. I was once with a clerk, we did not know one's hand-writing from the other.</p>

The prisoner slept in the same room for three nights before the 10th of October - when he was gone, on the morning of the 9th of October, I missed the articles stated; he returned and slept there that night -I got up early the next morning, and when he came down, we had him stopped - he took my jacket out of his trousers, and jumped through a window; I jumped after him, and took him in a skittle-ground next door - this is my jacket.</p>

I took the handkerchief from my pocket - it has my mark on it, made by a woman in the Isle of France; the prosecutor never saw me take any thing - I never had any of his clothes; when I came down the landlady said she could not get the door unlocked - he then went up stairs, came down, and whispered to her; I waited an hour, and could not get out -I then said I would stop no longer, as my captain's orders were to be on board by the time the dock gates were open; I got out at the window to get to my ship.</p>

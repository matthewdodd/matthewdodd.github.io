                  </hi>. I resided with my mother in law, at No. 74, New Gravel-lane, Shadwell, on 25th Feb. last I knew the prisoners before that; I cannot say where they lived—I have seen M'Carthy and Daley's sister together—I recollect Daley's sister coming with a gentleman to the house my mother in law keeps—I think the gentleman was a sailor—I went before Mr. Yardley at the Thames police court to give evidence of that—I put this mark to my depositions (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>), and was bound over by the Magi<lb></lb>strate to give evidence—I do not recollect anything being read over to me—they said I was to come up against Ann Daley, to which I assented—I said I would appear, but I was taken away—I was not told when the trial would come on, because I was out of the way, and nobody came to tell me—on the next day, Saturday, the two prisoners came to No. 64, where I was living as servant, and said that they would give me a sovereign if I would go out of the way to Greenwich, and there should always be a good home to go to if I went out of the way with them and did not go <hi rend="italic">again</hi> Ann Daley—they showed me a sovereign, they did not give it to me—I went with them to Greenwich, and they took me to a house in a little court opposite the College—Mrs. Townsend kept the house—before we started they said that if I went <hi rend="italic">again</hi> Ann Daley they would have my life—I was left at Mrs. Townsend's that night, and slept up stairs in a little garret—I did not go out of that room at all—we got to the house about 2 o'clock on Sunday morning, and went up to the garret—I came away on the Wednesday, and did not go out of the garret during the whole of that time—that was because I was frightened; and the door was locked—the old woman used to be in with me, and she locked the door—she used to get her living by selling apples and oranges in Greenwich-park—she went out in the daytime, and left me in the room till she came home at night—the door was locked when she went away—I did not see either of the prisoners while I was there, but Charles M'Carthy came to me on the Sunday afternoon, and he fetched me a new green dress which I had bought—I had told him that I did not like to leave it at No. 64, where I was living as servant, and he said, "Give it to me and I will bring it to you," which he did—Fanny Daley was there on the Sunday—they were there all day on the Sunday—I did not appear at the trial.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185405080104"></xptr>
               <p>but she used to ask me if I would go into the Park with her, and I said I was frightened to go; she did not ask me on the Sunday, but she did on the Monday and Tuesday—on the Wednesday evening me and the old woman came up to London; I went to inquire for M'Carthy's mother, I found her and remained at her house about two hours; she had no room for me, and I went and slept at a woman's house—I was frightened to go home—I went and got a place next morning, with one of the bad girls, at No. 2, Gravel-lane—I have been to my mother in law's since, because Mary Ann Ferguson sent for me—I went there about two months after the time I left Green<lb></lb>wich—I saw M'Carthy the night after I came up at the Coach and Horses, at Shadwell—I asked her for some money, but did not get any; I saw Daley soon afterwards on the same night, and asked her for some money, and if she had any place for me to go to; she said, "No"—the old woman left me with Charles M'Carthy's mother.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Greenwich. Daley is a goddaughter of mine, and I know her sister—I do not know M'Carthy; I saw him once on the Sunday evening after Daley had come to my house with two other females, at two o'clock on Sunday morning—I saw no men with her—one of the girls was Mary Ann Harvey; Daley did not say anything to me about her—neither Daley or McCarthy said anything to me about the girl—Daley left about 9 o'clock on Monday morning, leaving the girl Harvey with me—when they came on the Sunday morning, I got up to let my goddaughter in—she said that her mother and herself had had a few words—I said I would go and ask her mother; she said that it was pouring with rain, and I could not go—she asked me if she might have the candle to go down stairs; I said "Yes," and she went and brought the other two females up—having been seven years in the house, I did not like to disturb the people in the house, and I said, "We will all go to-morrow"—on Sunday morning I got up at 7 o'clock and went to Church; when I came home I found the girls sitting before the fire—after breakfast I went out with my basket, and when I came home I found M'Carthy and the girls having tea—M'Carthy stayed about a quarter of an hour—next morning, when I got up, my goddaughter asked me when I was coming back; I said, "About twelve o'clock"—I never saw her again, but when I came home I found Mary Ann Harvey left behind—I asked if she would go into the Park, and she said she would rather <hi rend="italic">bide</hi> at my place—I locked her in, because I am a poor woman and did not know her character; I thought she might be bad enough to take my little <hi rend="italic">bit of</hi> clothes—she remained with me till the Wednesday evening—I told her I was a very poor woman, and only had my basket to depend upon</p>

               <p>—I said, "Your friends do not seem to come for you;" she said, "No," and that she did not know her way home, and her mother had used her badly, and she would not go home—I said, "If I see you through the Tunnel, will you go home?" she said "Yes," but that she could not pay the penny—I gave her 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to pay for the Tunnel and another for the bridge, and have never seen any of them since, except when I went over to ask Fanny Daley why she left the girl; and she said that if I insulted her she would give me in charge of a policeman—I have not received anything from anybody—after Daley had told me that her mother had used her ill, I said that if I could get her a situation in Greenwich I would; M'Carthy was not present—I inquired of a nursemaid if she knew of a place—I was out on the Sunday; the door was not locked then—the girl might have got out on Sunday, but she told me she did not know where to go—she did not talk of leaving on the Monday, or on the Tuesday; she was wondering what kept my goddaughter away so long,—I stayed till my work was over, and then brought her back to Shadwell—I did not know the other young woman—none of them went out on the Sunday—I saw no young man on Saturday night.</p>

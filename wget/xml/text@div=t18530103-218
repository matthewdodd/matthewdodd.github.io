                  </hi>. I live with Davis and Son, drapers. On Tuesday, 21st Dec., about three in the afternoon, I found two square shawls gone, and early next morning I missed a long shawl from a stand inside the door—it was safe about 6 o'clock, the night before—the others I had seen safe, about three hours before I missed them—these shawls (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two I lost on Tuesday, and this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the one I lost on the Wednesday morning—they are Messrs. Davis's property; they are the patterns of those we lost; there is no mark on them—I went with the policeman to the house of the prisoners' father, and saw him there, and the prisoners also—the policeman told the father that his daughters were charged with stealing shawls—he said he knew nothing of it, he had more shawls in his box, and said, "Will you come up stairs and see?"—we went up stairs, and he opened the box, showed us two other shawls not referred to here, and said his youngest daughter had brought them home as a present from her mistress, Mrs. Stride—I found this shawl, which was taken on 22nd, in the hands of the prisoner Amelia. who was outside a pawnbroker's door, and the other girl was with her—I told her it was my shawl—she said it was given her to pledge by a woman living in Coleman-street, whose name she did not know; and as we went towards Coleman-street, she said her father had given it her—there is nothing by which I know the shawl, except the pattern—I had seen it ten minutes before it was missed, and the prisoner only had been in the house during that time—I missed it at half past 10 o'clock, on the Wednesday morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father at West Hill, Wands-worth—at the end of last December I was engaged to go to Mr. Mellor's house of a morning to assist in the house work—the prisoner at that time was his only servant—there was another servant who had left for a holiday—I used to go about seven o'clock, and stayed till ten—Mr. Mellor was in the habit of letting me in each morning—on 28th December I went there about seven o'clock—Mr. Mellor let me in, he was quite dressed—and I went and lighted the kitchen fire—while I was there the prisoner came down—she complained of being unwell, and had a glass of brandy—she said nothing at that time about any fire having occurred—about a quarter to eight I went up to Mr. Mellor's bedroom on the first floor to make his bed—there was no fire in the grate—in making the bed there was not the slightest appearance of any fire having taken place—I turned over the pil<lb></lb>lows and sheets and mattress; there was no bed—I went down to the kitchen again a little after eight—there was no fire or candle in the bed-room then—I did not leave any in the room—I had no candle—Mr. Mellor was then having his breakfast in the parlour—about nine o'clock I was sweeping in Annie's (the prisoner's) bedroom—that is very near Mr. Mellor's bedroom, not on the same floor—it was not her proper bedroom—not the bedroom in which she had been sleeping—it is one at the back of the house, about six steps below Mr. Mellor's—at that time she was occupying a room on the same floor as Mr. Mellor—whilst I was sweeping in that bedroom the prisoner came to me and said, "Come, Amelia, and see where this smoke comes from"—I went with her into Mr. Mellor's bedroom—she was a few steps in front of me—when I went into the room the pillow was blazing on the bed, and a flannel at the side of it that I had left there when I made the bed, folded in a square, and Mr. Mellor's night-cap—the flannel was not burning, but the squares were singed as it lay folded in about six—the nightcap was quite burnt to tinder—as far as I can remember the flannel was in the same position in which I had placed it when I made the bed—Mr. Mellor always had a small flannel laid on the bed at night,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185902280062"></xptr>
               <p>he mostly laid it there himself—water was thrown over the pillow to put out the fire—Annie took the jug from the bason, and I took it from her hand and succeeded in extinguishing the fire—I took the pillow up into the attic and put it on the floor in the middle of the room—at the time I was sweeping out the room Mr. Mellor was in the parlour—I had cleared away his breakfast things, and taken them into the kitchen—he was down in the kitchen nearly the whole of the time—I did not perceive him go upstairs—at the time I put the pillow on the attic floor it was very much saturated with water—it had soaked through the pillow, and wetted my arm as I was carrying it up—there was no fire in the pillow at that time, it was quite put out—the prisoner said that Mr. Mellor must have taken the flannel down-stairs and dried it, and taken it upstairs again on fire—after cleaning up the room, I made the prisoner's bed—that is in the best bedroom, opposite Mr. Mellor's room, not the room that I had been sweeping out before—I then went across to my own house—nearly an hour afterwards the prisoner came across and told my mother to tell me to come over again—I went over with her—she was rather in front of me—I asked my father to come too—when I got to the house, the prisoner said that the fire was blazing in the same place—I went into the yard and fetched a pail of water, and went up to Mr. Mellor's bedroom—I found the pillow that was at the head of the bed, moved to the foot, quite to the opposite corner—the bedclothes both upper and under were all removed back quite to the foot of the bed, and the mattress was quite bare, and was burning at the corner-the fire was not from underneath, it was only the top of the mattress—there was something on the other pillow, I am not sure what it was, it might have been another nightcap placed there—it was completely burnt to tinder—the second pillow was blazing at the foot—that pillow was on the top of the other clothes—my father wrapped the pillow in a sheet of another bed which stood in the room, and I carried it down stairs into the back yard—the fire was all put out with the pail of water that I took up—I threw it on the bed—while I was down-stairs Annie came and said there was a fire in the garret—Mr. Mellor was out nearly the whole of the morning—he went out just before I came home, and he was about ten yards before me when I came across: he was a little way down the hill going away from the house—he was back again a very few minutes after I went into the house—he was away about an hour—he came in five or ten minutes after I came in the second time—when my father came in he left the door open for Mr. Mellor, as he saw him coming—it was some time afterwards, about twelve o'clock, that Annie called my attention to the fire in the garret—she took me and my father up—I found the pillow which I had placed on the floor, on the drawers—the first fire was about nine o'clock, and it was a little after ten when I went back the second time—the alarm of fire in the garret was about twelve—between ten and twelve we cleared up the mattress, and the tinder that had been made in the bed, folded up the clothes that had been brought down stairs, and then I had to clean Mr. Mellor's room over—it had been made very wet from the water that was thrown about—my father took the carpets out on the lawn and brushed them—this took up nearly the whole of the time—the prisoner was helping us—Mr. Mellor went out again after he came in—he went out twice that morning—after we had cleaned up we had lunch in the kitchen—the prisoner was not with us all the time—she was up and down stands doing the different things she had to do about the house—it was about twelve when I went up with my father and the prisoner to the garret—I found the pillow on the top of a chest of drawers with some green glazed lining which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185902280063"></xptr>
               <p>was partly in the top small drawer and partly lying on the pillow—Mr. Mellor was down stairs when the alarm of fire in the attic was given—part of the lining was blazing in the drawer—my father folded the pillow together, and told Annie to go and fetch Mr. Mellor, and show him where it was—she went and fetched him, and he could scarcely get into the room for the smoke—his cough seized him—my father folded the pillow together, and gave it into my hand—I took it down stairs, and he took down the drawer—I put the fire out by folding the pillow together, and when we got down stairs we put the things under the tap—the drawer was burnt—my father scraped a hole with a penny piece—it was charred very much—I can't say whether that drawer was open or closed when I put the pillow in the attic in the morning—I remained in the house after this until after one o'clock, clearing up and doing one thing and another—Mr. Mellor was in the parlour nearly the whole of the time—he came up stalls once or twice—he came into the garret, and in coming down from the garret he told my father he would have all the things out of the bedroom—the prisoner was there the whole of the time—Mr. Mellor directed the things to be taken out of his room, and that was done—the prisoner assisted in taking them out—there were sheets, blankets, and the counterpane—they were brought down stairs—at that time there was not the slightest appearance of fire or smoke any-where about that room—after that was done I went back to my father's house about one o'clock—I had not been home five or ten minutes before I observed flames in Mr. Mellor's bedroom—it was about half-an-hour before I went home that we had taken the sheets and blankets out of Mr. Mellor's room, but I had been in the room after that just before I came home, and at that time there was no appearance of smoke or fire—the room was nicely drying up where it had been cleaned, and there was not the slightest sign of fire—Mr. Mellor was then in the parlour, just going to have his dinner—upon seeing the flames in the bedroom I went back to the house—I saw a young man go over first—I called my father's attention to it—some of the neighbours had seen it, and went over too—on going into the room I found the fire was behind the door—I scarcely saw the fire on that occa<lb></lb>sion—there were two gentlemen in the room—I fetched water to extinguish it—on going into the room afterwards, I found that Mr. Mellor's dressing-gown was burnt—it was lying in the wet behind the door, and the door was very much burnt—the dressing-gown had been hanging there all the morning—I had seen it several times during the morning—at the time I found it burnt, there were no sheets on the bed, they had been all taken down before—the mattress was there—there were no curtains to the bed—the dressing-gown was, I should think, a yard and a half from the foot of the bed—by the aid of the water, the fire against the door was put out—I remained in the room, and cleared it all up again—I did not come away again until the house was all in flames—I remained in that room, I should think, about a quarter of an hour—while I was at work in that room, I saw the prisoner come upstairs—she held her dress up in her hand, and went into the best bedroom, the one she had been occupying—there is a passage which separates that room from Mr. Mellor's—I can't say how wide the passage is—it is a good sized passage, sufficiently wide for two flights of stairs, one to go up, and the other leading to the garret—the door of that room had been wide open the whole of the time that I saw it that morning—when the prisoner went into the room she shut the door after her—she remained there about seven or eight minutes—I saw her come out, she shut the door after her, and went down stairs—at that time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185902280064"></xptr>
               <p>my father was on the landing cleaning—I was just inside the door, and he was sweeping the dirt that had been congregated together on the land<lb></lb>ing—I faced my father's back and Annie's face when she came out—I had been into the best bedroom several times that morning—I think I went in just before Mr. Chidley and Mr. Meyers went in—that was after the dressing-gown fire—I merely went in with the others to see that all was safe—Chidley and Meyers went in to see that there were no signs of fire there, and I went in to look—that is the last time I remember being in the room—when the prisoner came out of the room she went down stairs—I followed her in a few minutes down to the kitchen—I found her sitting in a chair—I asked her how she felt—she rose up from the chair, and said, "Oh, very bad"—I went into the yard after that—I was not absent a minute, I only went to get a clean pail of water—when I came back, the prisoner had gone part of the way up the kitchen stairs, and at that time my father came down, and told her that the house was on fire, and nothing could save it—I believe the words he used were, "My God, Annie, you have set that room on fire"—she made him no answer—she stood with her hands so, and looked at him, but did not say a word—she stood with her hands as though she was very ill, or something particular was the matter with her—Mr. Mellor was at this time sitting in the parlour, with his shoes off, warming his feet by the fire—I can't say how long he had been sitting in that way—I saw him some little time before in that same posi<lb></lb>tion—he was up stairs at the time of the dressing-gown fire—he was back-wards and forwards—he was in his room once, I know—I am not aware whether he went into the best bedroom or not—it was a long time before I saw the prisoner go into the room, that I saw Mr. Mellor—I can't say whether he went into the room with Chidley and Meyers, I don't think he did—he was up stairs at that time—he did not go up stairs after that—Annie had had a glass of brandy the first thing in the morning, and some porter was had about twelve, or a little after, with our lunch—after father went, the prisoner had some raw gin, and she gave me some gin and water—I have known the prisoner ever since she has lived with Mr. Mellor—I think that is three years come July—I don't think she was quite sober on this occasion, in fact, I am sure she was not—I think she was sober when I first went—I noticed she was not so towards eleven or twelve—I think she was slightly intoxicated when she came over for me a little after ten—I did net see anything more of the fire, only as I came out, I saw the flames coming out of the window, and I was too terrified to stay any longer.</p>

               <p>him in the High-street, Wandsworth, between the first and second time of my going to the house—I am not aware that I said he was in the house all the morning, except that one occasion—Mr. Mellor is a very old gentleman, between 85 and 86—he is rather eccentric and queer in his ways—when I first saw the prisoner, and she complained of being unwell, I believed she was poorly, as women are—she seemed to be in great pain, and she took a little brandy to relieve it—I should not have known anything about the first or second fires, except for the prisoner's calling my attention to them—she assisted as far as she could in putting out all the fires—on the last occasion, she was very much excited—when my father said the house was on fire, she appeared paralysed; I can't say what with—she wrung her hands—she had a very large quantity of clothes, and very good—I believe Mr. Mellor was in the habit of airing his flannels—I am not aware that I ever saw him do it—I have seen him air his towels, in fact, he would frequently wash them himself, bring them to the parlour fire, and dry them—I have seen them scorched—I have never seen one on fire—I had not been into the parlour and seen Mr. Mellor there just before the last fire—they were preparing for dinner, he had not dined—I can't say how long before I had seen him there with his shoes off—I do not think it was so long as half an hour—that would be the extent—I am aware that he was in the parlour, but I had not been in—the parlour-'door was wide open, and one could see him in passing—I did see him in the parlour not a quarter of an hour before the fire—I am not aware whether he was insured or not—I have heard since that he was not.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, West Hill, Wandsworth—the last witness is my daughter—I remember her being called from my house by the prisoner about 10 o'clock on the morning of 28th December—I went over to the house five or ten minutes afterwards—the prisoner was standing at the door—she said nothing to me—I said to her, "Don't shut the door, Annie; Mr. Mellor is just here"—I saw him in the street—it appeared as if he were coming up the street—I went direct up to Mr. Mellor's bedroom—I found that the mattress had been on fire—water had been thrown over the mattress when I got there—the fire was out except a little at the pillow at the bottom of the bed, the other things were stripped off—I took the pillow and wrapped a sheet round it, and it was carried down-stairs to the yard—I afterwards returned to Mr. Mellor's room—I did not minutely examine behind the wardrobe and such places, but I looked at the bedstead and the fire-place—there was not the slightest appearance of fire or anything burning—we took the carpets, and such like, down stairs, by the direction of Mr. Mellor—he came up stairs while we were in the room—he had his hat and stick—we did not take the sheets down then—we then had luncheon down in the kitchen—while we were at luncheon, I</p>

               <p>do not know whether the prisoner was up stairs in the bedroom or in the parlour with Mr. Mellor—she left the kitchen a portion of the time—the laundress' daughter came in while I was there—the prisoner came down and said there was a strong smell of fire upstairs again, would we come up stairs and see—she came down the kitchen-stairs—I do not know whether she came from Mr. Mellor's room or the bedroom—I went up to the garret with the prisoner and my daughter, and found a pillow on a chest of drawers, also some glazed stuff on the top of it, on fire—the glaze was also burning in the drawer—I told the prisoner to ask Mr. Mellor to come up stairs and see it, and she did so—she went down a flight of stairs, and I believe Mr. Mellor was coming up—he was very quickly up in the garret—I believe, at the time I went up to the garret, Mr. Mellor was in the parlour, but I can't say for certain that he was—I saw him on the top of the landing—I wished him to come into the room to see the fire, but he could not come in, owing to the smoke from the calico—the drawer and the pillow were taken down into the back yard—I took the drawer up stairs again, after making a hole in it with a penny-piece, and was about to place it in the drawers again, but Mr. Mellor objected, and I put it down by the wash-stand—I then came down stairs again and finished my lunch, and stopped in the kitchen, and did one thing and another, some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—afterwards, by Mr. Mellor's request, I went to his bed-room and took the sheets and blankets and counterpane into some glass-house at the back of the house—the pillow had been removed before—at that time Mr. Mellor and me, the prisoner and my daughter, went through the six rooms of the house, that is, the garret, the two bedrooms, and the two parlours, and there was not a vestige of fire in any room except the fire in the parlour grate and in the kitchen—this might have been from ten minutes to a quarter to 1—after I had done that, I went over to my own house to my dinner—whilst we were having our dinner, there was a knock<lb></lb>ing at the door, and an alarm of fire—I went across with Mr. Meyers and Mr. Chidley, two neighbours—they were before me, and just as I went into Mr. Mellor's room, Mr. Chidley threw a jug of water on the embers of the dressing-gown, which was hanging behind the door—the dressing-gown had been burnt to tinder, and the door was charred and burning—Mr. Meyer, who is a builder, took a rule out of his pocket and took the charred wood off with it—we then moved every portable article out of the room down-stairs into the kitchen and back premises—I took the two mattresses right out on the lawn—I returned with my daughter, and another person named Aiger, clearing up on the first floor—I was cleaning on the landing—whilst I was there, I saw the prisoner come up stairs, and go into the room she had been sleeping in—she shut the door after her—she was there, probably, six, seven, eight or ten minutes, not exceeding ten minutes at the most—I then saw her come out again and go down stairs—I had been into that room once before, that was when I examined the house with Mr. Mellor, the prisoner, and my daughter, not afterwards—I saw Mr. Meyers and Mr. Chidley go into the room after the dressing-gown fire—that was, I dare say, a quarter of an hour before I saw the prisoner go in—I did not see Mr. Mellor up stairs again at all after Chidley and Meyers went in there—when the prisoner came out of the bedroom, she closed the door after her and went down stairs direct—she passed close by me as I was sweeping on the landing—the next thing I perceived was smoke coming into Mr. Mellor's bedroom over the door—I was then in Mr. Mellor's bedroom—that was, at the most, not more than ten minutes after the prisoner had gone down-stairs,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185902280067"></xptr>
               <p>I should say some minute or two under that—no one had come up stairs during that ten minutes except my daughter with a pail of water for my use and her own—I had not gone more than a foot or two into Mr. Mellor's room from the landing and the door was open—upon seeing the smoke, I asked Aiger where it came from—he said he could not tell—I looked about for some minute or so—I took a chair and pulled down the paper of the room over the door, thinking it might come from there, but it did not—I then got down from the chair, and when I got within about four steps of the best bedroom door, I smelt fire very strong—I opened the door, and the flames then rushed oat upon me—they appeared to come round the doorway—the door opens on to the bedstead, and the flames seemed to come round from behind the door, as if the bed or the bed-clothes were on fire on that side—I immediately ran down stairs, and saw the prisoner at the bottom of the kitchen-stairs, and said, "My God, Annie, you have set light" or "fire to that room"—she never made any reply—she stood there—I immediately ran up to the door—there was a great rush and noise at the door—Mr. Meyers was the first person I saw in the house—there were several near him—I don't think they rushed quite up stairs, they might have done—I did not go up to the room again—I only assisted then in taking the things out of the house—the fire spread very rapidly indeed—the house was completely burnt—we had no assistance of water—the inside of the house was what is commonly called "gutted"—when I opened the door, I did not see how much of the room appeared to be on fire, I did not stop long enough—I had not presence of mind to shut the door, I was too much excited, seeing the fire—the door of that room had been open all the morning to the best of my knowledge, except when the prisoner went in and shut it—I can't say where Mr. Mellor was after the dressing-gown fire—I believe he was somewhere down stairs—he never came upstairs to me.</p>

Q.</hi> How long had you been on the landing when you saw the prisoner go into the room the last time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know that I was directly on the landing when she did go in, I might be just against the door—the best bedroom and Mr. Mellor's are on the same floor, and the windows look the same way—they are separated by the passage, and the stairs leading to the garret—the staircase is in the middle of the house—I dare say it was three-quarters of an hour before I saw the prisoner go into the room and shut the door that Mr. Mellor went in with me and my daughter and the prisoner—it must have been more than half an hour, because I had been down stairs and had my luncheon, and been home—it was not intended that I should come and do anything at the house that day—I stopped to clean up, partly by speaking to the prisoner and my daughter, and Mr. Mellor asked me to remove the carpets and things—it was partly at the prisoner's suggestion that I staid and cleaned up—it was not Mr. Mellor who came while I was having my luncheon, and said there was a smell of fire—when I did go up I did not find Mr. Mellor on the landing, he was coming up the stairs—I went into the garret—when I came out again I saw Mr. Mellor—there are two rooms on that floor—when I said to the prisoner, "You have set fire to that room" she appeared to be as it were motionless. I called it "paralysed" in the depositions—I have not been reading over the depositions—I recollect the observation—she did appear to be paralysed—I do not know that she fetched me water on more than one occasion—I don't recollect seeing her bring water on any occasion—she did all she could to assist in putting the fire out in the room—I did not see that she was either pleased or displeased when it was put out.</p>

I am a tailor at Wimbledon—my parents live at Wandsworth—I was there on 28th December—about 1 o'clock my attention was called to a fire on the first floor at Mr. Mellor's—I went to the door, the prisoner opened it—I asked her whether she was aware that the house was on fire—she said, "Fire! no"—I cannot exactly say the state she was in, she seemed very excited—that was after I told her the house was on fire—I went up stairs to the door of the room that I had seen on fire—I tried to get into the room, but I found the flames were so fierce I could not—they were close to the door—I went down and met Mr. Meyers—I went for the engine, and when I came back the fire had broken out in the other room on the same floor—I assisted in getting the goods out.</p>

I live at West Hill, Wandsworth—on 28th December, about 1 o'clock, I heard an alarm of fire at Mr. Mellor's—the door was open, and Mr. Mellor was at the door—I went up to the bedroom on the first-floor—I believe Linfield was coming down the stairs as I went up—I found a dressing-gown on fire behind the door—I threw a jug of water over it—Mr. Meyers came up directly afterwards—I left word for all the furniture to be carried out of the room down to the garden; I did not see it done—before I left I went into the best bedroom, the two sitting-rooms, and the kitchen—there was not the slightest appearance of fire in the best bedroom—I don't remember that anybody else went into that room with me—I believe Mr. Mellor was up there, but I don't remember seeing him in the best bedroom—I then left the house, and in about twenty minutes or half an hour I heard an alarm of fire again—I then saw flames coming out of the best bedroom—I did not go into the house then—I saw I could do no good there—I had some conversation with the prisoner in the kitchen after I had extinguished the dressing-gown fire,—I said, "It is a strange thing these fires"—(I had then heard that there had been other fires that day)—she said that Mr. Mellor was a very old and infirm man, and obliged to put things between his legs—she pointed to a flannel, and said, he would hang them before the fire to dry them, and she supposed they had caught fire, and he had taken them up stairs and thrown them on the bed, and set the bed on fire—the prisoner was very much excited; but I could not say what it proceeded from—I had not known her before—I could not say whether she was in liquor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder at Wandsworth, and a neighbour of Mr. Mellor's—on 28th December, about 1 o'clock, I was alarmed by a cry of fire at Mr. Mellor's—I went up stairs to the bedroom—I did not see the dressing-gown on fire—after the fire I looked round the room and took a rule from my pocket and scraped the panels of the door—something had been burning over the small cabinet close to the door, between the door and the wardrobe—I examined the wardrobe—at that time I ascertained that the fire was completely extinguished in that room—I and Mr. Chidley walked across the landing and went into the best bedroom—there was no appear<lb></lb>ance of fire there whatever Mr. Mellor was not in that room with me—I don't know where he was, I did not see him after he left the room that was first on fire—he was in that room, his own bedroom, but not when I got there—he came in with the prisoner—that was about five minutes to 1, while I was about putting out the fire—after I had been into the best bedroom I went down stairs to the parlour—I don't think Mr. Mellor was there—I think I saw</p>

               <p>him in the kitchen as Chidley and I were going through—I then went home—my house is next door—about twenty minutes afterwards I heard the alarm of fire again—I went into the house—I passed Mr. Mellor at the front door—I went up to the door of the room—the door was ajar—the place was full of smoke—I was obliged to stoop to see the flames—the top of the bed was on fire, and the foot-board of the bedstead was then lighting—there was no fire underneath the bed—it was flaming over the bed—it appeared to me that it was the bed itself that was on fire—I called for a pail of water—I do not know who brought it—I threw it on the fire, and the flames spread all over me, and all over the room, and rose higher a great deal than they did before—I have seen turpentine on fire, and it appeared to me to be a similar thing—I left the room, for the flames spread all over me and encompassed me, my whiskers and my hand were burnt—I said there was no alternative but the engine—the place was all a body of flame, and I went out of the house—I have seen turpentine on fire in a pot—I have seen the effect of throwing water over it—it will not quench it—it will augment the flame and cause it to rise—if bedding is on fire and water is thrown over it in my opinion it would smother it—if the fire had been nothing but the bed consuming, the water I threw on it would certainly put it out, unless there had been something combustible—the water did not quench it, but the flames came higher in the room and spread all over me—there was not sufficient water to diminish the fire—I could not procure water—the fire did not diminish in consequence of the water being thrown—Mr. Mellor had not come up stairs while I was at the door—I left the house directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I had a house at Wandsworth, where these fires took place—I am eighty-five years of age—the prisoner has been in my service about two years—I believe the house was insured, my furniture was not—the first I saw or heard of a fire, on 28th December, was early in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I have generally been a very early riser; and as I stood by my bed-side, I thought I saw something of smoke or fire issuing from the pillow on the bed—I took up the pillow and turned it over, and underneath it there was a very small portion of fire, not more than the end of my finger, still there was fire; and in consequence I finished my dressing, and went down as early as I could into the parlour—I did not see that anything had been burnt—the fire was under the pillow—I was not in the habit of being called in the morning—I get up between 6 and 7—I have no fire in my bedroom, nor any light—I was nearly dressed when I saw this little bit of fire—I had not used any lucifer matches that morning—I do not sleep with my door locked—the prisoner was generally down in the morning before me—I don't think she had been into my room that morning before I went down—I don't remem<lb></lb>ber whether I let the witness Louisa Cotterell in that morning, my memory is very fallacious, and hardly to be depended upon now—I don't recollect whether I said anything to her about seeing fire in my room that morning—I came down about 7 o'clock and went into my parlour, where there was a fire made for me—I could not charge my memory how long I remained there—I staid there till I had had breakfast, and I was there when I heard there was a fire up stairs in my bedroom—that was about 9 o'clock—I had not gone out then—I had not gone up stairs before I heard of the fire—I went up stairs when they told me that there was something carried up into the garret, and I found that a pillow had been taken up into the garret, and was placed on a mahogany chest of drawers—that was the first time I went up stairs after I had come down in the morning—I think Mr. Cotterell was up stairs when I went, but I cannot charge my memory—I desired that everything which appeared to have any fire about it should be removed and carried into the yard—I don't recollect where I went to after that—I re<lb></lb>member hearing of another fire in my room, when the dressing-gown was burnt—I had seen the dressing-gown hanging on the door of my bedroom, and when it took fire they brought water and threw it on the door and dressing-gown, to put it out—I did not see it take fire—I can't say whether I had been into my bedroom before that, since I left it in the morning—I recollect persons coming and putting out the fire—there is another bed-room opposite mine, called the best bedroom—I did not go into that room</p>

               <p>did—Mr. Mellor did not appear at all rational: in my opinion he did not know at all what he was about, he wanted to go up stain in the flames to get his shoes—the prisoner appeared excited—I had known her before to speak to her, she was sensible—I judged her to be intoxicated by her appearance, and when I was taking her she staggered against me.</p>

I think it was almost impossible for any person to have gone into the room between the time of the prisoner coming out and my smelling the fire—I don't think there could have been a possibility of it, without my seeing them—I was on the landing, or just inside Mr. Mellor's door, 'with the door open—I was in and out of the room—I was never away from the landing from the time the prisoner went into the room, but once, and that was to take the things down into the glass-house—that was while she was in the room—I came up again and then I saw her come out—I was sweeping on the landing when she came out, and shut the door—after that I went into Mr. Mellor's room again and assisted in removing one thing and another from the room, and then I saw the smoke—I don't think it possible for any person to have gone into the room without my seeing them; I may be mistaken—Mr. Mellor could not have come up and down stairs in that time—he would not have been able to do so without my seeing him—the only persons in the house were my daughter, myself, Mr. Aiger, Mr. Mellor and the prisoner: Chidley and Meyers had gone.</p>

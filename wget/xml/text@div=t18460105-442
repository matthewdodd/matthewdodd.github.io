                  </hi>. I am a smith, in the employ of the prisoner's father, and live at Greenwich. On the 26th of Dec., between two and three o'clock, I was at work at the anvil—the prisoner came into the shop, and said, "Well, Mr. Sedgwick, what have you been saying about me?"—I said. "Nothing <hi rend="italic">as</hi> I know of, William"—he said, "You are a d—old liar, and I will have a <hi rend="italic">go-in</hi> at you"—he pulled his coat off, and tucked up his shirt sleeves, and challenged me to fight—I said, "No, I have not said anything about you; who is your author?"—he said, "You are a d—old liar, and an old rogue, a rascal, and a thief"—I would not presume to fight him; so he up with his fist, and struck me—I took him by the collar and threw him on his back—he hung by my waistcoat—he asked me to let go—I said, "If you will let go of me, I will let go of you"—I let go of him, and he caught hold of a large piece of iron, and struck me on the head—it was a new tool I had made—the blow staggered me to the anvil—I did not fall, I believe—I collared him afterwards—in the struggle I became rather insensible, and, another large piece of iron came on my shoulder, which has injured me greatly—I have not been able to move my arm behind me since, or to do any work—the prisoner's father was sent for by Pembery, and he ran into the shop, took him from me, and threw him out of the shop—I was taken home and afterwards taken to a surgeon—the blow on the head cut my head open and the blood streamed from it—I am fifty years of age—the prisoner is twenty-three—we never had any quarrel.</p>

                  </hi>. I heard a noise and quarrelling in Mr. Roberta's shop on Friday week—I went out to see what it was, and found it was the prisoner and Sedgwick fighting—they were struggling—as soon as they parted, the prisoner up with a piece of iron and heaved it at Sedgwick—it hit him on the head—they struggled again, and he picked up another piece and heaved it—it hit Sedgwick on the shoulder—after that they had another struggle, and the prisoner's father came in and separated them—I took Sedgwick across, and dressed the wound in his head as well as I could—there was scarce a moment, between the first blow and the second—directly the prisoner let go, he picked, up the iron and heaved it at him—they were struggling together, and they fell down on the top of one another.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. Sedgwick was brought to me on the 29th of Dec., by order of the Magistrate—he had a plaster over the wound, which I removed, and washed the blood away—I found the remains of a contused wound on the centre of the head—the skin was broken—it must have been inflicted by some blunt weapon—it was not in itself serious—cry<lb></lb>sipelas might have supervened—I should scarcely have thought it would have</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been ill in Bartholomew's Hospital five weeks, and was turned out incurable—on boxing day my brother gave me something to drink; I was intoxicated when I came home; I was going to bed; my father said Sedgwick had been saying something about me; I went to the shop, and asked what he had been saying about me; he said he would kick me out if I did not go out; he came and collared me, and we were hustling together; he struck me on the nose, and I threw one piece of iron, but not two.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Rifle-cottage, Lower Norwood—I became acquainted with the defendant at the end of last year, and became on inti<lb></lb>mate terms with him—it was afterwards arranged that I should take part of his office, and I did so the first few days in November, and remained there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186308170090"></xptr>
               <p>until 7th January—during that time I regularly paid my rent—I did not become indebted to him—I lent him, money two or three days after I went there, and afterwards on various occasions—I did not sue him for it—he was sued in March or April on a bill of exchange which I discounted for him in January—it was a 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and I gave him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I saw him at the time he was served with the writ—it was through my instrumentality that he was served, and he knew that—on 15th June I received this letter, marked A, on 12th June the one marked B, and on 2d July the one marked C—during the time I was in the prisoner's office I had the oppor<lb></lb>tunity of seeing him write constantly, and before I joined him I had one or two letters from him—I am well acquainted with his writing, and have not the least doubt in saying that these letters are his—I have several other documents in his own hand—I wrote to him on the receipt of the second letter, and then received this one, dated 10, Princes-place, 7th July—the defendant formerly lived there, from October when I first knew him to about December, and subsequently during April last, and I visited him there—I have not the least doubt that this letter is in his writing—a great many of the persons mentioned in it are creditors down in my schedule, and others are clients of mine—the libels contain also the names of persons with whom I have had dealings—the defendant had the opportunity of knowing my business affairs—I did not consult him on my business affairs, but in my absence he kindly took the names of persons who called, as I have done for him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you still living at Rifle-cottage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I came from there this morning—I had no personal knowledge whatever of the defendant before October last—I knew his brother's wife—this "Received 7th July" in the corner of the letter last put into my hands is my writing—I wrote the letter I sent on 15th or 16th June—it never came back to me, but the third letter came, which was a reply to it—the post-mark on the first letter is "E. S. June 12"—I was at a loss to ascertain what that meant and took it to the General Office—I was told by the chief manager that it was either posted in Lombard-street or Lambeth-street, and I took it to the Lambeth-street district—I have not positively ascertained what E. S. means—the second letter is marked "S."—that is the district post at Lambeth—"June 15" is the post-mark—I know a person named McGwire, he is the brother of my wife's father's second wife—I saw him last in November; I think I may safely say the latter part of November, at 3, Charlotte-place—I heard the defendant allege at the Lambeth Police Court that the letters were written by M'Gwire—I have not taken any steps to see M'Gwire since, there was no necessity—I was bankrupt this year, and once previously—I do not think I have more than 120 creditors in my present schedule, and they are for very small amounts—I am sorry to say they are tradesmen of all kinds—my debts and liabilities are 2, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think—I received a com<lb></lb>mission for discounting bills, and carried on business at the office in the name of S. G. Raymond &amp; Co.—I was in treaty with Mr. G. S. Raymond, an officer in the army—I never advertised to lend sums up to 40, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I advertised to lend money—I had the command of money, but had not one shilling of my own—the defendant's wife called on me three Sundays ago—I did not say that if she brought me 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I would not appear here; nothing of the kind—she made an earnest appeal to me to accept 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a diamond ring, which she would bring me next day, and I said that I could not inter<lb></lb>fere—I did not offer if she could raise 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. not to appear against her husband—I said, that in expenses I had been put to I was 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of pocket</p>

               <p>by him—I did not say that for that 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I would not come near this Court—the defendant has been connected with various papers, the <hi rend="italic">Law Times</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Law Journal</hi>—Mr. Edward Owen, the publisher of the <hi rend="italic">United Service Gazette</hi>, was examined as a witness for me—I have not brought him here—he was sworn in my presence and examined on my behalf, but was not bound over—I have an office in London now, 26, Bucklersbury—except writing one letter to the defendant I did not communicate with him—I applied for a warrant against him on the 7th, I think—I was engaged before that in applying at Scotland-yard and at the Mansion House, and in getting recommended to a solicitor to take it up.</p>

I am preparing for the medical profession—my father is a surgeon—I have known the defendant two years—I have had letters from him, and seen him write—I cannot recognise these three letters or their envelopes as his, and I do not think they are—I have heard nothing against his character.</p>

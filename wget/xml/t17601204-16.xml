When they went away, Norris brought the tankard to me in the kitchen, and said: I shall come and smoak a pipe with you in the evening. In the evening, between six and seven, Hicks came in, and called for a tankard of beer, a paper of tobacco, and two pipes; and said, he had an acquaintance a coming to smoak a pipe with him. I carried him the beer in a silver mug; he then had not on his soldiers cloaths, but was disguised; but I knew him again. I came out and went to the door, and there was Norris at the window, and

He leared up at him, and said: I cannot say I know them, but I'll tell you where you may know; and he took him to a brandy-merchant. I was called up stairs. I was not two minutes above. I was coming down, my servant met me on the stairs, and asked me whose tobacco that was that lay in the back-room. Hicks was smoaking a pipe there, when I went up stairs; but then he was gone, and the silver mug, and had left his paper of tobacco on the table. I never saw the mug since. I ran out of the door immediately, but saw nobody stirring.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor, there were three men and a woman came into my house on a Sunday night: they pretended to be going over the water in the ferry. The prisoner and Norris were two of them. This was between nine and ten at night. They called for a tankard of beer. I had nobody up but myself. They sat and drank that. Then one of them said, It is a shame to trouble the house for a tankard of beer, let us have another. Then they ordered me to fill it again. While I went down to draw it, I missed the prisoner at the bar: he was gone from the place where he sat. The others said he was gone to fetch his sister. Then one of them started up, and gave me three pence for one tankard: the other gave me a six-pence: I gave him the three-pence, and they went away. I looked at the six-pence immediately, and found it was a bad one. I ran to the door, and took the man by the coat, and said, 'Tis a bad six-pence. The other said to him: You must give the woman good money; but away they went, and I never saw any more of them. As soon as they were gone, I looked in the cupboard over the bar, and missed a silver tankard. I had just before put it there, with two other tankards, and a pint-mug<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176012040034"></xptr> I mistrusted they had taken something. My husband went next day to Mr. Fielding's, and had it advertised, and two guineas reward. I heard no more of it till justice Fielding sent for me. Then the evidence was there. I never saw my tankard since. The prisoner was taken, and I was at Mr. Fielding's when he was there. He denied knowing any thing of the matter.</p>

On Friday the 19th of Sept. between five and six in the evening, Norris came into my house; he shook hands with me, having before done business for me as a Marshal's-court officer. Soon after him came the prisoner in a mighty hurry, and said: He had lost thirty pounds by a Jew, and had brought Norris to arrest him. Norris and another man had been several times in my house the week before. They were admitted into a room, where we do not admit any body; none but neighbours and people of reputation. They pretended they had extraordinary business, and they must go backwards. It is a private room, that faces the door. I was that day bottling damsins, for the West-Indies. The door stood open. I had at that time two tankards, and three mugs, in a cupboard in that room; the place where they constantly are, when not in use; and the door was locked. The key was delivered to my boy, to get a tankard out: he went and fetched one while they were both in the room: he left the key in the door. In that tankard was carried beer for my brother, and another man, who drank it in that room: they drank the beer, and went away, and left the tankard on the table. After they were gone, the prisoner and Norris were very peevish, because they could not have the door shut, being, as they pretended, on particular business. They shut the door. They drank two six-pennyworths of rum and water out of a silver pint-mug, which was taken out of the cupboard for them. I believe they might stay there twenty minutes, or half an hour. When they went away, Norris came out first, about a minute before Hicks, and then he came out in a great hurry, saying: Which way is Norris gone? which way is he gone? if I miss him I am utterly ruined. He had a bag under his right-arm, folded up, about the bulk of a quart, and a pint within-side it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he such a bag when he came into your house?</p>
               <p>Robinson. If he had, I did not observe it. When he got out at the door, he cried: Hip, hip, hip. Norris turned towards Duke's-place, and the other after him. We went immediately into the room, and found the cupboard-door locked, and the key was hid. We found it soon after put under some things in an egg-basket. We opened the cupboard, and missed a silver tankard, and a silver pint mug. I pursued them amongst that nest of thieves in Duke's-place, but could not meet with them. I never heard of the tankard and mug since.</p>

               <p>Q. How was Hicks dressed?</p>
               <p>Robinson. He was not in his soldier's cloaths, but in a light coloured jacket, with little buttons, like a sailor.</p>
               <p>Mary Hill. I live with Mr. Robinson. I was at this time helping Mr. and Mrs Robinson in the fore room. I thought them to be thieves, and set myself in a particular place to watch them. Hicks had nothing under his arm when he went into the room, that I am certain of. I went into the room, and took the tea-things out of a cupboard, and locked the door again. Hicks said, he had been tricked out of 30, by a Jew in Duke's-place, by one Levi that keeps a publick house, a smooth faced man. They said, perhaps I might know him. I said, There are many Levies in Duke's-place; and went out of the room. When I went in to carry the tea-things, they asked me to drink. I went in a third time, then Hicks cry'd like a child whip'd with a rod, pretending he was ruined, and the like; and said, he would not mind giving half a guinea could he get the man. He came out two or three times, and always shut the door after him; at last Norris came out, and Hicks shut the door after him; after that he came out with a parcel under his arm in a bag, near as big as a couple of tankards, and said, Which way is Norris gone? and gave me a shilling for the rum and water which they had had; I said, you may be sure he is gone towards Duke's-place. He went to the door and cry'd, Hip, boy, Norris!<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176012040035"></xptr> and away he went; I saw nothing more of them afterwards. Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, and I, went into the room immediately, there stood the tankard Mr. Robinson's brother and another gentleman had drank out of, and the silver pint mug they had drank out of. The cupboard door was lock'd, and the key hid; when we found it, we looked into the cupboard, and missed a silver tankard and silver pint mug. We have not seen either of them since.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Where is the lad that unlock'd the cupboard door.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He is in court, but he is but eleven years of age last February, and a weak lad as to understanding.</p>
               <p>The lad was set up, but not knowing the nature of an oath, he was not sworn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I do not know where the prosecutor lives. I know nothing at all of the man.</p>

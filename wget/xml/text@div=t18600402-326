                  </hi>. I am a widow, of Chalcot Villas, Regent's-park—the prisoner was my coachman—he had the care of my horses at Eastbourne in September last, and it was his duty to obtain corn and hay for them, and to come to me for money to pay the bills—he presented these two bills to me at Eastbourne, and I paid him for them—I never saw either of these other bills until I saw them in the hands of the police constable—I paid the prisoner other moneys for saddlery and sundries about the same time—I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 19th September—he presented this bill to me with the stamp on it, and I paid him this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the bill is for 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. purporting to come from Mr. Wall—this account, giving the items (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), was given to me by the prisoner—I never saw this other bill for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at all, or any other bill from Mr. Wall except this—I never gave the prisoner authority to get goods elsewhere, and put them down into Mr. Wall's or Mr. Hurst's bill.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186004020013"></xptr>
               <p>—I still have the three horses—I had no charge made by him or anybody else for corn during that period—the usual course was, for the prisoner to pay small amounts out of his own pocket, and come to me to be reimbursed, but it was contrary to my orders; I repeatedly told him not—I from time to time sanctioned that act by reimbursing him—he occasionally brought me a few bills which he had paid out of his pocket, and asked me to reimburse him, but very seldom—I believe the only account he brought to me at Eastbourne receipted as having been already paid by him, was the sadler's, and I paid him the amount—I owed him some wages when he was discharged, and also some money which he had paid on my account—it amounted altogether I dare say to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and has not been paid to this day.</p>

               <p>give green clover to horses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I will not swear exactly that it was green, but I know it was clover—it came in regular farmiug carts—the tares were in bundles, and there was grass—green graas was cut and given to the horses—we left in September—we went down before that—green food was given all the time we were down there—I never troubled myself to take the name of any farmer's cart—the horses were at the Wish-house, the stables belonging to the house—I used to be in the stables every morning—there was no memorandum given or taken—it was before we left town that Mrs. Hall told me to tell the prisoner not to make out so many little bills—it was not that she thought the bills he was making out were too much; nothing of the kind—I mean to say that she told me to tell him to put all the little bills, for forage of the horses, into one—two French ladies were present, and one of them came down into the kitchen and spoke to the prisoner about making out so many bills, and told him to put all the bills for the forage into one—I was discharged by Mrs. Hall, not at the same time that the prisoner was, but before they went to the Isle of Wight, when they left Eastbourne—I do not know why she discharged me, but if she had not I should have discharged myself—I do not know how the prisoner made up the bills—I had nothing to do with it.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who were the French ladies; were they friends of Mrs. Hall, or ladies' maids? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know whether you would call them ladies; I did not think them so: Mrs. Hall was lodging with them at the time—I was out of place about three months, as I was kept without a character—I got the place I have now partly on the character I got from Mrs. Hall—I referred to her for it and they denied it two or three times; I also referred to my former employer, on which I obtained the place I now have—there is no ground for imputing any dishonesty to me while I was with Mrs. Hall.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Bingfield, in Berkshire—I have known the prisoner from his childhood—it is usual to give green meat to horses in the summer and autumn—green meat is a general term for tares, clover, and that sort of thing—it is very often called grass—it is usual to give green clover to horses—during the time I have known the prisoner, I can give him a good character in every point of view; perfectly good for honesty and integrity—I have never heard the slightest imputation against him up to the present time—he has been in his own uncle's service—I am his uncle by marriage.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that it is usual to give green meat in the autumn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly; in October—it was given the whole of the winter before last; the winter being mild—I gave them to my own horses—I am a yeoman—I farm my own land—one of mine is a horse that I drive in my shay-cart, and the other is a farming horse—green meat is certainly given to carriage horses in September and October, and even later than that I have known it done—they have clover about that time, what we call latimust—I have seen the prisoner lately; I was bail for him—he has been with me since the bail—I have seen him frequently for the last two or three years, before he was taken in custody—I sometimes come to town—I have not seen him so often as three or four times in the year.</p>

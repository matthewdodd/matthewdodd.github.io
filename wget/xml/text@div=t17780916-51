On the 11th of September last I had been making the fire<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160031"></xptr> for my father and mother; as I passed by the prisoner's apartment, the prisoner called to me, and desired me to fetch him sixpence-worth of halfpence; I fetched it, and laid the change down upon the table which was near the bed side; this was between seven and eight in the morning; the prisoner was then in bed. The deceased was in a chair sitting in the same room; and which chair was about a yard and half from the bed. I was going away after I had laid down the change; the prisoner bid me stop and sit down; I sat down at the feet of the bed; I had not sat down there above the space of a minute, when the deceased made use of some expressions or other, but what the particulars were I do not know; I cannot say whether they were words of passion or heat, or words of contempt; but some expressions fell from the deceased, which were addressed to the prisoner. The prisoner immediately after the words were spoken, snatched up a pair of scissars from a table that was near the bed side; and sitting up in bed, he threw these scissars at the deceased. I cannot tell how they were thrown; whether they were taken up by the point, or whether they were taken up by the handles; whether they were closed or open, but I saw the scissars hit the deceased; she immediately clapped her hand to her neck; and I, seeing the blood run down her arm, ran out and called for assistance. The poor woman died in five or six minutes afterwards; I did not see her again till after she was dead. The deceased had lain up in the garret all the preceding night.

               <p>I live next door to the prisoner. About eight in the morning, on the 11th of September, Mrs. Fleming came to my house, and said she believed there was murther committed between Monday and Robinson; she was generally known by the name of Monday, I ran then directly and met the deceased a few yards from the door; she was then upright coming towards me; there appeared to be a quantity of blood running from her neck; I put my hand to the wound; but when I removed my hand from the wound, the deceased herself put her own hand there. The deceased never spoke a single word to me during the whole time I was with her; she was then about six yards from her own room; she dropped down in three or four minutes, and died very soon after. I was in company with the prisoner and the deceased over night; some words passed between them in my presence. The deceased had told me that morning, that they had had words that very morning.</p>

               <p>I live within thirty yards of the prisoner. I came up about five minutes after the deceased had fallen down; I saw her shrink up her shoulders in the act of dying, and she died immediately after. Myself and another person attempted to break open the prisoner's door to apprehend him: he had made the door very fast. I got an old pistol in order to intimidate him, and went round to his apartment; there I saw the window broke, and some mats put up to the window in order to keep out the cold; I removed some of those mats; there I saw the prisoner still in bed; I forced myself through the window and went up to him and seized him. He said, is she dead? I told him she was dead enough; and I said you have done a very rash action. The reply he made to it was, I know I have, good Lord pray for me: I have done it with the scissars! I saw the scissars lie upon the floor, and there was a stream of blood which followed the deceased's body, and a quantity of blood where the deceased dropped. I took the prisoner before the magistrate and he was committed; as he was going before the magistrate, he was forced to step over the body of the deceased; he looked at the body as he was going over it, and said, he hoped the mob would pray for him.</p>

               <p>I am a surgeon. I examined the body of the deceased; I found the carotid artery was wounded, by which means the whole blood was exhausted. This was undoubtedly the immediate cause of her death. The wound appeared to have been made by a pointed instrument with an edge to it.</p>
               <p>Could it have been caused if the scissars had been closed at the time? - No; they must have been expanded before the neck<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177809160032"></xptr> was struck; if they had been thrown close, they must have expanded of course. The instrument is very loose in the river; I apprehend they must have expanded in less than two feet.</p>

               <p>I went out with some goods last Thursday; I came home about twelve in the day; she was not in the way. I boiled some potatoes; this woman's sister-in-law, an Irishwoman that lives up stairs, received her monthly money; this Irishwoman came, and met this woman in the passage; she said, Dolly, will you have a dram of your brother's money; no, says this woman that stands here, I will give a dram to Robinson, because he is good to the children. I was coming home, the deceased met us; she was very angry; she was always jealous of my spending my money with people; she made a noise; I shut the door and went up stairs; she went up and laid in the Irishwoman's room all night. She came in between seven and eight; there were no words between us. I gave her two-pence for a dram; she brought it, and we drank together; she was saying that I was giving my liquor away to those that would not serve me; I was going to treat this woman; the deceased gave me ill language; I threw the scissars at her; but God knows! not with an intention to hurt her.</p>

On the 8th of September, by the direction of Butcher, I followed the prisoner Elsgood's wagon—he had three nose-bags hanging under the hind part of the axletree, which appeared to be full—I saw a boy named Kneller—he met Elsgood's wagon at the Broadway, Deptford, just as he set out, at five o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I followed the wagon to several places, till it got to Old Gravel-lane—Elsgood there emptied the nose-bags into a flour-sack, and as he tied it up I noticed a darn in it—he threw it down, and sat on it—he then went on to the hay market, in Whitechapel, where a country cart drew alongside of his wagon, and put some hay into it—Elsgood then drove on to the New Cross Inn—I there saw Roots standing outside, near the watering-trough—they spoke together, but I did not hear what they said—then Roots took the full sack from the shafts, and took it into his stable—Elsgood was feeding his horses with hay, and watering them—Roots was not gone more than two or three minutes—he then brought the empty sack, and put it where he took it from—he then went into the public-house and got a pot of beer—they drank, and the boy had some—I got assistance, and we went into the stable—I there found the food I produce—Elsgood had taken the sack away—I let him go on—I went to Mr. Carpenter's, and found the same sack there—from the time I saw Roots go into the stable till I went is, no one else went in—I found between three and four bushels—I at last found the sack in Mr. Carpenter's yard, along with some others—I took Elsgood into custody, and told him what for—he said it was a b----y lie.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general-dealer, and live in Cutler-street. On 21st July, I was going along—I met Fox, and went with him to a skittle-ground—I there saw Smith—he was the waiter—he fetched a pint of ale—they begun to play with skittles, and one man said to me," That old man has got plenty of money"—Fox lost some games—he came to me and said, "I will play you"—I could not play at skittles; my business does not allow me to stop in public-houses—I was going to walk off, and he took my gold guard from my neck, and a silver one from my waistcoat pocket—he wrapped them together and put them into his pocket—I said, "Give me my guards"—he would not—I went to the steps to get a policeman, and Fox</p>

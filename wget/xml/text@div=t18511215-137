The letter was signed "Thomas Henry Wood," and stated that a Mr. Price, of Bath, had offered 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. an acre for the land, and wished to know whether she (the prisoner) was disposed to sell it at that price—it purported to come from 13, Royal-crescent, Bath—I said I could not advise her at all about the value of the land, but asked her what she would do with the money if she sold it—she said she would put it into the bank—I said, "As you would not get so good an income from the bank as from the four acres, my advice is that you should keep it as it is"—she said she would do so, and as she could not read or write she would thank me to write to Mr. Wood to that effect—I wrote a letter, addressed it "Thomas Henry Wood, Esq., Royal-crescent, Bath," and gave it her to post—she thanked me, and went away—the copy of the will she gave me to read stated the four acres of freehold to have been left her by an uncle—I Teceived an</p>

               <p>answer to the letter I had written to Mr. Wood, but have destroyed it—the substance of it was that Mr. Wood quite agreed with the advice I had given her, that the property should not be disposed of—I then wrote again, and received this one in answer—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—directed—"Henry P. Davies, Esq., Palace<lb></lb>wharf, Lambeth. 13, Royal-crescent, Bath, 24th July, 1851. Sir,—I re<lb></lb>ceived your letter this afternoon, and I will send you Miss Mary Hall's money on Tuesday next, 29th inst., which is 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I shall feel much obliged if you will inform Miss Hall that I received a letter this morning from her aunt at Carlisle; she is very poorly, and wishes to see her niece as soon as possible, as she is of expected to live many days. I would advise her to make the best of her way to her aunt, and not delay one moment. I am happy to find that Miss Hall will not sell the four acres of land situated in Folly Close, as it will, in the course of two or three years, be worth three times the money Mr. Price has offered her for it, and her aunt is now far advanced in years, and not expected to live long; and at the death of her aunt she will come into full possession of Hadley Farm, which contains 130 acres of freehold land, and at present lets for 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; but if Miss Hall would appoint some person as an agent, the farm would let for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, as the land is good, and the farm in good repair. I am, dear Sir, yours respectfully, Thomas Henry Wood.") The prisoner said her aunt was a very aged woman, eighty years of age, or upwards, and lived at Carlisle, and at her death she would come into possession of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she said she should have 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Wood in a few days, and asked me to receive it for her—I said she had better receive it herself, or get some friend to re<lb></lb>ceive it for her—she said she could not read or write, and if she got any one it would be some petty shopkeeper or the woman where she lodged, and it would not be quite safe; so I then offered to receive the money for her, and wrote to Mr. Wood, giving him my Christian name, and then it was I received the letter I have produced—when I received the letter I told her she must immediately go to Carlisle—she said she could not do so until she received the money on the following Tuesday—I said she must not wait for that, as her aunt was so unwell, and I advanced her 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was about an hour before the train was to start, and she took the money in such a dilatory manner, she seemed so dilatory in starting, that I felt sure she would lose the train, and I took her to the station myself, and saw her off in the train—I then wrote again to Mr. Wood, and the letter was returned to me through the Post Dead-letter Office—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read—addressed, "</hi> Thomas Henry Wood, Esq., 13, Royal-crescent, Bath," <hi rend="italic">endorsed</hi>, "Unknown." "Palace<lb></lb>wharf, Lambeth, 26th July, 1851. Sir,—I received your letter of 24th inst. upon reaching town yesterday at 6 o'clock. I did not lose one moment to acquaint Mary Hall with the necessity of at once proceeding to Carlisle, and giving her the necessary sum for the purpose. I saw her off by the quarter to 9 train, which would be due at Carlisle at 5 minutes to 8 this morning. I am glad to find that your opinion coincided with that which I had previously given her with respect to the Folly Close property, and I presume that if anything happens to her aunt nothing will be done in the matter.

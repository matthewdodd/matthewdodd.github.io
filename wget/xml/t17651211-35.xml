            . On Monday the 18th of November I was in <placeName id="t17651211-35-crimeloc207">Leadenhall-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17651211-35-crimeloc207" type="placeName" value="Leadenhall-street"></interp>

I perceived a man's hand in my pocket; I turned immediately, and saw no person near me but the prisoner: I charged him with having taken my handkerchief upon missing it; he immediately threw it to me, and I catched it in my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where he took it from?</p>
               <p>Cooke. I think he took it from his bosom. He ran away, I called out stop thief; a man tripped up his heels; he was never out of my sight till taken. I got a constable and charged him; he was taken to the Compter, and next day before the sitting Alderman at Guildhall. I there produced the handkerchief: he there said he took it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110021"></xptr> off the ground. It appeared clean; and had it been on the ground it must have been very dirty at that time. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I picked up the handkerchief. A man passed by me, I did not know him; he went up by the market. The gentleman turned about, and asked me if it was his handkerchief: I said if it was, he might have it. I gave it him, and he gave charge of me directly. If it had been a handkerchief of gold, I should never have attempted to steal it.</p>

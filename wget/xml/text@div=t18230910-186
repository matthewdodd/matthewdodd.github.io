I saw it on the 26th of August, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening. On Sunday morning, between six and seven I missed it. I found it on the 28th in the prisoner's stable, in Duck-lane, fastened in. I know it to be mine. He said it was lying just by his place, and he opened the stable-door, and drove it in. It could not have strayed, as my yard has a fence three feet high.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. If he had stolen it he might have killed it, and made away with it - A. Yes; I found an ass in the stable; I believe it was padlocked, but am not certain.</p>

            . I am a constable, I went with Handley and the prosecutor, and found the hog, with an ass, in the prisoner's stable, in Duck-lane. The door was padlocked - I forced it open. We went to his lodging, and asked where his stable was; he hesitated, but his wife told us in his hearing. I told him to get up; he went with us to the yard - I went to the first stable, and took out the hasp - he said that was his stable. I found the hog in the next stable, which had his name chalked on the door. He said he knew nothing of anything in that stable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you found the pig, he was not there - A. No; we took him there afterwards. He told the Magistrate it had strayed, and he put it there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw this pig on the dunghill. I used to keep my two donkeys separate - I put one into my brother-in-law's stable, and this pig followed it in; being tired, I shut it in, and came out next day to find the owner.</p>

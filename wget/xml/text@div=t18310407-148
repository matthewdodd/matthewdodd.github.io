On the 5th of March, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I saw my street door open, as I was returning from my back premises; I was about to reprimand my servant, when I saw the prisoner come out of my front parlour with this desk under his arm, and the flute in his right hand; he went out - I called after him; he put down the desk and flute opposite the area; I pursued, brought him back, and gave him in charge - I had not lost sight of him for a momant.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BAGG. I was up stains, and heard s voice that I thought I recognized; I saw the prisoner run across the road, and some person after him - I saw my father cross, and take him; I went down, and took hold of him.</p>
               <p>JAMES MOORE. I am a constable. The prisoner was given into my charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was running, as any other person might do; the gentleman took up the property, and then came and took me, therefore he must have lost sight of me; at the office he said he had not seen my face, but he swore to me by my black coat, and the servant said I had a blue coat; it was a lamplighter stopped me.</p>
               <p>MR. BAGG. My house is directly opposite the church, and he crossed to Museum-street - as to his saying I took up the property, I passed by it, and pursued him; when I came up to him he turned round, and I saw his face. <rs id="t18310407-148-verdict822" type="verdictDescription">

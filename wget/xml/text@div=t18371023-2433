                  </hi>. On the 14th of October, in consequence of a ring at my mistress's bell, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the street door, and found the prisoner Redshaw there—he said, "How do you do? I want two sovereigns, and I must have them, for I am going into the country this evening"—I said I had not got them—he said he must have them, he was going into the country in the evening—I said, "I have not got them"—he said, "You have got a watch, let me have that, and I will pledge it, and send you back the duplicate "—I said, "I have not got one, where am I to get one?"—he said, "Get it as we do, how you can "—about this period of the conversation another person came up, who I had seen with the prisoner on the 12th, in Blackfriars-road—that person said to me, "How pale you look, how you tremble, give him the money, he will not say any thing "—I was trembling at the time—Redshaw then said, "You must have more clothes than you have got on, let me have them, and I will pledge them and send you back the dupli<lb></lb>cate "—I told him I could not get any money then, but I would meet him at eight o'clock in the evening, and if I could not bring all, I would bring as much as I could—my mistress was not at home at that time—she is a widow lady—there was no man in the house at the time—Redshaw said, "Go and ask your mistress for the money "—I told him she was not at home—it was then I said I would meet him in the evening—I could not say what time my mistress would be at home that evening—she might be home in about an hour or later, I could not tell—Redshaw asked what time she would be at home, and I said, "In the evening"—it was after that I agreed to meet him in Prince's-square, in the evening, and said I would bring him as much money as I could—I asked him to meet me at the corner of White Hart-row, which is the second turning from where I live, at eight o'clock in the evening—he said he could not wait so long as that, he would meet me at half-past six o'clock, at the corner of Prince's-square—they then both went away—while I was in conversation with them, the prisoner Page walked past, and looked at me, and went and stood two doors off—that was after I had been talking to them about three minutes—I do not think he was near enough to hear our conversation—I had never seen him before—I did not see what became of Page when the other two went away—I left home about ten minutes after they were gone, and informed the police—they did not go away in the direction Page was, but the other way</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183710230227"></xptr>
               <p>—I did not see Page after I saw him standing two doors off—how long he stood there I cannot say—I went out at the back door when I went out, but I saw Page again—I saw three of them in Prince's-square when I was going to the station-house—they were all three together, looking at some things in a broker's shop—I turned back and went another way, that they should not see me—I was about the middle of Prince's-square, and they at the other end—I was more than a hundred yards from them, but I saw them again before I got to the station-house, at the corner of East-street, Kennington-cross—they were then looking at another broker's shop, all three together, and talking together there—I did not say any thing, but tried to avoid them, and I think I did so—they did not speak to me—I was on the other side of the way—I passed very near to them, within six or seven yards—I saw nothing more of them again, till I met them in the evening—they seemed to me to be all talking together—it was the third man who came to the house, and he is the person I saw in Blackfriars-road—about twenty minutes after six o'clock I went to the corner of Prince's-square, and saw Redshaw there alone, walking up and down—I said, "You are here very soon, what a very great hurry you are in "—he said, "I have been to your house, I could not wait any longer "—he said, "I suppose you were at home, although they said you were not?"—I said, "I was at home "—he then said, "Have you brought the money? I was just coming again "—I answered that I had not got the money, I could not get the two sovereigns, but I had brought him all I could—I did not say how much it was—Redshaw said, "I must have it, for I am going to the west end, and have got to be there by seven o'clock, and I cannot lose that for you"—he then said he would not take any money unless I had got the two sove<lb></lb>reigns—I said, "You had better take what I have got, for I cannot get any more"—I had two marked shillings in my pocket at the time—at that moment Page came up, and said to Redshaw, <hi rend="italic">"Bill</hi> and took hold of his arm—they left me directly, and began to walk down Prince's-square—I did not hear what more was said—I had come with the policemen from the station-house to the square—the policemen were within sight of Page at the time—I had come with them to the end of the square, and then we parted—they were in sight of Redshaw when I first saw him, but he could not see them—they were on the opposite side of the way, in Kennington-road, out of Redshaw's sight—they could see him, for they were watching for him—I do not think he could see them—he was not looking that way I—he was paying attention to what I was saying—I did not see Page at that time, but when he came up and touched Redshaw on the shoulder—I suppose he had seen the policemen then, but I cannot say whether he had—I walked close behind him and Redshaw, when they walked away, and said, "You had better take the money"—I had not said what money I had—Redshaw said, "No, I will not take it now; you shall hear from me again soon"—I then gave a signal, by taking off my hat, which had been agreed on, and the policeman came and took them both into custody—when he took them I said Page was not the one, meaning he was not the one that had spoken to me—the policeman said, "I must take them both to the station-house," and then I gave them both in dirge—I had met Redshaw and the other man in Blackfriars-road on the 12th—I did not owe that man any money—I never had any transaction with him—I never made an agreement to pay Redshaw any money that I owed that man—they never said any thing to me about my owing him any money—they and that man's name was Denton—I never owed a person of that name</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant.

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. In consequence of a communication with the prosecutor, I, accompanied by a constable, went into Prince's-square on the evening of the 14th of October—when I first got there I saw the two prisoners and two other men—they were all together—they could see me as I came into the entrance of the square—one of the others was a person said to be Denton—the prosecutor went with us from the station-house to the top of Prince's-square by Kennington-cross—I saw them standing near Kennington-road, at the bottom of the square—we separated at the Cross—the prosecutor went down White Hart-row into Kennington-road, and I went down Prince's-square by another thoroughfare, so as to meet in the square—as soon as the four persons saw me they went in two two's—Redshaw and the tall man turned to the left towards White Hart-row, and Page and the other turned to the right—the tall man who was with Redshaw crossed over to the other side and stood with his arms folded on the other side of the road—Redshaw then walked towards White Hart row, and met the prosecutor just as he came round the corner—he turned back with the prisoners and walked to the entrance of the square—the tall man who was on the opposite side of the road took a little circle, then crossed the road and came into the square, and Page came to the square, and stopped with Redshaw and the prosecutor at the entrance of the square—I was not near enough to see whether Page touched anybody</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183710230231"></xptr>
               <p>—he very likely saw me before he went up to them—I could see him, and he might have seen me—the road is thirty or forty feet across—there was nothing between us to obstruct our view of each other—I was within thirty If or forty feet of him—the prosecutor and Redshaw appeared to be talking together till Page came up, and after he came up the prosecutor gave the signal we had agreed to, and the two prisoners walked away arm in arm—they had turned away before the prosecutor gave the signal, and were walking arm in arm into the square—I came up and took them into custody—Redshaw said, "It is not me you want, it is the tall man"—I had not told him who or what I wanted him for before he said that—I took them both to, the station-house—I heard Redshaw say to the inspector at the station-house that the prosecutor owed Denton some money, and he was to receive it on Ben ton's account, and he said he had never seen the prosecutor before that day in his life—Page never spoke—the prisoners were told the charge against them, but Page said nothing—I searched him and found 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and two farthings, a duplicate and a handkerchief—the money was given back to him—on Redshaw was found two handkerchiefs, a duplicate, one bad sovereign, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I afterwards went to No. 43, Little Sur<lb></lb>rey-street, and found the prisoners lodged there—it is a coal-shed and green-grocer's—I saw a man in the shop there—it is three or four hundred yards from the obelisk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you go to that shop in consequence of Page telling you he lodged there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They both gave that address—I found it with some difficulty—I was dressed just as I am now—the four men had an opportunity of seeing me when I saw them together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Redshaw.</hi> He said before the Magistrate, last Monday, that there were three of us, and then he said there were four of us together. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I said at first that there were four, and there were four—I distinctly saw them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 43, Little Surrey-street. The prisoners lodged with me between three and four months—on Satur<lb></lb>day, the 14th of October, Redshaw left my house about three o'clock, or a little after, to the best of my recollection—I do not recollect whether Page went out with him—I do not think he did—I did not see Redshaw again till he was in custody—I do not know what time Page left—I do not re<lb></lb>collect seeing him since between two and three o'clock—I think I saw him between two and three o'clock—we generally dined together between twelve and one o'clock—I think he dined with me that day—I do not know the exact time he left my house, but I believe it was between two and three o'clock—I will not be certain whether the prisoners left together—I do not recollect seeing them both go out together—I saw Redshaw go out of the parlour—Page was not in the parlour at that time—I cannot say how long he had left it—it might be half an hour—they both lived toge<lb></lb>ther, and were on friendly terms—they did not go out much after they came to my house—they sometimes went out together—neither of the pri<lb></lb>soners have directed me to make any application to the prosecutor since they have been in custody—I have seen the prosecutor, and spoken to him—I did not see him after I had seen the prisoners—I have not seen them all the week since last Monday, at the Hall, and I had not spoken to the prosecutor then—whatever I said to the prosecutor was out of my own head.</p>

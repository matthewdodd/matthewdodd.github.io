The deceased young woman was my daughter—she was twenty-five years old last February, and lived at home with me, at Hendon—her name was Ann Sarah Cox—she was commonly called Annie—I have known the prisoner a long time—he used to come into our house of an evening, and of a morning—he slept there from the Wednesday week until the Saturday morning when this happened—he had been courting my daughter for about eight months; since August—on that Saturday morning, while I was lying in bed, I heard a noise—I do not remember the day of the month—it was at the end of March—the prisoner said, "Good morning"—that was before I heard the noise—I cannot say what time it was when I heard that, because I was in bed and roused from sleep—it was in the morning—I heard nothing, only James Lawrence say good morning to me, and I said, "Good morning" again—I knew his voice—I heard nothing more until I heard the noise—he said nothing that I heard but, "Good morning"—I did not hear him say anything to my daughter—I was in bed—he said, "Are you going to lie a-bed all day?"</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Mill-hill, Hendon—I know the house in which Mrs. Bettle lives—I was passing that house on the morning of Satur<lb></lb>day, 29th March, about a quarter or twenty minutes to 6 o'clock—I was going to my work—as I went by I heard a great noise, as though something were falling from a shelf—I could not judge from where it came—I was thinking more about my work than anything else, and did not take particu<lb></lb>lar notice—I could judge of the direction from which it came—as I was going to work it was on the left-hand side, the same side that the cottages were on—I went on after that noise for about thirty, or from that to forty yards—I then heard a female calling very loudly from a window—I believe that was the mother of the deceased, Ann Bettle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You only heard a noise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A kind of rumbling altogether, as though some things were falling down—the noises were very momentary—it was like two things together, but was very quick, whatever it was—it seemed like two noises—there did not seem to be much interval between the two—I cannot tell whether it was one or two noises—the noise was momen<lb></lb>tary—I did not hear two distinct noises at two distinct times.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is at the back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Little gardens—the street door opens into the road, but the door which when open, prevents the staircase door from being opened, that is the back door—as you go into the wash-house that door goes from you—there is a door in the middle of the wash-house that opens into a front parlour; it is like a passage through, and there is another door which takes you into the parlour—the door which prevented the staircase door from opening, is a door which goes outside into</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising at Hendon—on Saturday morning, 29th March, I was sent for, about twenty minutes past 6, to Mrs. Bettle's cottage, and got there about forty minutes past 6—I found Ann Cox lying on the sofa, dead—I found on the right side of her neck a hole about the size of a shilling—the skin was blackened round the hole about an inch in circumference—I mean a black ring extended about an inch from the hole, all round—the wound did not injure any of the arteries on that side—on the left side of the neck I found a severe lacerated wound—it was the same wound coming out—the hole was as large as the palm of my hand nearly—it had severed all the great vessels, and also the swallow—that would be quite sufficient to account for death—I made a post-mortem examination of the body—that would be four days after, because the Inquest was held, and they had to adjourn it—I found three shots and a piece of a yellow colander together in the wound—the piece of colander was quite close to the shot—when I went in the morning to see the body, I observed the fragments of a shattered colander against the wall, about five feet seven, or five feet six from the floor—it was hanging from a nail by a piece of thread—I had not the least doubt that the piece of colander was sent into the wound by the rebound; because it was not very deep—it was just on the external surface, where the wound came out, where it was as large as the palm of my hand—I did not see how near the deceased was to the wall—the fragment of the colander was about a yard from the copper—the copper was in a different position—I examined the rest of the body in the post-mortem examination—I found nothing else to account for death—after I had examined the deceased on the morning, I went into the next cottage, the prisoner's father's cottage, and there found the prisoner walking about the front-room, with his hand to his face—on the left side of his face I found a very severe lacerated wound, which had fractured the lower jaw, and des<lb></lb>troyed nearly the whole of the left cheek—a gun-shot would be the only thing to produce it—I bandaged the wound there, and sent him to the hospital—I said to him, "Lawrence; you did this yourself?"—he said, "Yes, Sir"—I said, "And you have killed that poor girl too?"—he made no answer to that</p>

So good bye all, and bless you, dear friends, I must conclude with my own best love to all, and you are the cause of this Mrs. Bettle, and you will find it out.

I live at Mill-hill, Hendon, and am a working gardener—I have known the prisoner ten years—he and I were working for the same employer since Christmas last, up to the 28th March—I knew from him that he had been courting Ann Cox—some short time before 29th March I had a conversation with him on the subject of Ann Cox—I could not say exactly how long before, but between a fortnight and three weeks—he told me that he heard Mrs. Bettle say she was going to sleep with Harry, and she asked her daughter who she was going to sleep with, and she said <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>—I asked him what <hi rend="italic">Jem,</hi> and he mentioned the man's name, but I do not remember it—I did not know the man—the prisoner said he was a lodger and an out-policeman—it was since that time, and before the occurrence, that he told me he was a policeman; before the 29th—he told me that he was in his father's bedroom, and the partition being thin he heard it—I have heard him talk about Ann Cox very often, but I did not take any notice of what he said; I thought he was joking—I saw him on 28th March, and the first words I heard him say about it then were, "My Nancy's in the Strand, buy<lb></lb>ing a bun"—I asked him if she was gone to London, and he told me, "Yes, gone to be married"—some time afterwards he asked me what time it was—I told him it wanted ten minutes to 12—he said, "My Nancy's married by this time"—I asked him who he thought she was married to, and he told me the policeman; he said his name, but I do not know it—it was the name that he had mentioned before as being the policeman—I asked him whether he meant the man that lodged there, and he said, "Yes"—I said, "What makes you talk so silly as that, when you know better than that yourself?"—he told me she was; he meant gone to be married—he made no other answer than that at that time—in the afternoon he began to talk about it again, and said, "My Nancy's in the Strand, buying a bun"—he continually kept saying so—I said that I should have to take him to Colney Hatch, or somewhere else, if he talked like that—he said no he should not; meaning he should not go—he said,</p>

The next morning I received a letter from him. The contents were, that he was in trouble in New-prison, and begged I would come and speak to him. I did not go then, but on the 2d or 3d day I did. He told me he was taken up by a warrant for having carried away some books of a man that he had lived with before, and desired I would apply to the person that was to prosecute him. Then I was alarmed, and suspected him . My wife when I came home told me, there was a yard of long lawn missing. I went to the prison and asked him about it. He acknowledged he had taken it. I lost silks and sattins of divers sorts , the quantity impossible to be ascertained by me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lynn . I am a pawnbroker ; I live at Hyde-park-corner. (He produced some pieces of remnant of silks and stuff. ) These things the prisoner pawned with me on the 3d of July last, for 16 s. I inquired where he lived; he said at Knightsbridge , that his sister was dead and they were left to him.</p>

               <p>What were the coals worth? - They were fairly worth seven shillings and threepence. At first the three servants would not tell where they had disposed of the coals; upon which I said if you will not tell I shall compel you to it. When I had paid them their wages I asked what the account was. I had heard the coals had been taken out, then it was they confessed they had taken them.</p>

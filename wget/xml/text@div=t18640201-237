                  </hi>. I am a chemical colour manufacturer, at Jubilee-street, Mile-end—I formerly had an office in Leadenhall-street, and carried on business under the name of Wilson and Fletcher—I have known the prisoner for about three years—I was formerly a creditor of his, and after<lb></lb>wards took him into my service, at a salary of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—that was in July, 1862, during the existence of the partnership between myself and Fletcher—I think the dissolution of that partnership was gazetted in March or April, 1863—the actual dissolution was before it appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>, I think, in February—the prisoner continued as clerk up to the time of dissolution and afterwards—some time after the dissolution with Fletcher, the prisoner expressed a wish to become a partner, and made a communication to me—he told me his uncle was desirous of assisting him here in England, and for that purpose he would advance a certain sum of money, and he hoped on that account I would take him into partnership—I stated that if the sum of 1,580<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was forthcoming, I might then, on certain terms, do so; 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his share in the business, and 580<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of my loss on the old estate, which I had taken up and paid a</p>

(Signed) Wilson and Co. A. Oppenheim will sign Wilson and Co.")—I signed the name of the firm as Wilson and Co.—after the dissolution with Fletcher, I carried on business as Wilson and Co.—I remained away about three weeks, and returned about the latter end of March—I afterwards left again on account of illness—I left in May completely—I was laid up in bed, unable to move—previously to that, I was for some time very unwell and only occasionally able to go to business—during all that time the prisoner was managing the business—I returned to business on 6th June, and then found this letter in the prisoner's handwriting—he had not given me any notice that he was going to leave; I expected to find him at the office as usual—(<hi rend="italic">letter read:</hi> "43, Devonshire-street; Friday, June 5th, Dear Wilson, Do not judge me before you see me again, which will be before long; forgive the trouble I have heaped upon your head, and do not curse your heart-broken A.

Dear Wilson, When I got up last Friday morning, I had no more idea to leave London than you had of leaving Europe. I went over to the factory, looked round, &amp;c., and then walked to Leadenhall-street. I had expected a remittance for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the last few days previous to cover some liabilities which were falling due out of my old estate; and expecting this remittance, I had in the meantime drawn sufficient from the bank to pay these bills, meaning to repay the sum on receipt of the money, which I expected daily. I would not have done so, however, but for the 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had previously paid into the business, and thinking it no barm to withdraw part of the sum for a few days. On that Friday morning, I learned that I <hi rend="italic">would not</hi> receive the expected remittance, and at the same time a letter from your bank arrived, saying they had the day before returned a bill of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. unpaid, on account of insufficient funds, we having no right to draw under a balance of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. This news, coupled with the knowledge of further liabilities which I <hi rend="italic">then</hi> saw no hope of meeting, fairly took away my breath and benumbed my reasoning powers. I walked about the streets for an hour or two, having no heart to stay at the office, vainly trying to think what I could do to make every<lb></lb>thing right; the more I thought, the more disheartened I got. The fact of some of your bills falling due on that very Friday, and the fact of not sufficient funds to meet them on account of my inability to repay, <hi rend="italic">at once,</hi> the sum I had withdrawn, almost drove me mad. There was already enough besides to do so. My dear uncle had made himself liable, on my account, for a considerable sum, and the payment of this will all but ruin him. You have no idea what I suffered, and what I suffer still. I walked about on that dreary Friday not knowing which way to turn; I had not the heart to face you; I knew you could not forgive me, and, what is more, that I did not deserve it. In my despair, the thought forced itself on my stunned mind to leave England, and <hi rend="italic">before I fairly knew where I was,</hi> I was travelling away to France. Sick at heart, I travelled, and travelled, and travelled without stopping, till I came here. I arrived at Barcelona last night, and I cannot rest till I have despatched this letter to you. I am <hi rend="smallCaps">NOT</hi> a bad man, for all that you must think so; circumstances were too strong for weak me and overpowered me. I can hardly hope that you will judge me or my doings rightly, but, on the contrary, that you will despise me as one unworthy of your friendship. I pray and beg that the power may be given me to make good everything towards you; and I shall not be myself again till this is accomplished. I mean <hi rend="italic">work, and can work;</hi> and this, dear Wilson, makes me hope that to accomplish it may not be out of my power. You may, perhaps, resent my calling you still 'dear Wilson,' but for the world of me I cannot do otherwise. A. Oppenheim.")—The prisoner had no authority to discount bills at any "other place than the Bank of London—he had no authority to discount with Mr. Hermann—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are bills of exchange drawn by me; they amount in the aggregate to 239<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have the pass-book here—100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to my credit on 5th June, and a country draft of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is entered in the cash-book—it may have been payable in London—this is the cash-book kept by the prisoner—the last entry appears to have been made on 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> June</p>

Oppenheim, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I know there are a great many irregular entries there—I have looked over many of those items—I find two entries here of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I can only explain as to those entries that moneys have been withdrawn and paid in a very irregular manner—I am attributing to him that he has taken 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one of those huudreds represents half of the produce of that bill; I can't say which, inasmuch as they are both on the same date—it is one of them, whichever you like—100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of those two items represents 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the cheque—it was a cheque, I believe—the other 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. represents money that was given to him and accepted for another of my cheques—I think I can find that one—this is the cheque, I believe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is dated June 8th—I am sure it is the cheque for the money that is entered in the cash-book as June 4th—the prisoner did not get the money for that cheque from the bank; he exchanged it with some one else; I believe, with a Mr. Werner—I don't know whether he is here—I believe some one is here to speak to this cheque; I can't say positively—it is entered in the pass-book on 8th June, therefore it is clear that some one else presented it at the bank—that person will be here—I can't say which of those two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in by the prisoner, because they are entered in the same manner—in his second letter, he speaks of a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-bill being returned by the bank on the 4th—116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid in on the 4th, but I think that was money that came from customers—money is continually being paid into the bank—money was paid in on 4th June—there were the two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I spoke of—500<hi rend="italic">l</hi> of that was paid on 26th February I think, and 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 16th March—I believe those were the dates—the date of the authority to the bank was the 9th March—I went abroad on that day—I gave him power to draw, because I was going abroad—I was gone a fortnight or three weeks—when I returned, I was at the manufactory, not at the office—I scarcely went to the office at all—the factory is about a mile and a half from the office I suppose—I went to the office occasionally—I partially attended to business for the space of a month, or five or six weeks, after I returned from abroad—this memorandum is in my handwriting—I believe I prepared this after I came back—during the four or five weeks I was at business after I came back from abroad, I did not revoke the authority to him to draw on the bank—it was withdrawn after his departure—I drew cheques myself as well, at that time, concurrently with him when he was away, sometimes one drew, and sometimes the other, for a short period; cheques and bills too—I was very little at the office indeed—I gave the 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bills to the prisoner for repayment of the money—I told him it was in repayment—it was repaid as so much cash that I had previously received—I mean to swear that—I have since taken steps against Aubenheim, and received some money on these bills from him—in consequence of the prisoner's departure, and my discovery of the means by which he had raised the money, I consi<lb></lb>dered that Aubenheim was not entitled to have drawn those bills, and took proceedings against him—I treated him as a rogue—the money I paid for the bills was the payment of the 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have received a very small sum of money from Aubenheim, not above 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am not charging the prisoner with taking that 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but with drawing certain sums of money from the bank—the private ledger is here—125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or some sum in florins, was received over in Worms—I had the account handed to me by my agent, which you are at liberty to inspect—Aubenheim paid a certain sum in florins, which I suppose would amount to 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; two of these bills were accepted on 15th April, and the third was arranged to be accepted—I have</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say in this authority, "And in case of the dissolution of our partnership;" what do you mean by that? if that does not apply to the prisoner, to whom does it apply? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not write that; it is a printed authority given by the bank to me—it the usual form of the bank, and applies to any person—there was money paid in at that time on account of the projected partnership, 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and shortly after that I wrote out this memorandum of partnership—I imagine that the words," in case of the dissolution of our partnership all such acts of the said Adolphus Oppenheim shall be binding upon us," in plain language means, that I would be responsible for all cheques and bills signed by him, but as far as any partnership was concerned, there was nothing of the sort—I had received his money, and, so far as it was paid into the bank, I used it, and I repaid it on those bills—I imagine when I accept a bill I am so far responsible for it, that I consider I have repaid the amount—I gave the bills to the prisoner—they went through him to Aubenheim I suppose—I said I had given them to the prisoner for Aubenheim—I lived at Bow, in the Mile-end-road—the factory was much closer than the office; a mile nearer, and that is some<lb></lb>thing when you are not well—I only signed bills and cheques occasionally then—I had the whole of my operations to attend to at the factory—I had machinery and plant, and so on—I was not well enough to go to the office—I have the key of the private ledger here—there is an account made out, "A. Oppenheim's drawing account"—" on 26th, cash, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "; that is the sum I spoke of as the first instalment of the partnership; then "March 14th, 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," "May the 9th, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not a third sum paid on account of the partnership—that is a memorandum that was made after the departure of the prisoner; a memorandum of the accounts as they stood in the cash-book—that sum of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is a sum paid in by the prisoner in an irregular manner that is all I can say—I don't know whether I took the cash; it was paid into the bank, I will admit that—I had no way of distinguishing it then—I suppose the money was used; it is entered in his own handwriting, "May 9th, A. Oppenheim, private, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that was not an additional sum, part of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was to be paid—it was a sum that was sent up from Glasgow—the prisoner was on a journey then—it was received in the</p>

               <p>you wished to have it—it was not prepared with care or accuracy—it did not include all the drawings I then charged him with taking—I did not strike a balance, because at the time that was done actions were pending on some cheques, which I have had to pay—this had nothing to do with the actions at all—I was only saying that at the time it was prepared, in June, these payments were not absolutely made which I have subsequently in<lb></lb>cluded—I have since included the payment of a cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated somewhere about June 8th, a post-dated cheque—there was another cheque dated June 8th; I have no doubt it is here; it may have been June 5th—yes, this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and is dated June 1st—here is another one dated May 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>; that was paid on May 30th—there is an entry there of that—there is also an entry on June 1st, of 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the day book is here—that cheque for 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is dated May 30th, and entered here June 1st—the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheques have not changed places, because the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not paid till some time afterwards—it is quite possible, for this reason, that at the time I made that account it was not entered in the bank account—if a cheque is given on May 30th, it is very probable it would only be paid in on June 1st—there is only one cheque on May 30th, and one dated June 1st here—this one, dated May 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> seems to have been retained by some one, and then paid in on the 30th—I charged the prisoner with stealing special sums, amounting altogether to 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think I have repaid the 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the prisoner paid in by the bills, and therefore he had no right to draw out this 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under any circumstances—he says, in his letter, that I had 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his, and I say it is not true—I say I repaid the sum lent by Auben<lb></lb>heim by the bills—I have not charged the prisoner with so large a sum as he has taken, and therefore the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before mentioned has been virtually deducted—he has not specially had credit for it in that document you have there, but I have another one prepared which shows it—I believe the prisoner is a bankrupt; he has petitioned the Bankruptcy Court—I knew that, per<lb></lb>haps, about three weeks before he was charged at the Mansion House—he gave me notice where he was through his attorney—for a long time the matter was in Messrs. Mullen's hands; they simply had notice that he was about to petition the Bankruptcy Court—I don't remember whether his address was sent or not; it may have been—I went immediately and in<lb></lb>formed Mr. Mullens—it may have been three weeks after that that I took proceedings in the police-court—during that time I believe there was an ex<lb></lb>amination in the Bankruptcy Court, but I did not take any notice of it—it would have been rather an awkward thing to have been made a partner with him in the Bankruptcy Court, but I did not fear that—on my oath I con<lb></lb>sulted Mr. Mullens as to criminal proceedings immediately after the pri<lb></lb>soner's departure—after I had been swindled I tried to get the money back the best way I could, and for that purpose I sued Aubenheim—two of the bills were abroad upon which I took criminal proceedings—there are entries of the payment of the prisoner's salary continually, on account—here is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have the private ledger here—there was no entry made at all from the cash-books until after his departure—it had never been posted; it could only be eutered in the cash-book—it is only posted from the cash-book to the ledger—there was no entry made of these sums—he drew sums from time to time corresponding nearly with the amount of his salary, and, of course, as I was away very much, these sums could not be made in regular weekly payments—I have other clerks and servants—I have a wages account in this ledger of them—there is no wages account of the prisoner's; he was in a confidential position with me, and he was desirous that the amount of</p>

               <p>his salary should not be exposed—the wages of the others are entered weekly; the men paid at the factory, and the lads in the office—you will see entered here 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as half a year's salary of the prisoner's—this is the account, from June to December, of the amounts paid to him; it was not made up after<lb></lb>wards—I don't care whether it is called a drawing account, or what it is called—it is written there, "A. Oppenheim, drawing-account"—that was not written with the intention of being legally discussed afterwards; it does not appear anywhere else—when the balances were drawn it was included with the other amounts—it appears in the general balance—that was the settlement at the end of the half-year—it is carried to another book, in which my balances were kept—I have not that here; it was my private balance—this was all during my partnership with Fletcher—I can show you that sums were drawn after the dissolution, but they were not entered regularly because it was not posted—it was the prisoner's duty to post it, and he did not—he left before the six months were out—I can only show you that these sums have been taken; they are chiefly in the prisoner's own handwriting—it is not spoken of as salary or wages, it is simply entered, "Oppenheim"—that is a ledger in which I have made private memoranda—I see here an entry on 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> January, "Oppenheim 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." then "Oppenheim 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have put those sums into that account which you have before you—I have extracted all the sums I have found from the day-book—that account was read to me by Mr. Scobell, and I simply wrote what he read—the prisoner has been credited on that paper with the amount which was due to him for salary—there is no other entry of salary or wages than that which I have described—there has been no settlement since December 1862.</p>

Oppenheim's drawing account," and not a figure was written on that page until after his departure—I swear that those two pages were written up to 1862, certainly, and all the rest written after his departure, after I found him to be a rogue—there is "A.

                  </hi> a friend of Mr. Wilson's, I undertook to keep his ledger for a time—that was about July, 1862—I recollect hearing of the prisoner's leaving—a morning or two after that I went through the cash-book with Mr. Wilson—the entries in the cash-book, after 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> June, 1863, are in my hand-writing, with some few exceptions—I think the prisoner left on the Friday, and these entries might have been made on the Monday or Tuesday—they were made after he left.</p>

Oppenheim, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." each are in my writing—I made these entries from the banker's pass-book—the other entries are amounts received from different firms; customers of Mr. Wilson's—they were entered from the fact of their having come in; by post perhaps—I am not aware that Mr. Wilson was pressed for money several times—I do not think I lent any money to the firm—I have my books here—on the back of my subpœna I was told to refer to this 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is about a year ago—I think it was an exchange of a cheque of Mr. Wil<lb></lb>son's for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—possibly it was an accommodation for a day or two—I</p>

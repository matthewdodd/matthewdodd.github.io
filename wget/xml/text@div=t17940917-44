               <p>When I am well I go with messages for the admiralty. On the 31st of July, I had been employed to take a parcel to Litchfield-street, when I came back I had a pint of beer, I was then going home, when I got to the Admiralty gateway, I saw a boy making gestures to the prisoner at the bar, who had this trunk; it wanted five minutes of ten o'clock when I came out of the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy make the gestures to the prisoner in the street? - No, under the Admiralty gateway, and when I went to look at him he wanted to hide the trunk with the slaps of his coat, which gave me a suspicion that he had stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the prisoner from the trunk at that time? - He was close to it, and I went back again, and told Mr. Gillum, that keeps the Anchor and Vine, and then he came back with me, and he was sitting on the trunk, and we laid hold of him by the collar, as soon as we took the end of his collar, he got up and ran away, Mr. Gillum ran after him and brought him back, and we took the trunk into Gillum's house with the prisoner; in a very little while after Mr. Bichner and his wife, I believe it was, came to Mr. Gillum's house. and he said it was his trunk, and his wife, or whoever it was, seemed very much frightened and knew the trunk directly, and we took the trunk and prisoner to St. Martin's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend them to the watch-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You did not see the prisoner with this trunk? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. In the time you went back to the Anchor and Vine, he might certainly have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170111"></xptr>run away with it if he chose? - If he had attempted it he certainly would have been taken.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he in your sight all the time? - No.</p>

He said he had got a trunk, he had found it, I told him, I believed he had found it before it was lost, and he attempted to run away, and I ran after him and catched him, I took the prisoner down to the watch-house and gave charge to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor claim if as his? - He did; I saw a chaise about a hundred yards up, and I sent my man up to see whether it came from that chaise or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you found this boy he told you that he had found the trunk? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And he did not attempt to run away till you frightened him, in telling him that you believed he found the trunk before it was lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cowkeeper, at Perry Hill, Lewisham—on. 6th March I had a van and a bag of coals in the yard of the "Rutland Tavern," Perry Hill, between 5 and 6 o'clock—I had a coat under the bag of coals—Rainbow was there—he asked me the price of the van—I left the yard, and went home to tea—I had not been in five minutes before some one sent for me, saying my coat was stolen—I went back to the yard, found the coals thrown down, and the coat gone—when I went out of the yard I saw Smith standing by the gate—this is my coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—It is worth 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to me, for the purpose I use it—I throw it over the pony's back when he is standing still.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the "Rutland Tavern"—on 6th March I saw the prisoner in the yard, with another man—they came in a cart about 5.30—they had some bread and cheese and beer, and Rainbow and the other man went into the tap-room—Smith went out, and came back in about twenty minutes, and then he and Rainbow went up the yard—I looked through the kitchen window, and saw Rainbow lift up the sack of coals, which was standing at the tail of a little van—the tail-board was down—Smith drew the coat from underneath, and I sent over to Mr. Seager—I saw Rainbow coming out at the gate, and I went round to the front to stop him—as soon as he saw me he turned, and said something which I did not hear—they then both came out of the yard, and walked into the tap-room—Smith went up the yard again immediately afterwards—I followed, and asked what he did there—he said "Why do you ask me' that T—I said "Because I saw you take a coat from that van just now; what have you done with it?"—he said "You are a liar, I have not taken a coat from that van, and I will punish you for saying so"—Seager came over, a constable was sent for, and they were given in custody—when we came back from the station, I saw the policeman with the coat under his arm—he said he had found it in a cart.</p>

I took the two prisoners at the "Rutland Tavern," for stealing a coat from a van in the yard—they said they knew nothing about it—after I had taken them to the station I went back to the yard, and found the coat at the bottom of another cart, about eight or nine yards from the van.</p>

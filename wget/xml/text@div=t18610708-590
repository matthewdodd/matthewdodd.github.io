I keep a public-house in Long-lane, Smithfield—some time in June last, the prisoner came into my house, she asked for a half a pint of beer; I served her, and she gave me a bad shilling—I told her it was bad, and asked if she had got any more—she then put down a bad two-shilling piece, and said nothing—I told her it was bad, and said, "Cone put down another," she then put down another bad shilling—I did not give her in charge at first—she was brought back to me—I gave her in charge, and gave the money to the policeman.</p>

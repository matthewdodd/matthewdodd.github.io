               <p>Charles Leignes. On the 11th of September, the prisoner was hired into my service; after she had been there a little while, she told me a strange woman had entered the house, and stole two shifts, and a handkerchief; and upon examination we found they were pawned in the prisoner's name.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they pawned?</p>
               <p>Leignes. One shift was found at the corner of St. Martin's-lane. We took her and that before the justice, where she confessed the other shift and handkerchief were pawned in West-street, Seven-dials. The justice sent for them, and the pawnbroker brought them.</p>

             I am a pawnbroker, and live at the corner of St. Martin's-lane; the prisoner pawned this shift with me on the 23d of September. [Produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor]</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Castle-lane, Westminster. It is not my dwelling-house—I am an appraiser, and live in a room attached to a warehouse, but separated from it—it lies behind—it is a sleeping-room, partitioned off from the warehouse—I left the room about six o'clock in the morning of the 19th of April—I returned about eleven o'clock at night, opened the door, and found something in my way—I procured a light, and found the room all in confusion—the outer door was safe, but they had broken through into the warehouse, and from there through a door into my place—I missed a pair of old boots, a small quantity of copper and brass, and a razor—there were things of more value there—there was a good great coat and my bedding—these are the boots, the razor, and brass (<hi rend="italic">looking at them.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About seven o'clock on this night I saw the prisoner come down Great Chapel-street, into Orchard-street, with something in an apron—he went into a shop, came out, went down Cooper-street, and turned to the left—I went and asked what he had—he said "A pair of boots"—I said, "Whose are they?" he said, "My own"—I said, "Where did you get them?"—he said, "I bought them of a man in the street"—I took him to the station-house, and found the other things on him—he was discharged that night, as I could not find where they were taken from, but the property was detained—he was taken again on the Monday—I went to the place, and found the door broken through from the warehouse.</p>

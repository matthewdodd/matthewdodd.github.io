                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 44.) I am stationed near Perry<lb></lb>vale, in Middlesex. On the 17th of June, near six o'clock in the evening, I was on duty near the Grand Junction Canal, and saw the prisoner in a barge there—I was spoken to by Mr. Cogden, who charged the prisoner with steal<lb></lb>ing a fishing-rod and line—I told the prisoner he was charged with stealing a rod and line, and he must go with me—(he was not in the barge at that time—directly I had come up on the towing-path, he had swung himself on shore by the shaft of the barge—there was another man with the barge)—he said he would see meb—first, and immediately struck me several times with his fist, and forced me into the canal—he laid hold of me bodily, and pushed me in before him—he went in with me, and forced my head underneath the water, in the middle of the canal—the water is nearly seven feet deep there, as near as I can judge—I could not stand—I was out of my depth—I was obliged to swim ashore—he did not keep me in that state a great while—Wallis, who was standing on the opposite side of the canal, hallooed out to him, and on that he let me go, and I let him go; and as soon as I did so, he walked out of the water before I could get ashore—I was deeper in the canal than he was—he forced me further out, and forced me under—when I got ashore I again attempted to take him into custody—he was very violent, struck me several times, and likewise kicked me on the thigh—I have no doubt he intended to kick me somewhere else—assistance was procured, and he was secured—I was in my full uniform.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Gloucester-place, Gloucester-square. I went to Perryvale to fish—I placed my rod and line on the bank of the canal where it shelves off from the bridge, and widens—it could offer no obstruction to the boats passing—it was on the opposite side to the towing-path—I did not see it removed by any person—I saw it in the prisoner's possession immedi<lb></lb>ately after, in the barge which was going along—I followed, and called out to him, and begged him to give up the rod, and treated it as a joke, saying, I was not of an age to run after him—with oaths he declared he should keep it unless I stood so much beer—I followed him I think nearly two miles-—I then obtained Keeler's assistance, and told him he had stolen my rod and line—I heard Keeler tell him he must come with him—he swore he would not be taken, and immediately attacked the police<lb></lb>man, and after a short struggle bore him into the middle of the canal, and endeavoured to get his head under the water—I turned round to see where I could throw my coat, and go to the policeman's assistance, and on looking back, found the policeman and the prisoner both coming out of the canal—he walked or struggled out in some manner, either by walking and swimming, but I was very much agitated from the situation he was in—he was up to his arm-pits, and the prisoner was endeavouring to get his head underneath—they got ashore nearly together—the prisoner again attacked the policeman with his fists, struck him, kicked at him, and endeavoured to kick him in * * * *—the whole time using the most threatening and horrible language—after receiving several blows, the policeman took out his staff, and struck him over the head—I assisted him, and the prisoner was secured—I saw Wallis on the opposite side of the canal.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter and joiner. On the day in question I was coming over the bridge, and met with Mr. Cogden, who asked me to go for a policeman—I fetched Keeler, and went on the off side of the canal, while he went on the towing-path—the prisoner was in his boat, and directly Keeler came on the towing-path, he took the shaft of the boat and jumped on to the towing-path, from nearly the middle of the canal—Mr. Cogden immediately said to Keeler, "I give this man in charge"—he put himself in a fighting attitude, and struck Keeler several times right and left—Keeler said, "My friend, you had better go with me quietly"—he said, with a tremendous oath, he was not going to be taken by him—he then caught hold of him, and carried him into the canal—they both went into the canal together, as near the middle as I could judge, and I was exactly opposite them—they had a violent struggle in the water, and he put Keeler under water twice—I called out to him," I know you, your name is Dixon; you had better let him alone, for you will be very severely punished for it"—he replied, "If you know me, did you ever know any harm of me?"—I said, "I never knew any good of you"—he then left Keeler in the canal, and went out—Keeler followed him—another violent struggle ensued between them—I called to Keeler, "For God's sake, take your staff out"—I saw there was danger—the prisoner kicked him most tremendously and dreadfully; and if he had not drawn back, I do not know what might have been the consequence—I likewise called out to Mr. Cogden to aid and assist him; and I believe, if it had not been for his assisting, the prisoner would have got the staff, and the result would have been tremendous—Keeler struck him once on the head with the staff, and I believe twice on the shins, but not tremendously hard—Mr. Cogden caught hold of the staff, and tried to wrest it from the prisoner's hands; and in so doing, it flew out of Keeler's hands into the canal—Keeler immediately went into the canal id search of it, and the prisoner got into his boat again—I went to fetch further assistance—as I returned I heard a cry of "Stop him," and saw the prisoner running across the fields—I immediately jumped over a high fence, and met him—he was stopped, and taken to the station—they tried to put the hand<lb></lb>cuffs on him, but could not</p>

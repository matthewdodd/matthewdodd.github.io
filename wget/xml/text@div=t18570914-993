On 22nd July the prisoner Brooks applied to me for a situation as general servant—I asked for a reference, and eye referred me to Mrs. Wright, No. 7, New Dorset Place, Clapham Road; I went there on the following day, and I saw the prisoner Gould under the name of Mrs. Wright—I asked her whether Brooks was strictly honest and sober and a good servant, and whether she was a person on whom I could place dependence to take out of my property—she gave me satisfactory answers to all those questions——she said that Brooks had been in her service two years and a half, and had left her about three weeks—in consequence of this, Brooks came into my service on the following Tuesday, 28th July, and brought with her a box, painted green—on Thursday afternoon, 30th July, I went out with my nursemaid, leaving Brooks alone in charge of my house; I returned in about half an hour, and found a variety of property had been taken away—Brooks was gone, and the house was empty with the exception of my husband.</p>

                  </hi>. I lire at Amersham, near Lewisham, and have recently arrived in London from Australia, in the ship <hi rend="italic">Joshua.</hi> The prisoner came home in the same vessel with me—my berth was immediately over his—I had been to the diggings at Ballarat, and got gold there—when I got on board, I put my gold into a cigar box, with a pound of tobacco on the top of it, put the lid on, and lashed it up with a bit of cord—the tobacco was in the box on the top of the gold, which was in a bag—I had sixty ounces of gold, or rather more; I think there was sixty-six or sixty-seven ounces, but I cannot swear to that—I saw it safe one afternoon, and missed it next morning; we had been then three or four days at sea—I went to the captain as soon as I missed it, and made a complaint—a search was made, but it was not found—shortly afterwards I went down, and saw the prisoner standing at the doorway of my berth (some berths had doors, and some had not; mine had only a space to get in; a doorway)—he asked me whether I thought Mrs. Levy would take care of his gold if he gave it to her; I said, "Yes, I have no doubt but she will"—he had a short belt in his hand, which was crammed full, but, I did not see the contents; he said it was gold—some short time after that, I lost a bottle of gin to the prisoner, which was in my berth—it was a bet—I suppose he drank it, for he was drunk about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I did not see him take it, but when I accused him of taking it he only laughed—while he was in that state he showed me and two or three others a nugget, which I think came from Ballarat by its appearance; I could swear that it came from that dis<lb></lb>trict; I know by the colour of it—I asked him where he got it, and he said he got it at Ballarat—afterwards, when he was sober, I asked him about Bal<lb></lb>larat, he did not give me a willing description of it; he answered very reluc<lb></lb>tantly—I asked him what part of Ballarat he was working at; he said "Eu<lb></lb>reka"—I asked him what <hi rend="italic">lead</hi> he was in; he said, "Canadian gully," and every-body who has been there knows that they are two separate <hi rend="italic">leads</hi>—Canadian gully is two miles, or two miles and a half, from Eureka, not more, and the prisoner said it was five or six miles—I asked him where he was working on the Canadian gully; he said "Prince" something, but I forget the name he gave (he was perfectly sober then; this was not on the same occasion—I think it was next day)—I said, "I suppose you mean Prince Regent's gully?" he said, "Oh, yes; that is the name"—I asked him whether he was working at the top or the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">lead;</hi> he said he worked about the middle of it—I asked him how far Jones's Circus was from it; he said it was about three quarters of a mile or a mile; but it is close to where he represented himself to have worked, within a quarter of a mile at any rate—I asked him how deep his hole was; he said fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen feet; and where he represented to have worked, the holes are generally eighty, ninety, and a hundred feet—I asked him whether they slanted; he said, "No"—there were some holes once on the top of the hill, but not where he represents—by the top I mean the upper part—he never mentioned</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185405080044"></xptr>
               <p>the name of the person with whom he had been working—I asked him so many questions that it is scarcely worth while entering into them—I asked him if he knew such and such persons, mentioning the names of the different storekeepers; he said he knew one, but he did not give a proper description—he gave the name of Tapley, and said he was a thin young man, whereas he is a stout old man; but I did not tell the prisoner so, because I wished to see what he did know—there is no young Tapley, that I know of—I mentioned that Tapley was a storekeeper close to where the prisoner repre<lb></lb>sented that he worked, and asked him whether he remembered any meeting at the diggings concerning the licences; he said, Yes, he had heard about one meeting—I asked him whether he was present; he said, "No"—I think if he had been living at the diggings at the time he would have known something about it, especially living at Canadian gully—I asked him whether he knew any of the Committee; he said, "No"—I do not think that there is a digger, hardly, but what knows something about it; the meeting was held on the <hi rend="italic">Flat</hi>—Henry Boswell, who was the carpenter of the ship, made a communication to me soon afterwards, in consequence of which I went to the prisoner—I talked to him a little time, and then asked him if he would show me his gold; he said, No, he would not; he had been <hi rend="italic">put up</hi> to that—I had never accused him—I was not present when the captain spoke to him—the next morning, after the prisoner had refused to show me the gold, he was called up by the captain (I had asked him again in the morning, and he refused both times)—the captain ordered him to produce the gold; I saw it, and recognized one nugget—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is Ballarat gold, and there was other gold mixed with it—there were two or three ounces of Bal<lb></lb>larat gold—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the shot belt; it was given up to the captain—there is not the quantity of gold here which was delivered up to Mrs. Levy to take care of; it is the quantity given to the captain (<hi rend="italic">The shot belt was then opened and the gold shaken out into a saucer</hi>) I recognize this nugget, and can undertake to say positively that it was among my gold; it is a dif<lb></lb>ferent species of gold, it is surface gold—all my gold was of this colour—the small gold was very much burnt, and it looked rather browner than the nuggets; the nuggets are clearer—this is the nugget of which I had given a description to the captain—I had also described it to Mr. Brooks—when this nugget was turned out in the prisoner's presence, Mr. Brooks said, "That is it"—I had described it to two or three others besides—I should think the cigar box would hold 100 or 150 cigars.</p>

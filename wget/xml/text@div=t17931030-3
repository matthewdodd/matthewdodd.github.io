               <p>Q. Did you ever employ the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner coming to your shop? - He came to me that afternoon, for me to go with him to get him into the militia; he came also on the next day, it was the next day that he committed this robbery; he came Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you saw these boots? - On Wednesday afternoon, I saw them in the window, I left him sitting in the shop till I returned from putting a letter in the post office; when I returned I found my shop door open, and my boots taken out, I had seen him frequently before, I have known him for many years; the boots are here.</p>
               <p>Simpson. These are the boots.</p>
               <p>Dizney. I can swear to them boots, they were for sale, they had not been sold to any body.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them? - Twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have known the prosecutor for a long time, he perfectly well knows it is the first time I had been guilty of any offence of the kind, I did it through mere want; he knows me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300006"></xptr>perfectly well, and my little family; I have three children, I lost my wife two years ago.</p>
               <p>Dizney. I did understand that he had some children in the workhouse, but when I went to enquire I found he had defrauded the master of the workhouse out of fourteen pounds.</p>

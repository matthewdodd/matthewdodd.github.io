               <p>Mr. Silvester. What was he asked before he said this? - He said they certainly were Mr. Gent's instruments, but he never knew of the taking them.</p>
               <p>Court. When he said these were Mr. Gent's instruments, did he accompany that with any account how he came by them? - No, when he was put to the bar to be examined before the magistrate, he heard what Mr. Gent had to say, and Mr. Gent said, with submission to your worship , I shall only ask whether they are my instruments, he said they were; he said he did not pawn them, nor know how they were lost, and he said he did not know Mr. Lane's, much less of the pawning them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I would only observe, Sir, that the boy swore at my second hearing, that Mr. Lane could as positively swear to me as he did, and when Mr. Lane was there, he could not.</p>
               <p>Meredith. I never said any such thing, Mr. Lane was present at the time I lent the money on them, but not when the prisoner first came into the shop, but he did not know the prisoner, he did not take any notice.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. It was on the 3d of May.</p>
               <p>Court. Whatever day of the month it was, that was one of the nights that this lad lay out, and I wish this circumstance could be ascertained, and it may very easily; the Foreman of the Jury has a recollection that it was on that Monday, one question will ease all my private doubts about it, was it on a Monday, whatever Monday it was? - I must own I cannot positively say , whether it was on a Monday or a Tuesday .</p>
               <p>The Foreman of the Jury. My wife laid in a dangerous state on that day, and she died on the day following.</p>

               <p>Did Mr. Lockwood make a successful attempt afterwards? - He did.</p>
               <p>Was there any attempt between that in which he was concerned, and the other? - None that I know of.</p>

               <p>In what way was the shop door fastened? - Most commonly I go to bed last, and I generally turn the key , and leave it in the door, the reason is in case of fire.</p>
               <p>So that if anybody was so disposed, they might go out of your house without your knowledge ? - They might so certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr Silvester. Where did you lay? - In a room opposite to his.</p>

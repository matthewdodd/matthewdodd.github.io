                  </hi>. I am foreman to Frederick William Westley, and another, bookbinders in Doctors'-commons—we bind the Christian Observer for Hatchard's in Piccadilly—we supply that to their customers on orders presented to us on the publication day—amongst others, Messrs. Piper's sent us an order dated 30th September, for 155 copies—this order was brought to me on the morning of the 30th September, by a porter from Piper's, of the name of Thomas; when he brought the order, there were not sufficient copies printed for him, and I gave him fifty-five copies—I kept the order; he signed for the fifty-five copies on the back of it—some time afterwards another person, who I believe to be the prisoner, came as from Piper's—he said, "Is anything ready for Piper's"—he inquired for the Westminster Review—I told him how many they had had of them, and that the others were not ready—I then told him how many they had had of the Christian Observer, and I gave him one hundred copies more of them and he signed the receipt—shortly after Piper's porter came, and I told him—I gave a description of the prisoner to Gayler the officer; he took me to a public-house in Warwick-lane, and I saw him take from a closet under the stairs eighty-three copies of the Christian Observer for October, and some other things—it was then about half-past 2 o'clock, and I should say at that time, there was no publisher who had so large a number of the Christian Observer—the publishing price of one hundred numbers was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

Gayler came and told me that he had got him—he took me to the station to see if I could identify him—he pointed out the prisoner, and asked if he was the man—Gayler told me he knew very well who I meant by the description I gave—the prisoner called between 11 and 12 o'clock in the morning, the place had been opened for the delivery of publication—he addressed me first; I was in the counting-house—he was near to a table—there were two other persons there that I had been delivering magazines to, and the prisoner stood aside for a few minutes—there is a person who usually packs them up, but on this occasion I gave them to him myself—I positively believe him to be the man—I had such a recollection of him that I gave a description of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am door-keeper at Messrs. Westley's. On 30th September, a little before 12 o'clock, I saw the prisoner come into our house; I am quite sure he is the man—he came in at the door and went through.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Messrs. Westley's. On 30th September I was there when the magazines were given out—I saw the prisoner there between 11 and 12 o'clock; he was waiting to take his turn to speak to Mr. Gray—I know this parcel of books came from Messrs. Westley's—I tied them up that morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. My aunt keeps the Physicians' Arms, the prisoner uses that house—there are two cupboards under the stairs—Mr. Cooper had the use of them—I saw the cupboard which the officer looked at—it was one that the prisoner had the use of—the prisoner came there that evening after the policeman had taken the books—I told him the officer had taken the books away, and if he wanted them he must go to the police-station for them—he said the officer had no business to take them—he left in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are the cupboards open cupboards, unlocked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I am not aware that customers may deposit books or anything in them—the prisoner had the privilege of putting books there—anybody may put things in by asking—the prisoner has been in the habit of using it for the last eighteen months to my knowledge—he came that morning a few minutes after 10 o'clock, he came again about five minutes after I—to go to that cupboard he would go through the bar.</p>

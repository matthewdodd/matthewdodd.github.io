               <p>Q. Had your master said, before that, any thing about his loss? - A. No; he had not; he then tapped him on the shoulder, and told him, he was his prisoner; he denied having them at first, and then he said they were up in the lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your master endeavoured to persuade him to confess? - A. No; he had not; my master then sent me for a constable; I fetched the constable, and while he and my master went to search, I staid with the prisoner; there was a gentleman in the house besides; they came down again to fetch the prisoner, for they could not find them; I went up with them, and just as I had got to the top of the yard, where she hay-lost was, they were found in a bag, the prisoner was present when it was examined; there were two coats and a waistcoat, one was a great coat, and the other a superfine close coat; we then went into the house again, and then I asked him where the other coat was, and he denied knowing any thing about it; then we had him to the cage; the other great coat was found by the landlord, he is not here.</p>

               <p>Are you sure the prisoners are two of them? - Yes, they are, we took them to the watch-house. I saw the bundles opened in the watch-house. These things are part of the contents of the bundles. The first person said they were the other persons property, and that he was under a cloud, and wanted to get these things off for fear his landlord should seize them.</p>

I am sure he made all the discovery he could. I went after the persons, and found every information he gave me true, though I was not successful enough to take the persons. Anderson seemed very affected and sensible of his faults. The justice promised him mercy if he would do all he could to bring his accomplices to justice.</p>

I had been there on the Sunday before. I left the house fast, and the things mentioned in the indictment were in the house. I went down and found the door and windows broke open. It is all on one floor. All the bottom parts were broke. I lost two mattrasses, two window curtains, two pillows, a cloth waistcoat, and a bag. The waistcoat I used to work in. They were found in the custody of the watch. I went before the justice who ordered me to have my things, and said I need only produce the waistcoat here.</p>

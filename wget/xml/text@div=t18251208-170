I was employed by Mr. Drew to detect persons selling counterfeit coin. On the morning of the 19th of November I saw the officer, who searched me, and found I had no money - they then gave me 4 shillings and 2 sixpences, which I had about me at ten minutes past nine o'clock that morning; the prisoner came to me by appointment on the Friday - he brought me twenty counterfeit shillings, for which I gave him the four shillings and two sixpences, which I had received of the officers, who were very near; while the prisoner and I were dealing. I then went to Halls' house - he and Drew followed me; Hall asked me what I had got- I told him twenty counterfeit shillings, which I gave him; he searched me, and found I had no more money about me - they were wrapped up in a piece of this paper in four fives; all I did was under their direction.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell the officer I was not the man you recollected as selling this coin? A. I never used such words.</p>

            . I am one of the conductors of the patrol. I saw Cousins on the 17th of November, and again on the 19th, when Hall was with me; he was searched by Hall, in my presence, who took all the money he had from him, and we gave him four shillings and two sixpences; we then followed him to Whitechapel, and he crossed the street, to his stall. I saw the prisoner come down Petticoat-lane; Cousins put up his hand, and came across to him; we were in a house close by; the prisoner and Cousins spoke, and something passed from Cousins to the prisoner, and from the prisoner to Cousins; he then went away - I went out and took Cousins to Hall's house, where he gave him twenty counterfeit shillings, which Hall took and marked; I followed Cousins all the way, and it was impossible he could have received them from any one else; they are done up in fives. I took the prisoner on the 23d, in Whitechapel, and two shillings were found on him.</p>

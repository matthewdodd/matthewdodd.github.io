I have known the prisoner for years, and loved him as my own son; he came to me about two o'clock, on the Monday after Christmas - my son and I were having some pancakes - I went out and got to St. Paul's, about ten minutes before four o'clock - the prisoner had left me, and told me he thought he should see me again, before I went into the city - I had locked my room, and took my key - I returned about twelve o'clock at night, and found my door open, and the drawers were in a very disordered state - I missed seven silver spoons, some seals, and other things.</p>

            . I live on the same floor with Mrs. Nantz. I saw the prisoner on the 27th of December, in the morning, and again about five o'clock in the afternoon - Mrs. Nantz was then out - I heard some person at the door of her room - I opened my door, and saw the prisoner; he asked me if the key was left there - I said No; he said he wanted to get some books - he took my key, and opened Mrs. Nantz's door - I gave him a light - he remained there about a quarter of an hour - when I went to see if he was there, he was gone, and the door was open.</p>

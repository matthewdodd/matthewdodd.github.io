            , the evidence, knows nothing of me, I deal in prints and books, I was selling some prints to a young man in Kingsland-road; Smith, came and took some out of my hand, and asked me what he should give me for the remainder? I sold him the remainder, then he asked me if I had got any magazines? I told him I had a bundle at Mr. Lemoines, Bishopsgate Church-yard, (I sell books and prints for him,) and as we went along we met some officers, they took us, one of the officers, took the prints out of his pocket, I never see him before. The woman swears to my being in company with her husband, at several times, I know nothing at all about him; Mr. Armstrong searched my mother's house, and a great quantity of pictures were there.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. What time was it you went to Mrs. Gurnell's house? - About three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. There was hut one article found on Clinch, and that was an handkerchief, which Mrs. Hulme cannot swear to, and no evidence, to affect either of them, but what comes through so very tainted a stream as Smith and his wife.</p>

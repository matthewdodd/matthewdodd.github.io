On the 8th of April, in consequence of information, I detained him, and asked what business he had up in the room where I keep my goods - he hesitated, and said he had not been there. I called the servant, who told him he had been up - he still denied it. I gave him in charge - Sampson said he had been up in the front-room, and he had seen some leather in his hat. Sampson brought it from the room, and I was convinced that it had been in his hat, for it was squeezed, and we keep it quite smooth. He was taken to the watchhouse - the officer brought him back to me - he said voluntarily then that he had taken the leather from the front-room, and put it into his hat. I found some of my goods at his lodgings next morning, and took them to him - he said he took them from behind my counter; and in consequence of what he told me I went to Collett's house - he is a shoemaker. I told him I had come on unpleasant business, that he had some leather of mine - he turned to a box and said,</p>
               <p>"That is Rudd's leather - he brought it to me to take care of."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did not you first mention Rudd's name, for you told the Magistrate that you asked him for Rudd's leather - A. I do not recollect saying so.</p>

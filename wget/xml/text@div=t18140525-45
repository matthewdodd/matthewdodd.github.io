On the 26th of April, in consequence of suspicion, the prisoner was stopped; I asked him what he had got; he said something. I took him into the accompting-house; there I searched him. I found two stockings or sandals of tea under his waistcoat. I weighed the tea; it was better than one pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the prisoner any where in the warehouse - A. No. He was reported to me as a suspected person. This is the tea. and these are the stockings.

I am a clergyman of the Church of England, and reside at Ealing—I keep a boarding school for young gen<lb></lb>tleman—on Friday night, 28th September, I returned home by the half-past nine train from London—I reached home at ten minutes to ten—I found the house shut up as usual—the part of the boot-house that I examined was carefully shut up—it is at the extreme end of the house, doors open from it into the house—it is all under one roof—there are two outside doors to the boot-house—the one that opens into the open air was securely fastened—the other, which opens into the coal cellar, I did not examine—that door is fastened by a bar—that is the only fastening the coal house has—I was woke next morning about ten minutes to six by the ringing of the door bell—I went down and examined the premises, found the doors open, and missed eleven pairs of boots—a large portion of them I had not seen for some time before—they were the boys' Sunday boots—one pair I had seen the night before—I know both the prisoners, they have been in my employment and in the employment of other persons on the premises.</p>

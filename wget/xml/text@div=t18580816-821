I keep the Neptune beer-shop, at Rotherhithe—on Thursday, 24th June, the prisoner came into my house between 11 and 12 at night, and asked for a glass of porter—I served him—he gave me a counterfeit shilling—I gave him the change, and he made the best of his way off—we were shutting up, and the gas was being put out at the time—I marked the shilling, and put it on the shelf at the back of the counter—I never put it into the till—on Saturday evening, 4th July, the prisoner came again at about 7 o'clock—he called for a glass of porter, and tendered in payment a counterfeit shilling—I took it up, and laid sixpence of the change on the bar while I went round—I said, "My gentleman, I have caught you this time"—he was very independent; he sat down and smoked his pipe and drank the beer very coolly, and told me I had rung the changes—I told him it was a bad coin—I got a neighbour of mine to take care of him while I fetched a policeman—I told him he had been in the house eight or ten days ago—he said, "It is about a fortnight since I was in your house before"—I gave both of the shillings to the police-sergeant—I had kept the first shilling on the shelf—I marked it; it was a Victoria shilling, and the second was a William the Fourth.</p>

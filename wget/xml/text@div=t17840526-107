               <p>About half after six, on the 28th of May, I sent my wife out to get me something to drink, I was in bed, and when she was gone I heard a person come in and go into the yard; nobody was in my apartment but myself, there were other lodgers up stairs.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>When I returned and was in the doorway, I saw the prisoner in the yard, the child's cloak was pinned to a gown, and the woman had half of the gown upon her shoulder, and the half part she was opening, it was pinned to the line to dry, and a shirt was unpinned, and the cloak; the shirt was not taken off the line, but the cloak was chucked into the necessary, within the door; I pinned the cloak and gown on myself: I asked the prisoner what she wanted.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went into the yard, I asked leave of her lodger; the prosecutrix is a good for nothing hussey, she tells a thing that is as false as the child that is in her arms.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. With respect to the gown and the shirt, it is only an attempt to steal, but with respect to the cloak, if you are satisfied that was pinned to the gown, and could not fall off by accident, there was a sufficient removal to constitute a felony.</p>

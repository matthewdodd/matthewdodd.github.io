                  </hi>. I am a woollen-draper, of Aldgate. The prisoner was in my employ about two months—on 1st July I called in an officer—I had observed the prisoner to go up to his bedroom at a time when he had no right to go there—I asked him, in the officer's presence, why he went there—he said he went for his handkerchief—his boxes were searched, which were in his bedroom on the third-floor—he was present—I found there a piece of black kerseymere and a piece of marsella quilting for waistcoats—I asked him where he got them—he said he bought them, fifteen months ago, of a man in the Borough, who was since dead—they were wrapped in these two papers, which had come out of the shop—one of them is written on—I compared them with the pieces from which they had been taken, and which I produce—this white one matched in every respect, except that a piece has been cut off it—this black one matches thread for thread.</p>

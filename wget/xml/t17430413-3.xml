On the 1st of March, as near as I can tell, my Wife brought the Keys to me, and said she had kept the Money in such a Drawer; there were nine Guineas and some other Money. There came a Man that Night, whose Name is Pearse, he was a little suddled, and had Victuals and Drink, and paid me very honestly for it; and I was told that the Prisoner had given the Money to him; on the Tuesday afterwards I went up to change a Guinea for one Mr - a Neighbour; that is, Mr What d'ye call him, the Apothecary. -</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Mr. Henry Cox, soap—maker, in Goswell-street. On the 23rd if December I went to a shop with half a ton of soap—I received 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in copper, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in half-crowns—I put the copper into one of the soap-boxes—it was in five-shilling par<lb></lb>cels—I went on to Blackfriar's-bridge—I there looked back, and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in my waggon, putting his hand into the box, and taking a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. parcel in his hand, he handed it out to another lad, who was by the side of the wag<lb></lb>gon</p>

               <p>I stopped my horses as quickly as I could, and came behind—I caught the prisoner at the time he was stepping out of the tail of the waggon—I asked what he wanted there—he said he was only going to have a ride—I said I would not let him go till I had got a policeman—I gave him to a gentleman—he got away six or seven yards, and was caught again—he got away again, and was again caught—I did not find any money at that time—I counted the money in the box at the station—house, and there was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short out of the 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in copper.</p>

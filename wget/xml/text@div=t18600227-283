I am a detective police-officer—at 3 o'clock in the afternoon of 3d February I saw the prisoner in the Bank premises; Mr. Billinge came up and spoke to me—I asked the prisoner where he got the cheque from that he presented at the counter—he said that he got it from a man outside the Bank, to whom he was to take the cash—this was in the court yard of the Bank—he went just outside with me, and then returned back again into the Bank yard—when he Went outside it was to look for the man—he did look for the man—he was not able to find anybody at all—I asked him if he knew the man—he said, "No"—I asked him how he became acquainted with him—he said he met him that morning by accident in Bishopsgate-street, and that he met him by appointment at this time at the Bank—I asked him when he saw the man. before—he said he knew him three years ago in Boulogne, and had not seen him until that morning, when he went up and made himself known to the man—asked him the man's name and he said it was Harris, and that he was in the employment of the railway company at Boulogne—I then took him inside the Bank and received the cheque from Mr. Wheeler, and took the prisoner on to Mr. Bateman—Coombs, a brother officer, went with us to Mr. Bateman'g—when we got there I took the prisoner into the outer office up stairs; a clerk of Mr. Bateman's was there—after a short time Mr. Bateman came in—I had sent the cheque into him by Coombs—he came in with the cheque in his hand and said it was not in his handwriting—I asked Cadman, the clerk, if he knew the prisoner, and he said, "Oh, yes; he was here the other day "—the prisoner said,' Yes was; I came here with a letter"—Coombs and then both went away together with the prisoner—I parted from Coombs on the way—Coombs took the prisoner to the station—when I got back to the station afterwards, in consequence of something that I heard had taken place in my absence, I asked the prisoner to take his top coat off; I told him that I must search him—he said, "I must take them both off together; I can't get the top coat off from the under one"—after some time made him take the top coat off—I assisted him in getting it off, and in doing so some papers fell from between the top coat and the under coat—these two cancelled cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)are two of the papers—I asked him where he got those from—he said the same man gave them to him—I searched the pockets of the coat and then threw it to Coombs, and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am a timber merchant, and carry on business at 60, Old Broad-street—my former premises were at 35, Sun-street, Bishopsgate—on changing my premises sold some waste paper to Mr. Birkett, of Norton-folgate—at the time I sold it I was not aware that there were any cancelled cheques in the waste papers—I keep an account at the Bank of England—do not know the prisoner at all—these two cheques, which purport to bear my handwriting, are neither of them my writing—did not authorise anybody to draw them—these two cheques of 1852, on Prescott, Grote and Co. are both mine; they are both genuine cancelled. cheques—I bank with them as well as with the Bank of England—I am not at all aware how they came into the possession of the prisoner—I did not know what had become of them—they are the two which fell from between the coats—this note, purporting to be directed to Mr. Ingram, is not a genuine note—this request for the delivery of a cheque book is not my writing—since this investigation, I have discovered that some of the cheques which we were in the habit of making up monthly in packets were missing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did that sale of the waste paper take place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> July, 1858; I think about that time—I was about to leave the premises in Sun-street after thirty years occupation—I can't swear that some of the blank cheques might have found their way into the waste paper—theyought</p>

               <p>not—all persons who bank at the Bank of England use the same cheques, but all different numbers—I preserve all my cancelled cheques in a book bound up, but some of 1852, the date of those produced, were missing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, carrying on business at 27, Norton<lb></lb>folgate—the prisoner entered my service as errand boy a few days after 17th November last and remained till the time of his being taken into custody—I remember purchasing from Mr. Bateman, in the summer of 1858, some waste paper; account books of every kind—I was not aware when I bought them that there were any cancelled cheques amongst them—since this inquiry I have searched amongst the papers, and have found some cancelled cheques of Mr. Henry Bateman—the papers that I bought are kept in our warehouse behind the premises—we generally put them in bags, but I think these got behind some boards in the shop; I think they were taken out quite lately—the prisoner had access to that warehouse when the papers had to be carried to the paper mills and on other occasions—I received, in December last, from Messrs. Hearn and Company a cheque<lb></lb>book to be bound—it did not go positively through my hands, but I received it—supposing a volume were sent to my premises to be bound, the prisoner would have an opportunity of access to it in taking it to or fetching it from the binding shop, or in taking it home—it would be his duty to carry volumes in that way to the binding shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not examine this cheque-book before it was bound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not; I never saw it—I can't say whether these cheques that were missing were ever sent to me—I form the opinion that the cancelled cheques were kept loose—between the boards, because in a basket that has lately been used I found some of the cancelled cheques of Mr. Bateman, of 1852—I had a good character with the prisoner when he came to me—they said he was honest and willing, but slow—a stationer in Camden-town gave that character—I did not go for the character; I sent for it—it was in every way satisfactory.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a soap manufacturer, in partnership with the firm of Messrs. Hearn and Company—I keep a banking account at the Bank of England—we are in the habit of receiving folio cheques from the Bank of England, that is, five cheques on each sheet; and when we receive those books we send them to Mr. Birkett, the stationer, to get bound—in December last we sent a folio book of that description by our clerk to Mr. Birkett—we received it back from Mr. Birkett's sealed up in a brown paper cover—I broke the seal myself—the book then appeared regular and proper; I did not examine it minutely—I have, since the investigation, and the result is that one sheet of five cheques is missing—I have the book here—the missing cheques are from 93,671 to 93,675 inclusive; the letters are G. V.—those which have been produced are two of the missing cheques; they are the first and the last—since we received the book we have kept it under lock and key; no one has access to it but myself and my partners—you can see from the book that the leaf has been torn out—both the cheques must have been torn out after the book was bound.</p>

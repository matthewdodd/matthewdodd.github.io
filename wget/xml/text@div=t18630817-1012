               <p>there found a great many slates broken, and saw footmarks of naked feet—I traced those footmarks to the roof of 62, Charlotte-street, and found the outer trap-door of that house open, the inner trap-door was fast—I had another officer with me, and I sent him back to come into the house and let me in—he did so, and when we got the inner trapdoor open, I saw black prints of finger marks on both ledges of the traps, as if some one had gone out that way—I went down on to the landing and saw naked footmarks on the landing similar to those I had traced on the roof—I then went into a room and saw a naked footprint inside the door, and two prints of naked feet on a chair in the room, which stood next to the door—I then ascended again to the roof and followed the footmarks quite up to 23, Portland-place, both ways, there and back, and only footmarks of one person—at some places it was much more distinct than at others, where there was soft mud or anything of that sort—there were no marks beyond 23, Portland-place, or 62, Charlotte-street—there are thirty-two houses between those two.</p>

From information I received, I apprehended the prisoner on 16th July, about 8 o'clock in the evening in the Kingsland-road—I told him I wanted him on a charge of committing an attic robbery at the West-end—he said, "Oh, nonsense, you know better than that; that is not my game; you know I don't do anything of that sort"—I took him to King-street police-station, and placed him with four or five others, some with beards and whiskers fair and dark; they might have been a little taller—Mrs. Newman was sent for and picked him out directly—I found 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a pair of earrings, and some other things on him—they have nothing to do with this robbery.</p>

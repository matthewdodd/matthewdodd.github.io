               <p>look after everything that entered and left the field, and check the tickets with respect to the quantity of bricks that came in—on the morning of the 24th I took a can of tea which my wife had filled and some food in this handkerchief for my breakfast—I never drink milk in my tea—I arrived at the field about 6.20, having been previously to the office—I unlocked No. 4 gate to let in a van with bricks—on leaving home at about 5.45 I drank some of the tea, and at about 6.20 I drank about a pint—the can holds about two quarts—I then hung it up on one of the iron pegs that keep up the hack caps that cover the bricks to keep them from rain, close by the kiln—this is the can (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went away and returned about 8 o'clock, and saw the prisoner holding the can like this, and the handkerchief which had been attached to the handle was thrown over a wooden cross-bar under the middle of another hack cap—he went straight down through the same hack my bottle was in towards Elliott's lobby—that is not the same lobby I breakfasted in—I then took my can and went straight down to the lobby to breakfast, where I found Marlow, sen., Sheppard, James Marskel, jun., Hughes, and Swanney—I cannot say whether that is his right name—I ate some bread and butter and took my can from the fire and drunk five or six mouthfuls—I detected a disagreeable smell, handed my can to Marlow, and asked him to smell it—he put it to his mouth, and said it smelt very strong of something, and I believe George Marskel tasted it—I cannot say whether any one else tasted it, for directly after I felt ill, and had a burning pain in my muscles, throat, and stomach—my muscles seemed drawn up double, and I cried, thinking of a threat the prisoner had used towards me only one hour before—I cried out, "I believe <hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> has been poisoning me"—Marlow handed me his bottle to rinse my mouth out—one of them poured some of the tea into his hand—I thought it was Marlow, but I heard at the police-court that it was Sheppard—young James Marskel says, "I dare say <hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> has been and put some stuff in it, as we seen him with the bottle"—<hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> is the prisoner's nickname—the boys Marskel and Marlow were with me when I saw Saint with my bottle—Marlow senior said, "You boys have nothing to say about it"—the tea that was poured into one of their hands was blue—I asked one of them to go with me to Mr. Bird's house to get something to take, and Hughes came out and said, "I will go along with you"—some one in the lobby told me to put my fingers down my throat; I did so, and vomited a good deal along the road—we went to the house, which may be about 200 yards—I only went into the hall, and the servants gave me some salt and water to drink—I had vomited twice—I did not vomit after taking the salt and water—Mr. Ernest Bird put some of the stuff from the can in a glass, and it was a bluish-green dirty colour—he also gave me some mustard and water—I was then taken in a cart to the West London Hospital by George Ball—I was sick in the cart—there was a lot of straw in the cart—I was unconscious—at the hospital I saw Mr. Mortimer, the surgeon, perhaps 20 minutes after my arrival—I remained five days under his care, and came out on the sixth day—I have been attending the hospital ever since, once a week—the same evening I was taken there I gave information to the police—on 27th July previously I was in my place at the yard gate and saw a carman leaving with some bricks—I saw Saint hand some money back to the carman when some bricks were taken out of the cart—there were 500 in excess—he had no right to take any out when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187812090029"></xptr>
               <p>there was no ticket, and I turned the cart back—Saint said "You b—Irish s—, who is going to have a peg-legged s—like you watching us?"—I lost my leg in the Royal Navy—I reported that to Marskel senior, fore<lb></lb>man of the field, Mr. Bird being out of town—on another occasion I reported the prisoner to Mr. Bird for sending out 50 more bricks than the ticket speci<lb></lb>fied, and he threatened to put my b—light out, and that he would not do any more work as long as I was in the field—I was continually being threat<lb></lb>ened by the prisoner and two other mates, Davis and Care, from that time up to the 24th October—the mates have <hi rend="italic">threw</hi> pieces of brick at me and threatened to smash my skull in—before 19th October Saint and Davis had thrown bricks at me—on the morning of the 19th I was coming to work, over the line, at 5.50, when I saw Saint just in front of me—he turned round and said "You Irish s—, if I knew you was coming close behind me I would have put your b—head down underneath that train"—an engine was just coming down from the Scrubbs station towards Uxbridge Road—no one was with the prisoner at that time—he then said "A s—like you ain't fit to live, to be going to master's telling tales"—an hour after I was passing one of the kilns, on the top of which were the prisoner and Davis, when a brick came down and struck me on the heel—I don't know who threw it—I heard Davis say "It was very near the top of his b—head," or "skull"—the prisoner said "It would have been a good job if it had broke his b—head"—at 10 o'clock that day I obtained two summonses against them at the Hammersmith Police-court for threatening me, which were to be heard on the 24th—at 7.15 a.m. on the 24th the prisoner was standing by the lobby where we used to go to breakfast about 100 yards away from the kiln, where I left my tea-can, and he said to me "You peg legged s—, I will lay you b—stiff," or "sick, before night, and you can * * * * with the summons."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. Before I took out the summons I had complained to Mr. Bird of the threats being used, and the old foreman Marskel told me I had no right to go to master, but to complain to him about anything that occurred in the field—that was before Mr. Bird—when I told Mr. Augustus Henry Bird of it he said, "You have done right, Collins, but for the future perhaps you had better inform the old <hi rend="italic">moulder</hi> Marskel," and the old <hi rend="italic">moulder</hi> said he should not be able to get the men to stop at the kiln if I got carrying tales—he said that before Mr. Henry Bird—I told Mr. Henry Bird, it was no use my speaking to Mr. Marskel, as I had done so before, and I had a life like a dog in the field in consequence—then I told him I would not work any more round the kiln for some time picking up the brickbats, filling up my time as I had done, because I was afraid, and he told me I could go on the soil hacks, as there were</p>

               <p>carts there throwing in the soil, and keep the soil levelled down, and the ashes—after I took out the summons Mr. Henry Bird told me I had no business going away from my work down to the police-court, as if I had come to him he would have made it all right, and that he would not let the men go down to the police-court, as he should not have anybody in the field to load the carts—I told Mr. Bird I did not wish to harm the men in the least, but my life had been threatened so long that I felt it insecure, and I wished them to be bound over to keep the peace, and I did not wish to go down against the men if they would promise not to molest me again—when I came out of the hospital he declined to take me back, as he said I had brought disgrace on his field and family by taking the proceedings I had—I received these three medals in the navy.</p>

                  </hi>. I was coming up from breakfast at about 8.30 on 24th October, when I found a little gin bottle like this, 17 yards from where I was told Collins hung up his food and bottle that morning—he usually hung it up in the lobby—I did not see it hanging up that morning—the little bottle had a cork in it—I gave it to a boy, Hackwood, who tried to get the cork out, when half broke off, and he shoved the other in—it looked more of a greenish colour than now—I had passed the same spot about 8 o'clock, and the bottle was not there then—I heard of Collins going to Mr. Bird's and I then pointed out this bottle—Marskel told me to put it back in the same spot, as it might be wanted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I remember a few days before this Collins saying if <hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> did not mind, before he was another week older he would make it hot for him—James Marskel, junior, was present—I told the men of it on the Tuesday or Wednesday before the Thursday that Collins used the threats—I breakfasted in Dan Elliott's lobby—when I passed down the hack the bottle was not there—when I went out of the lobby, between the time I passed down and up the hack, I saw Collins standing on about the spot where I picked up the bottle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. We were at work in Toby Hack, shovelling up. sand, when Collins used that threat, and he came down to see the cart—James Marskel is bigger than me—I am 18—one of us, I think Marskel, had said, "It wants a man like <hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> to pick up the brick-bats; he takes all the tops with the bottoms of the bricks;" and then Collins used the threat—Collins went away then—it was after breakfast—I cannot say whether I had had my dinner.</p>

I am 17 and work in this field with my father—on the morning in question I saw Collins under the caps at 7.50—Marlow and <hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> were there—<hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> was loading a cart on the top of the kiln—Collins started dancing and said "Did you ever see a wooden<lb></lb>legged man dance?"—Case was in sight—Collins then swore and said to Marlow and me "There is old <hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> at my tea-bottle"—I looked and saw <hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> under the hack-cap—we walked towards the hack-cap—<hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> was unfastening his basket; he took his jacket down, threw it over his shoulder, and walked across the hacks to breakfast—the basket was hanging about 4 feet from where I afterwards saw Collins's bottle—on the Monday previous to this I was at work with Ovenden shovelling up sand on Mr. Toby's hacks about dinner time, and Collins said he would make it as hot as he could for <hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> before he was a week older if he didn't mind—something had been said about the sand being kept up clean from the bottom, and Ovenden said it wanted a man like <hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> because he made them pick up the sand from the bottom of the kiln—I never told anybody what I heard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was not examined before the Magistrate—I was called; Mr. Paget asked me what I knew about that bottle; I said "Nothing," and I was told to step out of the box—when Collins said "There is <hi rend="italic">Dabber</hi> at my bottle," I looked up at once, but did not see any bottle in <hi rend="italic">Dabber's</hi> hand—he had his own basket, which he was in the act of unfastening from the hack—it was not Collins's habit to hang his bottle under the hack-cap, but in the lobby behind the door, where he used to have a nail for his waterproof jacket—Saint's basket was hanging at the end of the cap, on the end cross-piece, and Collins's bottle was on the middle cross-piece—when Saint took down his basket he went across the hack to Dan Elliott's lobby to breakfast—from the time Collins put his bottle to his mouth to the time he went out with Hughes he did not go out of the lobby—he was not sick.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. On 24th October I was house surgeon at the West London Hospital, and was on duty when Ball brought Collins there, whom I first saw in the casualty room a few minutes after his arrival—he was lying on the sofa, and complained of being poisoned—I examined him thoroughly, and found a slight trace of froth on his moustache, saliva; I really could find no symptoms at all—I tried his respiration and powers of walking, and he did not vomit—there was nothing abnormal—he complained of certain symptoms—I admitted him into the 'hospital, and put him to bed—I gave him no medicine—the first two days I gave him liquid food-r—I gave him no emetics—he remained in the hospital, I think, from the 24th to the 29th—he then left at my suggestion—he was not in bed all that time—I saw him once about a week after—he came to me amongst the out-patients—he Was to return if symptoms of his poisoning should come on—when he came the week after, in consequence of the cold weather affecting his stump, I bandaged it with cotton wool—he does not come to me now—I am house physician now—soon after he came to the hospital I received this tin bottle—I poured some of the contents into a glass; I could hardly recollect the odour of it at the moment, but I say now it was a decided odour of phosphorus—I kept it under lock and key until it was given to Mr. Davis, the analyst—on the same day I opened this glass bottle which I received from Mr. Bird, of which I made a very slight examination; I found there was phosphorus in it—at the Hammersmith Police-court I also received this packet of powder, on which is written, "Hunter's Dewsbury Vermin Destroyer, poison"—I made no exami<lb></lb>nation of it; I handed it to Mr. Davis—I saw nothing given to Collins but what was given by my order, namely, warm water and milk, which is an emetic and a dilutant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The odour from the bottle was exceedingly offensive—I smelt the man's breath, but there was no smell of sulphur—if a man had drunk three or four mouthfuls of the liquid within an hour or two of that time, I should expect to smell it—he had the milk after I saw him and after I had smelt his breath—we get a lot of poison cases—I found no symptoms of poisoning by strychnine—acetate of lead would be sold at a chemist's without an order, it not being included in the schedule to the Poisons Act—</p>

               <p>it is commonly called "sugar of lead"—it would be a poison in a very large dose—large doses are given medically—phosphorus is a poison, but not under all circumstances—it is given medically—I walked him about, and observed no rigidity of the limbs—there were no symptoms of his being doubled up—my treatment was more expectant than negative, but my expectations were disappointed—acetate of lead would be used in the preparation of Goulard water, which is commonly used when the skin is rubbed or chafed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I saw no symptoms consistent with his having taken an irritant poison—as to the absence of symptoms being consistent, it would depend if vomiting had taken place and the dose of the poison—profuse vomiting would decrease the smell there might be, undoubtedly—Goulard water is a lotion—it would be a matter of difficulty for a person unacquainted with chemistry to extract the powder from it—the saliva I saw, I suppose, would be consistent if he had been drinking a great deal of salt-and-water.</p>

                  </hi>. I am public analyst for the Fulham district—I received this tin can from Dr. Mortimer, and subsequently the flat glass bottle and this paper packet—I analysed the contents of the tin can, namely, 28 1/2 fluid ounces of tea—I found phosphorus—I did not estimate the quantity, and acetate of lead to the extent of 147 grains—I afterwards made an examination, and found the quantity of free phosphorus to be 8.19 grains—on a subsequent examination I found strychnine, which you cannot find unless you specially analyse for it—on the first occasion I was not looking for it—the tea had been so far used by that time that I could not by analysis estimate the quantity, but I had reason to suppose that the powder, the remains of which I found in this packet, was identical with the powder in the tea, and if that were the case there would be about half a grain of strychnine in the whole quantity of tea—I examined the glass bottle, and found phosphorus and acetate of lead—I afterwards found extremely minute traces of strychnine—the inside of the bottle was coated to a greater extent than now—it had contained fluid which must have contained those elements—I endeavoured to ascertain in what form the phosphorus was present, and I concluded it was in the form of match heads, not with the wood attached—that was a microscopic and analytical examination—in the powder I found 94.3 percent of acetate of lead and some starch and blue colouring matter—the blue would be ultramarine, and innocuous—in my first examina<lb></lb>tion I found nothing noxious except the acetate of lead—I subsequently found strychnine—I cannot tell how much, as I had used almost all the powder in my preliminary examination—there was no phosphorus—acetate of lead in large quantities would be poisonous—phosphorus is very poisonous—it if taken as a medicine—in the tea there was probably enough poison to poison more than one person—the quantity of strychnine in it has produced death in only one recorded instance—that was not in what was left for me to examine, but arguing from another set of facts altogether.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I did not look for strychnine till the prisoner was com<lb></lb>mitted for trial, so that it was not mentioned at the police-court—I am told this case was postponed from last session in order to prefer a fresh indict<lb></lb>ment because strychnine was found—strychnine would produce contraction of the body—I believe the phosphorus in the tin can to be the same as in the bottle.</p>

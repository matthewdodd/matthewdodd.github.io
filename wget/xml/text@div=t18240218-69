            . I am a watchman. On the night of the 28th of January, I was stationed in Hanover-street; and on going my rounds, at half-past two o'clock, I found Miss Rowland's front kitchen shutters and window open; I rang the bell two or three times; I saw a light in the kitchen, and called out,</p>
               <p>"Who is down there?" Nobody answered - I rapped at the door and sprung my rattle; and after knocking two or three times a gentleman came down, who lives in the house, looked out of the window, which was open, and asked what was the matter - I told him to let me in - the servant opened the door (not Chapman). I went in and searched the kitchen all over - then went into the yard at the back of the premises, found the privy door half open, and the prisoner standing up there; I collared him, brought him into the passage, and gave him in charge of another watchman - went to the door for further assistance - came in again - took him into the parlour,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180038"></xptr>and gave him in charge of the patrol of St. James's, who searched him in my absence.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found him in the privy, did you say any thing to him - A. I said,</p>
               <p>"Come along, I want you" - that is all.</p>
               <p>Q. You say in your deposition that you asked what he did there, and he said nothing. - A. I did not say so.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any myrtle plants on the 16th of March. - A. I lost some, they were in pors, they were found almost immediately afterwards. In consequence of information I went out, I saw the prisoner coming up the walk, I took him in custody, he had nothing with him at that time, he was my labourer.</p>

            . I was going along with Cope by the Bedford Nursery, I saw the prisoner in the nursery ground, he was running from the frame with two pots in his hand, he looked over the pales two or three times, that made me have suspicion that he was stealing the plants, he came from the frame through the ground to the ditch, he put them down there and covered them over with some old grass, he went back again, I saw him come with two more. I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 6, Pear-street, Horsleydown. On the 18th of Oct. I had some potatoes in a lug-boat—I had received them from a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Planter</hi>—I left the lug-boat at a quarter to eight o'clock below Pickle-herring-stairs, on the river—I came back about</p>

               <p>five minutes to nine, and found the prisoner in the boat, and the policeman with him—I was asked in the prisoner's presence, whether I had given him any liberty to take the potatoes—I said, no, but he was welcome to some of the potatoes—I had not given him leave to take them, but I had on former occasions given him leave to go to my boat—knowing one another a long time, we had taken the liberty of making use of one another's things—I think he might have taken them without intending to steal them, and told me of it afterwards.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police-inspector.</hi>) On Saturday evening I saw the prisoner in a lug-boat about half-past eight o'clock—it was dark—he was in a stooping position, as if wishing to avoid being seen—I stepped over into the boat, and said, "What are you doing there?"—he said, "I am only picking out a few damaged potatoes"—I said, "Who do they belong to?"—he said, "To Mr. Mitcham"—I went on shore, and ascertained that they did not belong to Mr. Mitcham—I then came back, and saw Lewis in the boat with the prisoner—I asked if he allowed him to take any potatoes—he said, "No"—I then searched a barge which the prisoner had charge of, lying a few yards away from the boat, and there I found 70lbs. of potatoes, and in the lug-boat alongside the prisoner I found a sack, with the name of the prisoner's employers on it, con<lb></lb>taining 56lbs. of potatoes—the prisoner said he did not know how the 70lbs. came into the barge, as the barge cabin had been open all the day—he said nothing about the 50lbs., further than that he was picking out a few damaged potatoes—some of them were damaged—he appeared to be washing them when I stepped into the boat—I asked Lewis if they were his potatoes—he said, yes, they were—I said, "Do you allow him to take them?"—he said, "No"—he afterwards said, "If you had asked me, I would have given you a few"—I know lightermen will take each other's tarpaulin, or boats, and say, "I have borrowed so and so," but not potatoes, or things for consumption.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> I had no notion he was going on board my lug-boat that evening—he had never taken potatoes before—he has borrowed a skiff and sculls of me, and we have taken those liberties the one with the other—my impression is that he meant to communicate to me what he had done—some of the potatoes were worth a halfpenny per pound, and some were hardly worth anything—I think he would have told me he had taken them—I do not know that he would have paid me—I should not have looked for that—very likely he might have given us a trifle for them.</p>

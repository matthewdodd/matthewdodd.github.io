About one o'clock yesterday, I left my wife in the shop, and went to dinner; my wife called me up - I came, found the prisoner in the shop, and said to him, "How came you to come into a shop at this time of day, you seem not to want victuals, and have a good coat on your back;" he said, "I did it through distress" - I said, "Why don't you apply to the parish?" he made no answer - I had left this cloth on the counter, about three yards from the window, when I went down; I found it laying nearer to the window, but on the counter - I had not been absent five minutes; it might be about a yard from where it was before: after I told him about applying to the parish, he said he was an orphan, and in distress; the cloth contains twenty-five yards, and the lowest value is 10l.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I was in the shop, but had not noticed the cloth, before I saw it in the prisoner's hands - I was sitting reading the newspaper, and the first thing I saw, was the prisoner turning from the counter, with the cloth in his arms; it was off the counter; he was turning from the counter with it; I did not speak for a moment, and he got to the door - I then said, Halloo! and he turned to the counter, and said, "I have brought this from Mr. Hume, for sale" - I paused for a moment, and said, "From who?" he said, "From Mr. Hume" - I said, "No, you have taken it off this counter;" he said, "Me! No, I have a young man outside, who saw me bring it" - I said, "You have not, for here is our mark on it" - I then knocked for my husband - I think I have seen the prisoner before, but not to know him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long before had you seen the cloth? A. I had not noticed it, till it was in your arms - I did not get to the door to look for the young man; you put the cloth on the counter yourself.</p>

In passing the corner of the court, a man came to me, and said, "Take this to the second shop, and tell them it comes from Mr. Hume, and he wants to sell it" - I was not certain whether that was the shop, and came back to look if Mr. Bennett's name was on the door; the woman said, it was hers - I said,"A young man at the corner gave it me to sell" - I told her to go to the door, to look at him, which she did.</p>
               <p>MRS. BENNETT. I did not go to the door at all.</p>

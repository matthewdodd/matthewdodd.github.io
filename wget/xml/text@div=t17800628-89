               <p>Our house was attacked about ten o'clock on Wednesday the 7th of June.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing the prisoner there? - Yes; some time after the goods were destroying I jumped out of the one-pair-of-stairs window to save my life. I fell into the street. I got up again, and the prisoner struck me on the shoulder with a kind of a coach wheel spoke, a piece of thick wood, which he had in his hand, and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he saw you fall? - He must see me fall; as I rose up again he gave me another blow: he then came round me, put his hand into my pocket apron and took what money I had. They had broke all the bars out of the cellar door; he got into the bar and left me; I thought to get into the bar; I could not. I withdrew a little and got behind the mob; they broke down the back yard gate and I got in again backwards in about five minutes; I found an old cloak and hat belonging to my servant; I put them on and stood among the mob, hoping they would take me for one of them.</p>
               <p>Did you see this man do any thing more? - I did not go any more to the place where he was, I was backwards; I saw him backwards and forwards on the outside of the house; I only saw him waving his stick about; he was very dirty; he seemed to have fallen down in the dirt.</p>
               <p>During the time you speak of were the mob doing any thing to the house? - Yes, they were very busy destroying the goods and pulling down the house; the inside, the window frames, and wainscoting are all taken out.</p>
               <p>Had they destroyed the wainscoting before you went out? - No.</p>
               <p>When was the prisoner taken up? - Last Sunday was a week.</p>
               <p>Upon whose information was he taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280207"></xptr> up? - I believe upon mine; I knew him but did not know his name; I enquired; they called him Hell fire-Jack. We had no habitation; we came back to a little house on the same spot of ground, till we got a knowledge of these people.</p>
               <p>How came you to know his name afterwards? - The people in the yard where he lived told me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether she can swear to what clothes I had on? - They appeared to me to be brown, but they were covered with dirt and mud.</p>

               <p>What were the people doing when he came out? - Demolishing the wainscoting as fast as they could, and bringing the things down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What sort of clothes had I on? - Brown.</p>

               <p>I live opposite Connor's house; the prisoner did not know of any riot there till I brought him down stairs. I had got two persons committed to Newgate; as the prisoners were let out I expected my house to be pulled down. Between nine and ten o'clock I took a tea-chest in my hand and went into the prisoner's room; he had his waistcoat unbuttoned, and was going to bed. I said, you do not know the distress I have been in; I expect the people to come from Newgate to pull my house down, I wish you would take my apparel into your room and save it for me; his wife had just lain in; she said he might go with me and save what he could.</p>
               <p>He does not live in the same house with you? - No, he lives at one Mr. Cooper's, about four doors from me; as we came down stairs there were two gangs of rioters came into the yard; they came down Wentworth-street way from the high street; when we got down to my door opposite the prosecutor's there came in another gang from Whitechapel, and then they filled the yard quite to my door.

               <p>How do you know he went there? - Mr. Hill will witness he was there. I sent some parcels about twenty minutes after, and his wife answered out at the window and said, Mr. Gandon's people were in bed and would not let any parcels in; they were frightened.

               <p>The prisoner came home about a quarter before nine o'clock, before the riot began. He lives in the same house I do; he has the lower part and keeps a cooper's shop. He went up stairs directly; in about half an hour Mrs. Mills, the last witness, came in and said the prisoners were come from Newgate, and she was afraid they would destroy her house. She asked the prisoner to assist her; his wife begged of me to keep the door shut, that he might not go, for fear he should be murdered. The door was opened; he went out and came in again in about a quarter of an hour; he staid a few minutes and then went out a different way from where the rioters were. He came in again in about five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280208"></xptr> minutes, as near as I can guess, and then went to bed. I went up for his candle because his wife had lately lain in; it could not then be above a quarter or half an hour after ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to say positively that he was not out of his house after half after ten o'clock? - That I can. I think before that, about eleven o'clock, the prosecutor's wife came to the house; I had just stepped over the way; the door was open; she brought some goods, and then she did not say any thing about being robbed, not a word.</p>
               <p>What did she bring the goods for? - To be safe. She had saved them out of the fire herself. More than that, a woman who came to bring some goods, told me, that a man who lived in her house, had been robbed of his watch and buckles, but never mentioned Mrs. Connor being robbed. I know nothing of that woman, I never saw her before. I never heard it mentioned that he had done such a thing till the Sunday after the riot, which was on the Wednesday. I told the prisoner what I had heard; he did not seem at all confused at it; he said he knew himself innocent, it was no such thing. I mentioned it to him two or three times after; he said he had been told of it by other people and had been desired to go off, but he would not go off as long as he knew his own innocence. I believe him to be a very honest man. I have been out of a Sunday, and left him all day in care of the house; I never missed any one thing.</p>

He avowed his innocence. He never has left the house I live in, except going backwards and forwards to his work, and then passed the house. They lived in Black Lyon-yard after their house was destroyed; he was under the necessity of passing by their house two or three times a day.

               <p>The prisoner had a job in hand for me at the time; he came to me the next morning after Mr. Connor's house was pulled down, at about half after nine, to borrow a shilling; I told him I could not lend it for I had no silver in my pocket. He came again the next morning and I lent him sixpence. Then he went to work for me. In the afternoon I lent him a shilling more. The next morning he came to work again and worked all day; at night I paid him three shillings and ninepence for work which he had done for me. He finished my job on the Saturday night after. He did not work for me the day of this affair at Connor's, because I was not ready, he did the day after, and the next to that; that is all I know about it.</p>

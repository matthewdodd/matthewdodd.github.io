            . I am sister to Mrs. Joy. I reside with her, and superintend her house - the prisoner had been there a fortnight - she was hired by the year - on the 30th of April she was washing her dishes, and I saw some flounces below her gown - in consequence of that, I told her she should go immediately - she had before had notice to leave on the Saturday following - she took away one box, and when she came back my sister sent for the officer - there were two wine glasses in the box which the prisoner left at our house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you have any quarrel with her about not making soup for twenty-four people out of a shin of beef? A. No; we found fault with her cooking generally.</p>

             (police-serjeant E 14). I was sent for, and asked the prisoner where she had sent the box which I understood had gone away - she said she did not know exactly, but it was gone to a house in Smart's-buildings, Drury-lane - that the people were quite strangers to her, but she took the things to the top of the stairs, and left them there, as she saw no one - I asked her if she would go with me - she hesitated, and then said she would - I went to the house, and a woman came out and said to her, "Ah, Kitty, is that you?" - I turned to the prisoner and said, "I understood the people were total strangers to you" - the woman said, "Oh, no, she has lodged here, and she has been here several times lately" - the prosecutrix saw these articles there, and said they were hers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. These were loose about the room? A. Some were in a closet, and some on the mantel-piece.</p>
               <p>MRS. JOY. These are my property.</p>
               <p>MRS. BURT. I live in the house where these things were found. My husband is a porter - this butter-pot lid is mine, I told the prosecutrix so when she came and took it.</p>
               <p>MRS. M'GARTHY. The wine glass and tumbler are mine - they were taken from my house by the prosecutrix, and she wanted to take some soup plates which I brought from America, and a fruit basket of mine - this glass was my mother's, and I set store by it.(Elizabeth Salter, Charles Salter,

               <p>25th July, I left off work at 7 o'clock in the evening—I was at home from 7 till half-past 10, and then I went to my friend, Benjamin Woodnut's sister-in-law's—there was myself, Woodnut, and his brother and sister—we had some steak and bread, and a glass of beer for supper there—that was very nearly eleven o'clock—I had no rum and water there; I had some at the Bell public house, I think, before we went to Mrs. Woodnut's—I was in the Bell five minutes—we left Mrs. Woodnut's about half-past 12, after we had had our supper, and went towards home—we had got a little better than fifty yards from the house, in Paradise-street, I think, when the two prisoners came behind us; they came in front of us first, and then got behind us; and as we were passing, Smith said, "We have been looking for you two b—s;" I turned round and said, "Who do you call two b—s?" and then Smith throw me down; I got up again shortly, and said to them, "I know you to be police," and I saw Smith's hand go towards his pocket, and he struck me in the eye; my eye bled, and it was closed for five days—the street in which this happened is lighted with gas-lamps, and these was a lamp near the place where this occurred—when I was struck in the eye and knocked down, I called out, "Police!"—no police came, and I went towards my mother's house—the prisoners both ran away immediately I called "Police"—just as we got close against my mother's house, the policeman Lamb came running up behind us—I told him I had been assaulted by two policemen, and he said, "Go on, or I will look you up "—he came from the direction in which the other two had gone—Lamb kept pushing us along and told us to get in doors or he would lock us up—I got home, and was taken out of my house about ten minutes afterwards and locked up all night—Lamb and two more policemen came and took me off to the station, and our neighbour next door bailed me out the next morning—I was taken before the Magistrate on a charge of being drunk, riotous, and disorderly, and assaulting the police—the charge was dismissed—I had known both the prisoners before this for years, as policeman in that part—Smith used to call me of a morning—I next saw them when they came to the Police Court on the Monday—I am sure they are the same two men—they did not give evidence on the Monday; they did on the Friday—the case was remanded, and they both gave evidence against us—I was bound over eventually to prosecute the prisoners by the Magistrate—I saw Woodnut thrown down by Allum—he asked the reason I was knocked down, and Allum caught hold of him, and threw him right off the kerb he fell backwards—when he was about entering my house, ho told me he had received a blow on the back of the head—I did not see the prisoners there then—I did not see him struck again that same morning—he was insensible when he was taken to the station-house, and after he got there—Woodnut was quite sober, and so was I.</p>

               <p>said that, I knew I was not drunk, and began to speak about being ill-used by the police, and I was told to hold my tongne—they would not let me say what I wished to say—a policeman in the morning asked me how I got the mark on my eye, and I said it was two detectives on the road last night who had given it me—that was a policeman I knew very well, Sergeant Jackson—it was not 307 M who asked me about my eye—I know Jackson well, because I gave him some money to get my breakfast in the morning—I swear that 307 M did not ask me how I came by that cut, and that I did not reply, "I got it in a row; I always get into a row when I have a drop to drink;" I said no such thing to anybody there—I saw a man named John Rogan up at the Court against me—I don't know whether he was examined—I did not see him that night close to my mother's house just before I was taken into custody—(<hi rend="italic">Thomas Hamlin</hi>, 309 <hi rend="italic">M, was here called in</hi>)—I know that officer; he came into my mother's shop with Lamb on this night after the rattle was sprung, I saw him put his bull's-eye on—I was kicked in the side by Lamb in the shop, and I was taken by the throat and dragged out by him and the other policeman—I believe I mentioned about Lamb kicking me at Greenwich—I could almost swear that I said so—I know the prisoner Smith very well—several others have called me in the morning by knocking at the door—I have engaged him in the night to call me, so I can swear to the man; and I still swear that he is the man who as<lb></lb>saulted me on this night—I had a hand put over my mouth several times at the station, and was told to hold my tongue—I cannot say who did that, there were two or three policeman round.</p>

               <p>and the two prisoners went away from them—I followed up to Mrs. Thomas's house—it was all in my line home—when they called "Police!" they had gone from ten to fifteen yards from the place of the assault, and a police-constable, 104, I believe, came up—Thomas told him he had been insulted by some parties, and the constable commenced pushing them on, and said he would lock them up if they did not go home—that was just before they got to Mrs. Thomas's door—he did not say what he would lock them up for—Thomas preceded Woodnut, and knocked at the door—a female in her night dress let Thomas in—Woodnut was just behind him, and I saw a policeman stop Woodnut from going in—I will not say it was the same who pushed them on—I then saw Woodnut fall backwards' on his head, and saw him between a constable's legs in a sitting posture outside—six or seven people then came up—I did not see the prisoners come up—I next saw them on the following Friday at the corner of the Greenwich-road, and recognised them—on the Wednesday following the assault I was passing Thomas's house, and saw him standing at the door with his eye bandaged up—I asked him how his eye was, and he asked me if I saw anything of the affair—I was examined at the police-court—I have been in trouble; I got a sentence of penal servitude for four years—it is three years ago last July since the sen<lb></lb>tence expired—I have been to sea since then; I came home sixteen days before Christmas from Africa, and have been at home ever since—I was at work two years for Mr. Fuller previous to my going away.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, M</hi>). The prisoner Allum has been in the police force eight years, and Smith five years—Allum has conducted himself with propriety, steadiness, and integrity; his conduct has been very good—Smith has also behaved in such a manner as to entitle him to the same character—I was on duty at the police-station at midnight when this matter occurred—I remember the persons, who are now the prose<lb></lb>cutors, being brought in—the defendants were in the performance of their duty that night—the prosecutors appeared to me to be drunk—Woodnut was the worst of the two by a great deal—I entered the charge, which was substantially that of riot and disturbance, and violence—I read it over to them after it was taken down—they neither of them made any complaint to me of having been ill-used by the policemen—they were able to give me their names and addresses—I asked Thomas how he came by the cut on his face, and he said he got it in a row—they were con<lb></lb>veyed to a cell, and locked up—I saw them again about 2—they were brought in about half-past 1, and I saw them at 2—from the period of their being brought in, until I saw them at 2 o'clock, they never said one word to me about having been assaulted by police-constables.</p>

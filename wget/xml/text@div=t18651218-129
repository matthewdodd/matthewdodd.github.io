                  </hi>. I am a seaman—on 11th December I was staying at the Sailors' Home in Whitechapel—on the night of 11th December, about half-past nine, I was in Cannon-street, going home—I was sober—I met the prisoners and was about to pass them, when Manning touched me on the shoulder, and said, "How are you getting on?—I said, "Nicely "—Donovan was then on the other side of me—I went to go on and Manning said, "I see, you don't know a person now"—I did not stop, and he then came up to me, and said, "D—n it, you don't know a person, you don't recollect me the other day, fetching you to the Sailors' Home?"—I turned round and said, "I know nothing about you, my good man; you did not fetch me there"—he then struck me behind the ear as hard as he could—I recollect seeing him about Wells-street, where the Sailors' Home is, before that—Donovan then <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> me on the side by the coat, tore my coat open, got his hand in my waistcoat pocket, and took out my money—I had hold of his hand and felt the money in his hand—Manning then struck me again with his fist, and I was pretty near stunned—I called "Police"—after Man<lb></lb>ning struck me the second time, he put his hand in my right waistcoat pocket, in which I had 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, which he took out—I then got away from them and crossed the street; I saw them turn a corner and followed them—I then saw two women, Hands was one of them—I went a little further, saw a policeman, and made a complaint to him—he gave not the least attention to me—I left him to go away and the three prisoners then made a chase after me, and the woman came up to me at different times and got me by the coat and tried to get it off—I turned round and saw her face at different times—I went into a public-house and made a complaint to the landlord, and about five minutes afterwards police-constable Barnes called me out—I gave him some information and went with him to another public-house; I believe it was the Crown—I went in—he remained outside—I went into a room, and saw about fifteen or sixteen men and women assembled</p>

About five or ten minutes past nine, on the night of 11th November, I was in Cable-street, which is not far from Cannon-street—I received some information which induced me to go to the Hoop and Grapes—I there saw the prosecutor, and called him out—to gave me some information, and I went with him to the Crown—I had seen the prisoners go in there—the prosecutor also gave ma a description of them—he went in first, and then I went in and took them in custody—he pointed them out to me—he was sober—I searched the prisoners at the station—on Manning I found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on Donovan 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Manning said he knew nothing at all about it, they had been at work together—after I told Donovan the charge, he said, "Why he only charged us before with taking 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and now it is 3s"—the prosecutor had a scratch on his nose, and on the following morning his jaw was swollen very much and bruised.</p>

He told a policeman that he had been rob<lb></lb>bed; the policeman said, "Who robbed you?"and he said, "I don't know"—we stood there listening to him, and the man turned round, and said, "Those two men robbed me,"and the policeman would not take us—the prosecutor said then that he had lost 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then walked up towards the Sailor's Home—this woman ran before us up to him, and then she came back to us, and said, "I have given him a good hitting and shoving for accusing us"—we then went to the Crown for some more beer, and the sailor and another policeman came in, and gave us in charge.</p>

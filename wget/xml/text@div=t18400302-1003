I live in Tower-street, Waterloo-road, My daughter, Elizabeth Susannah, is eight years and six months old—on Sunday, the 23rd of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the forenoon, I went with her to Mr. Budge's, a butcher's shop, in the New-cut, Lambeth—I bought a piece of beef, which weighed five pounds all but two ounces, and a piece of salt beef, which weighed four pounds four ounces—the two pieces of meat were put into a basket which I had with me—I gave the basket to the little girl to take the meat home, and I gave her 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to buy some turnip-tops and potatoes—I afterwards went to a potato-shop, and found her crying—the basket and meat were gone—she stated how she had lost it—in consequence of what she said I went with the policeman to No. 89, Carlisle-lane—I found the three prisoners there—it was then about a quarter past twelve o'clock—I found my fresh beef before the fire roast<lb></lb>ing—I said, "This is my beef"—the man said, "It is not yours, I bought it in the Cut last night"—I said, "Where is the salt beef?"—I was then looking into the cupboard, and the policeman said to Jane Burn, "What are you standing there for?"—he pulled her aside, and found the salt beef in a tub, with some turnip-tops, which I have no doubt were mine—I found my basket on the top shelf in the cupboard, close to the ceiling—this is it—I can swear to it—it has a leather strap, which I put on it, be<lb></lb>cause the handle was broken off—the meat was taken to Union Hall—I took it home afterwards, and ate it.</p>

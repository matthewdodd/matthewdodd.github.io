                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Customs, and was on duty at St. Katharine Docks on the 4th of Oct., and saw the prisoner coming through the dock-house, about twenty minutes to two o'clock in the afternoon—I called to him to stop, which he did—I said, "Have you not something in your hat?"—he said, "No, I have not"—I seized him by the coat, took off hit hat, and found 21bs. of indigo in it—Stevens, the constable, searched him, and found 3/4 lb. more.</p>

I am a constable at St. Katharine's Docks—Walden brought the prisoner to me, and showed me his bat, and I found in it 21bs. of indigo, tied in a handkerchief—I asked if he had any more—he said yes, two more cakes in his pocket—I asked where he had been, he said to letter F warehouse, to his master, Mr. Dixon, and he said he was going on an errand—I asked him if Mr. Dixon gave him the indigo to take out—he said no, be knew nothing about it—he showed me this paper, which he had in his hand—I know the F warehouse, and I know there is a floor called the indigo floor—I locked him up, and went to the F warehouse, to see Mr. Dixon—I then took the prisoner to the superintendent—he said he bought the indigo for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a public-house, the Black Horse on Tower-hill, in the tap-room, of a man, that he should not know the man again—he said he afterwards took it into the Dock—in going to the Police-office he asked what I thought would be done to him—he said, "Do yoo think they will take me up?"—I said, "I think it likely you will be remanded"—he said there was one thing he was sorry for, and that was, for giving his right name; and if they sent him to prison, he should not live to come out, he would rather be transported, because his character was gone.</p>

On the 4th of October I was there with Mr. Dixon—I was appointed to attend to him—there were from half-a-dozen to ten samples of indigo on the table—the prisoner came there between one and two o'clock, and spoke to Mr. Dixon—Mr. Dixon handed him a piece of paper, about the size of the piece produced when he went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintending inspector at the Docks. On the 4th of Oct. there was indigo on show—brokers and other persons came to inspect it—we had chests of this indigo in the Docks that day, and had samples of them laid on the table for inspection—the indigo with this mark is peculiar to the Dock Company—I have been familiar with indigo upwards of thirty years, and believe this indigo is the same as that we had out on show.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you prepared to swear that no indigo marked as this is comes from other warehouses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I can—I believe there is no other such indigo in any other dock besides ours—I inquired at the London Dock, and at the Fenchurch-street warehouse—I am aware that the same samples do not go to the Old Jewry warehouses—I do not recollect any im<lb></lb>portations of this indigo till within the last two or three years—the import<lb></lb>ations have been very small, and I believe they have come to our docks—a small quantity came about twelve months ago, marked with the same initials, and that has been sold.</p>

               <p>Mr. Roberts's shop between 12 and 1 the same day, presented the order to Beare the clerk—another assistant, Woodward was there—I said "Mr. Goddard has sent this order, and I am to wait for the goods,' and the shop-man delivered to me six boxes of cigars and eight pounds of tobacco in two brown paper parcels, which I took direct to the prisoner's shop, 98, Old Kent Road—he was behind the counter—I knew him before as a customer at the Hen and Chickens when I was employed there—it was about nine months since I had seen him—I said "Will you buy these cigars?"—he looked at them and said "I have got a lot coming in on Saturday, and I don't require them"—I said "Look at them; you shall have them for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he opened one of the boxes, looked at them, and said again "I have a lot coming in on Saturday"—I said "You shall have them for 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—somebody came from the parlour, looked at the cigars, and said "They are London make, and will be cheap at a sovereign, and I will take half"—the prisoner looked at them again, went into the parlour, and brought me a half-sovereign and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and I left the cigars—soon after I got into the shop I said "I am on board the boats; they are the sort that the officers smoke"—I said that I brought them from the boats—before I left I said "If you want any more you can tell Kingwell"—he is a friend of the prisoner—the gentleman who came out of the parlour said "Have not you got an address you can leave?"—I said "Yes," and I wrote my address, "8, The Oval, Hackney Road," and gave it to Voss—that is my uncle, Mr. Fowler's, house—I was not living there then, but I go there from time to time—the six boxes were exactly like this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but this is not one of them—I did not go to 8, The Oval, and never received any letter—I sold the tobacco to a pawnbroker. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "Hen and Chickens, Surrey Square, Old Kent Road, December 6, 1878.

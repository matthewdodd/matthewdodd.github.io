               <p>John Taylor. About 11 at Night I met the Prisoner and another Woman by <placeName id="t17340710-35-crimeloc143">Temple-Bar</placeName>

The Money was in a Bag in my Coat Pocket. We stay'd a Quarter of an Hour, I paid for the Wine, and as the Women were going out, I miss'd my Money, and call'd out to stop them; but none of the People of the House regarded my calling - The Women fell a running, and I follow'd them. One of them got off, but the Prisoner was stopt at the End of Cary-Street by the Constable and Watch - But I had not the Prudence to have her search'd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the Man's Face before he stopp'd me in the Street, and said I was like a Woman that had robb'd him. <rs id="t17340710-35-verdict144" type="verdictDescription">

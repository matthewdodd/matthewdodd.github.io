My house was broke open last Sunday was a se'nnight in the night. I went to bed about nine o'clock. I have two lodgers and a servant girl; they went to bed before; I saw all the house fastened; I was awaked about the dead of the night: I have no clock nor watch in the house; the first thing I saw was a man just entering my room with a cutlass in his hand; he shook it over me, and said, hush. The door was ajar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any light?</p>
               <p>Cousins. Yes, he had a candle in his hand. Then I saw another man with a mask on his face; he had a candle. They threw the bed cloaths over me, and blinded me; then I screamed a little; then I heard a voice demand the key of a chest that was opposite the door. Gentlemen, said I, the key of that chest is in that little drawer, (pointing to it) I then said, have mercy upon me, and spare my life; I then heard a voice say to me, hold your tongue, I will cut your throat if you speak a word, I said, gentlemen, I will not speak till you give me leave; then they went to the chest, and opened it, and said, there is no money here; then a voice said to me, you bitch, where are your pockets? I said, gentlemen, my pockets are under my right side, underneath my pillow, and one of them leaned over my breast, and took my pockets. If I had had a thousand pounds I should have parted with it; then I thought I heard them wrangle, but they bid me lie still, for they should be there for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after was the house quiet?</p>
               <p>Cousins. I heard them go up to my lodgers afterwards, but I lay still for fear.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay in the house?</p>
               <p>Cousins. It is my opinion they staid hardly a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them go down?</p>
               <p>Cousins. I think I heard them go down very softly. I lay in that condition about a quarter of an hour, Then I got up, and went up to the lodgers. I lost about twenty-seven pounds in gold, and about thirty shillings in silver out of my pockets; it was loose, but was in a private pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came down, what did you observe? Where did they get in?</p>
               <p>Cousins. They got in at my kitchen window; the two bolts of the windows were untwisted, and the screws drawn; I apprehend it was done with this (producing a small crow with two teeth) which they left in my bed-chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your kitchen window, a sash or casement?</p>
               <p>Cousins. A sash. When I came down I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177510180030"></xptr> found it quite open, and the door was open too.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that window fastened when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Cousins. With a shutter on the outside; the shutter was forced open, and the screws were drawn that were in the two bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. In your fright had you any opportunity or power to take notice of the people?</p>
               <p>Cousins. I had no power because they blinded me immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you any thing of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Cousins. By the heighth and thinness of the prisoner, I think he is the first man I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the colour of his coat?</p>
               <p>Cousins. I had not time.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor his face?</p>
               <p>Cousins. Not to-swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever recover any of your money again?</p>
               <p>Cousins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Cousins. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken up?</p>
               <p>Cousins. The Sunday following.</p>

            . I am a lodger in the prosecutrix's house; about the dead of the night I heard my mistress scream out; I got out of bed to go down stairs; when I had got down one stair, and went to step down the second, I met a gentleman with a lighted candle in his left hand, and a cutlass in his right hand; he desired me to walk back to my bed, and made me get into bed. I got into bed; he stood over me a few minutes; I viewed his face while he stood over me. When the prisoner was taken I was sent for and immediately knew him to be that man.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stand over you?</p>
               <p>Miller. About five minutes; then he went down, after he had been with my mistress: he came up again, to see if I was in bed; he wished me good night; he shut the door after him and went away, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost nothing yourself?</p>

               <p>Joseph Hall. The prisoner, who calls himself a printer, and I were acquainted; we met upon the Sunday the fact was committed, at the Green Man in Peirpool-lane; there the prisoner proposed to me to go and break open this house, and talked of asking two or three dust-men to go with us. I did not like that, because they were strangers; then he said, he would go and get somebody he knew; we met with Hartley, and he agreed to go; we all three went to Hartley's lodgings, in an Alley between Grub-street and Moorfields, where we staid till past twelve o'clock; then we went to this house; Hartley was the principal manager; he broke the window shutter open with a chissel and crow; he lifted up the window, went in and struck a light, and then opened the door and let us in; he bid us go up stairs first, and desired Andrew Gray to stop at the woman's door whilst he went into her room. Hartley went into the woman's room, and asked h er for her pockets and the key of her chest. He got the money out of her pocket; then he blew out the candle, and said, come away, and we all went away. We got about twenty eight, or twenty nine pounds, which we shared by the light of one of the brickkilns; we went together till we came to the Alley Hartley lives in; then we parted. Gray and I went to Hatton-wall, where we lay all night. I was taken up upon the Sunday; the prisoner was dressed in brown cloaths when the fact was committed; Hartly had a crape over his face; I had a handkerchief over my head; Gray had a handkerchief or cap.

When I had taken Hall, he informed me where I might find Gray; he said, he had left Peirpool-Lane, and I might find him somewhere in Moorfields. I told him I had reason to suspect Andrew Gray was one concerned in the robbery, because I had seen them together. Hall did not make any confession till Monday morning before the justice.

             the moment he saw him; then the evidence gave an information where Hartley lodged; there I found a number of picklock keys, two pistols loaded very high, and a crow. I saw them together, I believe, the same Sunday morning that the robbery was committed; I know it was of a Sunday morning, and I believe it was that Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of Gray before?</p>
               <p>Dinmore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he?</p>
               <p>Dinmore. A printer, I believe; I suspected him because I had him in custody before.</p>

               <p>I am innocent of it, my Lord; I was at Oxford the day the robbery was committed. I came to town the Wednesday following; I was taken up on the next Sunday; I was at Oxford a week; I lodged at a public house opposite the printing-house. I lodged at the King's Arms, in Holborn, when I came to town, I have nobody here. I came in drunk when I was committed to Newgate the other night, and broke the windows, and they put me in the cells. I could not send for any body.</p>

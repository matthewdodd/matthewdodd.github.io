                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Museum-street, Blooms<lb></lb>bury. On the 10th of November, the prisoner came to me, and said he wanted a leg of mutton for Mr. Roden, of the Boar's Head, Exeter-street, who deals with me—I asked if he was going to have a supper that evening—he said he was—I asked how many—he said "From ten to twelve"—I said, "I suppose you will want a large leg"—he said, he supposed he should—I cut him off one about 8lbs. and said, if it was not large enough to bring it back—it was on the faith of his coming from Mr. Roden, that I gave it him—I should not have let him have it, if he had not said he came from him—I let him have it for Mr. Roden—I thought proper to follow him—I took him to Mr. Roden and I asked him if he had sent him—he said he had not—the prisoner then said it was the pot-boy—the pot-boy was brought, and then the prisoner said it was another pot-boy in Drury-lane.</p>

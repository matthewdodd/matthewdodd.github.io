On Saturday the 16th of January, about a quarter to five in the evening, I heard a noise by the door, somebody was pulling away two pair of skates; I pursued the prisoner down Sackville-street, I run up to him and collared him; before I collared him he said it is not me; he threw them against the railing; I brought him into the shop; the skates were picked up at the door and in the street. His wife came to the private door and asked forgiveness; and he asked forgiveness; I said, I would forgive him provided he was not an old offender; I sent for an officer, he thought he knew him; he was taken to Bow-street office.</p>

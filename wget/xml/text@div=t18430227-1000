                  </hi>. I live in Great Peter-street, Westminster, and am a mason. On the evening of the 19th of Feb. I met Parker in King-street between eleven and twelve o'clock—I went home with her to a house in New-square, Westminster—I saw Ellis there—they were both in the same room with me—they persuaded me to undress and go to bed—I was not perfectly sober—Parker laid down on the bed for a few minutes with her clothes on—both the prisoners assisted in taking my clothes off, as I was not very fast in doing it—they took my clothes outside the room, and Ellis said I was to rest contented, my clothes would be all right in the morning—I awoke next morning and there was nobody in the house but me, and my clothes were all gone—I had a snuff-box in one of my pockets, a two-foot rule, a shilling and some halfpence—I have since seen my clothes at a pawnbroker's in Strutton-ground—when I found I was left alone I waited in the house till</p>

               <p>I saw some persons pass, and I sent for some clothes to put on—I went to the station and gave information—these are the clothes, and what I had on when I went to the house—these are my boots, and this rule is mine—the snuff-box I have not found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Strutton-ground. On the morning of the 20th of Feb. Ellis pawned this jacket, waistcoat, and trowsers—I did not know her before, but I have no doubt of her—I after<lb></lb>wards saw the prosecutor at my shop—Ellis came again afterwards, and I gave her in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I took Parker on another charge. As I was bringing her out of the shop where I took her, a woman said, "Take these boots with you"—I took up these boots and said to Parker, "Are these yours?"—she said, "Yes, I want them; they are my boots"—I found on her this rule and a new pair of clogs—she said she found them behind the door—she first said she lived in Chapel-street—we fetched a woman to identify her, and then she said she lived in New-square.</p>

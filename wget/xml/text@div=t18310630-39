On Saturday morning, the 9th of April, I was at the shop of Mr. Rees Rees, (who is since dead.) in Monmouth-street; in consequence of what Rees said, I returned to my master's house - the prisoner was at that time their <rs id="t18310630-39-deflabel211" type="occupation">porter</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Was Rees a dealer in marine-stores? A. No; he dealt in clothes and haberdashery - I knew him for twenty years, and was six years in his employ; I was in his parlour when the prisoner was taken into custody - the prisoner is a raw country lad, and has been but a short time in town; I have heard he has fallen into the hands of a woman of bad character.</p>

             was examined before the Magistrate? A. Yes; I saw Rees sign his name to his deposition - this is it; the prisoner was present, and had an opportunity of putting any question to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the Magistrate ask the prisoner if he wished to put any question? A. Yes, I recollect it; I saw Rees write his name in a book, and afterwards on this paper - what was done on this paper was in the absence of the prisoner; I cannot recollect whether this paper was read in the prisoner's presence.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you sign the paper? A. Yes; I believe the prisoner was there at the time, but I cannot exactly speak to that fact - I cannot positively swear that this paper was read in the prisoner's hearing; the evidence was first taken in a book.</p>

            . I am one of the presidents of the Inland Office. On the 16th of October, in the evening, the prisoner was on duty - his particular duty was to charge the letters in the Norwich division - he exclusively managed that division. A letter to Bury, in Lancashire, would not necessarily go to him. It was frequently his habit, as well as others to go to the sorting table, and help themselves - he would have an opportunity of taking letters out of the general mass. It sometimes happens that a letter for Bury, Lancashire, goes to the Norwich division, as there is Bury, St. Edmonds, if it came to him it was his duty to put it in the blind letter-box to be sorted again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. JARVIS. Q. There is not a separate basket for each bag - A. No; the prisoner had an aperture to himself in a recess. There are twenty sorters.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was the prisoner from where the Bury, in Lancashire, letters could be put - A. Almost the length of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner went occasionally to the sorting table - A. Yes, particularly at the early part of the evening, as the messengers do not attend then. I do not mean to blame him for it, it is a matter of praise - letters are often missorted.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 29th of January I was sent for to the Post-office, and went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210025"></xptr>with the prisoner to his lodgings in Norfolk-street, Strand. I found he occupied a second floor, unfurnished - he said he paid sixty-five guineas a year for it, and that his salary was 200 l. or guineas. He said he had no other income. I met Mr. Parkin there, and found some new and old furniture there, and a considerable quantity of new. I found about 217 l. in bank notes in his drawer, in different parcels, among them was a 10 l. note, No. 1326, February 8,1818 - (looks at it) - this is it. I was told he had taken something out of his drawer unperceived by me; I seized his hand, and took two gold seals out. As I was taking them out, he said,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use, I have done wrong - I am guilty *."</p>
               <p>* This witness was examined at considerable length, and deposed the same as on the prisoner's second trial, Page 225. It is presumed useless to state it here.</p>

            . I am solicitor to the Post Office. Adkins and I were at the prisoner's lodgings when they were searched, and the notes found. The prisoner said</p>
               <p>"I have done wrong - I am guilty." The note in question was found in the drawer.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence.</p>

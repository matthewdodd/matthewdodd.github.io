                  </hi>. I am a barmaid; on 13th October, at 11 p.m., I was standing at the corner of Great Cumberland Place, and saw the prisoner—he said, "Where are you going?" I walked away and took no notice—he followed me and pulled a handkerchief from my pocket with a shilling and two sixpences tied in the corner of it; he took: a penny which was in my pocket; he knocked me down, and made a peculiar noise with his mouth, and two others came from a doorway and held me down while he got away, and then one kicked me—I knew the prisoner from seeing him at the public-house, but I never served him—I shouted "Police," and an hour after I was behind the door of the Quebec public-house when the prisoner called for ale and put down sixpence—I said to a man, "That's the man who robbed me", and the prisoner took his change and ran out, and never stopped to drink the ale—I am quite sure he is the man.</p>

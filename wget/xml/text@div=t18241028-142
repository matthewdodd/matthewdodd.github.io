            . I am messenger at the War-office. I have seen the prisoner five or six times at the office; she came there respecting money, which she said was due to her at the decease of her father; she generally remained in the waiting room, and was there on the 21st of October; soon after one o'clock she came in, and asked if her business was likely to be settled - I said I would go and ask. I returned and told her she might call again in a few days, she cried, and wanted to call again the same day; she retired, and I thought she was gone, but one of the messengers came in afterwards, and I found she was not gone. I went into a room opposite to Mr. Feild's, and on coming out, I saw her standing against the door post of Mr. Feild's room, the door was partly open - this was ten minutes after I had given her an answer; I told her it was of no use to wait. I went away, and in about an hour heard of this watch being missed.</p>

            . I am a watchmaker, and live at Knightsbridge. On the 21st of October, about a quarter past four o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked if I would buy a gold broach, with a cornelian stone - I said it was not good enough; she asked me to buy a necklace, which I also said was not good enough; she then asked me to buy a gold watch; she produced an engine turned gold watch, with a seal and key: I shut the door, and asked what she wanted for it; she said 1 l. I asked where she got it: she said a captain had given it to her - I asked what there was in her face to induce a captain to give it to her; she said she was an unfortunate girl. I went for an officer, and asked once or twice where she got it; she said she had taken it from the War office.</p>

I then returned up stairs; in about two or three minutes I was called down again, the boy seemed a great deal agitated, he told me that the two women had turned into the shop again, and one of them had stolen a pair of stockings, and that both had run away. I pursued the prisoner and overtook her; she came back with me. I observed to her, as she was crossing the street, that she had something in her apron; she attempted to shake them out. I requested her to carry them down to the shop, and not to have a mob about us; she took them out of her apron in the shop and laid them on the counter; The prisoner said she had a pair of black stockings, the other woman had bought them. I asked her who the other woman was, she affected to know nothing of her; I said it was a very improbable story, I should send for an officer; she went down upon her knees and said at my property was restored, I should be no loser; begged I would forgive her. The officer searched her; he found a pair of cotton stockings, my property, in her pocket.</p>

             - A. Yes. On the 15th of August the prisoner and another woman came into the shop and asked to look at some cotton stockings; I shewed them some, and then they said they would have some black ones. I called my father down; he served them with a pair of stockings at two shillings and five pence; then my father went up to dinner. They came in again, the other woman said she would give me one and eleven pence for a pair of black worsted; the prisoner at the bar went to the end of the counter and took a pair of black worsted stockings; when my father came down. I told him which way the prisoner was gone; he went after her and brought her back. I am sure this is one of the women.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That woman gave me the black stockings; I was obligated to pawn a pair of white stockings I had just been and taken them out of pledge.</p>

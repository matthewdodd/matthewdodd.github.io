               <p>Mr. Knowlys, one of the Prisoners Counsel. The street door was opened to you on your knocking? - It was.</p>
               <p>You was the person who had the opportunity of looking through the chinks of the door? - Yes; I being first; with old Macmanus and another witness, looked through the crack of the door.</p>
               <p>Ivory clapped his back against the door? - He did.</p>
               <p>Is the door narrow or broad? - It is not very narrow or very broad; it is a common door.</p>
               <p>Court. Who looked through the chink of the door besides Mr. Macmanus and you? - Mr. Allingham did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What business are you now? - I am a cordwainer by trade.</p>
               <p>Do you pursue that trade? - I do.</p>
               <p>Who do you work with? - For myself.</p>
               <p>When did you make shoes last? - For Mr. Bond, on Snow-hill.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - About two months ago.</p>
               <p>Then for the last two months you have not made shoes? - I have got to be a common thief-taker now.</p>
               <p>I have not seen you much here? - I have been here, but have given no evidence: within this last two months trade has been very dead.</p>
               <p>You mean the trade you stated to me? - Yes; that of being a common thief-taker.</p>

               <p>How long was you a patrol of St. Sepulchre's? - Between six and seven years.</p>
               <p>How came you to leave the business of a patrol for this parish? - Because me and my fellow servant used to go to the Brewhouse together, the side of the Fleet-market, and drink strong beer instead of small.</p>
               <p>Then I believe the people there were illnatured<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270059"></xptr>enough to say that you have taken the strong beer wrongfully? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe they said, you stole it? - To be sure: I was discharged from the office of patrol for that: there might have been other common reports for aught I know.</p>
               <p>Have not you been charged with stealing the oil from the lamps? - Yes; but I deny that: I was dismissed for taking the beer from Mr. Watlington's brewhouse.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 14th of September me, and Ryland, Jealous, Townsend, and Allingham went to Royer's house, in the City-gardens; I understood it was a back room: Ryland went up; and I stopped on the second step from the bottom some time; when I got up stairs Ryland and Allingham were stooping; I touched Ryland, and said, what are you doing? he said, I see them at work; I desired him to stand away; he moved his head away, and I looked over him, and I saw three people moving and stirring, doing something; but what I cannot say; they were the three prisoners; their backs were then to me: I kicked the door a little open, and the two prisoners, Ivory and Smith set their shoulders against it, to prevent its being opened; it was opened in less than a minute; and I went in, and pushed in Ryland and Allingham: the first thing I observed was a man getting out of the window; I saw him very plainly getting out.</p>
               <p>Had you an opportunity of seeing him, so as to know him again? - No, Sir: Townsend came in, and I said, there is a man got out of the window; he got out, and said, I see him: I do not know more than what Townsend said: some of the glass was broke; and when the man was brought back again his hand was very much cut: he was brought back by Jealous and by Townsend, I believe, in less than five minutes; that was Royer, the landlord: here is the cloth he wiped his hand with when he came back (produces a cloth bloody); we secured the men that were left, and made them sit down; they were all stripped, and their shirt sleeves tucked up; their hands were nearly the colour of this glove, which they use some times (produces a green old glove): on the board, in the front of the window, was this six-pence, not finished.</p>
               <p>Court. They are pieces of metal? - Yes. Upon that board lay a parcel of pieces of cork, more than three, and these three pair of pliers, and a great quantity of scowering paper, such as this; I said to Jealous, there is a strange smell of fire, and there is none; and there was a pail near half full, and the colour of the liquor was green; and there was the smell of a slow ugly fire; the pail was as near the end of the bench as it could be: I turned round to my left hand; there was a little stove, made of bricks, that could be made and pulled down directly; I put my hand on it; the bricks were so hot that I could not bear to keep my hand there; and there was a parcel of column, (what they dry malt with) which I understand these people use instead of charcoal: there were also several little barrels of sand, with several bags of this sort; something made out of rotten stone, very offensive smelling things; the sand was white sand, such as is used in casting; and several parcels of this sort of paper, and things, such as they black them with, to make them look like those in circulation; there is blacking in those pipkins now, and here are the dies, and here are two things that Mr. Clarke can describe to you better than I can; but he says, they are the things that they turn the money in the lathe with; these were in the pocket of Smith: these clothes were all out of the room, on the bannisters of the stairs; and when they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270060"></xptr>begged for their cloaths these were in the pocket of the cloaths that Smith owned.</p>
               <p>When Royer returned did he claim any part of the cloathing as his? - Yes; and said it was his house repeatedly.</p>
               <p>(Produces several things, which he said Clarke would describe.)</p>
               <p>What became of the pickle in the pan? - Jealous brought away a pan full of it.</p>
               <p>How long was it before Royer was brought back into the house? - A very little time.</p>
               <p>How many of you were in the room during the time of making this search? - We were all in the room at times: there was another Macmanus besides me; he was in the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Macmanus, among the things that you found, you did not find any lathe? - There was part of a lathe in the room.</p>
               <p>Not a compleat one? - Not a compleat one.</p>
               <p>I believe you have not produced any files? - I believe there are some; I am positive I saw one or two; but whether they were brought away or not I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you find any flasks? - No.</p>
               <p>No moulds? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the sand could have been of no use for casting, without the flasks or moulds? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you find any crucible? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you find any jet? - I took this out of Royer's pocket, and he said it was physick; this I took out of Royer's pocket; there is good money in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I admit that no casting could be carried on there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then I shall not pursue this examination.</p>

            , City-road. I know No. 10: it is directly facing our garden; there is just room for a carriage between: there is a very high pale to our garden: on the 14th of September I found a cloth with some six-pences in it; I cannot say how many; I gave them to this man (Townsend) immediately; I was about forty yards from the house, at work: I found this about three yards lower down than over against the window, not one yard from the garden pales: I picked it up about half past twelve.</p>
               <p>Mr. Townsend. It is the same bundle I received from Smart.</p>

               <p>I live next door to the prisoner Royer, at No. 11. I remember this bustle the 14th of September: I saw a cloth come from the house, and it alighted in Mr. Fuller's garden; I cannot speak to its appearance: I understood it to be Royer's house: I have seen one of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know a man of the name of Morrison? - No: I saw a cart load of goods come to the house a short time before; there was a chair and tables; I did not take notice of the things: they stopped at my door in mistake.</p>

               <p>I am a carpenter and joiner. I received information that the prisoners were carrying on this illegal practice: I went to the house, and I went up stairs, and looked through the crevice of the door; the door was very wide on the box of the lock, and I could have shoved my hand edgeways; they were all three standing with their shirt sleeves up, found a board; we directly made a rush at the door, and Royer snatches up a cloth with some silver, and threw it into the garden opposite, and made his escape out of the window, that I saw; I directly ran down stairs after him, and Jealous with me; we fetched him out of the two pair of stairs, No. 12: we brought him back; I saw all of them round the board, rubbing; and when we forced the door, Royer took up the cloth with some silver in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long have you been acquainted with Ryland? - Not long.</p>
               <p>How long? - Not above three or four months.</p>
               <p>Have you been out with him often? - No, Sir, never; this was the first time.</p>
               <p>What business are you? - A carpenter and joiner.</p>
               <p>Who do you work for? - For one Mr. Rice; he keeps an iron foundry, on Clerkenwell-Green; I have been at work there this morning, and about three weeks.</p>
               <p>Who did you work for before? - One Mr. Butler, in Silver-street, near Wood-street; that was directly; as soon as I left him, I went to Mr. Rice's.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I believe, for the space of twenty years, you have had much experience of this kind of offence? - Yes; I have been called upon different times to report the different progress.</p>
               <p>First of all, you was at Bow-street, I believe, when Jealous produced this pan, with some thing in it? - I was there, when he produced a pan with some thing in it, but whether that is the pan, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Jealous. That is the pan.</p>
               <p>Clarke. It appeared from the look and the taste, to be aqua fortis and water.</p>
               <p>Why is that necessary? - In the first instance, after the six-pences are prepared making ready to put into aqua fortis, it is put into aqua fortis; after that they throw it into water, and from the silver, and the strength of the aqua fortis, it makes it into a green pickle; then afterwards, by rubbing it with sand and water, the white is left on the surface, drawn by the aqua fortis; it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179010270062"></xptr>impossible for me to tell what the metal is, but I suppose there is silver amongst it; if there is any silver the effect will be to expand the silver appearance over the surface.</p>
               <p>Then aqua fortis and water is the necessary ingredient to produce that effect? - Aqua fortis itself; but it is reduced by water, and every bit of metal which is put into aqua fortis, it immediately turns it green; and so, by constant putting it into aqua fortis and water, it turns it green.</p>
               <p>Then what was produced to you by Jealous, was what was necessary to produce this appearance? - It wanted the aqua fortis; it has been used, and put into this.</p>
               <p>What is the use of that cork? - After they are cast, they are rubbed with a file, and then they are smoothed with scowering-paper from the casting; them pliers may be used for several things, but they are put into them pliers in order to rub; that glove they may use for twenty things; it is not immediately necessary; the backing is in order, after they are made bright from this colouring, they put it in, in order to deaden the bright white, that they may have a better colour.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you looked at those pieces of metal which have been produced? - I have looked at some.</p>
               <p>Are they the genuine current coin of the kingdom, or are they base metal? - They are base metal; these are ready for circulation, and they are base coin, no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>From the view of these things, are they what is necessary to carry on that part of the process for colouring? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If I understand you, the liquor that was produced to you by Jealous, was not aqua fortis? - It was not.</p>
               <p>And you said, this appeared to be a pickle, produced by throwing some metal that had been put into aqua fortis into water? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This pickle, of itself, is not strong enough to throw the whiteness to the surface? - I should not suppose it would; whoever coloured this must have had aqua fortis.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the produce of this room, does not afford all that was necessary for the purpose of colouring? - Aqua fortis was necessary to be superadded, not a doubt of it: it would not do in that situation.</p>
               <p>- FRANKLIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the moniers of the mint; (Looks at the six-pences.) In my judgment, there were not coined at the Tower.</p>
               <p>Are they like the current coin of the kingdom? - Exactly the same colour and shape.</p>

He said, that Allingham and he were the only persons that could do any prejudice, and Allingham he could wind round his finger; and as they had not been sworn at Bow-street, he could keep Allingham out of the way, and he pitied Mrs. Royer, having a family of his own.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I will not ask you any questions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Ryland. Did you go to Mrs. Royer's house on the 23d of September? - I am not sure it was so late as that; I did go there; Mr. Macmanus desired me to give a call, to see whether I could find the flasks or not; upon which, the very day before I went, I saw the person that gave us the information; I went there in order to look for the flasks.</p>
               <p>Do you mean, after hearing these two witnesses, to state, that no such conversation as they have related, passed? - I told them the same that I heard.</p>
               <p>Did no such conversation pass? - Not to my knowledge, it did not.</p>
               <p>Then you will not venture to swear positively that you did not say so? - I will not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What did you say to Mrs. Royer about the reward? - I said, I heard there was one hundred and fifty pounds offered, and I told her; says I, Mrs. Royer, if it was in my power to do you any service, it would be a pleasure.</p>
               <p>Did not you appoint to meet Mrs. Royer that evening? - I did.</p>
               <p>Where? - At the Half-moon in Long-lane.</p>
               <p>For what? - To let her know whether there was any truth in it.</p>

               <p>Did not you offer yourself to this poor fellow's wife, as a person that would stay out of the way? - No; I said, I had a job of goods to move, and it was a chance of a thousand, if I could be in the way.</p>
               <p>Did not you give her to understand, that if she could make it worth your while, you would stay out of the way? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to deny now that conversation, that the women have spoke to? - No, they have spoke to part of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Which of the Macmanus's was it that desired you to go to see for the flasks?</p>
               <p>Macmanus. I do not know that I desired him to go; but I talked to him the day before, the 23d, and I said, I am very sure their flasks must be in the house somewhere; says he, I shall go there soon; very well, says I.</p>

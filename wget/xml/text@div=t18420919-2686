                  </hi>. I am shop man to Miss Forsaith, in Gerrard's-row, Marylebone. About eight o'clock in the morning of the 15th of September, the prisoner came to our shop—no one was in the shop but me—he asked for some narrow ribbon, for rosettes for horses' heads—I showed him some boxes, and he chose several pieces—he first said he would have fourpenny ribbon, then sixpenny, and then ninepenny—he put the ribbons he chose into his pocket, and went away—he came again on the Thursday, and chose several pieces—I told him what they would come to, and they laid on the counter—Miss Forsaith came down, seized his arm, and said, "You have more than belongs to you"—he shook very much, took the ribbons out of his pocket, and threw them into the box again—I did not see him take anything from the box—they were not part of those be bad bought and paid for on the Tuesday before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a milliner, and live in Edgeware-road. I was present on the Tuesday, and saw the prisoner there—he went out, and came again on the Wednesday, and bought some ribbon on each of those days—on Thursday I was up stairs—I heard someone in the shop—I knew who it was by his voice—I went part of the way down, and could see what was going on—I saw the prisoner take two pieces of ribbon out of the box—he was in the act of putting them into his pocket when I came down and laid hold of him—I said, "You have more than belongs to you"—he said nothing, but put his hand into his pocket, pulled out several pieces more, and put them into the box which was on the counter—I told him I must send for a policeman, to know where he lived, because I had missed several the morning before (they belonged to me and Miss Johnson) the prisoner said he was doing it for a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—I said, if he was <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> with the two pieces I found in his hand, why should he <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> with those found in his pocket?—he said he had a wife and six children—here is between seventy and eighty yards of ribbon.</p>

               <p>ROBERT GOVAN re-examined. Q. Had you ever asked the prisoner about this 3 s. 11 d.? A. Yes, on the 26th of July, about five o'clock, when I booked the bread; he said, No, she had not paid.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not part with him for a short time? A. Yes, and took him back again, at an advance of wages - when he went away, he did not leave 12 s. in my hand in case there should be a shilling or two deficient.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I first left my master, I left money in his hands. I left him on a Wednesday - I called on the Friday, I went with the new man to the customers, and when I came back, my master asked me to come back, and he would allow me 3 s. a week more.</p>

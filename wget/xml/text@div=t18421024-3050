                  </hi>. I am in the service of Henry Edwin Jag<lb></lb>gers, who keeps the Artillery Canteen at Woolwich. On the 22nd of Oc<lb></lb>tober I heard a noise, and went into the tap-room, and saw the prisoner with a pint pot beside him—there was no one else there—when he was gone the pot was gone—I told my mistress—I went to the prisoner's house and asked for the pint pot—he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me to the door, and shut it—I said "I must have it"—he went back, gave it me up, and said, "For God's sake don't say anything about it, or you will ruin me."</p>

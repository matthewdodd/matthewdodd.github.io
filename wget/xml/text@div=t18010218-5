               <p>Court. Q. Did the other man let in the man who took the cheese? - A. Yes; I never saw the prisoner before he came in for the cheese; I am sure he was the man, he never escaped out of my hands; the cheese was my brother's property.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.When you stopped him, did he attempt to use you ill? - A. No otherwise than pushing my arm through the glass; then a person came to my assistance.</p>

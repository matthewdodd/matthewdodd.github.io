I was alarmed about half-past four o'clock in the morning of the 24th of July, by the witnesses; I immediately went into my own garden, and had got about half-way down the garden when the prisoner jumped over the wall; he was the only one I saw there - he jumped over from Southcombe's garden into mine; I immediately secured him, by taking a rope and twisting it round him; he was on the ground - I cast the rope round him, and secured him; I gave him to the officer, and they took him to the station-house - I saw the house in the state the witnesses have described.</p>

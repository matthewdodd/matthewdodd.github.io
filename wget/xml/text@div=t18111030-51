Whitechapel, we found the prisoner sitting in the tap room with another man in a box I told him he was wanted, he must go along with us, we took him down to the flying house by the office, I searched him, but found nothing but an old knife about him, I then took him into the parlour, we asked him how he got away, he said there was a hole made in the ship by some of the prisoners, and he got away. He asked me if I would not get out of the hole if I was there, I said yes, he said he got into the fields, and there he was four or five days, and there with a file he filed the irons off.

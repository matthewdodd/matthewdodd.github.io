                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Through an interpreter.</hi>) I live at 12, Percy-street, Tottenham-court-road, and am a jeweller—the prisoner was first in my employ as a workman three years ago—he last year went to the Brazils, and returned about two or three months ago—he then came again into my employ—I paid his voyage for him—he stayed there till last Saturday week, when he went away without saying anything to me—after he had gone I missed a great many things, but principally models, some of which were found upon him—these models are mine (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,—I cannot fix the date</p>

               <p>particularly when I saw them last safe, but I believe I saw them last on Friday week, the day before the prisoner left—it is impossible to say what is the value of the property that was lost, having had great confidence in the prisoner—I gave the value as 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I meant by that that they would cost me that for making them—the work upon them is worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had never made the prisoner a present of those models—on Monday night he said in my presence, before other people, that he had taken three which he would bring back—he said I had made him a present of them, but he would bring them back—that was on the Monday after the Saturday he left—I never authorised him to take them away from my shop.</p>

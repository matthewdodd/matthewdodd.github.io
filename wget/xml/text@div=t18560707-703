                  </hi>. I am a miller, and live at Windmill-hill, Enfield. Between 1 and 2 o'clock on 17th June I heard a noise—I had had a cow blown the night before, and I thought my son had got up to look at it—I took no notice of it—in three or four minutes afterwards I heard a noise in the lower part of the house; I got out, and looked out of the window—the room I sleep in is in the front of the house—I did not see any one, but saw the path gate was open—there is a garden in front of the house, which leads into a private road—the shutter of the lower room window was broken open—I called my son, and after that saw the prisoner Sharp run out of my house, by the front door—he ran down the path into the road—(it was between light and dark)—when Sharp got out in the road he whistled, and Jones came out at the same door, and went down the same road after him, and they whistled again—I saw Leary standing in the road when Sharp ran out of the door—when they had whistled again, the three of them ran away down the road towards Barnet—they ran away, as if together—one of my sons, Benjamin, went after them—I afterwards examined my house—the window was open—the shutter was hanging off; the iron plate through which the pin went was wrenched off—I had fastened it up, between 9 and 10 o'clock at night—in the front room I had two tea caddies, which had contained tapes, and threads, and a parcel of things—all the contents were</p>

               <p>pulled out of them—they were in a room on the same floor as the room where the window had been forced—nothing had been taken away to my knowledge—I observed the men's dress—they seemed to me to be dressed in the same way that the prisoners are now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a son ef the last witness and live with him. Between 1 and 2 o'clock on the morning of 17th June my father called me, I got up immediately—I saw one man run out, and a whittle was given—I had not heard any noise before I saw a man—he ran out from the front door of the dwelling house—my room is just over the door, I saw the back part of the man—he never was oat of my sight from the time he left the house till I left him at the police station—it was Sharp—when I looked out he was running down the path—on seeing him run I followed down stairs—I first put on my clothes and went down and went out of the front door—I heard a second man go out an I was going down the stairs—after I saw the first man running and heard the second man go out, I heard a whistle again—I heard the first whistle when the first man ran out—I could not tell who whistled—I went down the path, and saw three men running on Slade's-road to Barnet—they might be fifty yards down the road when I saw them running, and between fifty and a hundred yards from me—I fol<lb></lb>lowed them—they went as far as Mr. Slade's and turned into Russell's foot<lb></lb>path-field—I should think Mr. Slade's is a quarter of a mile from my father's house, it is in the Barnet-road—I heard them speak one to the other—I fol<lb></lb>lowed them up Russell's footpath-field—I let them go on about a mile till they came to some cottages in Old Park-lane, where I was well known—they wene walking then—they ran about a mile and then walked—I walked after them till they came to those cottages—I then walked before them and charged them with breaking into my father's house—one of them, I believe it was Leary, said I must be dreaming—I said I did not think I was, and asked them to go with me to the police station—Leary and Sharp said they would—Jones said he should go his own road—we all four went on together by the Green Dragon in Mann's-lane—that was the direction in which they were going—when we were in Mann's-lane, I called out for a constable—I should say that was another mile from where I came up to them, between two and three miles from our house—I heard a constable run and stop at the Green Dragon—he said, "Halloo;" I hallooed again, he came up to us and I gave the prisoners in charge—they said they could easily have</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are there houses along the footpath between the cottages and the Green Dragon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, there is a hedge on one side and cottages on the other—not—all the way—it is a lonely place; here and there cottages—I was perhaps 200 or 300 yards from the Green Dragon when I heard the policeman stop—I could hear him running, and he stopped at the bottom of the lane—the prisoners and I said but very little—I told them directly that they had broken into my father's house, and they said I was dreaming—we went directly to the station—there are a few cottages and houses about the Green Dragon—it is a house where a good many persons stop—I expected to see a policeman down there—I saw the first man go out of the house—I am quite sure it was the first man—I was looking out of the window when he went out and went down the path—when I looked out at the window he was going out at the door, he was partly out and partly in.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being ready stated</hi>," I heard two persons, one after the other, run out of the house; they ran down Slade's road; I heard their footsteps in the road, and heard them turn out of the road into the foot-path.")</p>

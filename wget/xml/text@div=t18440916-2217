                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser, and live in Church-street, Hackney, and have done so thirteen years. On the 16th of July I was in Silver-street, Falcon-square—I had been to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and felt faint—I went into an eating-house there, and called for a penny-worth of pud<lb></lb>ding—the prisoner served me—it was very dirty, and I said I did not like it—he snatched it from my hand, and said, "If you do not go out of the shop, I will kick you out"—he ran round, and kicked me in the bladder—I had said the pudding was bad, and asked him to give it me back, to give to some poor person in the street—I had paid him for it—he knocked me into the street, and kicked me in different parts of my body—I went across to the shop of Mr. Oram, to ask for a policeman—I had been there a minute, and the prisoner rushed in, and thrust a fork right through my nose—I did not know he was coming—this was while I was asking for a pencil to take down his name—he ran the fork into my face, and said, "Smell, you b----"—he made a hole in my nose—I had given him no provocation—my nose bled pro<lb></lb>fusely—I could not see—I was led to a chemist's shop—they gave me a draught, and dressed my nose—the policeman took the prisoner to the station, having seen him do it—I kept my bed for more than a week, but did not go to any medical man, as I had been under Mr. Lloyd, at the hospital, for an inward complaint, and had been to see him when this happened—I had not kept my bed before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Silver-st. The prosecutor came into my shop to ask for a pen or pencil, to put down Mr. Ward's name—Ward came across with a piece of pudding on a fork, and said, "Here is the pudding, it is enough for a penny, look, and see if it is enough, or it is not"—he said it was dirty—I did not investigate the quality of it—the pri<lb></lb>soner ran the pudding into his face, not intending to run the fork into his nose; but, in the heat of passion, it went into his nose—it was the pudding he meant—his nose was covered with blood—the prisoner did not apologize and say he did not intend to hurt him—I did not leave my shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the prosecutor use abusive language? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said the pudding was dirty—I first saw him outside Ward's house, apparently quarrelling with Ward—he then came over, and asked Ward's name—I said "There is his name over the door"—Ward came over immediately, with the pudding on the fork, saying, "Here is the pudding, is not this enough for a penny? it is clean and good"—a few words ensued, and apparently Ward intended to push it into his face to smell it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a druggist, and live in Wood-street. The prosecutor was brought to my shop by a gentleman—I found a wound in his nose, and the blood flowing from it—it was a slight wound, or I should not have attended to it, not being a surgeon—blood flowed from it—it might have been caused by the end of the fork—there was but one wound—it was on the side of his nose—I do not think it went through—I gave him some lint and tincture of benjamin to stay the bleeding—he then went to the station, and on his return the blood was stopped—he was excited, and I gave him a draught.</p>

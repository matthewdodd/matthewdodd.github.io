                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 21, Daglish Street, Limehouse—on 27th November, about ten o'clock, I was going along the Glengalk Road—I was perfectly sober—the prisoner sprang out from a wall, struck me on the side of the head with his fist, and knocked me down—he called out, "Come on, we have got him now"—five or six men came up and got on top of me, kicked me, rifled my pockets, and took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my waistcoat pocket, and my purse and a sovereign and a half out of my trousers pocket—after that one of them kicked me in the side—they then all ran away, and I got up and said, “ It's no use running away, for I know some of you “—several of them then turned upon me and I ran away—the prisoner was one of them—I knew him before, when he was potman at the George—he left there on the Monday before for being drunk, or something of the sort—I found a policeman in twenty minutes, who told me to go to the George next morning—I did go on Wednesday, the 28th, and found the prisoner sitting in the taproom—I then went to the station and gave information, and two policemen came and took him.</p>

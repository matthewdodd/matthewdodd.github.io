            . The Prisoner and I lodg'd at Mrs. Whitehead's* in Bit-Alley in Turnbull-street - Her Husband is a Watch-maker - We went thence about Midnight, and walked up and down to look for a Chance, 'till we came to the Prosecutor's House. There the Prisoner took a sort of a Chissell and split the Flap of the Cellar-window in two, and raising up one of the pieces, I took out a Barrel of Anchovies that stood upon the Stairs; I felt more, but they stood so close together, that we could not get another, without pulling up the remaining part of the plank, which at last, with a good deal of Trouble, I made a shift to manage, and then he took out another Barrel. We could then have got into the Cellar, but some of the Barrels rolling down the Stairs, made a Noise, and so we went off. He took one, and I another, and carry'd them home, where we let them lie 'till Day-light, and then went with them to Mrs. Whitehead's in Charter-house-Lane, for at that time she did not live at home, but kept out of the Way upon Account of receiving some-Plate that was stolen. We shewed her the Anchovies; she said they were poor Stuff, and ask'd how much we must have. I told her to take no less than 7s. 6d. The Woman of the House said, there had been a Noise about her having, stolen Goods in her House, and therefore it was not safe to leave the Anchovies - I forget her Name, but I think they call her Jenny - So they were wrap'd up in an Apron, and sent to Mrs. Taylor, who keeps a Pawnbroker's and Chandler's Shop, against the Blue-Boar, in Barbican. Then the Prisoner and I took a Walk towards the Prosecutor's, and heard the People talking about the Robbery. Coming back, we met Jenny in Smithfield: She gave us 4s. 6d. and said it was all that Whitehead could get - I surrender'd my self, January 2, to Mr. Claxton, who with two more went with me to Mr. Cross, the Constable, and he carry'd me to Justice Ribe.</p>

               <p>Crofts. By Fidzar's Direction I took the Prisoner at a Brandy-shop in Rosemary-Lane, and as I came with him in the Coach, he begg'd me to speak in his Favour, or he knew he was a dead Man, for he said Fidzar was a Rogue, and had been an Evidence two or three times before, and he was sure he would take his Life away.</p>

            . Some Days before we to the Anchovies, the Prisoner and I went from Whitehead's late at Night, and walk'd about 'till we came to the Pewter-platter, and then it was 3 a Clock. The Prisoner put in his Chissel between the Plank and the Frame, and thrust one of the Bolts back, and pull'd the Plank up. He took out his Tinder-box, and struck a Light in the Street, and putting the Box in his Pocket again, went down the Cellar and lighted a Candle below, for he carried Candles and Matches in his Pocket as well as a Tinder -box. I shut down the Window and staid to watch. In a little Time he knock'd, and I open'd it again. Lay hold, says he, here's two charming Great-coats, one was Cloth, and had a Velvet Cape, and one was a blue Rug. I carried them over the Way, and left 'em on a Bulk. Then he handed up a pair of Cloth Breeches, two pair of Shoes, and a pair of Pumps ; a pair of worsted Splatter-casnes, a blue Apron, and a natural Wig; I laid these with the Great-coat till he came and then we went down an Alley, and each of us pat on one of the Great-coats, under which we took the rest of the Things, and went to Whitehead's. She was not up, but bid us bring the Great-coats to Taylor's in Barbican, for the other Things we shar'd betwixt us. We went thither, and she came to us. I told her the Coats were worth 18 s. but we must not have less than 16. The Prisoner and I went over to the Ale-house, and in a little Time she brought us 14s. and said if that was too little, we might have the Coats again in a Fortnight. We took the Money and shared it equally, and so we went to a Brandy-shop in Rag-fair, where we used to be harboured. From thence we went to a Lodging house hard by, where we lay all Night, his Wife lay with him, and I lay in another Bed in the same Room 'Tis a Sort of an Ale-house, the the Sun and Wheathead. We can there before, but not constantly for we were never rightly settl'd.</p>

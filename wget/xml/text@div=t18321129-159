On the 12th of November, in consequence of something I heard, I spoke to two officers; and on the 16th I gave the prisoner into custody, and we went with him to his house - he said we were welcome to search; I went with Hanley into the front room on the ground floor, and the officer found these fender-feet between the sacking and the bed - they are in an unfinished state; Mr. Line, of Birmingham, makes them for us, and we have them in this state - some knives were also found; the officer asked how he came by the feet - he said some person had left them there, and he intended to call for them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where did you go? A. To Union-court - he has a house there; he said the man who left these feet there was a fender-maker, and he knew him, and he asked him as a favour to let him leave these feet.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I found these feet between the bed and the sacking, in the front room - the prisoner's wife and I were present, and I believe no one else; I asked the prisoner how he could account for the feet being between the bed and the sacking - he said he could not account for it, but his wife said, "This is his first offence - I hope he will be forgiven;" he told her to say nothing - some time after he said they were left there by some man, and he would produce that man at the office, but he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not add that the man called in his absence, and left the feet? A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You first of all went into the back room? A. Yes, my Lord - the prisoner's wife was there, and in consequence of her leaving the room I went into the front room, and found these things; I did not perceive her carry any thing out of the back room - there was not time for her to have put these things under the bed; there were two children sleeping on the bed, and they must have been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290087"></xptr>disturbed - these feet were right under the middle of the bed, wrapped up in two pinafores; she resisted my searching the bed repeatedly.</p>

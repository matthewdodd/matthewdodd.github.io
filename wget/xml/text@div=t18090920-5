               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to her about the watch - A. I did; she abused me very much, and said she knew nothing at all about the watch. Her father talked to her, and by her father talking to her, after sometime she pulled out a large piece of paper, he gave it me directly; being very dark I went to the window and opened the paper; I saw the duplicate of the watch pledged for one pound one.</p>

No, the father gave it me voluntary, he never opened it at all; she was present when the father gave It me, and underneath the duplicate was a seven shilling piece, in gold, in that paper. After that, in a few minutes, she put her hand in her pocket again. and pulled out five shillings and five pence halfpenny; she gave that to her father, he never looked at it, but gave it to me directly: I kept the money till I surrendered it before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about the duplicate. - A. She then swore an oath, have I given you the duplicate; yes, I said, and the seven shilling piece under it. After that she took out the five shillings and five pence halfpenny, then I had had twelve shillings and five pence halfpenny out of the one pound one.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street-office. On the 4th of July I took the prisoner in custody, she was very much in liquor, at that time I received a duplicate of Mr. Dunkin, of a watch pledged for one pound one, on the 4th of July. This is the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her what she was charged with. - A. Not that time. On the following morning, when she was sober, I told her that she was charged with breaking the apartments of Mrs. Biggins, and stealing a silver watch; she said she did not break in, she found the key of Mr. Biggins's room in the passage, and she opened the door. She said nothing about the duplicate in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Look at that watch. - A. That is the watch that I left in my room on the 4th of July when I went out, it is my husband's property; it was stolen out of my room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I acknowledge I was in a state of intoxication that day, but what drink I had that day I had with my prosecutrix; I was going to do some work for her, and on account of my not going to her place, she was to bring the work to my father, therefore when I pledged the watch I gave the ticket to my father, and the money, in order for him to give it to her.</p>

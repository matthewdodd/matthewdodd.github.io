                  </hi> I am son of, and assistant to, Richard Wilcox Fairlam, a jeweller, of 33, Ludgate-street. On Friday, the 2nd of July, about half-past three o'clock, the prisoner, another man, and a woman came to the shop—the other man asked to see some diamond pins—I took out a tray, and showed it to him—they looked at them—the prisoner took some out—he looked at a large one, and said he wanted something like that—he laid one of the pins down on the counter, and put one into the tray—the other man explained a diamond pin that they wanted, and another article—he acted as an interpreter, and said he wanted a pin with a stone in the centre, and other diamonds round it—the woman took a ring off her finger, and the other man said he wanted a ring like that—my father said he would get the articles by five o'clock that afternoon—they went away, they did not buy anything—after they were gone I missed a diamond pin, worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which had been in the tray which I had shown them—I saw it again at the station the same evening when the prisoner was in custody—this is it, it is my father's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARNOCK.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is your father here? A. No—he has no partner—the prisoner did not speak at all—the other man was engaging my father's attention by talking to him—there was a small ticket on this pin, but there is no mark on it—we had this diamond mounted—I know it perfectly well, by having had the handling of it for about six months—we had four or five of these pins of a jeweler in Clerkenwell—one of them we sold, and I have one in my pocket—the gold part of them was alike, but the diamonds were different—they were not all the same price—some of the diamonds were larger and some smaller than this one—I will swear that this is not the one that was sold—I am not sure that one was sold—I believe we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184708160112"></xptr>
               <p>had five altogether, and I think we have three left—I believe we sold one some months ago—I cannot say whether I or my father sold it—this is a larger diamond than the one we sold—we have about a dozen diamond pins in our shop—the prisoner did not speak at all in English; I believe he spoke in French—I do not know what he said.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he seem to conversing with the other man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the pin we sold was a smaller diamond than this—I am confident that that one was not on the tray—I am certain this is one of the pins that they saw.</p>

On the 2nd of July I re<lb></lb>ceived information, and watched the prisoner, another man and a female—I first saw them in a hosier's shop in the poultry—they came out together, went to the corner of Charlotte-row, called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and got into it—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove a short distance and the other man looked out at the window—he saw me talking to the person who gave me information, and they all three jumped out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on the other side, and ran away—I pursued and took the prisoner—I found this pin stuck in his breast—this diamond and pearl ring were in his waistcoat-pocket, two rings were on his fingers, and he had 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which has been given up to him; and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, a pencil-case, a gold watch, a chain, and a key, three pieces of silk handkerchiefs; one piece containing seven handkerchiefs, one six, and the other, three—they are new and not made up, and another new silk handkerchief which is made up, and a foreign gold coin.</p>

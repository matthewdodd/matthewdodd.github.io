                  </hi> I am a cab-driver, and live at 8, Wood's Place, West<lb></lb>minster—about 2.30 on the morning of the 6th August I was in St. Ann Street, Westminster, in company with a young woman—I was going home with her, and when we got to her house I went into the passage—I had hardly time to get inside when four or five men came rushing in—one of them said, "What do you do in my house? "—I said, "If it is your house I will soon get out of it"—I tried to get out, but they would not allow me—when I did get out I was immediately knocked down, and received two or three kicks in the side and two or three severe blows on the head—I could not state who dealt the blows, but Condon was the man who knocked me down—I cannot state positively that Ryan is one of the men, but I believe him to be one—I called out, "Police!" but they knelt on my throat and took my purse out of my pocket—there were 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the purse—I have not seen the purse since—I got up and was knocked down again—they ran away—I met two policemen, and we pursued the prisoners into Great Peter Street, and ultimately Condon was</p>

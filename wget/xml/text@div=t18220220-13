            . I live in Charles-street, Globe-fields, Mile End. About half-past eleven o'clock on Saturday night, the 19th of January, I was coming home from the pay table in Globe-lane, and saw three people over the way, it was very dark; they hailed me, and one said,</p>
               <p>"Is that you?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, Is that you?" I did not go over to them, but kept walking on, and all in a moment I saw the prisoner at my right side; I said,</p>
               <p>"What do you do about at this time of night, you ought to be at home;" she said she had no home, for she had neither fire, nor victuals to eat when she was there; I said,</p>
               <p>"I am as poor as you almost"; I put my hand in my pocket, and gave her 6 d., and as I gave it her, I felt her hand in my pocket. I said</p>
               <p>"You have robbed me"; I missed a crown piece - I seized her, and took her to the watch-house, and saw the crown piece shaken out of her handkerchief on the floor - I thought her a woman in distress, and not a woman of the town; I have no mark on the crown piece. I also lost 3 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not go up a dark court with me - A. It is false, I had nothing to do with her.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house by the prosecutor, who gave the same account he has now; she denied having any 5 s. piece about her; I saw her fumbling at her handkerchief while she was being searched - the 5 s. piece dropped from her bosom; I picked it up.</p>

            . I was on duty that night - Stone's account is correct. Thinking the prosecutor might have been with her, I asked if she had any 5 s. piece about her, she denied having any thing but a few halfpence - I searched her, and found 3 s. in silver, and 1 s. 9 d., in copper; I saw her hand in her bosom, I moved her handkerchief, and the 5 s. piece dropped on the ground - the prosecutor said he lost 8 s. or 9 s., and there was a 5 s. piece among it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was among my halfpence, I did not know I had it; he took it from my hand. The prosecutor went up a court with me.</p>

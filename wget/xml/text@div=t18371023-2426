                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Kent-street, Borough. On the 9th of October, about ten o'clock at night, I saw the prosecutor in Kent-street—he was drunk—there were a great many persons about him—the prisoners were among the mob, which was pushing him about—there was a female in company with him, and they pushed and knocked her about—the prosecutor had a bit of pork—the female said the people wished to steal it, and she said she was going to take care of the man, and take him home—Garman took him into the Crown public-house, and stead went in too—they had two pots of beer to drink—the prosecutor paid for them—he spilled the first one and paid for another—the prisoners came out with the prosecutor—they took hold of him, one of each arm, and took him to the corner of a turning almost by the Crown public-house, called Crown-yard—Garman then held him behind by his two arms, and Istead laid hold of him in front, lifted up his frock, put her hand into his pocket, and shook him, and said something, but what it was I cannot say—she took a bag out of his pocket—she walked on a little way, and then Garman led the man on and she walked behind—she took something out of the bag, and turned it inside out—it linked like silver, and she put it into her bosom—she then walked some steps further, and tore the bag up—I saw her <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> down two bits of it—she. <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> one down first, and stamped on it in the road, and covered it over with mud—I picked it up—she went a little further, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> down the second, and covered it with mud—I picked that up also, and followed them on a little further—they took the prosecutor down a turning called Sweep's-alley, down by a Sunday-school, and there they left him and went home—I saw a policeman, and told him of it, and he went and found the man down there, lying tipsy.</p>

About eleven o'clock at night, on the 9th of October, Coker came and gave me information—I saw the prisoners come up from Sweeps-alley about two minutes before, and there found the prosecutor drunk—Coker gave me two pieces of a torn bag—I took the prosecutor to the station-house, and apprehended the prisoners about three quarters of an hour afterwards—Istead resisted being searched—I said, "Well, give me the money out of your mouth," and she pulled out what she said was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I found it was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Garman, in copper.</p>

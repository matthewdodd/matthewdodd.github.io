I did not like to say any thing, because there was no watchman near; I was afraid they would murder me among them. I knew the prisoner two years before; he used to be gambling at a broad place, close to where I live.</p>

             the watch out of your pocket, what did you do - A. I did nothing, for fear I should be murdered. He took the watch completely out of my pocket with one jerk; he run across the street, and I went home as soon as I could. I did not run after him, nor call out stop thief, because I knew him so well. I knew I should catch him some time or other. I told my wife the man that robbed me, if she should see him to get an officer, and have him taken up; she did. I have never found my watch again.</p>

            . I am a watchman, in Winfield-street. I was there on duty on the night of the 14th of August, I went on duty at ten o'clock; I saw nor heard of any mob or noise, or any thing of the sort. I never heard a syllable of it from ten o'clock till half after ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the young lad at the bar - A. Yes; I have known him three years, he is a very hard working industrious lad; his father keeps a cart and horse; I call him up early in the morning to go to market. I also know the prosecutor. On the night of the 14th of August, I saw him come out of the Cross Keys at ten o'clock; I advised him to go home, and to go to bed; he was in liquor. He never mentioned that he had lost his watch to me; if he had, I could have found out the lad in two or three hours.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

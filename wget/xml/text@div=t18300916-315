               <p>WILLIAM RUMBALL. On the 10th of July I met the Prisoner at <placeName id="t18300916-315-crimeloc1621">Enfield-highway</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you quite sober? A. Yes - I did stop with her for about ten minutes; I had put my money into my right-hand pocket - the constable took her on the Monday morning following; I sent the man who came up for a constable, and up came five or six men, who released her from me, and knocked me down - she got away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go up a lane with her? A. No; I stopped, but did not loosen any part of my dress - I had been drinking with my partners, where we were paid for our work.</p>

            . I took the prisoner on Monday morning; I found nothing on her - she said she had not had it, nor seen the man; when I got up on the Saturday night there were four or five men round the prosecutor - he was laying down, and when he got up he was all over blood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you find the prisoner? A. At her mother's; I went there on Saturday night, but could not find her - I found her in bed on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw any thing of the kind - he knocked me down on the road, and would pull my right-hand pocket out; there were 3s. in it - nobody touched him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a banker's clerk, and reside at No. 81, Beresford Street, Walworth. On Sunday evening, 29th March, I was in King Wil<lb></lb>liam Street, about 9 o'clock, there was a great crowd there—I had scarcely been there a minute before there was a rush made, and three men pressed me very tightly, the prisoner was one of them; they got my back close to the railings of the church in King William Street, at the bottom of Lom<lb></lb>bard Street, and the prisoner took my pin out of my handkerchief; I saw him most distinctly—he had on the same kind of jacket that he has now—he handed the pin to one of the men on my left, immediately across me, he was on my right; he immediately made away, I attempted to pursue him; the other two men tried to baulk me all they could, they pressed me tightly, and ran before me—I overtook the prisoner at the top of St. Swithin's Lane, as he was turning down there—I seized him, and said, "You have robbed me of my pin"—he denied it, and said, "Let me go"—he tried to throw me, and when he found he could not get away, he gave me a violent blow in the face—a policeman came up, and I gave him in charge—before the police-man came up, some men hallooed at me, and pushed me, and asked what I wanted with the man, that he had not done anything to me—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man that took my pin.</p>

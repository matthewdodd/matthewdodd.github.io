                  </hi>. I live at 17, Henry Street, Portland Town, and am timekeeper to Mr. Norman, the builder—the prisoner was in Mr. Norman's employ on 16th, 17th, and 18th October, and I discharged him on the morning of the 20th, after which he abused Mr. Norman—on 12th January he called and said that I had made a mistake with his father-in-law's money, who was in our employ; I had not got him paid enough—ho also said, "I will serve you out yet before I have done with you"—I know the prisoner's writing, I have seen him write—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in his writing, envelope and all—there is no truth whatever that I was living in adultery with a married woman, the mother of a family, or that I knocked my mother down stairs and broke her leg—I did assault my mother, and received punishment for it, but there was no limb broken, nor yet a scratch—it was under considerable provocation; I was taking the part of one of my own children, who is now dead—these two letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in the prisoner's writing—I did not see him write this, but I know it to be his.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When have you seen him write? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In June and July last, in my house—he has been a regular visitor there to the young men connected with my family—he is on friendly terms with a nephew of mine, and they got forming letters to see who could write the best—that was in June or July last year—that was the only time I have seen him write—there might be two or three occasions, but I can only say one—I received the first letter on 24th February—there was Charles Richardson, who is at sea, and a young man named Henry Mann, my nephew, who is on the Great Northern line at Camden Town—I am not a very good penman—I have never before had to give evidence of handwriting—this was seven months before, but the same writing kept coming to me day by day afterwards—another witness will prove that it came from the prisoner.</p>

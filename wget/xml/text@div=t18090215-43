               <p>Q. Did you lose it for any time - A. No. I caught the prisoner in my room between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, on Friday the 3d of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known him before - A. No: I never saw him in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that time had you been out - A: I had not been out five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing there - had he got any thing - A. Yes. My child came for me; when I came in the room he said he came in for some shirts, and ordered my child to go out for me; he had a letter in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the letter for you - A. When I came in I turned round to look for the man, I saw he was in my bed room; I asked him what he wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not tell you that he came for some shirts - A. No; he told my child that.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came in your room you found him in your bed room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your child fetch you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing - A. When I came in he had taken the blanket and laid it on the floor; he took all my linen that I had ready for folding, he took it off the great box and put it in the blanket; I said to him who do you want; he heard my voice, he came out of the bed room with this letter in his hand; he said he brought this linen from one

            ; it was my own linen in my bed room that he was packing up. He had two shirts in his pocket, they were my own shirts; he took them out and swore at me if I spoke a word he would knock me down; he threw the things at me and said, blast you, if you speak a word, I will knock you down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him at the time further than asking him who he wanted - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When he threw the shirts at you had you been in the bed room to see whether he had put the linen in the blanket or not - A. No; I had not time.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you did not know that he had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150021"></xptr>putting any linen in the blanket - A. Just the minute after I cast my eye round, then I saw it was my own linen.</p>
               <p>Q. When he threw the shirts at you did he stay there, or what did he do - A. No; he made his way to the door; with that I run towards the door to him, to insist upon him telling me the meaning of that letter in his hand; with that he came into the room to me, he swore if I came after him he would knock me down; this was on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your bed room on the ground floor - A. Both; I still followed him, and cried Stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said if you followed him he would knock you down, you followed him - A. Yes; he made the best of his way out of the house and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he stopped - A. Mr. Webb stopped him, I was there at the time; while I cried stop thief he swore he would stab me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near him when you cried stop thief - A. I was close to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he go from your house - A. He went into Compton street out of Cock court.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he got when you stopped him - A. I dare say about ten yards or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know they were your shirts that he threw at you at the time - A. I was sensible at the time he threw the shirts at me they were my own shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he had put some of the linen in the blanket - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you left the linen when you went out of the room - A. I left it in my bed room on a box - the door was shut, but not fastened; any one could go into my bed room that opened the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him while he was in your bed room at all - A. I saw him packing up my linen in the bed room; I could see him in my other room; when he was in the bed room he was packing the things up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any letter did you say - A. No. I insisted upon his giving it me, or upon his telling me what it was, but he would not leave it me, nor let me see what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you must enumerate the different articles that he put in the blanket - A. Five gowns - they are worth three pounds, they were almost new, every one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose were they - A. They were different people's gowns; I had them to wash, I am a washerwoman. A pair of sheets, twelve shillings; a waistcoat, five shillings; two bed gowns, five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Would they have sold for the price you have mentioned - A. Yes, and more; one waistcoat, four shillings; three frocks, three shillings; three shirts, six shillings; four shifts, four shillings; twelve handkerchiefs, twelve shillings; two pocket handkerchiefs, one shilling; one pillow case, one shilling, and one blanket, three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had the blanket been before - A. It laid on my child's bed; they were all the things that I took in to wash, except the three frocks; they were mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not pack them up, nor did I put the shirts in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Did you see him pack any of the things up - A. I did; the two shirts he threw at me when he came in the front room; then he took them out of his pocket; there is no marks on the shirt; I took them in of a man; they were to be mended; there is some holes on the shoulder; I am certain these are the shirts.</p>

            . I live at Shenfield. I had drawn my carravan up into Mr. Mane's yard, and whilst I was unlosding the straw, my whip and coat were on the shafts. The prisoner at the bar followed me all the way from Whitechapel. He told me he was Mr. Mane's cousin, and said he had thirty five shillings a week for buying hay and straw for Mr. Mane. I missed my coat and whip when I was coming out of the yard; I saw the prisoner going out with them on his arm; I followed him out, but he got away from us. I heard him tell the man in the yard, to hurry me along, saying he was going to a gin shop at the corner of the Curtain Road, but he never stopped.</p>

            . I am a horse keeper, to Mr. Mane. I saw the prisoner at the bar in the yard on this day. I have lived with Mr. Mane some months, and never knew the prisoner was his cousin. Sneesham came in with a load of straw; and I saw the prisoner carrying the coat and the whip out at the gate. He gave the note into my master's hand; he said he had got the whip, and the great coat, and told me to hurry the lad on, for he was going to the gin shop; the lad knew where.</p>

            . The prisoner brought a man to our office, for stealing a bundle out of a cart. In consequence of information which I had received before that, I detained him, and sent for Sneesham the prosecutor, who picked him out of a room in which there were seven or eight, as the person who stole his whip.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman 149 H). I was on duty on Tower Hill on the evening of the 4th July—the prosecutor came to me and pointed the prisoner out—there was another young woman with her—the prosecutor said he would give the prisoner in charge if he was sure she had his hand-kerchief—I said I could not take the charge—the prisoner then walked away towards the corner, and I saw her put her hand under the railings—I went to the spot and picked up the handkerchief.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was standing with another young woman, when the prosecutor turned round and spoke to us—he gave us some gooseberries—we walked along a little way and met this policeman—the prosecutor said, "One of these women has taken my handkerchief, but I can't say which"—the policeman said, "I can't take them if you don't know which of them took it"—I am innocent—I know nothing at all about it—he couldn't say whether the other young woman took it.</p>

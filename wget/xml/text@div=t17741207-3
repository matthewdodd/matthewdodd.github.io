On the 27th of October between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop, he said he had burst the upper leather of his shoe, and asked my man to give him credit for a pair of shoes, I bid my man tell him I would do no such thing, then he came through the shop to me, and said he lived in credit, that he knew several people in the neighbourhood, whose names he mentioned; I thought he might be distressed and agreed to let him have a pair. As soon as he was gone out of the shop, a person came in and said he had robbed me, my man went after him, and brought him back, and these two pair of shoes, (producing them) were found in his pocket, he took them out of his pocket himself before the constable came.</p>

            . I was coming along the Strand, at the corner of Essex-street, I saw the prisoner and some people about him, I asked what was the matter; they said, he had been in several shops, and they thought he wanted to defraud somebody, I followed him through Temple Bar, I saw him go into the prosecutors shop, I looked through the window, the last witness went into the parlour, while he was gone I saw the prisoner take a pair of shoes off the shelf and put them in his pocket, the man returned and then the prisoner went into the parlour; when he returned I saw the shop-man sitting on a pair of shoes; they would not do; while he was reaching another pair, I saw the prisoner take another pair of shoes and put under his coat, when he came out I went in and informed them of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's father, and live at No. 17, Old Castle-street, which is about a quarter of a mile from King-street—the prisoner lodged at my house—on Sunday evening, the 30th of January, he was at home from half-past six o'clock till half-past nine—there was nobody there but his mother and himself—he was taken into custody on the Monday morning about twelve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time did you dine that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We dined at four, at least had tea—I did not go to any place of worship that day—we supped about half-past nine—we all live in one room, and work in it—the clock hangs over the bed in the room—it does not strike, it goes, and keeps time—I remember looking at it at half-past six—my son called my atten<lb></lb>tion to it—he said, "Now, father, I am going down, take notice of the dock"—I do not know that my wife said any thing to that—"<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>" says I, "it is half-past nine."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But we are talking of half-past six? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is the time he came home—I took notice of the clock at half-past six when he came in, it was when he went down at half-past nine that he called my attention to the clock—he stopped in my room and had supper—he called my attention to the clock at half-past six, and I told him the time—I cannot say particularly how he called my attention to it, nor say his reason—I told him it was just half-past six—the clock goes fourteen hours—I wind it up every night—it is a Dutch clock, with brass wheels, and a pendulum—my son had been at home till about one in the day, then went out till half-past six—the evening had quite set in—I sat on the left-hand side of the fire, and could see the clock where I sit—my wife sat on the right-hand—she could see the clock—he did not particularly call my attention to the clock at half-past nine, because I told him the time myself when he was going down,—he said he was going out to take a walk or something—he did not come back that night at all—he lodged at my house some nights in the week, but he was out of my jurisdiction as regards that—he sometimes sleeps at my house, and sometimes not—he slept there on Saturday and Friday, not on Thursday—he did not tell me where he was going on Sunday—I did not ask him—we had a little beef for supper—he eat pretty fairly—supper began about a quarter to nine—he waited to get supper—nobody fetched any beer—we had none—we could not have any.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to tell him it was half-past nine, you did not wish to hurry him away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I saw it was half-past nine, and said, <hi rend="italic">"Bill,</hi> it is half-past nine, if, you are going down"—he had said, "Father, I am going down"—he did not say where or when he was going—I men<lb></lb>tioned the time—he jumped up, got a wet cloth, and wiped his face, and went down—he got a glass of liquor below as he went out—we lodge at the Feathers public-house—I have lived there twelve months.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's mother, and remember the Sunday before the Monday he was taken into custody—he came home that even<lb></lb>ing, I think about half-past six o'clock, and remained till half-past nine, when he went out—I am sure he was at home all that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What makes you recollect the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because my little girl, who is ten years old, was going to Shoreditch church that evening—the went at half-past six, and came in about half-past eight—we supped about nine, as near as I can guess—my husband, son, and two children, the girl who had been to church, and a son thirteen years old, sat down to supper with me—the little boy was not at home all the evening—I think he came in about eight—he had gone out about half-past six or seven—the prisoner was there when he went out—we all five sat down to supper together—I cannot remember what meat we had for supper, I think it was boiled beef, fresh—we had a pot of beer with the supper, which I fetched from below myself—I noticed it was half-past six, because my little girl said, "Mother, it is time to go to church"—I looked at the clock, and said, "Yes, church has begun"—the clock is almost by the door—the bed is in the back part of the room—the clock is right at the side of the bed against the doorway, not over the bed—my husband winds it up—my son said it was half-past six, and time for my daughter to go to church—no farther observation was made about the clock that evening that I recollect—I looked at the clock at half-past nine as we were talking about going to bed then—my husband generally goes to bed early on Sundays—my hus<lb></lb>band looked at the clock, and said it was half-past nine—the prisoner slept at our house on Saturday—I cannot recollect where he slept on Thursday—he slept at home on Friday—he sometimes sleeps at our house, and sometimes not—our beef was cold—we had tea about four—we generally dine at one—the prisoner had left before dinner—nobody called between half-past six and half-past nine to my recollection—neither the boy nor girl are here.</p>

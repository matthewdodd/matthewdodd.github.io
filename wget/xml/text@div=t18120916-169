The watchman came up to me; he said, let me go home with you, I know where you are going to sleep. I said no, I did not want to be exposed if I am a little fresh; you stay behind.

             on the night that he lost the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any person near him before he lost his watch - A. Two men were behind us; I saw them behind us. Goodwin had been drinking a good deal. They followed us some way. A boy gave him a description. He said, they were two thieves; I would have you take care. I said, Mrs. Goodwin, where are you going to sleep to night, it is getting late, I wish to go home. We went down Checquer-alley, where this man and wife were going to sleep. His wife was a little way before him. I had hold of his arm. His wife was a little distance from him; a man came up and pushed his wife against the wall; and pushed against Goodwin, and almost knocked him down; and another man was behind me; he drove against me, and almost drove me down. He made a pull at Goodwin's small-clothes, which I supposed to be at his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see whether he drew his watch or not, did you - A. No; I saw no face, but an arm, that passed. I said to Goodwin, good God; where is your watch; he says, in my pocket I said, be so good to feel; he felt down his small-clothes, and missed his watch immediately. I said, there are the two men, run down the court. One had a brown coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know either of these two men - A. No, I could not swear to their faces; one had a brown coat on. I saw none of their faces. On the next day, a person brought another watch to Goodwin.</p>
               <p>ISABELLA GOODWIN. Q. What did you see of this transaction - A. It was on a Friday night; Mr. Goodwin, and I, and Sarah Holmes, were coming home; I saw two men in Grub-street, in a chandler's shop, and I saw two men behind us in White-cross-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen after you got into Checquer-alley - A. Yes; after we got into Checquer-alley, one shoved me against the wall, the other pressed me against my husband and Mrs. Holmes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after a man had pressed against your husband and Mrs. Holmes, that you heard that your husband had lost his watch - A.Not a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the men - A. Yes; the next morning I saw the prisoner at the watch house, about eight o'clock; I pointed him out; I said, that is the man that made a snatch at my husband's pocket; there were more people with him at the watch-house, and I singled him out. I saw him snatch at my husband's pocket; I did not see him take any thing out; I am positive he snatched at something; I am positive he is the man; I cannot swear that he stole the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. This woman, that was to sleep at the house with you, says, that some person brought another watch to your husband; did they - A. Yes.</p>

I saw both their features, as they came out of the alley. I stood there and Goodwin came up to me; he said that he had been robbed of his watch. The men had got nearly out of my sight then. I did not pursue them; I was sure it was useless.</p>

I did not find the other; we searched the house, he was not there. I was present when the prisoner was under examination. Mrs. Goodwin saw him when he was under examination; she said she knew he was the man; she was positive then.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw the prisoner immediately after Goodwin had been robbed - A. Yes, immediately; Mr. Goodwin had been gone down the alley about two minutes before these men ran up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the other man - A. No; I have not been after him. I have not power to take him.</p>

The first I saw was in White-cross-street. I saw the two women and the man opposite Playhouse-yard, and they being so tipsy, the watchman asked to see them home; he held the lanthorn up to the woman's face. The woman said, do you know me full well. Yes, he said. I returned down to my own door; I stood a few minutes; they came down. They asked me if it was Checquer-alley; I said, yes. They stood against the wall in the alley. They were so tipsy they could not support themselves scarcely. The wife said something to her husband; he seemed angry. He said he would strike her. I had not stood there many minutes, before there came a man with a light coat and a stripped waistcoat; he took something from the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see a second man - A. No, there was only one man. He went up the court, running into White-cross-street; up came another man, with his coat buttoned and his hands in his coat pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same man that robbed him - A. No, another man.</p>
               <p>Q. That was five minutes after the robbery - A. Yes; they had not called the watch till after that man passed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you call, watch - A. No; I did not know until the man said he had lost something.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see him take something - A. Yes, but I did not know what it was. The woman asked him if he had his watch. He said, no, that man that passed me has taken my watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Have you been in court while this trial has been going on - A. I have been out of court; I have not heard a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Then another man came up the court, the wife said to her husband, have you got your watch? Did this man that came last run - A. No, he did not run at all; he walked by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, when this man came by with his coat buttoned, they said they lost the watch - A. Yes, they did; it was as much as five minutes, a minute over or under.</p>
               <p>Q. Did two men, at any time, come into the court together? Did two men ever go out of the court together - A. No, they did not. The man that took the watch from him had a light coat on; the other man had a brown coat on. The man with the white coat did run.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, what house do you live in - A. A lodging-house.</p>
               <p>Q. For such ladies and gentlemen as frequently come in Chequer-alley - A. The price of a room in that house is from a shilling to three shillings; I have lived there six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at all - A, I know him by passing and repassing through the alley. I have spoke to him once or twice, that is all. I never ate or drank with him, or sat in his company.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the woman that was here just now, Fetherday - A. No, I know nothing of her; I never kept company with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160091"></xptr> Q. Have you any sort of connection, either direct or indirect, with the prisoner - A. Never, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw two persons in the alley together, during the time you were there - A. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Could any two persons, together, have gone by you, from the time the man was robbed, until the second man made his appearance - A. No two persons could have gone by without my seeing them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him to live in the alley - A. About a month.</p>

               <p>Q. You thought him an inhabitant in the alley, did not you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come home regularly - A. Yes, some evenings, and then it would be two or three evenings, and sometimes a week. He used to go down the alley to a lewd girl; that was not a constant home for him; he used to go with other women. I am perfectly sure he did not live there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you know this lad was in custody - A. The next morning after the watch was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you applied to to come here - A. I have not told any body.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to know it - A. I went to the top of the alley; the watchman asked me if I knew them both. I said, I did not know the first that robbed the man, he was an utter stranger to me; the other young man that came out about five minutes after, I knew his name; his name was

I ordered the buying a large quantity of iron shot and boomshels at Portsmouth. Accordingly they were bought, shipped, and brought into the river Thames, the ship anchored against my own door. I took the shells and shot out, and put them into two lighters, one went through bridge, the other to my hous Says the clerk that bought the goods, I am sure, Sir, there is not the quantity of shot in that lighter which we put in. We took them out again, and weighed them, and found deficient 3 hundred weight.</p>

               <p>Eade. We bought about 50 tun of shot and shells, they were taken out of a French prize at Portsmouth. About three days after this there came a person to me to know if I would buy some iron shot, I agreed with him at four shillings a hundred for all he had. This person's name was

               <p>Eade. We prove, that by another evidence, I asked if that was all, he said, yes.

Welch told me when he came there he bought them of one Larrance, whom we took up. We went with a search warrant, but there was none to be found.

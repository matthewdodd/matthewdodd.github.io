               <p>Prisoner to GEORGE DAVAGE. Q. Did you never go by the name of Watts? Witness. I have a brother-in-law of the name of Watts - I don't know whether anybody may mistake me for my brother - he took the house I live in, and I conducted the business - I did not go by the name of George Watts, in the City-road, you at first had four shillings a week of me, and afterwards agreed to come for your board and lodging - I don't know that you pawned your coat to get my breakfast - you lent me 3s. - I might send you to sell some old iron and phials, to get a few halfpence - I sold a pair of scales, but not the pair you stole - I was a porter at the Bell and Crown - I was not discharged for stealing - my circumstances were embarrassed, and I have sent you with articles to pawn - I gave you one waistcoat, but not those you took - I did not give you those trousers - when you was with us you had as much as we could let you have - I never sent you to Mr. Bowles, in Newgate-market, for 17s. 6d. for the carriage of parcels.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Mr. Booth here? A. No: I have seen his Christian name on letters which came to the house - I have not seen him write it, nor heard persons call him so - he has no partner - I saw a man's hat in the area that morning - Bagster was drunk, and Ward was without his hat - he said his hat had fallen over, and Bagster tumbled over in trying to get it - there are four lodgers in the house.</p>

             (police-constable C 130). I was on duty at four o'clock, in Regent-street - I saw Ward against the rails of the area - he put his hands on the rails and attempted to get over - I caught him - I looked over and saw Bagster sitting in the area with this basket of wine by his side - I called to my serjeant, who got over and took him, and this wine, which was about two yards from the cellar door - Ward's hat was in the area - Bagster did not appear in liquor.</p>

             (police-serjeant C 7). I found Bagster in the area, sitting down - I should not consider that he was drunk - this basket, containing five bottles of wine, was by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040031"></xptr>his side - he said his friedn's hat had fallen over, and he had tumbled in getting it - his arm was dreadfully swollen.</p>
               <p>Bagster's Defence. I had been drinking with Ward all the evening, and when we got to Regent-street, Ward and I were larking - I knocked his hat over; I went to get it, and fell over.</p>
               <p>Ward's Defence. He knocked my hat over, and in trying to get it he fell from the top to the bottom. The goblet is bent where he fell upon it.</p>

On the 2d of July, about seven o'clock, I shut up my shop, and returned between nine and ten - I then tried the door; it was safe. I unlocked it to go in, and heard a noise inside the shop; it was then dark. I unbolted the door, and opened it about a foot, and hearing a noise in the shop I immediately pulled it too, and somebody inside tried to pull it open, and forced the latch of the door out of my hand - three men rushed out of the shop - one ran towards the Minories, and two down Princes-street, which is nearly opposite my house. I followed them as quick as possible; some persons got before me, and pursued the prisoner; I cannot positively swear that he is one of those who came out of the shop. He said that was what he got by running after the thief. Upon going into my shop I found I had lost nothing, but the goods stated in the indictment were taken off the shelves, and put into sacks, ready to be carried away. The property is worth 9 l. or 10 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. You could not identify the prisoner - A. No. I locked the door when I went out.</p>

               <p>JAMES RICHARDSON. I live next door to Harris. About a quarter before ten o'clock at night, I was knocking some nails into the ceiling of my shop, and heard a voice say,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake come and help me; here are thieves in the house." I ran to the door, and saw two men run from the pavement across the road, and up Princes-street - I followed, and never lost sight of them till I secured the prisoner; I did not see him come out of the door - he is one of the two who ran from the pavement; other people were pursuing behind me, but I was first. He asked what I took him for; I said,</p>
               <p>"For breaking into Harris's house," and at that time Harris and some neighbours came up, and took him from me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You could not tell whether anybody ran before you got out - A. No.</p>

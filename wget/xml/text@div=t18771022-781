                  </hi>. I live at 12, Tufton Street, Westminster—on Friday, the 14th September, I put up the shop shutter as usual before going to bed, between 9 and 9.30—the shutter is fastened by a bar, which can be lifted up by anybody, and a bolt—in the night I heard a noise, as of the breaking of glass—I did not get up—I was sleeping in the room behind the shop—shortly afterwards policeman Beecham called me up, when I found the bar removed, the shutter down, and a pane of glass broken and six pairs of boots and two pairs of soles missing—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of those which were taken from my shop that night.</p>

I was on duty in Great St. Peter's Street on the morning in question, about three or four minutes' walk from the prosecutor's—I saw the prisoner, who passed me, and I followed him back—I saw something at his side, and I asked him what he had, and he dropped a pair of boots—this is one of the pairs before me—I saw another boot hanging down, which I took from him and took him to the station—when I got there I found three other pairs and two pairs of soles on him—he said a man gave them to him to carry—it was about 2.20 when we got to the station—on my way back, after I had taken him to the station, I met the prosecutor coming to the station.</p>

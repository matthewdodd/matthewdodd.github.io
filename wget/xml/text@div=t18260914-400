On the 21st of August I was coming up from the kitchen to the shop, to speak to my master, and saw the prisoner in the shop, in the act of taking a piece of cloth; I asked the foreman if he had given a piece of cloth to any body - he said No; I pursued the prisoner, who had the cloth in his possession; I saw him stopped, without losing sight of him, and saw him throw it away - I took it up, and the foreman took him, in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PRENDERGAST. Q. What time was this? A. A quarter past eight o'clock; our shop door was shut, but not locked.</p>

            . On the 21st of August I was foreman to George Noah. I heard a man had run away with a piece of cloth; I followed, and saw the prisoner was carrying it in a way to conceal it. I saw him throw it away; the porter took it up; I took the prisoner at the corner - the cloth is worth 18l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you? A. I was gone up to the workshop - when I came down the porter gave me information. I did not see the prisoner in the shop - when I first saw him he was turning the corner of Crown-court, about forty yards off, walking briskly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you seen the cloth that day? A. Yes - I had been cutting it a quarter of an hour before. The shop is a part of the dwelling-house - it is under the first floor.</p>

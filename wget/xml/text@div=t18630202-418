BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you go to Somers-town? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoners both rode on the cart to Somers-town, and I rode in front with the other man, who helped to load the cart—I asked them what port of Somers-town they would like to go to, and they told me to pull up at the first public-house—I don't know who said that—when we got there we all four went into the public-house—we were there two or three minutes, and then it was suggested that Goude should go out and sell the potatoes—he went out, came back in about a quarter of an hour, and said he was as far off as ever, and he was afraid ht should have to take them to Blackfriars-road—Callan then went out, and in about a quarter of an hour returned, and said he thought he had sold them—I was to go up the second turning on the right in the Euston-road—I went there with the cart—they followed me, walking on the pavement—when I got to the corner of a court, a young man came out and looked at them—he said be would buy them, only he was full, and directed them to go and see Mr. Hummerston, who lived in Chapel-street, Somers-town, directly opposite—Callan went there, and was followed by the other one—I stopped where I was—they came back with Mr. Hummerston, who got on the cart and looked at the potatoes—he said he would give 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton if they were all through alike—Goude said to Callan, "Shall we?"—Callan gave a nod, and as Mr. Hummerston was walking away, Goude halloed out, "Very well, you shall have them"—the potatoes were then taken into Mr. Hummerston's shop, and shot into other sacks—I then took the empty sacks put them in the cart, and took them to the corner of Ulster-street, Euston-road—Mr. Hummerston has two shops, one on the right, and one on the left, about twenty yards down the street—it was on the right—hand side that the potatoes were taken in—I saw Goude come out of the other shop, with the money in his hand—I could not swear what the money was—Callan walked on before the cart, and we met him at the top of Chapel-street—it was after that, they <hi rend="italic">got</hi> in the cart and went to the Euston-road—we all went into a public-house together there—one of them called for a pot of beer—I stood against the counter to drink, and on my turning round, Goude said to the other <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>, who had been employed by Callan, "I with you would go out of our company for a few minutes; when we have done our business we will attend to you"'—the young man came along with me, and seemed somewhat out of temper about it—I then saw Goude and Callan pass money from one to the other—they stopped in the bar, but we did not keep close to them; we drew on one side—after they had done that, Mr. Goude asked me what was my fare—I him it was above three hours and a half there, and against I got home it would be four hours, which would be 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—there was a little argument whether they should pay me back carriage, and Goude said, "Oh, yes, that is all right," and they paid me—Goude gave me three shillings and sixpence; sixpence for myself—Callan was going to pay me, but said he had got no change, and asked Goude to lend him some—Goude said, "You have got money," and would not—he then changed a sovereign, and paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. too—I was then going to leave, and Callan said, if any one asked me what I had done with the potatoes, I was to say that I had loaded then into another van—I said, "Well, I don't know what I shall say; if there is anything wrong, I shall be brought into the mess as well as you"—Goude stood alongside, and said, "It is nothing wrong; only a little on the quiet"—knowing Callan to be a porter at Farringdon-market, I asked him if he was going there then—he said, "No"—I took the sacks out of the cart, and left</p>

               <p>them there—I afterwards saw Callan at the justice-room—he called me out there, and told me if I would say that he had no transaction with the money, I should not be lost—I made him no reply, but went and told the prosecutor there and then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long did your cart stand at the corner of Stone-cutter—street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Long enough for two men to carry in fourteen sacks of potatoes—I should say five minutes—I did not hear anything at Lomas's about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being paid for the potatoes—I saw a sovereign thrown on a beer barrel by Goude, at the public-house—I am sure it was not a shilling—when I got home I told the <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi> what I had seen—I had barely got home when the prosecutor and another man came inquiring about the potatoes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potato salesman and dealer, carrying on business in Chapel-street, Some-town—I have two shoe there—on 23d January, I believe, I saw both the prisoners in company with the witness who has been examined—I should say it was about 11, or shortly afterwards—they came to my shed, and asked me if I wanted to buy fourteen sacks of potatoes—I said I did not care about them; I had plenty by me—I called a friend of mine, in the same trade, and told him a man had got fourteen sacks of potatoes for sale—he went to look at them, said they were very small, and asked me to go and look at them, which I did—before that I put some questions to the prisoners about where the potatoes had come from, and Goude said he had them sent by a friend of his out of Kent, and, king the first lot that he ever had, he did not know where to sell them—I give Goude four guineas for them—the other man was not present at the time I gave him the money.</p>

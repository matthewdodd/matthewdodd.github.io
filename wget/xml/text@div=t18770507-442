                  </hi>. I live at 6, Hay's Court, Glasshouse Street, White-chapel—on Saturday night, 31st March, about 7 p.m., I saw the prisoner in a cart with another man, passing down Cable Street, at about 6 or 7 miles an hour—I held up my hands to him, as I saw a child in the road, and hallooed out three times to the prisoner, and at the same time attempted to save the child, but the cart was going two quick for me to do so—the horse escaped the child, but the wheel caught it and threw it on its face, and the wheel passed over its back—I picked it up—I saw nothing in front of the prisoner's cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 49, Prescott Street—on Saturday night, 31st May, I was in Cable Street, and saw the prisoner driving at a smart trot, 6 or 7 miles an hour, and smoking a short pipe—I saw a child crossing the road, I hallooed to the prisoner, but he did not slacken his speed that I saw—the horse passed the child, but the right wheel caught the child and it fell on its face, and the wheel went over it—there was a clear road in front of the prisoner, but there were barrows on each side of the street—there was sufficient space in the road for two vehicles to pass—the barrows did not take up more than 3 feet of the road, and there were spaces between them where the child might be.</p>

On Saturday night, 31st March, I saw the prisoner driving a cart in Cable Street very quickly, and as soon as he passed me I heard screams and saw a little white—headed boy roll under the cart—the prisoner drove on and took no notice—I took the child to a doctor who said that he was dying fast.</p>

On the 12th of June, Doyle came to me in the morning about ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070038"></xptr> o'clock; he said he wanted two saddlehorses for a gentleman; he said I do not know whether you recollect me or not; I formerly lived with Lord Molesworth, but I now live with a gentleman of the name of Murray. I then recollected him very well. I said I had a saddle-horse out of town, I would send for him home; he asked when he could see him; he appointed to come on Monday; he came on Monday and asked if the horses were come home; I said they were not; he said it does not signify, you have some fine horses here that will do, and said the gentleman will be here presently, that he had left him at the Hotel, and he desired me to tell the gentleman that he was gone to Lambeth. About seven o'clock Mr. Murray came into the yard, walked by me, and asked my man for Mr. Spencer; he told him I was there; he came to me, and said he wanted to buy some saddle-horses; I said your name is Murray; he said it was; he desired to look at some horses in the stable; he looked at one that was lame, then he looked at another which I recommended to him very strongly; he said he should want another saddle and two phaeton horses; he asked if he would go quietly with the saddle on, and desired I would put one on; I bid my man put the saddle on; he did and the prisoner rode the horse out of the gate; I was surprised he rode out of the gate without asking my leave. I desired my man to get on a horse and ride after him; he did, but missed of him. The prisoner returned, and said he went very gently, did I know whether he would go quietly among carriages; I said I did not know; he then desired me to let him ride it in the street; I said he might; I desired my man to get a horse and ride after him, but not to keep too close to him. My servant returned and said he had missed the gentleman with the horse. The prisoner not returning, I went to Lord Molesworth's to enquire his character, and heard a very bad character of him. I went the same evening to Sir

               <p>I am a Marshalsea-Court officer. I arrested M'Kenzie on the 14th of June, in the name of Brett; and Doyle, in the name of Villers; I then took them to a lock-up house in Wych-street; they desired me to let my man go for one Morris.</p>
               <p>Which of them desired you to let your man go for Morris? - M'Kenzie; I said he might go; but he could not be bad for him, as he lived in the city; I left them; when I returned, I found Morris and the prisoner together; Morris asked what the debts were; I told him, one was 8 l. 11 s. the other 7 l. 8 s. he said they were about agreeing for a horse, would I take his word for Brett's coming back again? I told him, no; I would not take any man's word; if he would leave the money, I would deliver it when he came back; he did not know he said whether he had so much; he pulled out seven guineas, and asked me to trust him the rest; I said I would; he then said let Captain Brett go with me, because he has a horse I am about agreeing for.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - Half after six or seven o'clock; they went out, and Morris returned in about an hour; I asked if they had agreed; he said he believed they had; and in about a quarter of an hour M'Kenzie came back on horseback; Morris went out and spoke to him, and then said he would come back and pay me the rest of the money; I went out about some business; I returned about nine o'clock; and then the person I had left them in the custody of was giving them a receipt for the money for me; he gave me the money, and they were discharged; M'Kenzie said, that he had a horse of his own, that he bought of a person in the King's-Bench; and that if he had been on the horse, I should not have arrested him, for the horse, would have plunged at me.</p>
               <p>M'Kenzie. Do you know that I sold the horse? - I do not know; Morris said he had agreed for the horse.</p>

               <p>I have not much to say, further than that I did not sell the horse; I went to Mr. Spencer and asked to look at some horses; I had a horse of Mr. Spencer; it was by his approbation I rode it; I took the horse to Mr. Morris, and left it for 17 l. to redeem this man from the spunging house. I never sold the horse; when it was advertised, I sent to the man to send the horse; I thought to redeem it; he said he could not send the horse, for that he had disfigured it; he had cut his ears off.</p>

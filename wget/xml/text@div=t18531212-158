                  </hi>. I live in New-street, Lambeth; it is my dwelling house. I was there on the 17th July—between 3 and 4 o'clock that morning, I heard a noise at the street door—I looked out at the window, and saw the prisoner going down the street with my clothes on—I knew him, he had lodged with me previously—he was going in a direction from my house—he was about fifteen houses off—the houses lie very close, they I are small houses—when I looked out he looked round, and I saw his face—he had a bundle under his arm, and an umbrella in his right hand—I put on my trowsers, and ran down the street—I did not see the prisoner, but I saw a constable—it was quite light, broad day light on Sunday morning—my house is a corner house—there is a fence to it, about nine feet high—when I came down, I found the street door wide open—the drawers in the front parlour were wide open, and the back door wide open which leads into the yard—any one could get over the fence into the yard—I found a mark on the fence where some one had got over, but nothing was broken—I had gone to bed last on the night before, a little after 12 o'clock—I fastened the street door myself—I am positive the back door was latched, but I cannot say whether it was bolted—the street door must have been opened from the inside, because the bolts were undone—I missed a black coat, a pair of trowsers, and the other articles mentioned—they had been in the drawers in the front room on the night before—I have a very sharp dog who would bark at a stranger, but he knew the prisoner well—I afterwards heard that the prisoner was loitering about the workhouse—I got an officer, and gave him in charge—I charged him with stealing the clothes, he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 82). I was on duty on the morning of the 17th July, between 3 and 4 o'clock—the prisoner passed me as I was standing at tie corner of the street, where the last witness lives—he was dressed very respectably, and had an umbrella in his hand and a small bundle—soon afterwards the prosecutor came down the street, with only his trowsers on—I went with him after the prisoner, but could not see him—I could not positively swear that the prisoner is the man—I believe him to be the man.</p>

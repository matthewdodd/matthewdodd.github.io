               <p>I was a watchman the time I took this man, I took him on Monday morning the 6th of May; I found him in a garden belonging to <placeName id="t17930529-70-crimeloc389">Bagnigge Wells</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see it in his hands? - No, I did not, it lay close by the side of him as he lay down in the inside.</p>
               <p>Thorley. It was an old iron door frame, that lay by as old iron, it was left about four or five yards from the place where it was found with the prisoner; my father keeps Bagnigge Wells; it was laying against a fence in a yard where we keep lumber in, on the other side of the ground.</p>
               <p>Q Can you say for certain where it lay? - If what the watchman says is true, it was found four or five yards from where it was left.</p>

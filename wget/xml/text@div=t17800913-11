On the 16th of August I had been to fetch Mrs. Gray, and three of my daughters from Sadler's Wells. From the city road turnpike there is a footpath goes across the fields to <placeName id="t17800913-11-crimeloc65">Hoxton</placeName>

I was a little before Mrs. Gray, I had passed three people who were standing at the rails, as we were getting over; I said I have got very little cash about me. The man put his right knee under my left ham, and bent me back, and then I felt my watch pulled out of my pocket very plain.</p>
               <p>Was there more than one person attacked you? - I was blind and could not see who did it, but when I got my eye-sight again, by his taking the handkerchief off, I saw there was but one man. He had then got fifteen or perhaps twenty yards off; then he ran and I ran after him. My daughter ran to the city road and cried out thieves and murder ! When I saw my children standing upon their legs, and none seemingly hurt, I ran after him and cried Stop thief too; he was never out of my fight till he was taken. It was a very bright moon-light night. There were people walking about, so that many people came about soon. He ran the same way we had come.</p>
               <p>Is that the man? - The prisoner is the man I am sure. I never found my watch again; they were pulling him one way and another, to search for fire-arms, but they found none upon him I believe.</p>
               <p>When you first got your eye-sight, was there any other man near you than the man you saw running away? - No other. I saw two men running at two hundred yards distance, I suppose. I had seen three people standing together at the rails as we got over.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice enough of him to know whether he was one of them? - No, and if he had ever been out of my sight I should not have known him again.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with Mr. Petit's daughters to Sadler's Wells. Mr. Petit came to us to see us home. We had just got a little below the city turnpike; we went into the field; three men followed us over the stile. Mr. Petit's eldest daughter who had hold of my arm, said she did not like those three men. The next thing I saw was, the prisoner clapped an handkerchief over Mr. Petit's face, and held it behind him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner? - I am positive to him; he said curse and d - n your blood, if you speak or mention another word you are a dead man. I went up and took him by the collar. I said, curse you, you are not going to kill the man. He got from me and ran over the field into the road, there I saw two men get hold of him, but I never lost sight of him. I did not see him take the watch.</p>
               <p>How long might this be about? - I do not believe they were together two minutes.</p>
               <p>Suppose he had not been taken then had you observed him sufficiently to be sure he was the man? - If I had seen him among forty others afterwards, if he had not been taken at the time, I could have sworn to him. It was very light, and when I laid hold of him I turned him fairly round.</p>
               <p>Had he the same clothes on then which he has now? - He had the same coat and waistcoat on, but his hair was more tumbled down, it was not so well put up then as it is now.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - About ten o'clock.</p>

               <p>As I was coming from Sadler's Wells, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw many people run; I ran likewise, and being nearly at the head of the mob, the people who ran said, Which way did he go? I said I do not know. I did not see him run; I did not see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178009130010"></xptr> the man at all. Some people who were a-head, laid hold of me and said, I suppose this is the man. They held me till these people came up; the woman directly said, that is the man! that is the man! They searched me and took me to the watch-house. I never saw the watch nor the man neither. They searched me again at the watch-house to see if they could find arms or watch about me, but they found none.</p>

               <p>- WELCH sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a statuary. I have known the prisoner nearly four years; he always behaved himself extremely well towards me. I have employed him many times to receive considerable sums of money for me, and always found him a faithful, diligent <rs id="t17800913-11-deflabel66" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Have you that good opinion of him that if he was discharged from hence you would take him into your service again? - I would notwithstanding all I have heard; he may have been drawn in by those who have more cunning and less courage than himself.</p>

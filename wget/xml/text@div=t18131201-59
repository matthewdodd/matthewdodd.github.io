I lost six table spoons, four silver forks, and a gold watch belonging to my wife. I left the prisoner in charge of my house. On the 26th of July I went into the country, and returned to London on the 30th. It appears there was something taken then. I returned to London again on the 13th of November, on hearing from my servant that the watch was gone. At that time the prisoner was in my service.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. I live at No. 12, Fleet-street. On the 9th of November the prisoner came to my shop, and offered a gold watch to pledge; she asked 5 l. upon it. I asked her whose it was; she said, her own, and she should redeem it very shortly. I told her I was convinced that was not the truth, and if she would really tell the truth it would save her a great deal of trouble, and save her character. Much conversation then took place, she hesitating to tell me, and I pressing her to tell where she got it from. When she walked into the parlour, she confessed that she was a servant to Dr. Jones; that she had taken it out of a drawer in Doctor Jones's house, and meant to replace it, and if I would give it her back again she would go and do that immediately. She would not tell me where I could see Dr. Jones. She told me where he lived; he was out of town, and she had not the key of the house; there was nobody in it. As I could not find out Dr. Jones's, I sent for an officer. She was taken before a magistrate. I know nothing of the other things.</p>

I took them in of a woman; I cannot swear to the woman; and on the 12th of October my fellow shopman took in four silver forks and two silver table spoons; he lent 4 l. upon them.

            . I am an officer. I was sent for at Mr. Harrison's to take the prisoner in custody. On my asking her what things were taken out of her master's house, she admitted she had taken some spoons, the duplicates were in the kitchen. The duplicates of four forks and two spoons, and four table spoons, were found by her direction. These are the duplicates.</p>

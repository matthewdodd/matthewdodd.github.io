            . I happened to be out pretty late, and was locked out of my Lodging, so I went to the Watch-House thinking to stay there all Night; but a Brick-maker took me down to a Night House where I picked up the Prisoner. The Brick-maker got him a Woman, and we all went up Stairs, but they left me and the Prisoner alone together. I paid 6 d. for my Bed, and the Prisoner lay with me; and we had not been a bed long before she wanted a quartern of Gin; I put my Hand into my Pocket to pay for it, and then my Money was safe. When she had drank the Gin, she got up and bolted the Door, and I being weary fell asleep, and when I waked my Money was gone and she too. I met her 2 or 3 Days afterwards in Bond Street, and asked her about the Money. I had a Crown in my Pocket when I went up Stairs with her, which my Father left me, and I desired her to let me have that, and I would let her go, but she said she only had the other Money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He came into the House, and asked me to go to Bed with him, and I never saw a Farthing of his Money but what he gave me and that was 6 d. and no more. <rs id="t17410701-9-verdict41" type="verdictDescription">

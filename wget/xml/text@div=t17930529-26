               <p>I work at Mr. Cooper's, coal-dealer, No. 15, Great Shire-lane; I was in my master's shop on Saturday evening about six o'clock; I heard an outcry of stop thief! I looked out and saw a great many people coming up, and a young man came up before me; there was a young man attempted to stop him, and I saw the prisoner push him down; he was meeting him; then I jumped out of the shop, catched the prisoner by the collar and stopped him, and then took him to Mr. Akerman's in Butcher-row, and they kept him till the constable was sent for.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You took him and delivered him to a constable; you found nothing on him? - Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. He ran against the man that you described, and the man ran against him? - The man wanted to catch hold of him, and he shoved him down.</p>

            's in Butcher-row; Brace gave charge of him, with feloniously breaking into his apartments; I took the prisoner up stairs into his apartments and searched him, and found nothing but one small key and three pennyworth of halfpence; there was a pair of sheets folded up and a pair of boots lay on the top of them, and the beds were turned down.</p>
               <p>Court to Brace. How many beds were there in the room? - Two.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the sheets on the bed in the common way when you left the room? - They were; the beds were regularly made; when I returned, I came home and I looked at the prisoner in the lower part of the house, and then went up stairs, and found each of the beds turned down from the blankets, and there was a pair of sheets lay on a heap on my own bed, and the boots which lay in the side of the room were put on them; when I went out they were on a box, on the side of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not leave them on the sheets? - I am clear I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Whether the sheets were removed or the boots while you was out you don't know? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this is a capital charge that will affect the man's life? - On my oath I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not learned it since you came into this court? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard that there is a forty pounds reward on the conviction of house breakers? - I have heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that if this man is convicted you will be entitled to a proportion of it? - I am not throughly acquainted with the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard that there is a forty pounds reward, and that people that give their evidence are entitled to a share of it; if this man is convicted don't you know that you will be entitled to share in the reward? - I don't wish to look after my property in such a light; I don't know I should be entitled to it.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean then to take any share in this reward? - I don't wish to get my bread in this line.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290048"></xptr>Q. If this man is convicted do you mean to refuse to take any share of it? - Sir, I have not come here with that view.</p>
               <p>Q. That is any thing but an answer. Do you mean to refuse your share in the reward if this man is convicted? - Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you understand me? - I have not come hear with that view.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have an answer before I have done? - I don't think I should take it; nor I am sure I should not; I don't come with that view; I thank God I think I can do without it; I don't want any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You come hear then purely for the sake of justice? - I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp to the Constable. It was a small key you found on the prisoner? - It was. There were two other keys in the room, and a screw driver, one of which opened the door very well, and which a person in the room observed the prisoner endeavouring to put into his pocket; this person was in the room when I went up.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first find the prisoner? - In the shop below stairs; I took him and led him up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How many keys had that man of him? - Two, one of which unlocked the door perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation between the prisoner and that man about the keys? - Not in my presence. The prisoner denied knowing any thing about them when I asked him to his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it appeared that this other had keys about him, one of which opened the door, and which he talked about to the prisoner, and the prisoner denied knowing any thing about them? - He did. The person at Bow-street declared on oath that he had the keys of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a man in the house had a pair of boots of mine to sole and heel, he lodged in the garret; I went up to see if they were done, just as I came to the landing place I saw a man run out, and the woman after him, he ran down Shire-lane, and the woman after him; I was there after him to see what it was, and just as I got to the coal shed the man came and took hold of me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

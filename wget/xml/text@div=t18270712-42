            . I took the cheque to Messrs. Harvey's, and received a 10l. and a 5l. Bank note, two sovereigns, and 10s., which I brought home, and put into the table-drawer. William Walters keeps the house, and lives there. The prisoner lodged on the same floor as us, and saw me put the notes away; we went out together that morning, by appointment, and when we got into Bunhill-row I had forgotten a small parcel, and, having my child with me, I asked the prisoner to go back for it, while I minded her little girl - this was between ten and eleven o'clock; she returned in ten minutes, and we went home together about five o'clock in the evening; I then expected to find the change of the notes in the drawer, as I had left them there for my husband to get change; I went to the drawer - none of the money was there, and I thought he had got it. When he came home, at eight o'clock, I found they were stolen. The prisoner had gone out about six o'clock - she returned about nine, and we said we had lost the notes - she only laughed at it; my husband got the street-keeper, but we did not like to give her in charge, and it rested till the 4th of May, when I saw the 10l. note, and knew it to be the same, by the number, which I got from Mr. Harvey. We could not find the prisoner for a month afterwards; she had left the house about a fortnight after the robbery; she had four examinations, and was then bailed - she has now surrendered.</p>

            . My husband keeps this house. The prosecutrix and the prisoner went, out together on the 7th of April - the prisoner came back in about five minutes, and was only up-stairs long enough to take a parcel and come down again - she went away a fortnight afterwards; I did not see her with more money than common, or with new clothes. She paid me two sovereigns on the Tuesday - the note had been changed on the Monday; I had never seen her with so much money before. She said the gentleman she lived with had given it her.</p>

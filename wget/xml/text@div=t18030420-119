A little before eight o'clock in the same evening, he returned, and gave me some information; I took him up to the Public Office, Bow-street, and gave what information I could to the officers; I asked him to go with me, he did not require any compulsion, because I did not tell him where I was going; the rest of the information the officers can tell you better than I can. That same evening there were seven pair of the same shoes found; I saw them taken from the prisoners, part of them, I believe two or three pair were taken from the prisoners, and one pair taken off their feet, it was Gent. I saw the others at the Brown Bear, where the prisoners were locked up; I saw one pair taken from Owen, that is all that I recollect at present.</p>

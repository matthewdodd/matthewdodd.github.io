             sworn.</p>
               <p>Between the last of May and the first of June, about half after one in the night, I was going out on some family business for my master, and I met with this unfortunate prisoner and she asked me to treat her, which I did.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - To the best of my knowledge I never saw her; I met her a little on this side a place called New-gravel-lane; she asked me to give her something to drink, and it being late, I took pity on her, and gave her something to drink; I took her to a public house, and we had each a glass of gin, and then we went out of the public house; I paid for the gin; we went on together for a good way, till we came to the place called the <placeName id="t17880625-1-crimeloc3">Match-walk</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17880625-1-crimeloc3" type="placeName" value="Match-walk"></interp>

                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y" targets="t17880625-1-off1 t17880625-1-crimeloc3"></join>; then she seemed to stop me, by way of crossing me; I seeing her a stout, sturdy body, being late in the evening, I did not date to refuse her; there were little or few words; what passed I cannot, in conscience, mention, but she stopped me, and untied my apron, then she took off my bonnet, then she rifled both my pockets; I do not know whether she rifled my right or left pocket first.</p>
               <p>What did she take from your pocket? - As near as conscience will give me leave to speak, about 14 d. I then went home; I was in hopes to find her on Monday; I am but a poor woman; I could put nothing in force against her; I went back from her; I could not go any further with her; I was going to London-street with her; I cannot recollect the words-that were said; I think I told her I was a Welch woman, and she was going to rob me; to the best of my knowledge, I never saw her before; I can give but little account, but I think she seemed rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>How came you to go along with a strange woman to give her gin? - I did it out of pity.</p>
               <p>There was no pity in giving a drunken woman gin you know? - There are two apprentices in the family where I live, and they had had words and were gone out; one was a resolute boy, and I went in search of him; the apprentice boy was brother to my master.</p>
               <p>Was your master at home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you taken any steps to find this woman? - I had searched at several places; I only wanted my property of her; I found her at one Mr. Anderson's, a public house by Smithfield; I do not know the sign; when I saw her there, I did not know her immediately; when I went in, on her speaking, I immediately knew her voice; I said, you took my property; she turned about, and said, me, Madam; I said, yes, my dear, you to be sure; I went to get a watchman; when he stopped her, she attempted to run away, but he took her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>What time was it that you took her? - About half past ten in the evening; she said charge for charge, which I did not understand then; the officer of the night detained me two nights and a day with her in the watch-house; I was taken before the justice; there I gave the same account as I have here, and she was committed to prison; I am sure as far as conscience will permit me to speak, it is the same person.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure of it? - I am sure it is the same person that took the things from me in Match-walk; when first I saw her, when I took her, her back was towards me; I did not know her, but by her voice; but when she looked over her shoulder, I knew her.</p>
               <p>Was you quite sober when you came out of the public house? - I was quite sober, and quite sensible; I would not belie my conscience for the world; I had drank a little in the course of the day, but nothing to hurt me; I was truly sensible of what I was doing; I cannot recollect any words she said when she took the things; she was a strapping sturdy body to me; and I am rather of a faint spirit; and there was nobody in the street that I could see.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Am I the person that took your property? - Yes, my dear, you are.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178806250004"></xptr>Oh! do not say it? - Yes, but I will fly it.</p>

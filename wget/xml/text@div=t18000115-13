             sworn. - On Friday, I think, the 20th of December, between four and five in the evening, I was upon the watch, in <placeName id="t18000115-13-crimeloc68">Newgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been in the hospital five months; I was going to Snow-hill, and a man offered to give me a shilling to carry it to Jewin-street, and when I got into St. Bartholomew's-hospital, I was stopped with it; I had not had a bit of bread in my lips from the Wednesday till I was taken to the Compter on the Friday, and then only a three-penny loaf for myself, my wife, and three small children.</p>

On Friday the 28th of January, I sold this pig which the prisoner is indicted for, to a person that keeps a cook's shop in Fetter-lane; it was a particularly poor pig.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it paid for? - No; I do not suppose there was such another pig to be found in the market; I do not know how many pigs Mrs. King had in her shop; I observed it as soon as the man who bought it asked the price of it; it was what they call a beat out pig, it was brown and very thin; the bones were slit very even; I suspected the prisoner, having seen him walk by the shop that morning, and when I lost the pig, I said, I remember that red-headed man went by; I went to the prisoner's house, I afterwards saw the pig at Clerkenwell; I was sure it was the same by the cleaving of the bones and the skin; the prisoner seemed very much agitated, and begged of me to let him go, and he would never do so again; I told him we had lost several; he said, he would not mind paying for all the pigs we had lost; and before the Justice, he owned the fact; he said it was the first thing that ever he did; he was taken up on the Friday; but at a further examination on the Monday, he did not own it; but said he bought it of a countryman.</p>

               <p>Court. What words did he use the first time? - He said, please your worship, I did take this pig, but I never did any thing before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told them the pig they took from me, was a casualty pig; I did not know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230140"></xptr> they took me for thieving; I thought they took me for a casualty.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you very sure he said he took the pig? - I am very sure.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the pig? - It was sold for fifteen shillings and two-pence, that is the worth of it.</p>

               <p>The morning this pig was stolen, I took it out of a cloth, and hung it up at the door; it was a remarkable brown skin pig, dark in flesh; it was not cleaved down as it should be, and the bones of it were yellow; it was a very remarkable pig, I never saw one like it, though I have seen many thousands; I went out and left nobody in the shop; and while I was gone the pig was gone; I went with Prevost to the prisoner's house, in Pear-tree Court, Clerkenwell, and he was cutting up the pig; I looked through the window, and saw him cutting up the pig, and I made an expression that was not fit to be heard, and I said this is the pig; and he said, Lord have mercy upon me, what have I done! he then offered me a guinea to let him off; he would give me any thing; I told him it was not in my power; I left my fellow servant with him, and went home; I examined the pig, I am sure it is the same, though one side was cut, the other side was quartered, and I took a quarter of it from behind the bedstead; I was present when he went before the Justice, and he there owned he took the pig from the shop of the widow King, and begged for mercy; on the Monday, he said he bought the pig for nine shillings.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher, my fellow servant and I went out with a side of beef, we first put the pig into the shop, and laid it on a hamper, this was about half past eight in the morning; while we were gone, the pig was gone, and we looked for it; it was a pig very dark in the flesh, and rough skinned, and poor; I could distinguish it: I went after it was lost, with my fellow servant to the prisoner's house, and found him cutting it up, he had the chopper in his hand; he was left in my custody, and before the Justice, on the Friday he owned to it, and on the Monday he said he bought it of a man at the Bell Inn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask that witness my character? - He worked with me two or three winters in the Victualling Office, and behaved very well.</p>

               <p>I live in Aldersgate-street, I am a bricklayer by trade.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you keep a house? - No, I only keep a room.</p>
               <p>Who do you work with now? - I did work for Mr. Gray last, in Wilderness-row: on Friday last was a month, the 28th of January, I believe it was; I was at Cheapside looking for a job, coming back from there, in Newgate-street, between seven and eight, I saw the prisoner talking to a bricklayer's labourer; I asked him after his brother, who worked with me, I told him I was going to Warwick Lane, he said he was going to Newgate-market; I went along with him, we went into the Bell, and had a pint of purl, coming out of the Bell he and I together, and I was going away, we saw a country-man with some pork, and a basket; he says to me, says he, that is casualty pork, which I never knew what casualty pork was before.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by casualty pork? - I do not know, it was very poor pork, and the rind on the outside of it was quite red, it seemed as if it died; he asked the man if he had bought it, the man made answer no, he had brought it to town for sale; he asked him what he would have for it, and he would buy it, accordingly he asked him sixteen shillings for it, he offered him fourteen shillings; after some words, he bought the pig for fourteen shillings and six-pence, and paid the money, half a guinea, and the remainder in silver; the pork he and the man took out of the basket, and put on his shoulder, it was in four quarters, and he took it away; I saw no more of him till his brother found me out.</p>
               <p>Describe the pork that he bought particularly? - The rind of it, the outside skin of it, was red as blood.</p>
               <p>Was it rather a sattish pig? - No, a very poor pig, it was in four quarters.</p>
               <p>Do you know where he lives? - I do now, I did not then; I did not see it weighed.</p>
               <p>Court to Simons. When you saw the pork at this man's house, describe in what condition it was? - There was one side in two quarters, and he was cutting up the other in different joints.</p>
               <p>Court to Haywood. In what condition did you find this pig? - One side was cut up more like mutton, the other side was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230143"></xptr> quarters, and one quarter I took from behind the bed.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called another witness who gave him a good character.</p>

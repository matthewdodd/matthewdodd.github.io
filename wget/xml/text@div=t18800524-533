                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of 1, Lancaster Place, Strand—my father was Mr. Keogh's solicitor in the action referred to—I was present at Judges' Chambers on 23rd March, when the summons was heard by Justice Hawkins—it was taken out by the defendant to set aside the order of Mr. Justice Denman—previous to that affidavits had been filed on both sides—I heard Mr. Keogh examined and Mr. Saunders, his clerk, and Dr. Steele—the defendant was present, and both plaintiff and defendant were represented by Counsel—after those gentlemen had been examined, the prisoner was sworn—I saw the oath administered to him, and the Judge directed me to take notes of the evidence he gave—this is only a copy of my notes; the original was made on an affidavit which I had to file in Chancery—speaking from memory, the defendant swore over and over again that he served Mr. Keogh with the debtor summons on 8th December, 1879, in Pump Court, Temple—Mr. Keogh was pointed out, and His Lordship said, "Is that the gentleman you served on 8th December?"—he said that he was—His Lordship said, "Let there be no mistake, Mr. Keogh and the clerk and the doctor have sworn that he was ill at home on that day, are they speaking untruly?"—he said, "They are speaking untruly"—the Judge said, "You an quite sure of that?"—he said, "I am of that opinion"—the Judge said, "No, no, are they speaking untruly?"—he said, "They are speaking untruly, he is the gentleman I served on that day"—he also swore that he had seen him since that day in Castle Street; he thought on 27th December—he was asked, I believe, whether he knew him before, but I do not know whether he said he had seen him on 3rd November or not—a book was produced, which he admitted was his service-book, and he said that the second entry, "Keogh 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., balance 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," referred to Mr. Keogh, and the entry was made within an hour of his serving him—the Judge told him that there were several other witnesses ready who could swear that he was away at another place at the time; he was asked in re-examination whether he saw Mr. Keogh's clerk, when he went to serve him, and he said that the clerk said he was not in, but did not say that he was ill.</p>

               <p>prisoner; he was standing with Mr. Coleman, who was smoking a pipe, but I did not know who he was—at the time of my arrest I was not aware that the order of committal of 21st January, 1879, had been made—I was never served with any document by the prisoner—I paid the money and was released from custody—it is absolutely false that I was served person<lb></lb>ally on 8th December, 1879, with a copy of this judgment summons—I was not in the Temple at all on that day, I was in bed at my private residence, 9, West Kensington Gardens, having broken my left thigh—I first got out of bed on 1st January, six weeks and two days after the accident, and I was confined to the house till 31st January—Dr. Trevor set my leg, and Dr. Steele attended me—my clerk came to see me on the morning my leg was set, and I was in a very dangerous condition—I first heard of the judgment summons of 1st December some time in January—I think Mr. Coleman wrote—I knew I had not been served in a former instance, and then, know<lb></lb>ing that I had not been served again, I suspected some foul play, and gave directions to my solicitor, and a summons was taken out before Justice Hawkins to set aside Mr. Justice Denman's order—that was heard on 23rd March, and I gave evidence, and Dr. Steele and my clerk—I have heard Sir. Jones's statement; it is substantially correct—I have been upwards of 20 years at the bar, and am perfectly well known in the Temple.</p>

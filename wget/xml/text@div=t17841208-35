I saw no person but Simmons in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Council for Prisoners. Dame, how long have you lived in Mr. Powell's family? - Thirteen years.</p>
               <p>Now I remind you, you are upon your oath, and that the lives of these people are depending, take care to conceal nothing. - I have known Anderson twelve years, he has worked in his business.</p>
               <p>Have not you been very intimate with him? - I have not.</p>
               <p>How happened it that he was to dine at your father's on Sunday? - He said he had not seen the old folks a great while, and he would dine with them.</p>
               <p>Has the prisoner Anderson, in the absence of the family, slept in Mr. Powell's house? - He slept there the time the house was attempted before, he slept there with a pair of pistols loaded, and a blunderbuss; my master desired me to get an honest man.</p>
               <p>You say you did not see any of the persons that committed this robbery, except Simmons? - I think two more persons came in after the first, because I think I heard them talk.</p>
               <p>How soon after the robbery did you see Anderson? - He came about nine on that evening, and said he would sit up all night for the safety of the house, and sat there all night; at one o'clock in the morning we went round to see the state of the premises.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing in the course of that search? - Yes, I picked up a silver book in my progress through the house, in the India room.</p>
               <p>Anderson was there then? - Anderson took it out of my hand, and said he would have it, I said he should not; I can speak to it: I do not know what became of it after he had it, till the runners told me, I did not know he took it out of the house.</p>

               <p>Court to Davis. You have never found any of the articles of plate that were missing? - No, Sir.</p>

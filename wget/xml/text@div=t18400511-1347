                  </hi>. I am a cooper, and live at the Ten Bells public-house, Church-street, Spitalfields. On the 12th of April, about seven o'clock at night I was sitting in the tap-room; the prisoner came in partly tipsy, speak<lb></lb>ing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184005110029"></xptr>
               <p>loudly about what work he had been doing, that he had done nine days' work in one week—I said there were plenty of people came there to tell lies without any of his assistance; he took the poker from the fire-place, came to me, knocked the poker on the ground, and said if I would get up he would put my head on the ground, where the poker was—I made him no answer—he stood for a moment and put the poker back in the fire-place again—I went to another part of the room and sat down—after remaining there some time, he rose up, took the poker in his hand, and in about a minute and a half he came to me and said he would give it to me—I made no answer and took no notice; he directly afterwards struck me on the head with the poker, 1 fell forward on the table, stunned for a moment; when I recovered I shifted my hat from my head, and the blood come over my face—the waiter took me to a doctor's, where I had my head dressed—the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I was present and saw the prisoner come in—he began talking about making nine days in a week, being a tee-total<lb></lb>ler, and paying three weeks' rent in advance, and boasting in a foolish way—the prosecutor said, plenty of people told lies without his help—that excited him, he instantly went to the fire-place, took the poker, jobbed it several times on the ground, and said if Smith would get up he would put his head where the poker was—he afterwards put ft back, called for a pot of porter, which he drank, and in about ten minutes went and seized the poker again, approached Smith, told him he would give it to him, and immediately struck him a blow on the head—it was a sort of side cut—it was certainly done on purpose—he immediately threw the poker back and ran out as fast as he could—Smith pulled off his hat, and the blood ran down his face—he went to get his wound dressed—we gave information at the station-house, and the prisoner was taken at the Duke's-head public-house, within two or three doors of the station-house—he had been drink<lb></lb>ing when he came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. The prosecutor's wound was about an inch and a half, or two inches long, it was quite a clean cut—a blunt instrument on that part of the scalp would produce a clean cut, if given with sufficient violence—I should say it would require violence to inflict such a wound—I did not see his hat.</p>

I asked what brought me there—the police-man said, "For cutting a man's head with a poker." I was sorry for doing it, and when I saw the roan, I begged his pardon.</p>

            . On the 27th of March, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I went home. I could not get in, and was going to sleep with a man who was with me, and in <placeName id="t18240407-43-crimeloc243">Tothill-street</placeName>

The prisoner took my watch out of my pocket. I felt him take it - nobody else was near enough to do it. The others stopped behind - he instantly crossed the road. I gave an alarm, and the watchman stopped him about sixty yards off, without my losing sight of him. I do not know what became of the others. I suppose he let the watch fall, as I heard something fall ten or twelve yards from him - it sounded like the case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Were you sober - A. I was not tipsy, nor the worse for liquor. I left work between five and six o'clock, and might have been four hours at different public-houses, but drank very little. I had taken a walk after leaving work. I am a journeyman baker. I have seen the prisoner about Westminster several times before; the street is lighted with gas, and was very quiet; he did not turn any corner.</p>

            . I am a carman, and was with Drew. He could not get admittance, and was going to sleep with me. I saw the prisoner and two or three others, but he was rather before them, meeting us. He came up close to Drew, who immediately said,</p>
               <p>"The scoundrel has drawn my watch." We both ran after him, and were not above six yards behind him, and never lost sight of him. Cox stopped him. I thought I heard him throw the watch away. I returned to look for it - but his companions were looking for it, and I could not find it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many people were in the street - A. None except them. Drew looked at his watch four or five minutes before. I knew the prisoner before. We were both sober.</p>

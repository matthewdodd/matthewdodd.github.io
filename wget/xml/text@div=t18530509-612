The deceased, Eliza Lea, was my eldest daughter—she was in her twenty-sixth year—I know the prisoner well—he had lived with my daughter between five and six years—during that time they had separated four times—they had been separated the last time between five and six months before her death—on Sunday, 30th Jan. last, she came to my house as usual to dinner—the last time I saw her alive was at half-past 7 o'clock on Monday morning, the 31st—she slept at my house on Sunday night; it being a wet night I did not wish her to go home—she resided in Townsend-buildings, Portland-town; that is near St. John's-wood, on the other side of the Regent's-park—I went out to my work at 6 o'clock on Monday morning; but I came home at half-past 7 o'clock, to tell my wife that I should not be home to breakfast, and I then left my daughter at home,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the deceased—she was at my house on the Sunday before her death—she did not live with me, but at Portland-town—she supported herself by going out to work, ironing—she came to spend the day with me on Sunday—on the Monday morning I gave her a half-sovereign, to go to Tottenham-court-road, and get some merino out of pledge—it was intended for some dresses for two of my children—She was also to buy some lining, some buttons, and a reel of cotton—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some merino and other things produced by the officer</hi>)—this is what I ordered her to take out of pawn, and these are the things she was to get—I did not see the lining and other things until after her death—this is the merino I sent her for—it was in pawn for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I allowed her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for the lining and trimming, and if it cost more she was to pay it—there was the interest on the merino to pay; I do not exactly know how much that would be—it had been in pawn about eleven months—she would have about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the half-sovereign—I knew of her living with the prisoner for some years—the last time they separated was about five months before her death—she was usually in good spirits, and continued so after the separation—she was very happy when I sent her out; that was about half-past 9 o'clock on Monday morning—she said as she went out, "Mother, I shall be back in half an hour, pro vided I am not kept at the shop, or an hour at the outside"—she never returned, and I never saw her alive afterwards—I was in great fear and great trouble for fear the prisoner had met her—she was occasionally addicted to drink, by following this man—she was not in the habit of getting tipsy; she used to take a little when she was in company—I had not seen her tipsy lately before her death—she was in very good health in general—she was rather hysterical if she was a little upset—I did not observe anything at all different from her usual manner on the Monday morning when she went out; she was as happy, indeed more happy than I have been since her death.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you hear any groan? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot compare it to anything but a gurgling sound; it might have been a struggling to make some cry, she was evidently drowning fast—I should say the sound appeared to proceed from about the centre of the canal—I could not exactly distinguish the spot; they seemed to be bearing a little to the left of where I was standing, which was about the centre of the garden; it might hate been about the bottom of the passage, but she was taken out several feet from it—the footsteps I heard were coming from the canal up this passage towards Augustus-street—I should say I had been in the garden about a quarter of a minute before I heard the noise I speak of—the footsteps were as of a person running—I first heard the footsteps from the towing-path, close to the water; I should say a few feet from the place where I heard the gargling sound—I heard the gurgling sound first, then the splashing, then another gurgling, and then the footsteps; it was all done within the space of a minute—directly upon hearing the footsteps, I ran up the garden and through the house, to meet whoever it was at the top of the passage—I ran right through the house; I called out to Mr. Woolfe, "Woolfe, Woolfe! there is something the matter;" and continued running—Mr. Woolfe followed me through—I was out first; I met a man within three feet of the gate, at the top of the passage—the moment I met him I ran up against him, so whether he was walking or running I could not say—he stopped, and I ran up against him—he was dressed in a flannel jacket, and his trowsers might have been moleskin or corduroy, but they were much smothered with plaster—they were light—he had a white cap on his head—his jacket was white flannel.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185305090082"></xptr>
               <p>it was too dark to fee anybody in the water; we could not fee far into the canal—Mr. Woolfe said, "I will go and fetch a light," and he went for one—the man that went down with us followed him up, as I thought, to assist him in getting the light and a rope—I stayed by the canal—while Mr. Woolfe was away I heard the last sounds, merely two splashes, and then I heard no more—Mr. Woolfe returned with a light and a rope, he bad been detained about two minutes—the man in the flannel jacket did not come back at all; I saw no more of him—directly I missed him, something occurred to me, and I ran after him—I did not find him—when I got to the top of the passage, I turned to the right, and proceeded towards Cumberland market; I went about half way down the street—I met a policeman on the opposite side of the way, and I called to him, and asked him if he had seen a man of that description—it was the policeman 144; I met him about half-way down Augustus-street, opposite Lea's wharf—I then returned back to the canal with the policeman—the body of a woman was got out of the water, she was quite dead—she was earned into the tap room of the Regalia, and a surgeon was sent for; he tried every means of restoring her, but she was quite dead.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where does the other end of the towing-path lead to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It takes a winding course up to Pickford's warehouses; it comes out in the Albert-road, more than one hundred yards beyond the York and Albany.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know the neighbourhood well? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perfectly well; to get from the Victoria to the towing-path, you cross over the railroad bridge, and proceed round the half circle (I do not know the name of it) to the Regalia, and then take the turning down by the side of the Regalia—you cannot get to the towing-path without going down by the side of the Regalia, unless you go on to Primrose hill, and go in there; there are only those two ways of getting there within a mile.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Regalia Tavern, in Augustus-street. I recollect on the night of 31st Jan., Mr. Wilson calling my attention to something out of doors—I left the house that moment and followed him—there is a passage at the side of my house which runs down to the side of the canal—at the top of that passage, at the street end, there is a gate across; it is kept half open, one half is closed and the other open—just outside there we met a man, four or five feet inside—I observed that he was dressed in white clothing, something like flannel, or moleskin, or corduroy; it was a light dress, what it was I cannot say, I did not observe the texture of it—he had a cap on his head; I could not exactly distinguish the colour of it, it looked light, the same as his clothing—it was exactly such a man as the prisoner in height and appearance—I am not able to say further; I did not notice him sufficiently—as I ran I rather headed Wilson, and I ran upon this man—I said, "Hallo, what is the matter?" he made an answer, I am not quite positive what it was, it was either "I think there is a woman in the water," or, "I think somebody has thrown herself in the water;" and I in answer said, "Let us go and see if we cannot assist her;" I ran forward, leaving them to follow me down, which they did to the water's edge—I was first at the water's edge—Mr. Wilson and the man came down immediately behind me—I heard a stifling or gurgling, like a choking in the water—I could see nothing—I could hardly distinguish the water from the land—there was a good deal of fog on the water—I called out "Are you afloat? can you speak?" and receiving no answer—I said, "Hold hard, I will run and get a light"—I went away directly, leaving Mr. Wilson and the man at the water's edge—I ran in doors and got a candle and a rope, which I had handy, and returned I should think in two or three minutes—I then saw Wilson alone—I said something to him, and upon that he ran up the passage—I afterwards ran up the passage into Augustus-street—at that tine there was no sound proceeding from the person in the water—all was still when I returned with the rope and the candle—the policeman got the body out, and it was taken into my house—I have no doubt she was quite dead.</p>

               <p>an extremely dangerous place, especially on a foggy night; it is merely a place for the rope belonging to the barges to run along; it is not a regular footpath—a person walking along there on a foggy night might very easily slip in.</p>

               <p>—I got information from Mr. Norris, the clerk of the works, and went to Eccleston-buildings, High-street, Marylebone, near the police court—I knocked at the door, and inquired for Mackett—the prisoner came out—I was in plain clothes—he walked with me—after we had gone some distance together, I said to him, "I am a police officer, and I want to askyoua question or two; you can answer or not, as you think fit"—I said, "I believe you were in company of a woman, named Lea, last night?" he said, "I was"—I said, "Where did you leave her?" he said, "At a friend's house, in Pratt-street, Camden-town; where is she now?"—I said, "I believe she is in St. Pancras Workhouse; she was found in the Regent's-canal, at the back of the Regalia last night"—he said, "Is she dead?"—I said, "She is; and I shall take you into custody upon suspicion of having caused her death by throwing her into the water"—he immediately dropped his head upon his bosom—I took him by the sleeve, and walked, I should think, about 200 yards; neither of us spoke—he then shook himself up, and said, "I shall be able to clear myself;" I then took him to the station house—before we got there, I said to him, "Was that your wife that answered the door when I knocked?" he said, "Yes, it was; I was married last Sunday week"—I left him at the station at about half past 1 o'clock; it was about 1 o'clock when I went to the house in Eccleston-buildings—I afterwards went back to that house, and saw the woman who had opened the door, to me when I first went—I told her what I came for—I asked for a parcel; I got it some time afterwards, at the house—it was the merino that I have produced to-day—I was at the house more than half an hour on the second occasion before it was produced; the parcel was not in the house at the time I went there—an elderly woman went out first, and after she had been gone some considerable time, the other person went out and saw her coming up North-street I think—she ran and met her, took the cloak and bonnet from the old woman, and put it on herself, and the old woman gave her some money—she then went away, and afterwards returned with the parcel—this tin can and basket was standing on a chest of drawers in the room when I went there; I brought them from the house—this cap (<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>) I took from the prisoner's jacket pocket after I took him into custody—he had a hat on his head when he went to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, S</hi> 28). I prepared a sketch of this locality before the last session—the length of the passage from Augustus-street to the towing-path is 119 feet; the breadth of the towing-path is thirteen feet three inches; it is as nearly level as possible—I did not measure the breadth of the canal at that spot, but I should say it was about the width of from here to my Lord; about wide enough for two barges to pass—the distance from the Victoria to the Regalia is 320 yards—in order to get there, you must cross a bridge that runs across the North Western Railway, that leads into Park Village East, and turns round with a winding turn into Augustus-street—to get to the towing-path you must go down by the side of the Regalia, there is no other way—the distance from Augustus-street to the next entrance to the towing-path must be near a mile—the distance from where Mr. Wilson was standing to the spot where the body was found, is about sixty feet—the street where Percival was standing when the man passed him is narrower than usual; I should think it might be about the distance I am from you, ten or twelve feet, not more—there would not be sufficient room for three carts, one may pass the other—it is about 200 yards from the Regalia to Mrs. Hermitage's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I saw the body of a woman at the Regalia Tavern, on the night of 31st Jan.—I examined the body—the cause of death was suffocation from drowning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were there any marks of violence of any kind on the body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None whatever; there were some scratches across the abdomen, that might arise from the cut of the stays or from tearing the clothes off—she was undressed before I arrived—I did not notice the clothes—the scratches were very bright and vivid, as if they had taken place before death.</p>

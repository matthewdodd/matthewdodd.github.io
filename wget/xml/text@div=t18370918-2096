                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Charles Edward Kendall, a bootmaker on Saffron-hill. On Saturday afternoon, the 26th of August, the prisoner came to the shop and asked me for work—I said I had none for him, and while I was stooping down, I observed him take a pair of shoes, put them under his apron, and run off with them—I ran after him and caught him with them—he begged my pardon, and said, "Pray, for God's sake let me go; I am <hi rend="italic">done</hi> for ever if you detain me"—I took him to my master's, who ordered him into custody.</p>

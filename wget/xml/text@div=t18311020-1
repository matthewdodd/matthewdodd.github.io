On the 14th of October, about a quarter after three o'clock in the morning, I saw two men come out of the street door of that house - I did not know them before; each of them had a bundle, and suspecting all was not right, I crossed over the way up to the door, and found it standing wide open - I perceived a dark-lantern with a light in it, on the floor, and at that moment Ganer, my partner, came up to me; we both went after the men about twenty yards, and as they turned the corner of St. Martin's-le-Grand, as we had left the door open, I turned back to close it - I rang the bell, and alarmed the house, but did not go in; Ganer returned to me, and brought the two bundles - the men had not been secured then; the two bundles were left with the constable of the night- I never saw the contents; I could not distinguish the men, only that one was taller than the other - I saw Scott in the custody of an officer coming down the street, but was not near enough to say whether he was the man, or not; when Mr. Drake came down I went into the house, but did not examine to see how the persons had got in.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on my beat in Noble-street, and heard a rattle spring in St. Ann's-lane, and the cry of Stop him! I ran to the end of Noble-street, and saw a man run across into Maiden-lane; I pursued, and he turned up Gutter-lane - I spring my rattle; he turned into Huggin-lane; I lost sight of him there, and did not see him again till he was in custody - when I first saw him cross the street he had a hat and coat on; I did not see what was done with the hat, but when he was taken he had neither hat nor coat - I saw a hat and coat at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.You never saw his face? A. No, not till Cheney stopped him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Cripplegate. Just before half-past three o'clock in the morning I was in Wood-street; I heard a rattle spring - I went up Maiden-lane, and within eight yards of Gutter-lane I distinctly saw the prisoner Scott pass the lamp, without a hat - he had an olive coat on, and there appeared something heavy in the pockets as he ran; I saw him taken - he had no coal on then; I had not seen him throw it off; I had lost sight of him - the coat was given to me by a young man who picked it up; I am quite certain of Scott's person.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Cheap ward. I was on duty in Cateaton-street, and heard a rattle spring in Lad-lane - I saw Scott turn down Aldermanbury, without coat or hat, and immediately secured him - I took him to the watch-house, and saw the other property found on him.</p>

            . I have seen all this property, and am quite certain it is all mine - this gold medal, which has been produced by Ford, is a medal of honour given to my son, who was killed at Brussels; the property recovered is worth more than 100l.</p>
               <p>The prisoners made no Defence. Three witnesses deposed to Scott's good character, and two to that of Davies.</p>

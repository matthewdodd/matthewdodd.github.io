               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Then it was done in a moment; and altogether a surprise upon you? A. Yes. I had never seen him before I saw him stand at the door for about a minute; he appeared very much in liquor; Langley was not saying any thing to him; Langley did not appear to be heated; I had not heard any words; I was not far off. I had not been in the public-house; I know it as a watering-house. I saw one person came out (just after the prisoner), who picked up the knife. He could have no spite against me; I had not opened my lips to him, nor he to me.</p>

            . I am the waterman. On the morning of the 9th of March I saw the prisoner, whom I had not seen before to my knowledge - he went into the public-house about one o'clock; I went in at the same time, and had something to drink with him - I came out and left him there - I was not with him above three minutes - I did not see him come out again, but I saw him after he was out, in about half an hour's time - he walked up and down, and appeared vexed - he muttered something to himself - he appeared to be more drunk than when he went in - he walked about up and down about forty minutes; Norris, who had been feeding his horses, then came and spoke to me - the prisoner had bade me good night about five minutes before, and went towards Whitechapel, where he said he lived - he had asked me to direct him which way he must go - he had not got across the street, when he returned, pulled out a knife, and struck at me in the back - he did not say any thing to me then, but he had before said he would have his revenge, but he did not say on whom - the knife went through my coat and waistcoat - he then turned round and struck Norris through the hand - he did not say any thing to him - he appeared to strike at random - he did not offer to run away - I went for the watchman - the prisoner remained behind, and did not offer to run away.</p>

               <p>The tallest of the prisoners (Saunders) came into my house yesterday afternoon between four and five o'clock, and called for a pint of beer; the other prisoner came to her before she had drank it; they drank that and called for another, before they had drank the other Saunders was going out of the house; I had some suspicion they were such persons; I have lost eight dozen of pots since July last; as she was going out I laid hold of her arm and said I believed she had got something more than her own; she said, what do you mean by that? I said I believe you have a quart pot; and felt down one side of her clothes and felt a quart pot; I felt down the other side and felt a pint pot, as I supposed it to be, through her clothes, it proved so afterwards; I sent for an officer and gave him charge of both the women; we went before Justice Blackborough, there he searched her and found a quart pot of mine, and a pint pot of Mr. Bates's.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found upon the other prisoner? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Did you see the other do any thing? - I saw them both go to the table; they sat by the fire when they first came in.</p>
               <p>Did you see her take any thing? - I did not.</p>
               <p>(The pots were produced in court by the constable, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Smith and I went in to have a pint of beer at four o'clock (I have two small children; they had had no victuals) I was going to take them some drink; I bid her stay, the gentleman came after me and stopped me; I was going to carry some drink home and bring the pot back again.</p>

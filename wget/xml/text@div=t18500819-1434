                  </hi>. I am a hosier. The prisoner was my servant of all work, and lived with me nearly four years—I went to Mr. Boyce's shop, and found these shirts, waistcoat, handkerchiefs, and other things; they are mine—I had some of them safe twelve months ago, and all within thirteen months—the first thing I missed was this holland—this waistcoat I saw safe perhaps six or eight months ago—I found this tablecloth at the pawnbroker's, I never missed it till I found it there—these shirts I cannot say when I lost—I spoke to the prisoner about some blue cotton—she said it was up-stairs in the wardrobe; I said it was not, she said it was—I said I would convince her it was not, and I took the duplicates out of my pocket—she then begged my pardon, and asked me to forgive her—I said I could not—I sent for the policeman.</p>

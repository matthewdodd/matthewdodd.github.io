On the 1st of January, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I counted her sheep - there were thirty-six altogether; I went to the field next day after my son came to me - I found a skin in the possession of my son: I found in the field a sheep's entrails and some blood - I am sure the skin was the skin of the sheep I missed; here is the mark on it, W L, on the off side - I afterwards saw the head and feet of a sheep; I looked over the pales, and saw footmarks of two different people - they were near the spot where the entrails and blood were found; I received the skin into my possession, and put it into the tool-house in the garden, and produce it here; Mead had it from me, and I have got it now from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When did you get the skin from your son? A. On the 2nd of January - it was snowy weather: I do not know whether it had snowed in the night or not - the fields are frequented by sportsmen at times, but it is paled in, and we prevent them when we can.</p>
               <p>JAMES SAVILL. I am the son of the last witness, and in the employ of Mrs. Lewis. On Saturday morning, the 2nd of January, I went into the field, and counted the sheep; there were thirty-five - I found a skin in the field, and the entrails and some blood; it was under some trees by the side of the pales - there were some dried leaves in the field near to where I found the skin; it was an ewe sheep - I gave the skin to my father.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There are plenty of leaves about every field where there are trees? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN MEAD. I am beadle of Enfield. On the morning of the 2nd of January, about ten o'clock, in consequence of information, I went to Mrs. Lewis' premises; I went into the park - Savill showed me the entrails of a sheep, and blood; the skin was shown to me in the tool-house - I saw footmarks in the park, close on the spot where the entrails were; the footmarks were not bloody - I looked over the pales, and saw footmarks where they had got over, and traced them nearly three quarters of a mile on the snow, leading towards Enfield, in a direction to Puddifoot's house: I traced them within two hundred yards of his house - he does not live in the high road, but on the Chase green; I went to Puddifoot's house - he was not at home; I searched the house - I had some slight knowledge of him before, and knew he lived there; I went up stairs, and in a butter-firkin, in the bed-room, I found nearly the whole carcase of a sheep, cut up in a very slovenly manner, and put into the firkin covered with a sack, and in the window, in the bed-room, lay a bill and a knife all over blood; I produce them - there was also some fat and small pieces of meat on them; the blood was very fresh - it had not dried; in the sack which covered the tub was a sheep's head with part of the skin on it, and by the side of the tub lay part of the inside of a sheep, and in it what turned out to be a young lamb; I searched the lower part of the house, and under the stairs I found a sheep's pluck, and three sheep's feet concealed - they were not covered, but were on a shelf high up; I found a parcel of ropes, two very large sticks in the bed-room loaded with lead and nails - they are not here; I afterwards apprehended Puddifoot in the barn -I said, "You are the man I want; you must go with me;" he said, "For what?" I said "For Mrs. Lewis' mutton;" he said, "Oh, I will go with you" - he did not resist; I locked him up and went in pursuit of Gratton - Watkins took him that morning, and about twelve o'clock I took his(Grattons) shoes off; there were nails in them, and marks of blood and fat, and small pieces of meat on the shoes - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140023"></xptr>produce them; I looked into the snow, and there were nine nails in the shoes, in a crossway, and so there was in the snow - I did not put them into the snow, because there had been a little thaw; I did not take the shoes to the field when I looked at the footmarks: I compared the sheep's head and feet with the skin produced - they exactly fitted; there were some leaves on the head, and by my laying the head down the leaves dropped off on the skin - I saw some of the dry leaves in the field, by the blood and entrails, and the leaves on the head were the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What sort of trees are there? A. Oak and ash; the sun had come out about twelve or one o'clock, which was the reason I did not take the shoes to fit them- I know it was Puddifoot's house I went to; his wife and family live there, and were there when I went - I never saw him there myself; I was told it was his house - I was before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q.Were not several butchers sent for to try to fit the legs and head in the skin? A. One, named Taylor, was sent for; nobody else - I heard no butcher declare it was impossible to say a sheep cut up in that way would fit the skin; I was there nearly all the time - there were two butchers there, but only one was sent for; the other came in by chance, (Mr. Gocher, who is here) - Taylor did not like to interfere in it; he was spoken to by the Magistrate, and said he had rather decline having any thing to do with it, he did not like to be called out of his business; there was no other butcher there to my knowledge - none were examined, for I was not out of sight of the office; I only went out to wash my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many children live in Puddifoot's house? A.There was a little boy at home, and two work for Mr. Ellis; he told me himself, at the Nag's-head public-house, where I took him, and gave him a pint of beer, that it was his house - he said he knew nothing at all about what was in the house; he had got his dinner - I said,"Come, old man, you sha'n't go in dry," and gave him a pint of beer - I said I had been to his house, and he said,"I live on the green;" he said it was his house - I said I had been to search his house on the green; he said, "What did you find there?" this was in the farm-yard - I told him I found some mutton: there are two houses standing by themselves on the green, one of which is his, and there are some more houses about fifty yards off: there are six or seven cottages on the green in all - the high road passes by the green; the snow was batted down on the road.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.Were they footmarks of one or two persons? A. Two; I traced footmarks on the green after they crossed the bridge, across the green again - there was still two footsteps, and blood was traced within two or three hundred yards of the house; Puddifoot's sons are not grown up - there are two children under fourteen years of age; the footmarks were of grown up men.</p>

            . I am a horse patrol of Bow-street, stationed at Enfield. In consequence of information I went to apprehend Gratton, and took him in Pudidfoot's bed-room; on my going into the house I saw him before me - he turned his head, and when he saw me he ran; I did not know him at the time, but suspected it might be him - I afterwards ascertained that it was him; I took him to the watch-house, assisted Mead in taking his shoes off, and then locked him up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was this after Puddifoot was taken? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JACOB GOCHER. I am a butcher. I examined the carcase found in Puddifoot's house before the Magistrate: it was produced in a tub by Mead - it was cut up all to pieces, hammocked and spoiled; I examined the head, feet, and skin - I tried the head to the skin; it fitted - we should term it a Welch breed, but it was a little cross; the head matches the skin - the skin on the head is not as a butcher would cut it; I did not compare the feet with the skin.</p>

            . I compared the feet found in Puddifoot's house, with the skin; they matched - I also compared the head, that matched - I produce the feet; it was not a thorough Welch bred sheep, but a little cross.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.If you saw those legs and skins in Yorkshire would you say they were the same? A. I swear the head and skin match, and the feet also; if I had never seen the skin and legs before, I would swear they matched.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you saw them now for the first time, should you think they belonged to the same skin? A. I should.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Suppose you never saw the head and feet before, and met them down in Yorkshire, and did not know that Mrs. Lewis had lost a sheep, would you swear they belonged to the skin? A. Yes, I would; I should not think there is another skin in the kingdom that would match them - about thirty of Mrs. Lewis' sheep are alike.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose two sheep had been taken, and two skins were produced, could you tell which of the two they had belonged to? A. I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>MR. DOWLING. Q. What makes you so certain no other skin would match the head? A.Because it is cut in such a way - different to what sheeps' heads are usually cut; it was an ewe sheep, and I expected it was with lamb - I expected all her ewes were with lamb.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Looking at the head of the sheep, can you tell it belonged to a Welch cross breed? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who called her Mrs. Puddifoot? A. The Magistrate; and when I was going to Newgate, Puddifoot said "I was a lucky man with my old wife, but now have got a d-d fool."</p>

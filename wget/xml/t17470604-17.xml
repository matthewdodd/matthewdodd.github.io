            . The Prisoner at the Bar came to my House on Friday, the 22nd of May, and she brought me this Yarn, and ask'd me if I would buy it, I ask'd her what she would have for it, she said 18 d. I said, Woman I am afraid you did not come-by this Yarn honestly; so I stopp'd the Yarn, and said, if you can bring any body to your Reputation, and prove you came honestly by it, you shall have it again, or I will buy it of you. She went away, and came no more. I said to my Man, may be your Cousin may have lost this Yarn; so being ask'd, he said he had lost none; but he said there is a Man in Spitalfields who throws such Yarn, Mr Mackenzie; so Mr Mackenzie told him, to look over all his People, which he did, but did not see her at that Time; he went again on Tuesday, and saw her at work.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she ever bring any Yarn?</p>
               <p>Janno. On the 22d of May she came with a Parcel that is stopp'd, I went to a Relation's that dealt pretty largely in that Yarn, he told me, he had not lost any, but told me that Mr Mackenzie, dealt pretty largely in it; so Mr Mackenzie said I should go to see his Workwomen. I describ'd the Person, and the Person that I describ'd was wanting; then he sent for her to come to work; when she came, I said this was she.</p>

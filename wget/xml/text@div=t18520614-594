                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 631). On 8th June, about a quarter past 9 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Duke-street, Aldgate—I saw the prisoner coming in a direction from Mr. Mills'—I knew him before—he was carrying something under a large blue pilot coat, which he had on—I followed him to Duke's-place, from there to St. Mary Axe, and then to Camomile-street—I asked him what he had got—he said he had got nothing—I undid his coat, and found this coat in front of him—I asked how he came by it—he said if I would go back, he would take me to the shop where he bought it—we were close to the station, and I said we would go there first—he then said he bought it of a man in the <hi rend="italic">lane</hi> for 185.—I asked if he knew the man—he said, "No"—he said he was hawking them about the <hi rend="italic">lane</hi>, and he had them on his arm.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Thomas Mills; he is a tailor and outfitter. I know this coat to be his—I know it by a tear in the collar—I had seen it safe about 8 o'clock in the evening on 7th June in the show room—I saw the prisoner next morning about 9, he came to buy a coat—I showed him some in the show room—he tried on several, and did not buy any—he said they were too expensive—I told him we should have some more that would suit him—he had a large blue pilot coat on, which he took off when he tried on the other coats, and laid it on the counter—after he had tried on the coats, he put his own coat on again—I came out of the show room first, and he followed me—I followed him to the door, and saw that he turned down Duke-street—I had not sold him this coat, or any other—there</p>

               <p>was no one in the show room but him and me—this coat had been on the top of a pile of coats the night before—I believe he laid his great coat on the top of that pile.</p>

Q.</hi> How do you know this coat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is unsewn in the edge of the collar, about an inch and a half has come out of the sewing—I think I could swear to the coat—we mark all our coats—there was a mark sewn on the flap of this, which has been torn off—I believe it was sewn with white thread—I know the cut of this coat—it is one of the new fashioned paletots—I do not think you would find 500,000 such in London.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any brushes at any time lately? - In consequence of information that the prisoner had robbed me from time to time, I applied to justice Addington, and desired to search his lodgings, October 3d; and I found that box with the greatest part of the articles specified in the indictment, which box belonged to the prisoner; he was not present at the time; the prisoner had been an apprentice of mine.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you know it was his box? - One of the evidences is an apprentice of mine, who was present at the opening of the box, and said that it was the prisoner's box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present at the time? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You found these things in a box? - All except one or two trivial matters.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110071"></xptr>Q. Do you know the room? - Yes, it was in his room where he lodged; I always understood he lodged there; I believe the evidence in court will convince you of that.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the brushes? - The brushes appear to me to be of my manufactory; but there was one or two more things that seem more particularly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This man had lived in your service, I believe? - Yes, he was an apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. His time is not quite out now? - There wants a few days.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went away, did he take his boxes away or no? - Really I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you know that he came again, about four days afterwards, for his boxes? - I believe he did; I believe I heard so much.</p>
               <p>Q. The evidence you talked of just now, what is his name? -

               <p>Q. How long was it that master Watson kept all this story snug before he told it you? - I only heard it on October the 3d; how long he kept it to himself, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he keep the intelligence to himself before he told you? - Watson did not tell it to me; the first of it was, one of my men heard the conversation and told me, October the 2d.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell him where you had been? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what you had taken away? - Yes, I told him there was a quantity of things which his master had claimed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about its being, or not being his room? - No, nothing at all, he did not deny it was his room.</p>

I reside at Kingsbridge-place, Millwall—about half-past 4 on the afternoon of Saturday, 19th March, I was walking along Emmett's street—I had a piece of pork in my hand—Curley came up to me and found fault with the way I was carrying the pork, and told me to put it on my arm, and he moved it himself—he came close to me, and I saw him fumbling about my watch pocket, and I then saw my watch in one of his hands and the chain in the other, hanging down—I caught hold of him, we had a struggle, and we fell—as near as I can recollect, being rather excited with a fall or two, Gurley got away from me—I ran after him and saw him go down Bowley-street—I called out, "Stop thief!" as loud as I could, and I never lost sight of him till the witness Hanmore passed me and caught him—whilst struggling with Gurley I received a blow on the side of the head</p>

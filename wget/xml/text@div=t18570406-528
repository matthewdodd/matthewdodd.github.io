                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Defines, a gas engi<lb></lb>neer. The defendant was taken into his employ four or five months ago, and after making some moulds to pattern, he was engaged to make tools to make some diaphragms—(This case has been before two police magistrates, but not before any Court)—this is the agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) made between Mr. Defries and him, I was present when it was made. (<hi rend="italic">By this agreement, the defendant bound himself to supply no diaphgrams, directly or indirectly, to way other maker, under a penalty of</hi> l, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">in consideration of Mr. Defries lending him</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi> to purchase tools, the defendant undertaking to return him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week till they were paid for, and agreeing to work either in or out of the factory, and to pay all cost for spoiled materials.</hi>) He was engaged making the tools to make diaphragms, but was subsequently to make the diaphragms—he had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to purchase a press, with the under<lb></lb>standing that it should become his when he was able to return the money for it—I was not present then, but I advanced him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 19 Dec, that was money lent him to get on—on 2nd Jan., I advanced him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to enable him to finish some work which he was engaged upon, and as a means of living—that was the only wages he had—on Monday 5th Jan., I missed the screw of a press, and went over to him several times, at his house, request<lb></lb>ing him to bring it back, and to continue his work, which he promised to do, but failed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he left his work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on the Friday when he had the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the foreman and myself went to his house, and represented the folly of his proceedings, and requested him to return and bring the screw, which he promised to do, but failed; he said that he had got it, but did not show it—it was Mr. Defries's screw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Two Magistrates decided that the screw was mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were this press and screws to be his? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> When paid for; he did very little work indeed, to pay for them, he made the tools himself or was making them—I am not familiar with the names of them, because it was a plan of his own—these are parts of the very tools he was making—he had some invention of his own—my master is an Englishman; we advanced the defendant the money for the press. (<hi rend="italic">The defendant here produced a bill for the press, and</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">produced the original bill, which was made out in the prisoner's name, an sold to him.</hi>) The defendant purchased the press, and had his name put at the top of the bill—the sums I advanced to him were 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the money for the press—he was not at work eight weeks, because he was away so constantly; five or six weeks—he did not do some of the work at home, to my knowledge. (<hi rend="italic">The declaration stated that the defendant had lost the ticket, that he had not told it to any person.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I am the inventor of the tools; I was not in the work<lb></lb>shop on 2nd March, as a witness will prove; I summoned Mr. Defries to Marylebonne County Court for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. wages which he owed me, as I never received any; there is the summons (<hi rend="italic">Producing it; dated 2nd Feb., and heard on 5th March</hi>); the Magistrate said that the press belonged to me, and the Magistrate at Worship Street said the same, and he put it down as money lent; he wants to make profit of me because I am a Frenchman, the same as he did of another Frenchman, who he took a patent from; he let me sign a paper in the workshop, to destroy the other, and he promised me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to finish my work, but only gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that was not for the ticket, it was for my work.</p>

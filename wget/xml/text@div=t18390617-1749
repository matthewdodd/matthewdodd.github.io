                  </hi>. I am butler to Mr. White. On the morning of the 22nd of May I packed up the plate, and put it into the coach—I did not go to Black wall with it—on the same evening I went to Black wall with one of the maid-servants; and after that, as I was coming home, I was overtaken by an omnibus—I came to town by it—I observed on the top of the roof the same box of plate that I had packed to go to Edin<lb></lb>burgh, with my master's name on it on a brass plate—I inquired of the coachman about it—I got inside, and found the prisoner there—I asked him if he could tell me where he got it, and be refused to tell me, or where he was going to take it—I asked whose it was—he said it was his, and re<lb></lb>fused to tell me where he got it, but said if I took him to the station-house he would explain—I went on to the Royal Exchange—I saw a police<lb></lb>man there, and gave the prisoner in charge—I took him to the station-house—he then said he picked up the box on the road.</p>

On the evening of the 22nd of May I had an om<lb></lb>nibus at the Rising Sun, Poplar, about a quarter of a mile from Black wall—the prisoner came to me there with this box—he asked if I was going to town—I told him yes—he got in—I asked him if I should put the box outside—he gave it to me—I put it outside—I overtook the last wit<lb></lb>ness walking—he got up outside—in consequence of his inquiries he got in, and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

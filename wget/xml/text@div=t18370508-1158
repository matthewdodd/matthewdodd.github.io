                  </hi> I live at Stratford, near Bow, and am single. I have known the prisoner for years—he lives near the Three Pigeons at Stratford, in a house of his own—nobody lodges or lives with him—he is carpenter—I went to his house, on a Monday in April—I do not recollect the day of the month—I think it was the beginning of April—I think it was between seven and tight o'clock in the morning when I went—I went to clean his house—he came for me—I was there all day—he asked me to lay there—I told him I did not mind stopping of a day for him, and doing for him, and answering the gate, but I did not like to stop all night—me asked me to stop all night—he said I should not go back again—this passed between six and seven o'clock in the evening, when I wanted to to home—1 had dined with him between twelve and one o'clock—he had been out in the afternoon—he was tipsy when he came home, but not very tipsy—he insisted on my staying, and I staid all night, and slept, with him—he got up about six o'clock on Tuesday morning, and went to his work—his work was out of doors—he came in about eight o'clock to breakfast—he did not say any thing till dinner time—I told him then that I wanted to go home to see how my father was—he said I should not go home—he Liked about taking medicine is the afternoon—he did not do any thing to be that day—I staid Monday night and Tuesday night with him—on the Tuesday night, between eleven and twelve o'clock, he said he was going own the yard—he went down stairs, and came back directly after—I said him, "You have not been down the yard"—he said, "No, it was too cold"—he said nothing more to me, but he cut my throat—I did not see my thing in his hand—this was between twelve and one o'clock in the right, between Tuesday and Wednesday—I was in bed—there was no light the room—I had not been asleep—he cut my throat across the front.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police horse-patrol. I was at Stratford-green on the night between Tuesday and Wednesday—it was between twelve and one o'clock in the morning of the 12th—I heard a person screaming, and went towards the place—I met the watchman, and proceeded towards the sound, and met the prosecutrix in her shift—she was bleeding from the neck—I took her back with me to Cornell's house—she told me about this—there was no light in the house, but we procured one—I went up and saw the prisoner—he was on the bed in his shirt, not under the clothes—his face was downwards on the bed—I asked him what he had been doing—he made no answer—I turned him over on his back, and found that his throat was cut in front—I found a razor lying on the floor—it was bloody—my part<lb></lb>ner went for Doctor Vallance—the prisoner did not appear to be drank.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon living at Stratford. I was called on Wednesday, about one o'clock in the morning, by a horse-patrol—I found the prosecutrix in one corner of the room leaning against the wall—the blood was trickling from her throat down her fingers—I went towards her, and the watchman appeared to think she had done it herself—I saw, from the nature of the cut, that she did not do it herself—the prisoner was laying on the bed with his throat cut—his was the worst cut of the two—his windpipe was considerably divided, nearly half of it—he was not able to speak, but fearing he might die, I questioned him—I had the prosecutrix removed to her mother's residence, and attended her there—she is not in any danger now—I attended her nineteen days—I also attended the prisoner till he was capable of being removed to Ilford prison, which was also nineteen days—I did not see any symptoms of insanity in his conduct—I observed that he was not drunk on that night, and made the remark to the constable—I did not sew up his wound—it was sewn subsequently, in consequence of his tearing it, but at that time I only approximated it by means of pillows—he separated it on the Sunday, and it was then sewn up, and I had a strait-waistcoat put on him, to pre<lb></lb>vent his doing further mischief—I did not do that under the impression of his being insane—he had been from the Wednesday to the Sunday before he pulled the wound open—when he was able to articulate I did not observe any symptoms of madness in his conversation.</p>

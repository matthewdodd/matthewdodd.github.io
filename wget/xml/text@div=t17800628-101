             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a brick-maker, and live in Coffin-court. I came by the Sardinian ambassador's house between eleven and twelve o'clock. The chapel is in <placeName id="t17800628-101-crimeloc510">Duke-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17800628-101-crimeloc510" type="placeName" value="Duke-street"></interp>

I heard a noise in Duke-street; coming along I saw a fire in the street. I came and stood at the east end of the chapel to look, as other spectators did; I saw several people and the prisoner bringing out books, benches, and the lining of the chapel, and other things, and throwing them upon the fire.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - I never saw him to my knowledge before that night.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it is he? - Yes. I stood by some stables facing the chapel door; the prisoner came up to me, laid hold of me by the collar, and said, D - n your eyes, or blast your eyes, where are your colours!</p>
               <p>What did he mean by your colours? - My not having a cockade in my hat I suppose. I told him I had seen Lord Mountmorres in trouble in Parliament-street, that I offered him my cockade, and his lordship desired me to give it to his coachman, as somebody else had given him one, which I accordingly did; I threw the prisoner over my leg and threw him down; I begged his pardon; then he left me and went to the fire; he took up five pieces of board, about the length of my arm, which were on fire, and set them against the right-hand door-post going into the eastern door, immediately after that the door-post was on fire. It was then reported that the military were coming.</p>
               <p>Court. You do not know for certain that the fire was occasioned by the boards he set there? - It was not on fire before he set the boards there, but I saw the post burning afterwards. When it was reported that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280234"></xptr> military were coming, the people who were spectators absconded, and I absconded myself.</p>
               <p>How long do you think you was there? - I had not my watch. I am sure I was not there a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>How soon after was the prisoner taken? - I do not know; he was in custody soon after before the Lord-mayor for a misdemeanour, and was discharged.</p>
               <p>Are you able to say from your observation of his person that he is the man? - Yes, he had a cut in his coat; he has not the same coat on now. I wrote a letter to Lord Hilisborough when things were settled and they began to take up people, describing the prisoner. I took him to be a shoemaker or blacksmith, by the long apron he had on. I sent the letter about the 11th or 12th day of the month.</p>
               <p>Was you the first who gave information of him? - I cannot say, I told the constable if he saw such a person to take him.</p>
               <p>Was it on your information he was taken up? - I believe it was; I got a party of soldiers, and he was taken to the London Hospital.</p>
               <p>Did you know of any reward at that time? - No, I did not know of it till I heard it mentioned by Mr. Chetham here. I wrote to Lord Hillsborough that I wanted no see or reward.</p>
               <p>Do you claim the reward? - No, I never shall; I do not want the reward.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What business are you? - A brick maker.</p>
               <p>Do you follow that business? - Yes, on my stock; I have not made any this year; I made five thousand last year.</p>
               <p>You was going accidentally by, and stood at the stable opposite? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There was I suppose a great quantity of people? - No great quantity of people, there were several there.</p>
               <p>You never saw the prisoner before? - I never say him before excepting twice. When he was taken up for setting fire to this place, I happened to be mentioning it to this constable.</p>
               <p>Did you see a great number of boys and lads there? - Yes, and some men.</p>
               <p>How came you to observe this man in particular? - I should not have taken notice of him if he had not come up and taken me by the collar. I took notice when I threw him over my legs that he had bandy legs.</p>
               <p>He was taken up for some offence? - By Mr. Langdale's clerk I believe, but I did not know he was taken up.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you charged him with this after you had found out the man? - I had information from the master he served his time with, where he was. When I found where he was I went to Mr. Alderman Wilkes; I got a party of soldiers and took him.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to find him out? - I was in a publick-house describing him, particularly to a constable, his size, his clothes and his legs, if he met with such a man to secure him, and send to me, and I would appear against him, for his impudence in collaring me. There were two persons sitting in a box, one said, that is our George. I did not take any notice only hearing him say it is our George, till the Monday following, then I happened to be in the house again about the hour of four o'clock, drinking a pint of porter; his master who was in the house on the Thursday before, happened to come in; he said he never heard a man describe another so near in his life as I described his servant. I asked him if he knew the man? He said yes, he served part of his time with him. I asked him where he was? He said there was no occasion to enquire, for he was far enough from here now, for he had been in prison and been discharged, and was far enough off by this time. With that I asked him if he had worked for him lately? He said no, the last place he worked at was for a widow in Shoe-lane, who was now married again. I enquired there for the prisoner, describing his person; she said his name was

               <p>I am a carpenter, in Shoe-lane; the prisoner lodged with me three months; on Friday night the 2d of June he left my house about nine in the evening and was not at home again till the next morning; I saw him the next morning between eight and nine o'clock. I asked him, George, where have you been all night? He said, Master I have been to the fire. I said George, you had better been at your work, or sitting for your work, and not lie out of my house. I asked what fire? He said, at the Danish ambassador's; he said, D - n my eyes, master, we have burnt it down, we have had fine fun! and then he said he would go home to bed; he said, if you live two or three days longer you will see half London on fire. He went home and went to bed; he lay till two or three o'clock in the afternoon; he got up again, and did a little work till about seven; he said he was so ill he could not do any more that night, but if I chose he would do a little in the morning to make his work up, which he did; he had some roll and tea for breakfast and went to bed on Sunday all day; on the Sunday night he came out about eight or nine o'clock; he said he would go out and get him something to drink and go to bed, which he did.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

               <p>This conversation happened on the 3d? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not this strike you as a very wicked thing? - It did very much.</p>
               <p>Did not you go to an alderman directly? - No, because it was only his words; I did not then, I did afterwards.</p>
               <p>Then you went and gave him a good character? - No, we were afraid he had been concerned in oivers robberies.</p>
               <p>When he was taken up why did not you tell the alderman this? - I thou ght it did not signify as it was only his words.</p>
               <p>Can you read? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You heard there was a reward before he was taken up? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you read it? - No.</p>

               <p>Did he keep good hours? - No; and because I was his master he was discharged; that was all I was asked.</p>

               <p>Are you and your man upon an equal footing? - No.</p>
               <p>He came and told you he had done this, and meant to burn down half London? - Yes; he told me this publickly in the street, but a few yards from the door.</p>
               <p>Who heard this besides yourself? - I do not know that there was any body nigh me.</p>
               <p>Perhaps he mentioned it to others as well as you? - Not that I know.</p>

               <p>Do you know the situation of the Sardinian ambassador's chapel and house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is the Chapel joining to the house? - Yes, it is on the north side.</p>
               <p>Is there a communication between the house and the chapel? - There is on the south side a covered passage, which leads from the south side of the house, from the one-pair-of-stairs; underneath that is a place for bottles, for the use of the butler; and there was a door into the chapel below stairs from the butler's closet, which is now closed up; there is also a communication on the north side which goes into the sacristary for the servants and other people to go into the chapel.</p>
               <p>Does the chapel appear to be of equal date with the house? - The Chapel was built in the year 1763; it had been burnt down.</p>
               <p>Is the chapel now burnt down entirely? - The north side of it is injured by the fire; the galleries are injured, and I believe six pillars were burnt and a part of the floor.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You are a carpenter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This chapel is a distinct building from the house? - There is a communication with the house.</p>
               <p>As one house communicates with another? - There in an immediate communication with the vestry, which is a part of the house.</p>
               <p>There is an eight foot passage between the house and the chapel on the south side? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then there is eight feet distance, I understand, between the house and the chapel? - There is; a projecting wing; I have made a sketch of it, if it will be any information to you (producing it).</p>
               <p>Court. There are, I see, three communications; one up stairs from the ambassador's apartment to the chapel, one which has been stopped up, for the use of the servants, and one to the sacristary.</p>
               <p>The chapel was built since the house?</p>
               <p>Bates. In the year 1763, when the chapel was built, these communications, I under stand, were made, which were not before.</p>

               <p>It might be separated from the house without injuring the house at all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Take away the chapel and make windows of the doors, and the house will be complete? - Yes, they were windows before; they are taken out and reversed and put on the south side.</p>
               <p>As a builder do you suppose this chapel a dwelling house or a building adjoining to a house? - I look upon it as a building adjoining to a house.</p>

               <p>Do you know Rogers who has been examined as a witness? - About three months ago John Rogers applied to me to sign a paper in order to recover some money at the Assurance-office.</p>
               <p>Give us an account of what is his general<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280237"></xptr> character? - The report was that he wilfully set his house on fire.</p>
               <p>What is his general character? - He is a man of a very bad character.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the other man? - No.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the crown. This certainly is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of him? - Only from this transaction; he is a very bad man and ought not to be believed.</p>
               <p>Court. So far as your knowledge goes he is a man of bad character? - Yes. It is intended to prosecute him for perjury.</p>
               <p>Why do not they do it? - The information is very recent.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - He has been in my shop; I do not know much of him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Is his bad character owing to his living with a woman of a different name? - I cannot say; I do not say it was from that.</p>

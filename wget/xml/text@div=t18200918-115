            . I am mate of the Voston. I did not sleep on board the prisoner did, alone; he had charge of the cargo and ship in my absence. On Tuesday, the 13th of September, a young man in the hospital gave me some information, in consequence of which, on Wednesday morning, at half-past nine o'clock, I met Capt. Gass on board by appointment - we sent for Walmsley, and sent the prisoner out of the way. We searched, and found that some of the cases of goods on board had been broken open; some were cases of hardware. We then went into the cabin, and found in the prisoner's bed-place, between the blankets, three white-handled clasp knives, and in the after-locker, on the larboard side, I saw a new blue surtout<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180059"></xptr>coat and some spotted silk waistcoats (I think three) some of the prisoner's books were in that locker - I had often seen him go to it. We found a mahogany dressing-case in one of the lockers, with the name erased off it. I think we found a pair of white jean trowsers with the coat. I went again on Thursday with Murrant, and in the cabin, on the starboard side, we found a new blue coat, a dozen ivory-handled knives and forks and two pair of carvers. The prisoner had been apprehended at two o'clock on the Wednesday, I had frequently seen him go to all the lockers and the cabin. I took the keys of the hold away every night but one.</p>

            . I am twenty years old on the 3d of January. I am apprentice on board the brig Nelson, which laid in the London Docks at the time the Vaston did, she laid in the next tier. I got acquainted with the prisoner soon after the vessel came there, and was on board with him at different times. I went into the hold with the mate when the search was made. Some of the cases had been split and opened, and the cover of one had been prized open. I went down into the cabin one night, and the prisoner asked me to lend him a towell - this was above a month before the search. He told me to go down into the cabin and fetch a leather belt; I went down, put my hand into the locker, and felt a quantity of handkerchiefs. I came up and said</p>
               <p>"You have got a good stock of handkerchiefs on board" - he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, I was such a fool I forgot to get them out of the Dock." I helped to to push them into his pockets, and he went away with them. When I went into the cabin with the mate I saw a mahogany dressing-case, with the name scratched off the brass plate. I had seen the prisoner shave himself one night with one of the razors, which he took out of it - he put it in again. He took the dressing-case from under his bed in the cabin, and put it there again after using it. The locker where it was found was close to his bed. I saw the mate find all the things. About a week before the search I had been putting our Captain ashore, the prisoner was in the boat with me; he said</p>
               <p>"Jerry, did you ever see such a thing as this?" and produced a thing which had the handle done all over with red sealing-wax, it drew a piece of steel to it - he put them into his pocket; he said it was a magnet. The dressing-case was fitted up with a looking-glass, scissars, inkstands, and other things. About a fortnight before the search, I saw him open a chest of clothes in the cabin, on the starboard side. He shewed me a coat, some white waistcoats, and a piece of nankeen in it. He said his mother bought him the dressing-case, that it cost five guineas, and the razors cost a guinea each.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. I went on board the vessel with the mate, and found the things as he has stated. I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday, about two o'clock. I searched him the same evening, and found two keys in his pocket; I tried one of them to the lock on the fore-scuttle; it opened it, but any key would open it. A person might go from the fore-scuttle into the hold. I took possession of the property found on board, Mr. Smith claimed them.

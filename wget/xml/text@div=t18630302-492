                  </hi>. I live at 15, Susannah-street, Poplar, and am a bolt, nut, and rivet maker—I was working for Messrs. Westwood and Bailey—I had not been in their service above a fortnight when I was first told of this matter—Joseph Davis first spoke to me about it, as I was going home from work—he said he did not know how it was Rosser was getting more money than he, although he had a better job than Rosser; that there was a deal of work being reckoned for that they never made—I asked him how he knew it, and be said he had 1 cwt. put on for him by Seagur the week before, that he bad not made; that Seagur was putting in for them, and since he had the 1 cwt. they would not do any more for him; they stopped him from having any more, and that Ned Davis and Rosser were sharing the money—I went to Ned Davis a day or two after—Seagur, after I had spoken to him, went with me to Joseph Davis, and said to him, "Didn't I pay you for that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186303020084"></xptr>
               <p>1 cwt. that they put in for you?"—Davis said, "Yes"—Seagur said, "What have you got to tell lies for? You have told a lie by saying that I would not pay you, and would not let you have any more"—I went to Rosser in a day or two, and told him that a man had told me in the London Tavern about what game they were carrying on in robbing the firm—he denied it—I did not want to tell him that Davis had told me; I told him that a stranger had told me—then he said, "I think that little rogue Seagur has been and split about it; now I will tell you all about it"—then he said that they put in as many hundredweight as they possibly could during the week, and shared the money between the three (<hi rend="italic">Ned</hi> Davis, Seagur, and Rosser), and they would not let <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> know anything about it—I asked him how they were doing the iron; I said, "Why, you will be found out about the iron; they will be sure to find it out; you had better leave it off"—the iron is weighed out and weighed in again, and they are sure to know—if they get 4 cwt. of iron they are expected to return 4 cwt.—he said they could not detect them; that if the foreman gave an order for 5 cwt. they only took 4 cwt. out, and used to say they had the full amount out—he said, "I have to take little weights, such as 2 or 3 qrs. odd, and I lose a deal of time;" and when they could not take little weights he said they used to alter the figures, make ones into twos—the next I heard was in the Manchester Arms; I saw Seagur, Rosser, and the two Davis's there one night—<hi rend="italic">Ned</hi> Davis gave Seagur 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then Rosser gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then the elder Davis gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—as we were going home I asked <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> Davis what those sixpences were for—he said, they gave it to him to make it all right with him; he did a little for us, but he don't do any for me now since that I cwt.—some weeks after that I was present at the London Tavern on a Saturday night, and Rosser, Seagur, and the two Davis's came in again, and asked me to go and have a share in a pot of ale—I was out of work then—I went with them, and Ned Davis said, "What do you think of that little rogue Seagur? he has been trying to get these <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> to have a lot more rivets put in, as I have not been having enough put in for him"—Seagur said, "You need not be afraid, for I have done many a gross of bolts and nuts for <hi rend="italic">Ned</hi> Davis"—after that Rosser said to me, "I will just show you what a mess that Charley has made of a number two in my book"—they have a book to keep their own accounts in, as well as the storekeeper's book, to see that they tally one with the other—he was going to show it to me, but he said, "There are too many about; I won't show it to you now;" and he put it back again, and I never saw it—after that they all three told Seagur that if he did not go out they would chuck him in the ditch; that they would not give him any money that night—presently Seagur went, and I heard no more of it that night—I communicated this to my employers a good while afterwards—I told Mr. Bailey about a week, I think, before the inquiry before the Magistrate—I met him coming from the factory to the railway, and told him of my own accord.</p>

               <p>"Well, I will find you work for the purpose of stopping till this job is over"—I did not ask him for work then, nor when I met him coming from the factory—I had not asked his foreman for work before that time—I had not been in any work at all between leaving Mr. Bailey's and going back there again—I did not tell Mr. Bailey on that occasion that the foreman was a thief; I told him a trick that he had done; that he sold Ned Davis a pair of shoes, and credited him with the money three weeks, and when he could not pay him he raised his wages 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day for that week to pay for them, and then he took it off again, and he said there was no one like Davis in the shop; that is all I told Mr. Bailey about the foreman—Mr. Fairley is the foreman—I am at work at Mr. Bailey's now, and Mr. Fairley is still foreman—the last place I was at before Mr. Bailey's was Mr. Dudgeon's, the shipbuilder's—I had not been out of employment four or live weeks before Christmas—I left one place to go to the other—the conversation I had with Joe Davis going home from work was while I was working for Mr. Bailey—that was about a month before Christmas, when I had been there about a fortnight or so—I live in Poplar, and he lives in Limehouse, and we both had to come the same way—some scores of Mr. Bailey's men live in the same direction—there were only our two selves walking together on this occasion—we did not want any one else to hear us—if we met together at the gates we used to walk home together—sometimes it would be about once or twice a week that we went together—I was present when <hi rend="italic">Ned</hi> Davis asked Joe Davis whether he had paid him for that 1 cwt., and he said he had—the conversation with Rosser which I have mentioned occurred a day or two after that; it was in the workshop; we work next to one another—about twenty men or so are working in that shop, I daresay—the whole of the conversation with Rosser was there—it was impossible for any one else to hear it; we were all six or seven yards apart, and Rosser and I were close together; and there is a large fan at work in the shop, so that they could not hear it—it was during work<lb></lb>ing hours—a foreman is present all day—we ceased working during the con<lb></lb>versation—we work by piece-work, and we often have a rest—it was before Christmas that I went to the Manchester Arms—we were in the public parlour there—I do not believe any one was there but the two Davis's, Rosser, Seagur, and myself—I saw Seagur given 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. by each of them—nothing was said in the room about what that was for—going home I asked <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> Davis what it was for—I did not ask either of the others—Seagur said before the Magistrate that the sixpences were a return of borrowed money—it was after that interview at the Manchester Arms, and before I went to the London Tavern, that I left my employment—I was not discharged—Mr. Fairley told me he was Black of work, and that I should have to look out another job at the end of the week; and at the end of the week he asked me to stay, but I would not—he did not give a different reason for my leaving—he told me if he had work he would keep me on as long as I liked to stay, and that if I liked to call at any time he would take me on—he said that he should not employ me, as I was too great a scamp—he never made any complaint against me—I know two persons named Belcher and Gregory—I did not send them to Joseph Davis, offering to stop away from this trial if he would give me a sum of money—Mr. Fairley has said that I lost a deal of time at my work—he has not complained to me while I was there of my mixing my day-work with my piece-work, and defrauding my employers—he has done so since this has been going on—he came up before the Magistrate and wanted to say so, but he never paid me for piece-work at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am storekeeper to Messrs. West wood and Bailey—Seagur was assistant-storekeeper, under me—Davis and Rosser were rivet-makers in the same employ—Edward Davis was generally making bolts and nuts, but in the same department—these men would bring an order from the foreman for, perhaps, 4 or 5 cwt. of iron for each man to go on with his work, and then the iron would be taken from the store; not all at one time, but, perhaps, part at one time and part at another—having got out 4 or 5 cwt. of iron, they would make their rivets, and then they had to bring or send them down to me, and I should weigh them and book them for them, as they were working by piece-work—Saturday was pay-day—our week ended in the Wednesday night, and commenced on Thursday morning—from Thursday to the following Wednesday I should book the weights which come in on each day, and add up the totals which come in at the end of the week, and so make out the amount for them to send into the office to the pay-clerk—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my writing—the person to whom I give the account would go to the pay-clerk and receive the money—the book in which I enter the weights is kept in a little office in the store, not under lock and key; it is merely laid down with other books—I should not always be in that office; I should be away at meal-times; I live just by—Seagur's duty was to do anything that was required to be done—he had access to the room in which this book was kept—this original entry of 13th November is in my writing—I believe the entry of the weight of rivets, bolts, and things on that day to be 111lbs. it is now 211lbs.—it was not altered by me—the original entry on 21st November is 1 cwt. 2 qrs. 14lbs.; it now appears 2 cwt. 2 qrs. 14lbs.—that alteration was not made by me—the original entry on 24th November was 1 cwt. 2 qrs. 14lbs. the 1 cwt. is now altered to two—that was not altered by me—none of these alterations were made by me—on 1st December the original entry is 1 cwt. 0 qrs. 13lbs. it is now 2 cwt. 0 qrs. 13lbs.—on 6th December the entry was 1 cwt. 0 qrs. 12lbs.; it is now 2 cwt. 2 qrs. 20lbs.—on 3d January it was 1 cwt. 1 qrs. 20lbs.; it is now 2 cwt. 2 qrs. 20lbs.—I believe in several places where there were quarters a 1 has been added, but I cannot positively several to them—I think that the figures I have spoken to are not my writing—I used to com pare their book with mine on the Thursday morning before the pay came ON—I had to make a daily entry in my book—I did not compare theirs daily with mine—I should not get it above once or twice a week—I add up the whole sum on Thursday morning, and place it on the book to send it into the office—I did not observe the alterations when adding them up—they go into the totals—I then enter the totals into this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to be taken to the pay-office—the person who is to get the money brings his book, and I see that his and mine correspond—he does not take this book to get the money; he takes a book that lie keeps, or a piece of paper—when an in order for iron is obtained from Fairley, I should see some of it go out at times, and when I was not there Seagur would.</p>

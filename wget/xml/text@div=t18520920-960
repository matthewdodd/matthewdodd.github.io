                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. John Sainsbury, of Croom's-hill, Greenwich. On 16th July, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came—I had seen him once before—I opened the door to him—he asked if Mrs. Sainsbury was at home, and I took him upstairs into a sitting room—I saw Mrs. Sainsbury go into the room with him—she afterwards came out, leaving him in the room, and asked me to get some water—I took the water—Mrs. Sainsbury gave it to him, and he was let out of the house—about I that day I had dusted an opera glass, which was lying on some books on the bookshelves; it was in a case—I know the case of this opera glass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I will not swear to the glass, I never opened it—I am quite certain the prisoner is the person.</p>

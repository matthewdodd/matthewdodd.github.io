               <p>Mr. Garrow. Whose guinea was it? - My Lord Chatham's.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was it not the porter's? - I never enquired.</p>
               <p>Who gave it you? - The groom of the chamber.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know it was Lord Chatham's? - Davis gave them me, and I put them in my Lord's pocket: Davis is not here: he said, it was by my Lord's desire: I do not know whose money it was.</p>

               <p>Court to St. Aubyn. What day was it you received this? - The night before I put it in the breeches, in the morning of the 14th.</p>
               <p>What became of the breeches? - I put them in the drawers in the dressing room: sometimes they are locked, and sometimes unlocked: the prisoner had been in the dressing room that morning, some time before eight o'clock: I heard him in the room, and saw him come down: (looks at the guinea) that is one of the guineas I marked: but I will not swear it is Lord Chatham's.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is it marked? - In one of the G's.</p>
               <p>Jury. The mark is in the O.</p>

                  </hi>. At the letter end of Jan., 1846, I was accosted, when I was passing through Little Britain, by a person apparently in considerable diffi<lb></lb>culty—he stopped me, and asked me if I would render him a little service—I asked what was the nature of it—he told me had purchased a horse of a man, and he would not let him have it—I went with him, and when I had got alongside the horse, the prisoner came up—he told me this was the person of whom he agreed to purchased the horse—after a little hesitation, I said to the prisoner, "Why don't you let him have the horse?"—he said, "It is worth</p>

               <p>more than I offered to let him have it for"—the man said he offered to let him have it at 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that he went to inquire of a person who agreed to have it at a figure, I do not know what, and when he got back the prisoner wanted 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Why don't you let the man have the horse?"—he said he wanted more for it—I said, "I think it is very unhandsome," and I was going away—the other man said, "For God's sake, don't leave me"—he urged me, and I stayed some time—I was coming away, and at last the prisoner said, "You shall have it for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "That was not the agreement; why do you want 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when you agreed for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I was about leaving, and the prisoner said, "He shall have it for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "I wish you good day"—I thought my services were at an end, but the other man said, "Do, pray, see the money paid, or he will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> me, after all"—I said I had no objection to that—I went into the public-house, and the other man took out a double handful of sove<lb></lb>reigns and put them on the table—he counted as far as eighteen, and the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "No, I will not let him have the horse"—I said, "This is singular—not let him have the horse? I don't understand it; I beg leave to leave the room, and have no further to do with it"—the prisoner said, "I will sell you the horse, but not this man; the horse is not mine, it belongs to an uncle of mine, a man residing at Barnett; I won't have any transactions with this man; my uncle would be very angry if he knew I sold this man the horse; my uncle and he have had some difference"—the other man said, "Will you pay for it?"—I said, "I have not the money"—he said, "Per<lb></lb>haps you can get it"—I said, "That is very true, I can do that, and double the amount, if that be all"—he said, "You will render me a great service;" and he said he would pay me the amount, and there was the money; and there appeared to be more money on the table than would pay for it—I said, "I have money at home, but I am some distance from home, I reside in King's-road, Gray's Inn-lane"—they said, "Well, we will take a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and go for it"—well, somehow, they induced me to go—they took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and both went to my residence, and into my drawing-room—I was about to pay the money to the prisoner, and the other man said, "Don't pay it here; perhaps the horse is gone; somebody may have run away with it"—I said, "That is a very good precaution; we will return and see it"—we went into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and went into another public-house, and the prisoner said, "I am now ready to take your money"—I paid him a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and he took the money—I paid him them for the other man—he was to deliver the horse to the other person on my paying him these notes—I said, "I don't want the horse, I have no place to put it in"—as soon as I had paid it, the other man tendered me a sovereign for my trouble—he had said he would remunerate me, and he took it out of his own pocket and gave it me—I took the sovereign—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "Now I will deliver the horse into your hands, and the other man will follow you"—we left the room—the prisoner went first, I at his heels, and the other man, as I thought, at my heels—the prisoner delivered the horse into my hands, at least the halter, and I looked round for the other man to put it into his hand, but he was gone—there was I standing with the halter in my hand, and surrounded by, I suppose, sixty of the lowest individuals—after about five minutes, a man came up and said, "Who does this horse belong to?"—I said, "I don't know that you have any business with the horse, I have got the horse in my charge"—he said, "I must not let it stand here, it is dangerous, it has got the glanders; I must take it to the Green-yard"—he put his hand up the horse's nose, and made it bleed, and he said, "Now you see it has got the glanders"—I at last sold the horse, after waiting here the whole Sessions—the prisoner was out on bail, and he eluded</p>

               <p>his bail—he was off-you yourself, my Lord, was applied to to estreat the bail, and would not do it—you said they ought to produce the prisoner—I sold the horse for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., after keeping it some time—I had to pay the expenses—I suppose I was out of pocket about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I kept it at livery, and advertised the sale of it, and nobody would take it—at last I got rid of it for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you say you were, or did you mention? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not say I was anything—I am independent—I have been a schoolmaster in London the greater portion of my life—this began by a perfect stranger accosting me in the street—I was induced by him to go to see the horse—he earnestly entreated me to interfere my services to get the prisoner to let him have the horse—I did not know the prisoner, but he well knew him—I am between fifty and sixty years of age—I did not interfere in favour of a person I knew nothing of—I did not interfere against him—I have stated what I interfered for, and three of the Grand Jury told me they did the same thing—I was urged to interfere in this matter—I was to get 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, but that argument was not tendered till after the prisoner said he should have the horse for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was going to leave three times before—it was pure good nature on my part—when I went to the place I saw the horse in the street—it was in my possession, perhaps from three weeks to a month before I parted with it—this occurred at the end of Jan. 1846—I advertised the horse—I do not know that I advertised it as the property of a gentleman—I am not in the habit of advertising horses—I never did so before—it was not the property of a gentleman who was going out of the country—I will swear that was not the nature of my advertisement—I cannot repeat the nature of that advertise<lb></lb>ment, but it was an advertisement for the sale of a horse, describing the height of the horse, and, as I thought, the qualities of the horse—it was about sixteen hands high, and I think it was an easy going horse—I had not ridden it—I meant by its being an easy going horse that it was not restive—I had tried it once—I think another quality was that it was easy in harness—I do not at present recollect the precise wording of the advertisement, but if you will read it I will tell you, as nearly as my memory will help me, whe<lb></lb>ther that was it—I will not swear that I did not state it was the property of a gentleman, but I did not say it was a gentleman going out of the country—I did not state it was a very good horse—I gave no warranty for it—before I advertised it I took it to a veterinary surgeon, and consulted him as to the value of it—I asked him, "What do you suppose to be the value of it?"—he said, "I cannot say; get what you can; what did you give for it?"—I said, "What I gave for it was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I have been at some expense"—"You will not realize that," said he; "you must make up your mind to get con<lb></lb>siderably less than that"—I said, "Has it got the glanders?"—he said, "No it has not, but it will last but a very little while"—I asked different sums for it—I asked 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should have taken that for it if I could have got it—I should then have been money out of pocket—the surgeon said I must get what I could for it—I was guided by him—I was a perfect stranger—in addition to the 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I did not get the amount of the keep, only a portion of it—I let the man drive it who had it at a stable—it was he who got it for the 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I forget how much I owed for the keep—I suppose the horse stood me in somewhere about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I got 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it and the keep—I forget what that was, and a sovereign I put in my pocket, but I cannot reckon that, for my time was worth more than that to me—that made 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found the prisoner on another charge at Worship-street, and no person appeared against him.</p>

            . My mother keeps this house in Gardener's-lane, York-street. I came down stairs, and saw them fighting; the deceased was called John Davis; they fought fair, and both seemed of an equal strength - they fell, and the prisoner was uppermost; they rose, and fought again - the deceased said he would not give in; the prisoner wanted to give in: the deceased immediately became very ill - the prisoner appeared very kind to him, and did all he could, and said he was sorry for it; the deceased was in a chair for about three quarters of an hour, and then died: his body was taken to the hospital; there appeared no ill-will on the prisoner's part - they were both about half tipsy.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he and the deceased were intoxicated - that the deceased had insulted him, and a fight had ensued, the result of which he deeply regretted. He received a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Wellington-terrace, Clapham-rise, I was formerly an attorney's clerk—on 16th April last I put an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times—</hi> it appeared on the 17th—the same day I received a letter by post; upon which I afterwards saw the prisoner, and she said she was my correspondent—(<hi rend="italic">ready</hi> "9, Denmark-street, 17th April, 1851. Would an appointment in the Naval Department of Somerset House, commencing at 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and progressing to several hundreds, suit the advertiser? or one in the first national commercial establishment, commencing at 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and progressing to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum? If so, either can be obtained; for the first, a premium of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be expected, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which would be expected at the nomina<lb></lb>tion, and the remaining 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on entering on the duties of the situation, or as might be convenient. For the second, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be paid on the nomi<lb></lb>nation. Should either of these suit the views of the advertiser, every particular will be explained by applying, in the first instance, to R. F., 9, Denmark-street, Soho. It will be necessary to state the age of the adver<lb></lb>tiser.")—I wrote a reply, to that address—this is the draft of it, on her letter. (<hi rend="italic">Thomas Blunden, policeman, produced a copy of a notice to produce the original letters,&amp;c., served on the prisoner on Oct.</hi> 28.—<hi rend="italic">Copy read:</hi> "Mr. Alex. Beale, of 1, Wellington-terrace, Clapham-rise, will be glad to treat with R. F., of 9, Denmark-street, for one of the appointments mentioned in R. F.'s letter, if R. F. will send further particulars, with the understand<lb></lb>ing that the whole of the turn agreed to be paid be deposited with some banker, to be handed over four days after A. B. shall have entered on the duties of his office. The age of the advertiser is 25. April 19, 1851.)"—I answered that letter—it was merely two or three words—I think I said I would call—I afterwards received this letter, marked "C" (<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "9, Denmark-street, Soho, 26th April,—Sir, I shall be happy to see you, as you propose in your letter, which I duly received; but as I should wish to see the Secretary of the Admiralty, as well as him of 'Lloyd's,' before we meet, I must not ask you to call before Thursday evening, 29th inst.; for as all the great world is out of town this week, J cannot expect to obtain an</p>

               <p>interview till the morning of that day; for, to tell you the truth, although I wish to make no boast, my claims are so strong, that I have been led to expect some appointment above the ordinary commencing salary; and it is to obtain information on this subject that I seek an audience. Perhaps, therefore, you will call Tuesday evening, about 7 o'clock, unless you hear from me to the contrary. In the meantime, I remain, Sir, yours faithfully, R, F. To Mr. Alex. Beale.")—I called at 9, Denmark-street, Soho, on Tuesday evening, with Mr. Fry—I was shown into a room, and found the prisoner and an old gentleman, who retired immediately I entered—the prisoner said she supposed I was astonished to see a lady; but she was the person who had corresponded with me—she said she was in a position to promise me an appointment, in consequence of the services rendered by her father to the shipping interest and to the Navy; and said she should require 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the expense of remaining in town, and to fee the clerks with a <hi rend="italic">golden key</hi> to give her the first information of any vacancy—I asked her what security she would give me—she said she thought the old gentleman who had retired, her landlord, would oblige her by giving her his acceptance—she said his name was William Menzies—I said I would consider of it, and left—I afterwards received this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "30th April, 1851. 9, Den<lb></lb>mark-street. Sir, I did not see my landlord last night, as he had gone to see an invalid friend, and was late; but to-day I explained that I should require security for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at six months' date, and that I calculated upon his long friendship and knowledge of me to become my guarantee. He consented to do so, provided his note-of-hand or his acceptance should be satisfactory; for, although very willing to serve me by any responsibility of his own, he would not put himself under an obligation to another person. There cannot be a doubt but you will be appointed before the period stated; so that I have no hesitation in accepting this kindness from him. If you saw Mr. Cooze, I dare say you heard that Mr. Menzies is an honest roan, and would enter into no engagement that he could not be prepared to meet. For myself, I need say no more than that self-interest will be a sufficient guarantee for the exercise of the interest I possess to urge your speedy appointment. If agreeable to you, perhaps you will call to-morrow evening, and then I shall hear your final decision. In the meantime, although you know my name, t will subscribe myself, Sir, yours faithfully, R. F. To Mr. Alex. Beale.")—After I received that letter, I called on her, and she said her landlord would give his acceptance, and said it was usual to bind the agreement by some<lb></lb>thing, and I gave her a sovereign—she sent out and bought a stamp, and I drew a bill on William Menzies, which the prisoner brought to my house next day accepted; and I paid her 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., deducting the sovereign I had let her have, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for interest, as it was a six months' bill—I had prepared a memorandum, which I gave to her—this is a copy of it—(<hi rend="italic">read: This was an agreement between Alex. Beale and Mrs. Fisher, that in the event of her procuring him a Government or other appointment, such as he is capable of undertaking, within six months, the bill which she holds shall be void; and that he will pay her</hi> 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">if the appointment be in the Admiralty, and</hi> 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">if it be in Lloyd's. Signed, Alex. Beale.</hi>)—after that time I had several com<lb></lb>munications with her, and up to 25th Sept. I had no appointment—I called on her a few days before Sept. 25th—she was ill, and I said I would call another time, and she wrote to tell me to call on Monday 25th—I went, and she said she had received a very favourable letter from Sir Francis Baring, the First Lord of the Admiralty, and I was to get an office from him—she showed me the answer—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "Admiralty, Sept. 17th.

               <p>R. Fisher. Dear Madam,—I much regret to hear of your loss of health, more especially as I have not yet been able to complete your wishes, which is much more difficult than you imagine. I can only repeat my <hi rend="italic">strong desire</hi> to serve you, even to your perfect satisfaction; and it <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> be done as soon as possible. One of the best things you can do is to go down to our country-house for a few weeks. The change will be of service to you, and my girls will derive both advantage and pleasure from your society. In the mean-time, we will hope something will present itself satisfactory. Let me know your mind on this, that we may arrange accordingly. Dear Madam, yours faithfully, F. Baring.")—I asked her to allow me to keep that letter—she said she should require 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before she went, that she must replenish her wardrobe, she should want two new silk dresses, and a few pounds in her pocket, to appear as a lady—I did not part with any more money—I had made some inquiries, and laid it directly before the solicitor to Sir Francis Baring—I knew it could not be genuine from the style of the letter; and the Result was, that the Admiralty directed a prosecution.</p>

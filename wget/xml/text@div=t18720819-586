                  </hi>. I am in the Service of Mr. James Steele, of 3 and 4, Jewin Street, City, ostrich feather maker—I am 18 years old, and have been employed 4 1/2 years there—on 22nd July I was returning from the Bank, and saw Adams, who is not here, in the street—I had a conver<lb></lb>sation with him, and on my return I repeated that conversation to my master—I saw Adams again on Tuesday, 23rd July, opposite the warehouse, but I did not speak to him then—on Wednesday, 24th, I saw Adams again coming out of the public-house at the corner of Jewin Street, about 2 o'clock—the prisoner was with Adams then—he had a basket under his arm—Spurling spoke to me first, and Adams was Standing by—Spurling said "I have a basket; I don't intend going home with it empty," and then we came to a public-house and went in—I had a glass of ale, which I believe Adams paid for—Spurling said "We had better not talk of this sort of thing here, we don't know who is about, but meet us both at Broad Street Station at 7 o'clock"—I said "I will meet you there"—I got to the Broad Street Station about 6.10—I saw Adams first, at one entrance to the Station, and Spurling was at the other—Adams beckoned to me and he whistled to Spurling, and then Adams and myself went into a public-house, and Spurling came in after—I had a glass of ale there—Spurling asked me if I had any "Cape primed tips;" that is a technical name in the trade—Spurling said "I can do very well with Cape primed tips, you know; 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per pound"—I said "I know what you mean"—Adams said "What would be the best time for us to come round to-morrow, to catch the governor out?"—I said "He will leave the office at 4 o'clock in a Hansom's cab"—Adams said "I will watch him away, Spurling, while you get the feathers"—Spurling told me to get a parcel all ready—I was to walk to the door with it up my back; under my coat, I suppose he meant—he said "I have one thing in particular to tell you, take your own string and your own paper, because the governor can't swear to his feathers, but he can to his string and paper"—I then asked Spurling whether he had anywhere to sell them—he said "Yes; they are sold in less than five minutes, and in a tub of wash"—he also said "Whatever we get for the feathers, you shall have a fair half"—Adams asked me if I was broke; he meant if I had any money—I said "I have money with me"—he said "Have four or five Shillings now"—I said "No, I do not want it"—I then left, and communicated with my master on Thursday morning—Mr. Steele made up a bundle, and I waxed the string, so that I should know it again—Spurling had said "I will walk up the street as soon as the governor is gone, and you be at the door, I will ask you about the peacocks, and then you hand me the parcel; I will swing it about in a careless manner, so as to avoid suspicion"—on Thursday,</p>

               <p>25th, Mr. Steele went away in a Hansom's cab at 4 o'clock in the afternoon—before he left I saw Adams, about 3.50, on the opposite side of the way—I had the parcel under my coat, and went to the door—Spurling came up Jewin Street, and said to me "I have called about the peacocks"—I said "Mr. Steele has just gone"—he said "Have you got it?"—I said "Yes"—I handed him the parcel—I saw the same parcel after the prisoner was in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Adams was the man that I first saw—I saw him six times and I saw Spurling three times concerning this case—I saw Adams on the 22nd, but I did not see Spurling till the 24th—Adams paid for the ale on the 24th, when he said "Won't you have four or five Shillings now?"—he knew that I was in the employment of Mr. Steele—my master has bought feathers of the prisoner, pheasant skins, not "Cape primed tips"—that was about two years ago—he is an itinerant poulterer.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective Officer</hi>). I had instructions from Mr. Steele to watch these proceedings—I was with Codrey on the 25th July, near Mr. Steele's warehouse—I saw the prisoner opposite Mr. Steele's premises—I saw Mr. Steele go away in a cab—two or three minutes after I saw the prisoner, about six yards from the premises, walking away with a bundle of white paper tied with string—I and Codrey followed him into Aldersgate Street, where he went into a public-house—he came out without the parcel—we spoke to him, and took him back to the public-house—the landlady handed over the parcel—I asked the prisoner what it contained; he said "Ostrich feathers"—I said "Whose are they?"—he said "They are mine"—I said "Where did you get them from?"—he said "I brought them from home this morning"—I said "What time?"—he said "About 9 o'clock; I have the invoice of them at home"—I told him he would be charged with inciting a young man in the employ of Mr. Steele, his master, in Jewin Street, to rob him of ostrich feathers—he said—"That is false; I did not incite him"—I also said he would be further charged with receiving those feathers knowing them to be stolen—he said "I did not know they were stolen"—he said he had bought them nine months ago.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">CODREY</hi>. I saw the prisoner come up to the door and Billings give him the parcel, which he took from behind him somewhere—I had seen Mr. Steele go away before in a Hansom's cab—on the way to the Court on the following morning he told me that he had been drawn into it by Adams—I said "Do you know Adams?"—he said "Yes; him and me used to be in business together"—I said "Did not you use to go hawking together in the country?"—he said "Yes."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This conversation was on the way to the Police Court—I gave evidence there of the receiving the parcel—that is all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an ostrich feather merchant, at 3 and 4, Jewin Street—Billings made a communication to me with reference to Adams in the first instance, and afterwards with regard to Spurling—he communicated to me after he had met them at Broad Street—he is in my service now—a parcel was prepared; my seal is inside, and it has been in the possession of the police ever since—I employed the officers—the value of Cape primed tips is from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per lb.; the feathers in this parcel are of inferior quality—putting the feathers in a tub of wash might interfere with their identity—I never knew the prisoner to be a dealer in ostrich feathers—I have known him many years as a poultry dealer.</p>

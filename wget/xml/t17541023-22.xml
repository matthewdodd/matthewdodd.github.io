               <p>Q. Did you see the handkerchief in the prisoner's hand?</p>
               <p>Alsop. I did not. That part of it nearest the prisoner was falling to the ground. He ran away before I said any thing to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons near you at the time?</p>
               <p>Alsop. No, my lord, none but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming from my work at St. James's market, and going to seek for more at Leadenhall, I saw the handkerchief lying; I ran to take it up, the gentleman turned about, I thought to strike at me, upon which I ran away, I was not got to it by 20 yards, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How near was the prisoner to you when you saw the handkerchief falling ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He was within the length of the handkerchief, the prisoner offered to kneel down and beg pardon, and said it was another boy that went to pick my pocket.</p>

On the afternoon of the 17th of April I heard a noise at my shopwindow; I ran out and called "Stop thief" - I saw the prisoner, and directly he heard me call "Stop thief" he ran and dropped this piece of handkerchiefs; they are my property and worth 30s., and had been in my shop a few minutes before - they could not be taken without cutting or breaking the window - when I returned I found a piece of the glass out of the window, and it laid inside - the handkerchiefs had been against the frame of the window, not against the glass, but within reach of a person who could introduce his hand - I had seen the window sound, and the handkerchiefs secure, a few minutes before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was your shopdoor open? A. Yes, certainly; any one could have gone in there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When they had entered the street-door, would there be any door to open to get into the shop? A. No, there is a small lobby.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor; he called my attention to the shop-window, I ran out and saw the prisoner; he heard my master call, he turned round, saw me, and dopped the handkerchiefs; he was secured by a gentleman when he got to Philip-lane, about three hundred yards from my master's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you? A. I shall be fourteen in November; I know it is a wrong thing to tell a lie - my master told me if the judge should ask me where I should go to if I told a lie, I was to say, I should go to the naughty place - he told me the prisoner would be tried for his life - the person who was running had his back towards me, and the handkerchiefs were thrown on the ground - I had seen three boys in the street within half an hour; I did not know them, the prisoner was not one of them, I did not see him; the three boys had been looking in at the window - the prisoner said he was the wrong boy, it was not him who took them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure he dropped the handkerchiefs? A. Yes; he turned his face and dropped them; he was stopped in about five minutes afterwards - I lost sight of him as he turned the corner, but I am certain of his person; he dropped the handkerchiefs a few yards before he turned the corner; it was half-past five o'clock, and good day-light - these are the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you a mark on them? A. Yes, the private mark, it is on these, we never sell them with that mark on them.</p>
               <p>MR. SWEETING re-examined. Q. Was any thing found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160048"></xptr>on the prisoner to account for the breaking of the glass? A.No, I suppose it had been cut with a diamond; it was certainly not broken - my house is in the parish of St. Giles without Cripplegate; it is my dwelling house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.How soon after you heard the noise of the window, did you get sight of the prisoner? A.About half a minute; he was four or five doors off; I had seen the prisoner before, about the house; I heard the window crack by drawing the handkerchiefs out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going in search of a situation; the handkerchiefs were thrown on my shoulder by three lads who passed me; I thought they were stolen and threw them off, when I heard a cry of stop thief.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Honor Oak, Villa Farm—on 7th April, between 3 and 4 p.m., I left the dining-room and went upstairs—the window was fastened by a catch—I left a silver teaspoon and a pair of sugar-tongs in the cupboard—I looked out of the upstairs window and saw a cart drawn by a grey horse—it stopped in front of the house which is in a private road—I saw the prisoner in the cart—I identified him in Newgate—he came towards the door, and not hearing a knock I opened the window and looked out and saw him spreading a rug on the grass in front of the window—I asked him what he was doing there—when he saw me he left the rug, and another man came out of the dining-room window at the same time—they both got into the cart and galloped off—I went down into the dining-room and found the window and sideboard open and I missed the sugar-tongs and a teaspoon—I was upstairs a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes.</p>

I did not give this evidence at the police-court because the case was not investigated—I made my statement to Mr. Stephenson, of the Treasury, about a month afterwards—I went to Newgate on the Wednesday before last Session with my husband—the detective did not point out the prisoner—I had seen the other man Smith before that at Hoxton—the prisoner was not standing next to Smith—he was walking round the yard—when then cart stopped the man was partly in a stooping position with his eyes to the ground, but I saw him come in at the gate—I</p>

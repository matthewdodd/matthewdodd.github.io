                  </hi>. I keep the Nag's Head public-house in York-road, Battersea—on the morning of 20th April I went into the bar and found the bar door open, a screw drawn out of the box-staple, and the staple drawn back—I found a wooden bowl which had contained silver the previous evening, lying empty on the counter—I went outside; a policeman was passing at the time; he came in and found that Rome one had gained entrance in the public parlour at the rear of the premises and that the perforated zinc blind that was put there was broken away from the window, and the window thrown up—any one could easily step in—I looked about and missed a tin box, containing above five pounds' worth of halfpence, from a cupboard underneath the counter; from a desk in the bar three pounds worth of silver, done up in separate parcels; and about one pound's worth of loose money from the till—I also missed a gold finger ring, three gold shirt-studs, and four silver spoons from the desk—I afterwards found the tin box up at the end of the garden, very nearly thirty yards from the house, empty—before that I missed an overcoat, a pilot jacket, and an ordinary coat, and discovered a cord jacket in the kitchen—this overcoat, studs, ring, and pilot jacket are mine—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the ring is not here—the four silver spoons belong to the executors of the late George Pinnock—this is the jacket I found in the kitchen—the bar was secure the night before—I did not fasten the window—I fastened the bar door and the outer door.</p>

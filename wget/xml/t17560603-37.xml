I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175606030040"></xptr> and found it so. I live in Westminster, and keep a maid servant in this house, and I go there in the summer time to lie as I think proper. I found the window was broke at the end of the house, and the shutter cut in three several places in order to get at the bar of the window. I missed a set of work'd curtains to a bed, a feather bed, a table clock, a alove grate, a brass sender, and two brass dogs, a sconce glass, a warming pan, and several other things not in the indictment, and I advertised them the next day. About the beginning of last month I was sent for by Mrs. Woodnut, a pawnbroker, who told me a man had brought two of the bed curtains, and the gilt sconce glass, to her house to pawn. I found there the curtains and the glass. She told me the man that brought them lived in Gardener's-Lane, Petty-France, at No. 13, where I found the prisoner, and several things belonging to me. The prisoner made great resistance, and it was with a great deal of difficulty he was secured, tho' I had two constables with me, but at last we got him into a coach, and carried him before justice Welch, where he confessed the fact. At first he said a man and his wife were concerned with him, but on the second examination he own'd he did it all himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any promises made to induce him to make this confession?</p>
               <p>Stonach. No, none at all. He own'd he broke the house between 1 and 2 in the night, and lodged the goods in a cow house, till he could carry them to his own house.</p>

            . Early in the month of May the prisoner at the bar came to my house with a pair of bed curtains to pawn. I lent him but a trifle upon them, because I knew the goods to be the prosecutor's property, and I was glad to secure them for him, so I sent him word, and he came and own'd them.</p>
               <p>John Sherwill the constable confirmed the account of taking the prisoner, and finding the rest of the goods.</p>

               <p>A person brought these goods to my house, and my wife accidentally took them in while I was out. I had some money by me, and I brought the things; but wanting to make up some money for my landlord. I was obliged to pledge them.</p>

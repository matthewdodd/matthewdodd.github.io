On Thursday, the 29th of August, two tubs of oysters stood on a form and chair; a gang of nine or ten boys came up, Redford took a tub of oysters, and Goodridge took the form and chair; one of the others took another tub. I went after them, and one of them, who is not here, threw all the water over me, and hammered the tub about my head; I found the form and chair at my door broken to pieces next morning; the tubs and oysters have not been recovered.</p>

I know no such person as Boyce, and have not spoken to him on the subject; I always said I could swear to them, and never said they did not intend to steal them.

            , JUN. I went to the prosecutrix, and spoke to her about Goodridge. She said when she came into the office, that that boy had been with others taking oysters - but she never saw him before - that he took the stool but not the oysters, and she could swear he ran away with the stool; but never saw him till he came up after the oysters were taken, which was half an hour before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said at first that she said he was with those who took the oysters - A. She called him one of their companions. She said some of the oysters were taken an hour and a half before; but I think she said some were taken not long before, and that she first saw Goodridge about half-past eight o'clock. She said she only saw him when he ran away with the stool, and that the oysters were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110101"></xptr>taken just before, and he was not one of those who took the oysters, not that he was not there when they were taken.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to ask these questions of her - A. I live next door to the boy's master, and he asked me to go to see how the case stood with his apprentice, and when the prosecutrix came in, I asked her what the lad had been doing.</p>

            .

               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know they were knocked about before he left work - A. I understand it was done at eight o'clock; he did not run away with the chair.</p>

Redford called on me at eight o'clock, and went with me to Shoreditch - and did not leave me till a quarter to ten o'clock, and was then half a mile from the prosecutrix's house; I am as confident of it, as that I stand here; and when he left me, he said he was going home to supper.

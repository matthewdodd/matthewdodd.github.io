               <p>I am a salesman and dealer in clothes; on Monday morning the 4th of August, the prisoner came to me and said I have a coat and waistcoat I will shew you; I am very particular in keeping their bags out of the shop when they come to shew goods, but he threw his bag into the shop and took out a coat and waistcoat; I had information from Mr. Rose, and I stopped the prisoner; I asked him no price at all; the prisoner said he gave thirty shillings for the coat and waistcoat, Mr. Rose came and owned the coat and waistcoat; I asked the prisoner if he had any thing else in his bag, and he said, only an handkerchief; I said it would be better to have a search warrant, where he said he had them from; he gave Mr. Rose two or three directions in Gravel-lane, Hounsditch; we turned the bag topsy turvy and found the remainder part of the things there; then he said he gave fifty shillings for the whole.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Rose. My Lord, I believe from the construction of the window (though I was gone out out of the room a few minutes before) that it must be a more active man that could get up to the window, than this man can possibly be.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Rose. You do yourself a great deal of honour by saying that.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Rose. In my own conscience I cannot suppose this man to be the thief, though we have lost the things.</p>

Two or three months before the transaction in question, I sold the prisoner a French gold watch for seven guineas, which he afterwards paid for, and called frequently afterwards to have it regulated. On the 24th of November, 1821, he called and asked for two gold watches, which were to be as good as we could make, and said he was commissioned by a young nobleman, who was then in the country, to send them down. I shewed him several, he asked me to pick out two such as I could recommend; I did so; one was worth forty, and the other forty-five guineas, I said, I hoped he would not consider it unreasonable, if I asked the nobleman's name; he said, it was a case of great delicacy, and I must excuse him, as the young nobleman did not wish his friends to know he was purchasing expensive watches, I let him have them, one was to be kept and paid for within ten days, and the other returned. He took them away, and called as usual to have his watch regulated for a month after, but never mentioned the watches till I pressed him; I think it was not more than fifteen days when I spoke to him about them, (he might have called four times before,) he said the young nobleman had received them, but it was the shooting season and he was not able to send him up the particulars; in a few days I began to be impatient, and asked him for a settlement as the time was exceeded, he said, the young nobleman was subpoenaed on a trial at York. I saw him again in about a month, he then said, the young nobleman was obliged unexpectedly to go out of the country. I saw him several times afterwards, the last time was when I called at his house one Sunday, in Cheyne-walk, Chelsea; he then said it should be settled immediately, that he had got into some difficulty by procuring articles for the young noblemen. I afterwards made an affidavit of the debt, and put a writ against him into the officer's hands, (looking at the affidavit,) this is it, it is dated, May 1822, it was never executed. I have never recovered our watches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You knew his name, and where he lived - A. Yes, (looking at a paper.) I gave him this, it is merely the particulars and price of the watches, but is not a bill. I never entered them in my books as sold to him; when stock was taken at Christmas, a memorandum was made about them, he promised me an answer in ten days at his own suggestion, I went with Redford the officer to get him arrested several times; I always saw his wife; I do not recollect telling her I had come for the money. I proposed taking a bill in order to get the officer in to arrest him; he did not come to my shop for a considerable time before I issued the writ, I never saw him after it was issued, except on a Sunday.</p>

Their horse and cart stood on the near side of Holborn. When the prosecutor's waggon was coming along. Berry and Sullivan made up to the waggon, and looked into it, and then came and spoke to the third man and England. Their horse's head was then turned round, and Sullivan went to the off side of the waggon, and kept close to the tail of it. After following it some time, I observed somebody on the tailboard; the moment the cart came to <placeName id="t18160214-46-crimeloc269">Smart's-buildings</placeName>

She said, what do you ill use the man for. I secured the man, and took England into custody. The next morning, I went with Furzeman after Berry, and apprehended him.

            . On the 4th of December I heard Mr. Pickering say to the prisoner, go to Drury-lane and fetch a load of tallow: he went through Bow-yard, Mrs. Pickering said, that is the wrong way. He said it is the right way to where I am going. I went to the prisoner in Ludgate, and I asked him how he could go to sell Mr. Pickering's cart and horses? he said, I own I am a rogue, but Gilbert is a bigger, for once before I sold him a cart and two horses for three guineas and half, and he sold one of the horses for six pounds, and what he did with the cart and other horse he did not know. He said then he had sold these, and he had taken two guineas of the money, if not more; Watson was with us at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. to Watson. What did you hear the prisoner own ?</p>
               <p>Watson. I cannot recollect any thing more than I said before; Biggs was there at the time.</p>

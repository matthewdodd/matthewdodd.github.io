I am the wife of Henry Keane of 60, Lower Sloane-street—the prisoner came to lodge with me on 10th September, last year—he said he was a butcher—he did not carry on any business while he lodged with me, that I am aware of—his wife also lodged with me—on 5th October he sent for me to his room, the back parlour on the first floor, and asked me could I change him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I said, "Yes," I could do so, as I had just got my rent by me—I brought him four sovereigns and two halves, and he handed me over a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I said to him, "I hope it is a correct one, for I am no scholar, and I cannot tell a good note from a bad one"—he said, "It is quite correct, Mrs. Keane, I assure you"—I took the note downstairs into my kitchen, and placed it in my desk—I had no other note of the kind there—I left it in my desk, and took it out on 25th October—the desk was locked during that interval—I then sent it by Mary Ann Brooks, a lodger of mine, in part payment of my rent, to Mr. Cooper, my landlord, and 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with it—on Friday, 29th November, the prisoner again sent for me, and asked could I change him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note again—I said, "No, that I cannot; I could not have changed you the other one, had I not have had my rent by me"—he said, "Have you got any change by you at all?"—I said, "Yes, I have got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, "Well, will you let me have that, that will do for me to go to market with to-morrow morning"—I went, and brought him up two sovereigns and two half-crowns, and gave it to him, and he handed me the note—I took that note, and placed it in the same desk where the other had been—I had no other notes there—I locked it up safely—I took it out of the desk on 5th December, and took it over to Mr. Bradford's, a neighbour, who keeps the Fountain public-house—I got the change from him the next day, and I went up to the prisoner, and paid it to him, deducting the rent, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that I had advanced to his wife—I first heard of the notes again on 11th December, when Mr. Cooper came to me—in consequence of what he said I went up to the prisoner, and asked him, did he know the date of the first note he had given to me—he said he did not, but he could partly tell the time he gave it to me—I said I was aware of that, and went down<lb></lb>stairs—Mr. Cooper then told me the note was a bad one—I went up again to the prisoner, and asked him who he took it from, for it was represented to be a bad one—he said he took it from Mr. Jacobs, in Covent-garden-market, a wholesale dealer in fruit and apples—a few apples did come one Saturday to the prisoner's place; that was a week before he gave the note to</p>

               <p>The prisoner worked for me: Last Wednesday evening, a person called upon me, and I got two officers, to search the house of Mr. La Valte, who keeps an old shoe shop in Little Pultency-street; the one officer to apprehend the prisoner, and the other to search the house; we found eleven or twelve pair of shoes, of the prisoner's make; three of which I could swear to; with two other pair, that were brought to me on the preceding night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that from any mark upon them? - A. Yes; I went immediately to Bow-street, and the prisoner was committed to take his trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the three pair the prisoner's work? - A. I cannot be sure; the two pair that were brought the preceding evening were; he has worked for me some time; I am so used to his work, I can tell it from any bodies else.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. If the shoes are for the shop, do not you mark the inside, 3, 4, or 5? - A. Yes; they are marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you ascertain the fact, of having delivered more shoes out to him than he returned? - A. That must lie with the foreman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You cannot say, that you missed any shoes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But, for the information of this man, you would not have known that you had lost any? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say, you missed any? - A. I cannot say that I have; I have so large a stock, I could not miss five or ten pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your clicker here? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know of Mr. Peake's shoes? - A. I know nothing of Mr. Peake's shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to your house, and claim any shoes? - A. Yes, he did; afterwards I shewed him the shoes I had got; he picked out five pair, with his mark, and said, they were his.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this? - A. Last week; I went along with Mr. Peake, to Bow-street; that is all I know.</p>

               <p>On Thursday last, the 14th of January, Mr. Peake applied for a search warrant; I went to the house of Mr. La Valle, and asked him, if ever he bought any shoes of the prisoner; he said, yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you a particular mark to each workman, when you deliver them out? - A. No; the same mark to all.</p>
               <p>Q. How many workmen does Mr. Peake employ out of doors? - A. I don't know.</p>

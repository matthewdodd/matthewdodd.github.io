                  </hi>. I keep the London Spa, Clerkenwell. The prisoner Henry was eight months in my service—I never saw the female prisoner till she was in custody—I entered the boy's room on the 16th of January, with my maid-servant—she took a box from under his bed, and found in it a brooch belonging to one of the bar-maids, and some works belonging to a roasting-jack—the key of my wine-cellar was found on the boy when the officer took him, the same evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was at Mrs. Goddard's house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183502020138"></xptr>
               <p>on the evening of the day when the brooch and the works of a jack were found—I fetched the police-sergeant from the station—the boy was searched in my presence—some things were found on him, which led to further inquiries—and upon going to his mother, with the officer, we found some things there—amongst others, an apron, which I identified as Mrs. Goddard's, as it had been stained by a lotion which she had used to her leg some months ago—there is only one drug that will stain so as not to be ob<lb></lb>literated.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Why were you in this prosecution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I am frequently there attending Mrs. Goddard,. and have been for five months—I did not see the stain on the apron the moment it was done, as it requires time to dry; but I saw the apron was wet with the lotion, as it was put under her foot to prevent the stain on the carpet—I was applying the lotion, and some was spilled—it was at her house, about three months ago—I cannot say what time of the day it was—that has been the case every day, nearly—I have a handkerchief in my pocket stained in the same manner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mrs. Goddard. Henry Dady lived then as pot-boy—I was up stairs with my mistress when she said she wished to look into his box—I took it into her bed-room, found the brooch and the brass work which had been lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I went to the mother's house and asked if she had a son living at the London Spa—she said Yes, she had seen him on the Tuesday before—I asked if he had brought any thing home—she paid "No"—I said I had him in custody for stealing a brooch—she then brought this pint bottle of wine out of the cupboard—she was going to tell me about some other things—I said she had better not—she said she wished she had sent the first bottle of wine back, and Mr. Goddard would have forgiven her, and her dear little boy too.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This has been a jolly prosecution? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We certainly, in going to Westminster, had a glass of ale and a cigar—the doctor and I went there seven times—I have a smelling-bottle and a brooch, beside what is in this indictment—when I went to the mothar's house, I saw a woman in the room under where she lives—we left word that her son was ill—Dr. Whittell said, he was afraid he should be obliged to send him to the hospital—we waited in the street till she came home—she said she thought there was no harm in receiving a little wine from a gin-shop.</p>

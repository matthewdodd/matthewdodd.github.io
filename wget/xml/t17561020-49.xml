            . I labour in the gardens, at Mr. Banks's. There were some hens missing, who took them I can't tell; but I am sure they were at roost in the barn the night they were lost.</p>

            . I lay in bed, in the barn where the hens roosted, and a child about ten years of age with me. Between ten and eleven o'clock two persons came in. I heard a stranger ask where he was got now. The prisoner answered him, and said, d - n your eyes don't speak a word. After this I heard three fowls taken from their roost. I believe four, by the fluttering of their wings. I heard them kill them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. No, but I know it was he that said that, for I knew his voice, being used to him, morning, noon and night, and in the night he spoke it with a sentence. There was but a little dog-house between us.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be certain how many hens were taken from their roost?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. I can swear to four of them, that were intirely killed.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. They were taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. They were not left there.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. On the Saturday before Michaelmas day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the justice?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. I was; I heard the prisoner examined, and swore that it was his voice I heard there that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. He felt to abusing me, not attempting to justify himself as a man would do. I knew him by his voice, for I have heard it early and late; I have heard it thousands of times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say nothing for himself before the justice?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. He said, Sir, I know no more of it than you do, I have not been there since my master discharged me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>That night these fowls were lost I was at work for a butcher in the town; I came home and went to bed, and did not go out till nine o'clock next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. to M. Taylor. You hear the prisoner, is that the same voice you heard in the barn?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. It is the very same voice.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it that you heard the voice in the barn?</p>
               <p>M. Taylor. As near as I can tell it was betwixt ten and eleven; it was just before a hard shower came upon us.</p>

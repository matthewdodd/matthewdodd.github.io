            . Coming out of Marybone-Fields on Sunday Evening, I saw Sutton and Baker* and two more going in. As I knew the Characters of Sutton and Baker, I concluded they were going upon some Mischief. In three Quarters of an Hour, I was told there had been a Robbery, and I said, I thought so. I went to Mr. Turst, next Day, and his Brother came in, and brought a Pistol, and Mr. Turst's Wig, which, he said, were found in the Field where the Robbery was done. I ask'd Mr. Turst, If he should know any of the Persons who robb'd him? and he said, Yes, very well; and he believ'd there was one of the Suttons (for there's two Brothers of them) if not both.</p>

            . Two or three Days before the Robbery, I saw Sutton and another, buying a pair of Pistols, at a Broker's in High-Holbourn.</p>
               <p>Rovert Draper. The Morning after the Robbery. I found the Prosecutor's Wig and this Pistol in the Field where it was done.</p>

            . I keep a Broker's Shop, in High-Holbourn. About ten Weeks ago, two Men came into my Shop, and ask'd for a Case of Pistols. I shew'd them a pair, they look'd on them, and ask'd the Price, I told them 10 s. or 10 s. 6 d. I forget which, they laid them down, and went away. In a little time, they came again, and another Man with them, and said, they were dear; I told them I would take no less, and then one of them gave me a Shilling Earnest, and said they would fetch them before Night, and at Night two of them came, and brought the rest of the Money and took them away.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the Prisoners?</p>
               <p>Sheldon. No; I don't know that I ever saw them before.</p>
               <p>Court. At what time of the Day were those three Men at your Shop?</p>
               <p>Sheldon. About the middle of the Day.</p>
               <p>Court. Draper, are you sure that Sutton was one of the three Men you saw looking on the Pistols in Sheldon's Shop?</p>
               <p>Draper. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. At what time of the Day was it?</p>
               <p>Draper. About one a-Clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Shew that Pistol to Sheldon.</p>
               <p>Sheldon. This is one of those Pistols I sold to those three Persons that Day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Simonds. Enquire into the Character of Berry, Draper, and Sheldon; they live by nothing but taking Mens Lives away.</p>
               <p>Berry. I belong to the Brick-Field, where the Prisoners and a great many other loose Fellows frequently take up their Lodging. I have seen, I believe, 40 of 'em there; and if you come any Day between two and three a Clock, you'll be sure of seeing some of them.</p>
               <p>Court. We don't desire to meet 'em there, but if you'll bring 'em hither, we shall be glad to see 'em. The Jury <rs id="t17330912-36-verdict181" type="verdictDescription">

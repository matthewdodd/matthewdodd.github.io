               <p>When he came to your house, did he say from whence he came? - I do not recollect, I paid it to him without asking him any questions; I thought he was servant to Mr. Down, I never paid him any money before.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner at the bar, he was a servant of mine about 7 or 8 months ago; I do not recollect whether I ever sent him to receive that bill; he kept my books before the 12th of July, when I discharged him; after which he had no authority to receive any money on my account. At the time the prisoner went to receive it, on the 19th, it was owing me; I did not send him any where to receive money after I discharged him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you positively discharge me? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never was positively discharged; I was desired by Mr. Down to call on him now and then, and if he had any thing he would employ me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Eltham—I was formerly servant to Mr. and Mrs. Engleheart—I lived there four months—the family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Engleheart and two children, Constance and Percival—the girl was the eldest—there was no other servant but me—Mr. Engleheart was in the habit of going to business in the morning and returning in the evening—on Friday, 31st July, he left as usual to go to business—in the afternoon the child Constance dirtied in the dining-room—I had put the tea-things in the dining-room—at that time my mistress was upstairs—the child was on the floor, and the milk-jug upset—I heard Mrs. Engleheart come down stairs from her bed room into the dining-room—she called me up from the kitchen—she said the child had dirtied itself, and told me to get a cold bath and put it in the sink in the back kitchen—she said she had promised her a cold bath, and now she should have it—I got the bath ready, and put it in the sink—Mrs. Engleheart undressed the child upstairs, and brought her down and put her into the cold bath—the child was quite naked—she tied a duster round its mouth, and then put it in the bath, and she dipped its head in two or three times while it was in the bath—the water was in a tin hip-bath—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she then took the child out and wiped her, and put her on the edge of the sink to drip—it was a stone sink—she then stood her on the floor and wiped her, and then she gave her some cod-liver oil out of a bottle—she gave it her out of the bottle—she put the bottle in the child's mouth, and poured it in—the child spilt some on her breast and shin, and then she put her in the sink, and pumped on her—she held her with her left hand, and pumped with her right—the child's head was on the sink under the pump—she pumped on her four or five pumps—she took the duster off its mouth when she took her out of the bath, and threw it down at the side—the child did not cry out when she was put into the bath; the duster was in its mouth—when the mother was wiping her she gave her a slap with her hand, and then she cried—she struck her first, and then the child cried—she did not cry when she was being pumped upon; she was quite quiet—when she had pumped upon it four or five times she wiped it, and took it upstairs—the child was kept in the cold bath about ten minutes, I should think—she was not up stairs above two or three minutes, before she came down with the child insensible—during that time I was in the kitchen—I did not leave it at all—I was in the kitchen the whole time—the kitchen-door was open—the stairs are close to the kitchen-door—I did not hear anything during that time; no sound as of anything falling—the kitchen is so near the stairs that if anything of the weight of a child had fallen from the top to the bottom of those stairs, or even half-way, I must have heard it—when my mistress came down with the child insensible she said she had let it bide too long in the cold bath, and ordered me to get a warm bath—I got a warm bath, and she put it into it; it was this same bath—it did not recover at all—she told me to go in to a neighbour's and get some brandy—I went to Mrs. Wood's; Mrs. Morrison was at the gate, and I asked her little</p>

               <p>girl to go for the doctor—Mrs. Morrison came in first—I was there when she came in and asked what was the matter—my mistress told her that she had let the child stay in the cold water too long—I afterwards saw Mrs. Morrison point out a bruise on the child's head, and she asked how it came there—my mistress said she had let it fall down stairs—that was the first, time she said anything about the child having fallen—I was there when it died; about 5 o'clock in the morning—this took place about half. past 5 in the evening—it was about 6 when Mrs. Engleheart told this to Mrs. Wood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon living at Eltham—on Friday afternoon, 31st July, about a quarter to 7, I was called to Mrs. Engleheart's to see the child—it was in a state of collapse, almost pulseless, pale, and I thought was going to die immediately—I remained with it about an hour—it died about 5 in the morning—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—I found that the cause death was extravasation of a large quantity of blood on the</p>

               <p>brain—there was an external indication to account for that, a large bruise on the right temple—there was a recent bruise on the top of the left foot, and several minor bruises, old bruises—those were the only two recent bruises that I observed—I look on the bruise on the right temple as un<lb></lb>doubtedly the cause of the extravasation—the lungs and all the other organs were healthy—no other portion of the body indicated anything serious, or likely to cause death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. BLAKELEY</hi>. I was examined before the coroner, I had attended the deceased child before—I attended it about a year ago—it was a weakly child, suffering from general debility—I recommended it, amongst other things, cod-liver oil, and an occasional cold bath with salt in it to strengthen the system—I think a child ought not to remain longer than about five minutes in that bath—cod-liver oil will occasionally act upon a child as an aperient—I did not see the child put into the bath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The evidence given by the prisoner before the Coroner was put in and read as follows</hi>:—"I am the mother of the deceased child; I gave her two doses of cod-liver oil on the Thursday. I did not give her any on the Friday morning; as stated by my servant Jane. On Friday we dined at 2 o'clock. After dinner the child sat on the stool in the dining-room. Between 5 and 6 o'clock the servant came up to ask if I would have the tea. I said, 'Yes'—I went up stairs to dress; the child remained with her picture-books; she said, 'Here comes Jane with the tea; I shall get good now"—Jane brought the tea-things up before I left the room. When upstairs I heard the rattling of the tea-things. I ran down; the door was open; a cup was on the floor, and the milk upset; the child had dirtied itself, and dirtied across the carpet I called for Jane, who came up directly, and said, "Oh, what a naughty girl! I have not left the room a minute." I told Jane to bring down the bath from upstairs, and I said to Jane, "I've many times promised her a cold bath, and now she shall have one." I took the child down into the back-kitchen, and there undressed her; Jane got the salt, and put into the bath; I tied nothing over the mouth of the child at first; I stood her up in the bath, and washed her. Jane said, "Can I help you?" Jane washed one arm and hand. A duster was then brought, and it was tied round her head over her month; I then dipped her into the bath, head and all; I then stood her on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186309210079"></xptr>
               <p>floor on an apron, and wiped her; I sent for the cod-liver oil bottle, and poured some of it into her mouth; some came over her. I held the child over the sink, and Jane pumped. The child was perfectly quiet. I wiped her again, and carried her up stairs at once; I put her down on the landing, and told her to go into the room, and put her night gown on; she did so, and came back to my room. I saw she looked very cold, shaking very much. I said to her, "You are a stupid little monkey to do those things; you are cold;" she said, "Yes, ma, I won't do it again." I said, "If Jane has got any hot water I'll put your feet in. "I was going to bring her down stairs; my long dress sleeve caught in the bolt of the gate; she fell over the balusters on to the stairs, about half way down, and then rolled further down. I called out, "Jane, Jane, <hi rend="italic">Conny</hi> has fallen over the stairs. "Jane did not come. I went down stairs and met Jane, who came in at the back—door. I told her <hi rend="italic">Conny</hi> had fallen over the stairs. She said she had been in the back garden to empty the bath. I asked for hot water, and told her to bring it. I told her to go to Mrs. Wood, and to send for the doctor. Mrs. Morrison came in directly, and I told her I had let the child fall over the balusters. Three or four minutes afterwards Mrs. Wood came in; the doctor came in afterwards.</p>
               <p>The only statement I made to Mrs. Morrison and to Mrs. Wood was that the child had fallen over the balusters. I said nothing about keeping the child too long in the water. I never struck the child; I corrected her as a mother would. I never ill-used the child. I never struck the child that afternoon. She was always crying. She was very fractious. She was a little weakly child; a slight gust of wind would blow her down. I never struck the child with the stick produced. The child ate the chilies of her own accord, only one. I was up stairs only two or three minutes with the child. I did not knock the child's tooth down her throat on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>I noticed the child had lost a tooth, and I did not know what had become of it until Jane told me she had found it in the motion which passed from the child on the Friday. The bath was emptied, and the carpet was taken into the garden before I came down with the child. I deny the statements made by Jane; they are untrue."</p>

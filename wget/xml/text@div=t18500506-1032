                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's father, and am a fellow-ship-porter. In April last we were living at the Hope public-house in Gravel-lane, Southwark—my wife has been dead six years—I only occupy one room—the prisoner has lived with me since her birth—she has never been to service but three days—she will be nineteen next August—on Tuesday morning, 16th April, she woke me about eight o'clock—I had been asleep up to that time, and had not seen her preparing my breakfast—she woke me, and said, "Father, your breakfast is ready," and brought me a cup of coffee, and some bread and butter on a small tray—I stirred the coffee round, and tasted it; it tasted very unpleasant—I said, "Louisa, you have put something into the coffee," and spat it out—she said, "No, father"—I tasted it a second time, and was forced to spit it out again—my mouth and lips were very much parched, and my teeth shook—I felt a sensation of burning, and said, "Louisa, you have put poison in the coffee?"—she said, "No, father, I have not"—she then took the cup off the tray, and threw the contents into a washhand basin containing the water I had used the over night—she then took the cup to the fireside, rinsed it out with water from the kettle, and wiped it out—she threw the water under the grate—I got out of bed, and tasted her coffee, which she was drinking at the table—that had no unpleasant taste—I dressed myself, and put the contents of the basin into a clean jug, covered a handkerchief over it, and took it to Dr. Wood, of Union-street—in consequence of what he told me, I took it to Guy's Hospital—I then went back, and found the prisoner crying—I sent for a policeman, and gave her in charge for attempt<lb></lb>ing to poison me—she said to the policeman that she had dropped a piece of soda by accident into the cup—I afterwards gave the cup to Thomas Andrews, an assistant at Guy's Hospital—about a week afterwards, I gave a bottle and the coffee-pot to the policeman, and the soap which I had washed with the night before—I had used the soap several times in the interval, but not the coffee-pot—the bottle I found in the cupboard—I had had it for years—it was empty—it used to have oxalic acid in it twenty years ago, and was used for cleaning boot-tops.</p>

The prisoner and her father have lived there twelve months—I know that he has beaten her once or twice in that time—about two months before this occurrence she came into my room one morning, between eight and nine o'clock—she appeared very much excited—I was making my bed—she came in, and said her father had been beating her—I asked her what for—she made me no reply—she asked me to unfasten her dress—I did so, and found wheals with a slick all down one side of her, where her father had been beating her—she said if her father beat her as he had done, and kept her without clothes, she would purchase a pennyworth of vitriol, and would burn her clothes, and give him the contents afterwards—they lived very unhappily for seven months—at another time she came into the room, and told me her father had taken her down to the station the pre<lb></lb>vious night—I asked her what for—she said for pledging her father's clothes—I said, "I thought that was forgotten, Louisa; your father said he had forgotten it"—she said, "I made up my mind before my father should lock me up this morning; I had placed a razor in my own bed, and made up my mind that I would cut his throat, and put the razor at his side afterwards."</p>

On 16th April, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, Hartley came to the hospital—I received a jug from him covered with a handkerchief—I told him Dr. Taylor was not at the hospital, but I would take charge of it for him—he brought it down to the chemical laboratory by my wish, and I emptied the contents into a glass vessel, which I had ascertained to be thoroughly clean—the jug having a handle and lip, I could not cover it well—I covered and sealed the vessel in his presence—before that, I put a piece of litmus paper into it, which is coloured blue; it turned the blue to red—here is a small piece of the paper which I threw down, being of no importance, and Hartley picked up, and took before the Magistrate next day—I gave the sealed vessel and contents to Dr. Taylor—on the 23rd, I received a coffee-pot, piece of soap, tea-spoon, and an empty bottle from Squire—I gave them to Dr Taylor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Professor of Chemistry and Medical Jurisprudence at Guy's Hospital. On 17th April, I received from Mr. Andrews, my assistant, a glass vessel—I unsealed it—it was completely secure—it con<lb></lb>tained a brown-coloured liquid, very acid, about thirty ounces, a pint and a half—I tested a portion of it—it had the colour and smell of coffee diluted—the acid element was vitriolic or sulphuric acid—there was about half a tea-spoonfull of strong vitriolic acid in the thirty ounces—taking into account that the coffee was not stirred up, I do not think there could have been appreciably more acid than I detected—if a person had tasted the coffee it would be detected by the lips—I tasted it, and detected it immediately—there was a small quantity of sugar—I applied all the tests for common poisons, but discovered no poi<lb></lb>son but sulphuric acid—the cup would hold half a pint, and therefore, about</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185005060129"></xptr>
               <p>a pint most have been added to it—I received a bottle, a cake of soap, a coffee-pot, and a teaspoon—the bottle appeared quite dry—I examined it by a very delicate chemical process, and found it had contained sulphuric acid some time or other—I tried it for oxalic acid, but it was not oxalic—oxalic acid would be more likely to adhere to the sides of the bottle in a dry state—if the bottle had contained oxalic acid, and vitriolic acid had been put into it, it would have removed the oxalic acid, and so have defeated the tests for oxalic acid—I examined the coffee-pot; it contained no trace of vitriolic acid, but when I warmed in it a small portion of the liquid, it immediately dissolved a small portion of iron from the pot, which was a consequence of its containing acid; there was no iron in the original liquid which I put into the pot—I examined the soap, but found no acid in it, except a small quan<lb></lb>tity combined with sulphate of soda; but there was probably not the third part of a grain of soda in the thirty ounces—what I found, could not account by any possibility for the acid in the coffee—we find vitriolic acid in all soap, but in very small portions—soap is made with common carbonate of soda, which is roughly made, and contains a little sulphate of soda, from which it is pre<lb></lb>pared originally—the acid could not have been in the basin when Mr. Hartley washed his hands, it would have prevented the soap dissolving; in fact, it would have affected the fingers, and he must have discovered it—if the soap had remained in the water all night, it would not have added to the quantity of vitriolic acid in the basin—whether it came in with the coffee, or in any other way, I cannot say—I am able to say it was mixed after the coffee was prepared and removed from the pot, or else added to the water in the basin—I detected a small quantity of soda, but no more than would be accounted for by washing the hands with the quantity of soap dissolved in the liquid—an adequate quantity of acid would have counteracted that—I do not think the quantity of acid in the cup of coffee-would be sufficient to cause death—a person might drink it, but the pain of doing so would be acute—I ought to state, that the injurious action of vitriolic acid depends more upon its concen<lb></lb>tration than its quantity—the proportion of vitriolic acid to the quantity of coffee, was 150 parts of coffee to one part of acid—I have tasted that strength of acid myself—a person would feel a dryness or parched state of the mouth, and a sharp sort of feeling of the teeth, which is called setting on edge, and if the whole contents of the cup had been swallowed, he would probably have suffered from vomiting, pain in the stomach, and soreness of the throat in swallowing, but I believe that in a few hours the whole of those symptoms would have disappeared, and he would have recovered without medical assist<lb></lb>ance, and without any injurious consequence; in fact, the acid coffee was very little stronger than that which is sometimes given in an ordinary acid gargle—it would not have the effect of destroying the surface of the mouth, but it would produce a whitish appearance by acting on the saliva—I clipped my hands in it, and put it to my lips and tongue, and made my assist<lb></lb>ant taste it—it would alarm a person, and so perhaps give him a stronger sensation of pain; but the whole quantity would only occasion temporary uneasiness.</p>

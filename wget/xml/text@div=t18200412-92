            . I am in the East India Company's service. On the 13th of April, about ten minutes past six o'clock in the morning, I was passing along Brick-lane, and saw the prisoner and another man coming out of the prosecutor's shop; they had a bag, through a hole in which I saw that it contained some boots. The prisoner turned to the left, and the other to the right - the prisoner kept the bag. I then went to the shop, but could make no one hear. I afterwards went in search of the prisoner, and got sight of him. The other, on turning round, and seeing me running after them, left the prisoner with the bag. I still pursued the prisoner, and came up with him in Spitalfields-market, collared him, and took him to the watch-house - he was running at the time; I am quite sure he is the man. I saw the bag examined; it contained two pair of top-boots, one pair of Hessian, and one odd Wellington boot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Whitehouse, a laceman, in Oxford-street. On the 10th of April, the prisoner came for an artificial I flower—she selected two, which came to 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave me a crown-piece—I gave her the change—I put the crown-piece into the till—there was no other crown-piece there—somebody came in about five minutes after, and said something to me—I went to the till, took out the crown, and found it was bad—no one had been to the till during that time—I showed it to Mr. Whitehouse—he marked it with an H—I then returned it to the till, and kept it there till Saturday, the 12th of April, when I gave it to Hardwick.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Is there not a stout lady goes to the desk in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mrs. Whitehouse is rather a stout lady; but she was not there then—when you purchased the flowers you said you had a bad head<lb></lb>ache—I am confident you are the woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I never was in the shop that day; I know it because I lived in the neighbourhood; when this witness came up, she said she had no mark by which she knew me; she never said I was the person.</p>

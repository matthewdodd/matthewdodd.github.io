About eleven or twelve in the night she asked me for a pinch of snuff; I took my two 5 s. 3 d. pieces out of an iron snuff-box, and gave her a pinch; I was going home some hours after in the morning, and wanting a pinch of snuff, I went to feel in my pocket, and missed my box with the two 5 s. 3 d. pieces, which I had put in the box again, and I know I had them two hours after she had taken a pinch of snuff. I went back to the alehouse, there was the prisoner; I charged her; she desired to be searched; the landlord found two 5 s. 3 d. pieces in her bosom in a piece of a pocket-handkerchief; she then said she took them out of a joke; after that she used me and my husband and the landlord very ill, and said she would prosecute us if we did not her.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a coffee shop, in Chiswell-street. On the last Thursday in Jan., the prisoner was there from 7 till about 10 o'clock at night; I did not see him go out of the shop, he was there when I began to shut up the shutters, and when I had closed them I did not see him there—I went to bed about 11 o'clock, I heard a noise in the course of the night, got up and listened, but thinking it was some of my lodgers I went to bed again—I was afterwards aroused by a policeman ringing the bell; I found the front door open, and one of my lodgers standing near it; I did not miss anything till the morning, when I missed about 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper; a packet containing 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and two half francs which had been in the cash box—I missed about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—I found this pair of pliers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and gave them to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 60, Redcross-street. I have seen the prisoner there several times—the last time was the night after Mr. Ayres' robbery—he was with three others—he had two pints of cocoa, two pints of coffee, and four loaves and butter; he gave me a half franc, a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him it was a half franc, and not a sixpence—he said, "Do not you take half francs?"—I said, "No"—and he gave me a sixpence.</p>

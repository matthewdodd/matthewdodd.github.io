            . I keep Penny's Folly in Islington-road, facing the Reservoir. The prisoner and three more men came into my house on Monday morning the 4th of March about a quarter after eight o'clock, they asked for some hot wine. I made a quart hot, and lighted a fire in the room fronting the road. They asked for breakfast, which was got. They had two or three more quarts of wine after that, and paid for every thing as they had it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any boxes?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No; One went out to fetch a horse; which of them I can't tell. In about a quarter or half an hour the horse came to the door. I offered to put the horse in my stable, which they refused, and said, perhaps they might not stay ten minutes, or perhaps they might dine. They were consulting backwards and forwards, sometimes one, sometimes two were out together. Presently I heard the found of gold. I went in to see if they were gaming, but I could not perceive that they were. One man and Hopkins went out together; when they had been out about four or five minutes, the other two came to me and said if the gentlemen came and enquired for him he desired I would tell them they were gone to the Brown-Bear in Smithfield. I forgot to mention that I saw one box opened, and I saw some lace in it; it was such a box as these.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who brought them?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I did not take notice. The man that told me that went out and the prisoner took the wallets off the table, and put them across the horse; the boxes were in the wallet. I held the horse, and he went down the road very easy; my house is built fifty feet from the road. I went as far as the road for a fight, and came back very gently.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any part of the conversation, when the four men were in the room?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No; I heard no talk about the lace. I lifted it up at the end and saw it was lace, while the four men were in the room. I was no sooner come in doors, than Hopkins came back and enquired what was become of the gentlemen? I told him they were gone to the Brown-Bear in Smithfield; the prisoner rode upon the horse. I did not observe which way the other went.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who brought the boxes into the house?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the prisoner might bring them for what you know?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard no noise or disturbance in the room?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No; only once; as I said, I heard the sound of gold; when I went in, all was quiet.</p>
               <p>Q. Any person there might have purchased the boxes for what you know?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. I looked upon them to be companions together.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know that these are the boxes?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No; they were such boxes as these.</p>

We went to the house and searched it; we found there this empty box; we could not find any more boxes, or any lace in the house. He said, you need hunt no further, for the lace I did buy of one Mr. Vivason; I sold it again to a gentleman in Spitalfields, whose name I don't know. Langley sent for a gentleman that he sold it to. He came to their house, and said he had sold it to a gentleman in the Borough. He said, I did not know, Mr. Langley, that it had been stoln, or I would not have bought it of you. He said, if you will go to any tavern in the Borough, I will see and have this lace sent to you. We went to a house; and a porter came in about half an hour, with two boxes, and enquired for Mr. Langley.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, and live in Charlotte-street Fitzroy-square. On the night of the 13th of December I missed some books from a shelf in my window, which was open—I looked into the street, and saw the prisoner running—I followed him down Windmill street and John-street—I came up to him in Colvill-court—he was not running then—I took hold of him, and asked him for the books he had taken from my window—he said he would give them to me if I would let him go—he took ten books from his hat, and gave them to me—a policeman came up and took him in charge—I know the books to be mine—I had seen them about five minutes before—I gave them to the officer—on my return I missed forty-eight books, these are ten of them—I had not left my shop unprotected in the interval.</p>

I saw a man running up John-street throw some<lb></lb>thing away, and run up the court—I picked the books up, and put then into my hat—the prosecutor came up and said, "Where is the large book you took of mine"—I said I had no large book—he said, "Give me the Acting Drama,' and I will let you go"—I said I had some small books which I had picked up, and gave them to him.</p>

There was nobody else running in that direction—he could not have picked them up, for he ran all the way till he got to Colvill-court—I did not observe how he carried his hat when I first saw him running—he ran about four hundred yards—I did not see him stop and pick up any thing—it was ten o'clock at night—I missed the books, looked out, and saw him running—I thought I had lost the "Acting Drama," and said, "Give me that, and I will let you go"—but I afterwards found, instead of its being that large work, it was forty-eight books—I lost sight of him in Colvill-court for a moment, just at the turn of the court—I first saw him about fifteen or twenty yards from the shop—my house is one from the corner—I saw him directly I turned the corner—I did not call out "Stop thief"—he did not run very fast.</p>

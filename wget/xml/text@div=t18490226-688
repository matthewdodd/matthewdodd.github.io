                  </hi> I am a widow, and live at 12, King-street, Drury-lane. On 7th Feb. I Lived at 74, Dudley-street, St. Giles's—I knew the deceased—she came to my house between twelve and one o'clock that night, without any bonnet, cap, or shoes, and said her husband had turned her out—she came into my bed, and slept till seven—about a quarter-past seven the prisoner knocked at the door—I said, "Who is there?"—he said, "It is me; you have got somebody here belonging to me; open the door"—I said directly I was dressed I would, and directly the panel of the door came through, and he came in, came round to the bed, and hit his wife twice on the head with his fists—he then dragged her off the bed by the heels, two or three yards, just by the window—I have no bedstead, the bed is on the floor—he then took her by the shoulders, hit her head several times on the ground, and kicked her several times in the ribs—he never spoke, nor did I</p>

               <p>or his wife; she made no resistance—he tore something off her, and then went out of the room, calling me an awful name—I got out of bed and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the poker after him—his wife laid there as if she was dead, and never moved—I afterwards saw the prisoner on the Dials, and said to him, "Mr. Manley, I am afraid you have killed your wife"—he said, "I am going up.

               <p>I had taken his wife and made her drunk—we were not bad friends—I did not take up the poker till he entered the room, and never resisted him; he never spoke to me—I did nothing until he called me the name, and then I got up and threw the poker after him, and dressed myself—I think he knocked her head five or six times, very hard blows, on the ground, and about twice on the body with his fist—he kicked her two or three times—I thought it was on the ribs—it appeared to be violently—he bad his boots on—I cannot recollect whether anyone refused to give us any more drink that night, as we had bad so much—I have never had anything belonging to Mrs. Manley in my place, but the blind which he tore down that morning; that made a great disturbance.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, at 4, High-street, Bloomsbury. I saw the deceased about half-past eight o'clock in the morning—she was quite dead, and was not cold—by the order of the Coroner I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found a rupture of a blood-vessel on the brain, which was the cause of death; the brain was in a very diseased state, and there had been previous inflammation, and old adhesions were left—there was no disease in any other part of the body to account for death—there were no marks of kicks or blows about the body, or any external violence—if there had been such external violence as to occasion death there roust have been some indi<lb></lb>cations of it—the rupture of this blood-vessel was such as might have been produced by violence—I found the brain completely distended with blood, and the vessels in such a fragile state, that a shake or fall would produce the rupture that caused death; a fall would do it—I am certain it was not a kick that did it, or I must have found the mark of it—if a man had thrown her on the ground, and the vessel had been immediately ruptured, there would have been no external indication—the brain was in that state, that a <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> or fall from pulling a chair away would have caused death—there would then be no external indication; it was as similar to apoplexy as possible—there would be no time for discolouration—it was in the ventricles, the most important part of the brain, where the blood was effused—I can distinguish between a blow given before and after death—there would be no marks if the blow was given after death.</p>

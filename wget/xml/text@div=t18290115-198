I was present when the prisoner and the shopman were called up and told that a black veil was missing, and a length of silk, and asked if they would have any objection to let us look into their boxes: the prisoner said,"Not the least in the world;" Mrs. Edwards and I went up stairs - the prisoner went first and my sister followed her immediately; her box was locked - she opened it herself with a key: I found in it five or six parcels done up in brown paper; Mrs. Edwards opened them - some contained the gros de Naples; there were three lengths, measuring thirty yards, worth about 4l., some calico for linings, silk handkerchiefs, caps, lace, ribbons, and a black lace veil; she remained in the room and cried, and said she was very sorry; we brought them down, and showed them to my brother - I served in the shop, and know them to be his; I had missed one length of silk, and the veil - I had seen them three or four days before.</p>

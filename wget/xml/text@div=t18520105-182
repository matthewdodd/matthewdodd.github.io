               <p>11 o'clock, I was coming along Percival-buildings, leading into Whitechapel—when I came to the London Hospital public-house, at the corner of the buildings, I saw the prisoner and the deceased—I saw the prisoner bit the de<lb></lb>ceased on the forehead, and he fell backwards on the kerb-stone—the prisoner fell over him—I went and caught hold of him, and asked why he hit the man in the way he did—he said, "Because he hit my father-in-law and I would hit any man that hit my farther-in-lay"—I took him into custody—my brother constable came up, and attempted to lift the deceased up—I saw that his head was bleeding—he was taken to the London Hospital, and died—the prisoner appeared to have been drinking, but Was not drunk.</p>

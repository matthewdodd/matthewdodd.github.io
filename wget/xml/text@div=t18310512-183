            . I am a servant to Mrs. Wilkins, of Aldersgate-street - she is a baker. On the morning of the 10th of May I was going into Charterhouse-square, about eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner running out of the square with Mr. Robertson's basket on his back; I followed him to Bridgewater-gardens, where he put it down, and was going to take some bread out of it - I said he should not take any, the basket belonged to me; he said the basket was his own, and he would soon let me know that; he went down a court, put the basket down, and said if I followed him any further he would knock me down - he took the basket, and went down Playhouseyard; I saw an officer, and he took him.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BRADFORD. I took the prisoner going along Playhouse-yard at a moderate pace, with this basket; I asked whose bread and basket it was - he said his own; we were counting the loaves - he tried to escape, and almost pulled his coat off; I put the basket down, took him into a butcher's shop, and secured him.</p>

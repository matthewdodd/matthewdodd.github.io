                  </hi> I live with John Dible, at 18, Princes-street, Whitechapel-road—the prisoners lived in the same house. On Monday morning, the 16th of Aug., the female prisoner was having words with me concerning the swater. and told me as I was going out that she would give me a mark that would carry me to my grave—I came home with Dible about ten o'clock at night, and as I was going up the stairs to my own room the female prisoner came out of her back room—I had not got up any of the stairs—I was just at the foot of the stairs, just going up—Dible had come from his work—he was just behind me—the male prisoner was in his room along with his wife—I did not see him when she came out—she began to abuse me about the</p>

               <p>water—I turned round to speak to her, and Dible told me to go up to my own place, and not to have any words with her, he would leave the place—I im<lb></lb>mediately turned out of his hands to speak to her, not to have any words with her, I was going up stairs after what Dible said, when I immediately received a blow on the head with a chopper that she had in her hand—I saw it—she had a candle in one hand, and the chopper in the other—it was a little bit of a hatchet with an iron blade—I do not remember whether the candle remained alight, or not, for I was knocked quite senseless, and fell on the foot of the stairs, and cut my mouth—Dible took me up stairs, and I was afterwards taken to the London Hospital—I had my wound dressed and came out the same day—I was an out-patient—I cannot say that I saw the male prisoner at the time I was struck with the hatchet—when Dible came back he was bleeding.</p>

                  </hi> I am a drover, and live at No. 18, Price's-street, White<lb></lb>chapel. On Monday, the 16th of Aug., about ten o'clock at night, I was coming home—I had had two pints of beer—I was going through the pas<lb></lb>sage, and found Ellen Ryder having a few words with Mrs. Shea, concerning water—the prisoners were both standing at the door—as we were going up stairs, I said to Ryder, "Come up stairs, don't talk to the <hi rend="italic">rubbish</hi>; I don't mind what they say," when she received a blow—I did not see it struck, for I was going up stairs at the time—she immediately fell down on the stairs, and the male prisoner struck me on the head with some sharp instrument, I do not know what—I did not see any instrument—here is the mark—I became insensible from the blow—I believe they put the light out—as soon as I recovered myself, I conveyed Ryder up stairs the best way I could, and placed her on a chair—I then came down to fetch a policeman—I found out outside the door, and gave the prisoners into custody—I was taken to the hospital, and had my head dressed.</p>

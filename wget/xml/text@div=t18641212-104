               <p>was near Angel-court a man came up to me, as I thought wishful to ask a question—he put his face close to my ear, and being a little shorter than myself, I held my head down, in order to hear what he had to say, as there were a great number of people about—at the same moment he snatched at my chain—I had no overcoat on then, and my chain was hanging down—he broke the chain in two and ran away, leaving a small piece—I imme<lb></lb>diately supposed that he had the watch, and followed him, holloaing out, "Stop thief!"—Angel-court is not more than three yards from the place where the man took my watch—it is not a thoroughfare for horses; it is about four feet wide—I followed him down Angel-court, and just as I got into the court, I saw a man there, who I at once concluded was au accom<lb></lb>plice—I passed him, and he followed me for about twenty yards, and then I felt a blow at the top of the hat—my hat was knocked to pieces; the blow was very severe, but it did not hurt me—he still kept following me—I then holloaed, "Murder!" and "Police!" as loud as I possibly could, and another blow was struck me by the same man, which knocked a hole in my hat, and had the effect of knocking me down—it did not render me quite insensible, I think—the man who snatched my chain escaped; I did not see his features—the prisoner is exactly the figure and style of man—I picked him out from twelve others afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a comedian, of West-street, Mile-end—on the evening of 5th November I was in Whitechapel about ten minutes to 6—I was in the rear of Mr. Marshall—I saw the prisoner walk from the kerb to the pro<lb></lb>secutor, make a snatch at his chain, and run down Angel-alley—I have no doubt whatever that it was the prisoner—I afterwards picked him out from a number of men at the police-court—when I heard the prosecutor call out "Murder!" I went down Angel-court and saw a man I could not recognise, at the back of him, strike him on the head and run away—there was a light where the prisoner snatched the chain, right underneath, about three yards from the pavement, quite sufficient for me to see his features—there is a lamp projecting from a public-house right over where the prisoner snatched the chain.</p>

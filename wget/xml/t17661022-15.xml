No, I did not; she had a bundle with her; I did not speak to her; when I came down, I missed all the things, and found the window wide open; then I ran up into the street, I could not see her, but I called out I had been robbed; she was taken and brought back in about ten minutes, and the things also.</p>

            . I was standing at the gate-way where I work, and saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's house with a bundle, and run down the street; as soon as she turned the corner there was a hue and cry after her; I and another person pursued, the prisoner went into a chandler's shop, there the things were found in a coarse apron, such as I saw about the bundle when she came out of Mrs. Spong's house; the prisoner was secured.</p>

            . I was told the prisoner went into a chandler's shop, I went in after her and stopped her in the passage; I went on into the yard, seeing she came from that way, and I found the bundle in the necessary-house, in a coarse apron; we took her before the Justice, there Mrs. Spong swore to the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in the necessary?</p>

               <p>Five weeks before the last sessions I bought half a peck of beans of Shock-a-Tory; I was asked who I bought them of, I told them; they said, you know he makes short measure: as I was going along they came and took hold of me, and pulled me by the cloak, and gave me such a black eye, the swelling fell down just like a lump of blood; I was taken to Westminster, then brought down here to Newgate; they broke my door open, and here is the key of my room; they left me nothing in the room but my bare bedstead; I sent a penny-post letter for a woman to come, I sent her for some things to shift me; she told me all was gone but my poor bedstead; then I heard my gown was in pawn, and the woman that pawned it was gone a hopping; then I heard it was hanging up in Broad St. Giles's to be sold; I was frighted when the people and Shock-a-Tory dragged me about, as bad as I should be at a man with a naked sword; I got into a place where was no thorough-fare, and was just coming out in the mouths of all my enemies when they seized me; I never saw an inch of the things till they brought them before the Justice.</p>

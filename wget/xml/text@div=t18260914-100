               <p>JOHN PROSSER. On the 5th of July, about eleven o'clock at night, I was opposite Buckingham-street, in the <placeName id="t18260914-100-crimeloc600">Strand</placeName>

I called the watchman, who was the only other person in the street, and he picked up the handkerchief close to where I had seen the action of the hand.</p>

            . I was crying eleven o'clock, and heard the gentleman crying out Watch! I saw this handkerchief laying in the middle of the street, and took it up - I said to him, "I have got your handkerchief;" I had seen it drop, but cannot say from whom; the prisoner was about two yards from it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

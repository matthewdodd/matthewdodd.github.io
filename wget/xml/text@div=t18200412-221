The window had been broken before, and having been frequently robbed, I attached it by a piece of wire to a bell. I stopped the hole that had been made in the window by a compass box, and had so placed it that if it should be moved it would ring the bell - on the 30th of March, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning the bell rang - I was not down stairs at the time.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Richardson, and was in the shop when the bell rang. I was aware of the bell, and then looked towards the window, and saw that some one had pushed the box aside. I saw the prisoner's hand in pulling out the telescope, I then went and took him about thirty yards from the window - he had it partly out, and I saw him with it. The telescope was at one side of the box, and it was removed about six inches from the place it was first in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. There was a compass-box removed to make room for a persons hand - A. Yes; the telescope was removed six inches towards the hole. I saw the prisoner's face, and am quite sure that he was the lad that had his hand through the window - there were two other lads with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw two lads looking into a window, and after they were gone, two young men came and immediately charged me with taking the telescope. They took me to the shop, and he said</p>

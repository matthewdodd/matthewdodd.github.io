I am in the employ of Charles and Robert Gerard. I was at Lord Suffield's on the 31st of December, repairing the offices - there was a quantity of lead found in the prisoner's room, under his bed and about his room; it was old lead, which had been taken from Lord Suffield's offices - he was clerk of the works, and had charge of the lead and all the works; the lead was found under the bed, behind the bed, and in his boxes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you the man who has obtained the prisoner's situation since he went away? A. No. The lead was not all in one place; it was not under my care.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at East Acton. On Sunday afternoon, 24th May, I turned out a black mare pony, about 13 1/2 hands high, on Old Oak Common; on Tuesday morning, 26th May, about 5 o'clock, I went on to the common and missed her—she was worth about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never seen her since—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. On Monday evening, 25th May, I was on Old Oak Common, at a little before 8 o'clock, and saw the prisoner come by on Mr. Marshall's pony, which I had seen frequently before; it was of a rusty colour—I said to William Davis, "This is Mr. Marshall's pony"—the pri<lb></lb>soner went about ten yards further, and said, "Where is your father?" I said that he was at home—I did not know the prisoner; he then went away on the pony—I know the prisoner by his right eye and by his face generally; I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Old Oak Common. I was with Oxley on Monday evening, 25th May, on the bridge on the common, and saw the prisoner riding a rusty black pony, which I knew to be Mr. Mar<lb></lb>shall's, having seen it five or six times before—the prisoner asked Oxley whether his father was at home; he said, "Yes"—I afterwards saw the prisoner at the police court—there was no other pony on the common which could be mistaken for Mr. Marshall's.</p>

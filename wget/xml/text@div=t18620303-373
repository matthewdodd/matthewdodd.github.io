                  </hi>. I am eleven years old, and live near the Blackfriars-road, with my father and mother—on Saturday night, 15th February, I was near Christ's church, just about a quarter to eleven—the prisoner said, "Hi! will you go and get me two ounces of salts, and when you come back I will give you a penny"—he told me where to go, he pointed to a chemist's shop—I went there—before going he gave me a half-crown to pay for the salts—I went to the shop that he pointed out, and got them there—I gave the half-crown to Mr. Herbert, and he immediately told me it was bad—he asked me where I got it, and I told him that a man by the church gave it me—he gave me the salts—I went out, and Mr. Doughty told me to go on and his assistant would come—I did not see the prisoner directly I got into the street; it was about two minutes before I saw him, and then he came up and said, "Where's the salts and the change?"—I offered him the salts—he did not want it; but said, "Where's the change?"—and the gentleman came up, caught hold of him, and said, "Here's your change."</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Doughty at 26, Blackfriars-road, a chemist's shop—on this Saturday night, the last witness came there for two ounces of salts, and gave me a half-crown—I found it was bad—I gave him the salts and kept the half-crown—I let him leave the shop with the salts—I went to the back door and then went into the Blackfriars-road—I saw the boy speak to the prisoner—I heard the prisoner ask for the change—upon that I laid hold of him, and said, "Here's your change"—I met Osborne, a constable, and gave the prisoner into his charge with the half-crown.</p>

               <p>fetch me two ounces of salts, and I would give him a penny; he went and I stood talking to this young man at the corner, awaiting his retain; I saw him coming along by the church and the shopman and another boy with him. Had I known the half-crown to be bad, do you think I should be so foolish as to go direct up to the boy and ask for the salts and change? it stands to reason, if I had known the half-crown to be bad I should have made off as quick as possible. When the shopman laid hold of me I did not try in any way to get away from him, but I went back direct with him. I was searched at the shop, there was nothing more found on me, nor at the station-house, where I was stripped and searched again. Had I any more on me, or had I tried to pass another at another place, it might look something like guilt; as it is, a man may take a piece of money without knowing it to be bad I took 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the docks, and to my misfortune the half-crown turned out to be a bad one.</p>

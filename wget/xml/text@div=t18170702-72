On the 4th of July, at six o'clock in the morning, I was called up by a knocking at the door. I was the last person up at night, and fastened the doors before I went to bed, which was about a quarter after twelve o'clock. I examined every thing, and saw the doors and windows all fast. My family consists of my wife, son, nephew, niece, and servants. I had been in the parlour before I went to bed-there is a bookcase there. I did not leave a candle there. In consequence of the knocking at the door, and what I was told, I came down undressed - I did not find any person in the house. The street - door was shut, but neither locked nor bolted - I had seen it safe when I went to bed; there are two bolts, a chain, and a lock to it. I found the door of my library open, and every thing that laid in the front<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020032"></xptr>taken out. On the edge of the bookcase, there were marks of a candle which had been burning, and marks of fire; it was not burning then, the candle was not in the candlestick. The prisoner Bull lived servant with me for two years and one month, and quitted my service about three months ago; I searched my house and missed a great quantity of things. My son's name is William, he is twenty-two years of age. The room-window was also broken open by cutting a pane of glass out by the fastening, undoing it, and lifting it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CURWOOD. The shutters and windows were quite open; if they had had daylight, they had enough to do without lighting a candle.</p>

On the night between the 3d and 4th of July, I went to bed about half-past twelve o'clock, I went to sleep and awoke as I heard the clock strike two, I heard something like the breaking of a bottle almost immediately, and persons walking about the rooms over my head. After the clock struck three, I heard somebody come down stairs to my door, it was not locked; I did not hear them go away again; I heard something like the wrenching of drawers and locks; they did not come into my room. I was afraid to get up; I did not get up until my master called me.</p>

            . I am a milkman. On Friday morning, the 4th of July, I was going from the barn with my milk; I was passing Mr. Cartwright's house; I turned round and saw the prisoners, Fitzwilliam and Wilkins, come out of Mr. Cartwright's house, they had bundles with them, each of them had a bundle, or more than one each; I saw them go round the corner; I then saw the prisoner. Bull, standing inside the house holding the door and looking at me, thinking that I was watching him; Blyth came up, and we both went over to the house, and just as we got up to the door the prisoner, Bull, said,"what do you want?" and shut the door in our faces, it was not shut before. I am certain that he is the man; I knocked at the door twice, Mr. Cartwright came to the window we told him, he came down. Before he came down, I looked through the key-hole and saw Bull going backwards; I saw a light from the back of the house so as to see that he went through the passage; I told Mr. Cartwright that there was a man in the house; we went round to the back of the house, and saw Bull getting over the paling of Mr. Cartwright's house; there is a brick-field there; he got over before we could lay hold of him; I sent Blyth round and he secured him. I told Line, in the presence of Bull, that he had been robbing the house, and there had been two more gone out with bundles, and told him which way they went. I am sure the other two persons are the men I saw come out of the house.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BLYTH. The last witness has spoken correctly; I know the three prisoners; I saw them - I saw Bull in the house that morning, and afterwards took him. I am sure he is the man; I saw him getting over the wall. I am certain he is the man I saw at the door.</p>

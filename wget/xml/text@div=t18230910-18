            . Conway directed me to watch about the prosecutor's house. On the 10th of July, about six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner go round the house - he had nothing then; I afterwards saw him come out of the house with a basket - I followed, and secured him, and found two bottles of beer, and about a quarter of a peck of potatoes in it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I desired Gates to watch these premises. I afterwards obtained a search-warrant, and searched the prisoner's lodging at Finchley, and found some knives and forks, soap, candles, wine, cider, and several other articles. I took him before a Magistrate, and produced the property in his presence - what he said was taken down in writing; (looking at the examination) this is signed by Mr. Owen, the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Examination read. The prisoner says the knives and forks are Mr. Herring's - I had a few friends, and borrowed them. The cider and table beer are his. The potatoes the gardener gave me.</p>

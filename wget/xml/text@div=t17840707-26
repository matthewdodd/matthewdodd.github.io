               <p>Who was last up in your house the night before? - I cannot say, either myself or my wife, or the chamber-maid, but I rather think it was not myself for this reason, I had some shivering sits on me like an ague, and I went to bed rather soon.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it day-light when you was alarmed? - It was light very soon; when the prisoner was brought in to me, I searched him, and found a tinder box, with matches and tinder in it, which box is here, and a pawnbroker's duplicate, but nothing of my property; there was a watch, which I am now in possession of, which was the prisoner's; the next morning when we came to search, we missed about seventeen tea spoons and five table cloths, (which are still missing) and a pistol; that was found again and brought back to me by some of my people who found it in the field, I cannot say which of my people it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, Council for the Prisoner. You could distinguish one servant from another when you came down by day-light? - I could distinguish the prisoner immediately when he was brought into my house.</p>
               <p>But when you first came down stairs was there day-light enough then without candles to distinguish one person from another? - There certainly was sufficient light.</p>

               <p>Both of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see them again? - Yes, at Justice Wilmot's Office; the prisoners are the men, there were two candles in the room, and I was in my bed without curtains facing the door; I saw their faces plainly, I am quite sure these are the men.</p>
               <p>How long might you have a view of them? - About half a moment, very little more, only just while they looked round the room, I saw them afterwards; as soon as they were gone I got out and went after them, I went softly, I then saw them both in the bar.</p>
               <p>What light had you then when you saw them? - They had a large candle, they were breaking the desk open, and pulling out the drawers, and I had the same light to see them; then I went back to my own room, and went out of the window, and called one of my master's sons up, he slept in another house, my window was on the ground floor; when I came back I called one

When my fellow servant called me up, I went with all the haste I could down the yard to the gate, it was fastened, I went round the farm yard and came to the kitchen door, which was open, and the yard door was open, and there was one of the great candles by my master's writing desk, the backs of the prisoners were turned towards me, one of them turned his head and I thought he saw me, then I said damn your body, what are you a doing there? with that Holmes caught hold of the pistol, and he run at me, damn your body, says he, I will shoot you dead; with that I says, shoot, shoot, and be damned; I had this stick in my hand, I struck at Holmes and missed him, and he knocked me down with the pistol, or with his hand, I am not sure which; away they ran out of the kitchen door down the yard, I followed them as well as I could, but I could not get up just in a minute, one of them was taken before I could get up with them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt. How far was he from the house when you first saw him? - I believe about one hundred yards, I did not see him till I got into the field.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt. Then your principal reason for apprehending Mash was, because he came to see the other? - We had information, and we thought he was the man.</p>

               <p>Did you see the prisoner Mash at any t ime on the 23d of June? - Yes, he came to my door at half after twelve, and asked me for a light, I was undressed, and did not open the door immediately, I put on my petticoat and went to the door, then it might be something later; I am very sure it was the 23d of June, because it was the Wednesday, and the Friday was the 25th, and I had a little trifle to pay; I saw him go in with the light to the next door.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any thing extraordinary in this man's calling that night? - He was taken up the 25th.</p>
               <p>Did you say this then? - I did not know he was there.</p>
               <p>Where was your husband? - He was down at Paul's Wharf, he is a porter, bringing up goods to market, I was obliged to sit up till that time of night to call him, sometimes one and sometimes two, as soon as the tide serves.</p>
               <p>Was he in bed? - I called him out of bed, he went to work a little after eight.</p>
               <p>How came he to be in bed so soon? - He goes to bed sometimes at twelve or one o'clock in the day time, I called him at eight, he came home as near as I can guess the next day between one and two.</p>
               <p>If you called him at eight in the evening, how came you not to be in bed? - I sat up to finish my work, I was winding Spanish engine work.</p>

               <p>My husband is a carpenter, I go out of washing, I live right opposite the prisoner Mash, in Webb Square; I was washing at one on the 23d of June, and the prisoner Mash knocked at my door, I said who is there, he said if you please I want a light, I opened the door and I said, yes, Sir, I will give you a light, and the watchman came past one, and I wished him good night.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to remember the night? - Because I was washing some things to go to the Excise Office, this is the night I had the man's things to wash, dry, and iron.</p>
               <p>Was it the night before this or the night after this that you was to carry the things? - It was the night after this, this was on the Tuesday night that I was a washing.</p>

               <p>Jury to Pratt. I think you say there were two candles in the room when they entered the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are sure to the two men? - I am very sure.</p>
               <p>Court. Who held the candle? - Holmes, and the other looked over his shoulder, stood a tip toe, I was as wide awake as I am now.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure of the other two men? - I am.</p>

               <p>Court to Roe. Had you any full view of the face of the other man besides Holmes? Yes, when they came out both together, but I cannot swear positively to him, I can swear positively to Holmes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Holmes. As to this man I am sensible is as innocent as a child, and that man has swore false, and he knows it to be true; I dare say Shakeshaft thinks it to be the same.</p>

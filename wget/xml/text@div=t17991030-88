             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I keep a shoe-warehouse, at the corner of Brewer and Warwick-streets, Golden-square: On Monday the 24th of June last, the prisoner, Tyler. called upon me, his son lived errand-boy with me; he asked me if I served merchants with shoes; I told him, yes; he then said, for my kindness to his son, he had recommended me to his master, who was a very capital man, and dealt very largely in shoes; he said, his master was a merchant; he said, he would bring him the next morning to look over the different sorts, and make choice; he did not say any thing about my charges then, he appointed nine o'clock the next morning; I waited till nine, but I did not see them till the Wednesday morning, they both came together; I saw Mr. Mason, and Tyler addressed him to me as his master, and I shewed him different sorts of goods, and he made choice of some; he gave an order for ten dozen of men's shoes, I am not quite certain of the price.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they worth three pounds a dozen? - A. Yes, more than that; and there were some Spanish leather shoes, and two dozen of Moroccos; Mason then desired me to send them to his accompting-house, at No. 11, St.

               <p>Q. Did Tyler here what passed between Mason and you? - A. Yes; we all three stood together, and they both went away together; Mason said, he hoped I would put them in at a low price; I told him I would, but that I always dealt for ready money; Mason said, he meant ready money; he said, he had frequently large orders of shoes, and I might send them another time, without his coming down, and the reason of his coming down was, that he might see the different sorts, that he might send his orders another time; I sent them home the next day, which was Thursday, but being very busy on the Thursday, I had not an opportunity to look at them, and the clerk,(as he pretended to be) Tyler, called on the Thursday after on wondering that I had not brought them, and to know the reason; he said the money was sure, that his master was an honest man; he said, he was the most punctual man possible, but he would be a good customer. if I pleased him in that order; I asked him what time would be the best to see his master; he said, the middle of the day; I told him, I should bring them myself, as I was to be paid ready money for them; and in the middle of the day, I locked them up in a trunk, and took my shop-man with me to No. 11, Great St. Thomas Apostle; there was written at the door, "Compting house bell," but no name up; I wrapped at the door, and the clerk, Tyler, came to the door; he had a pen in his hand, sitting at the desk, apparently at writing; I ordered my man to put the trunk into the passage of the accompting-house; I asked Tyler if Mr. Mason was at home, and he said, no, he was obliged to be out upon particular business, and would not be at home till three o'clock; this I think was past one, I cannot be certain to half an hour; he persuaded me to leave them and call another time; she trunk was not then unlocked, I had the key in my pocket; he said, for fear he should not be in by three, I had better make it half an hour after; I desired my man to go home and leave the truck opposite, the house, there being a stable-yard opposite, in case I should not get the money, to bring the goods back again; I took the key with me, and left the trunk there; I went to St. Ann's-lane, and returned again, for I was rathes uneasy from the ap<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300077"></xptr>pearance of the house; it had the appearance of a merchant's accompting-house, but not in the style that I expected; I returned to enquire their character in the neighbourhood; when I came back in a very short time, I dare say not a quarter of an hour, I saw Mason near the hose, seemingly standing in the street, I think I spoke to him first; I said, I have left the goods at your accompting-house and I will return and shew them to you; he returned with me to the accompting-house; the prisoner, Tyler, opened the door to us when we went in, I unlocked the trunk; says I, here are the goods, will you be so good as look over them, as I have got the truck here in order to convey the trunk back; he pretended to be in a hurry, and said, I have not time to look at them now; Tyler was present all the time; I asked him if he would pay me for them; he said, oh, yes, and put his hand to his pocket as though he was going to pay me; he turned round immediately and said, I cannot now, I should not wish to pay for them till I had looked them over, I have not time now, nor cannot before to-morrow morning; but, says he, I will look them over and call upon you and pay you; if not, I positively will on Monday morning, for may be I may be busy to-morrow morning; I said, it is not usual to leave goods without payment the first time of dealing, and as I agreed for ready money, I expect the payment; surely, says he, you cannot doubt me till to-morrow, morning, you would not have me pay for them till I have looked them over; says I, sir, but my man and the porter are waiting to convey the truck home; then says he, I will pay the expence of the porter carrying it home; I put the key in the trunk and came away; I was not perfectly satisfied in my own mind, and in consequence of some information I received that day, I went the next morning by three o'clock, I thought they could not have had the impudence to remove them so early; I went to the accompting-house at three o'clock in the morning. I watched the door, and about seven I saw the window open; I then saw the door opened by a woman; I then went up to the door, I did not see Tyler, but I went into the accompting-house, put my hand to the trunk, and found it was empty; from information I received, I went to Goswell-place, it was then very little after seven, I knocked at the door and Mason looked out at the window; I told him, I wished to speak to him, and he came to the door in his shirt, without any other dress on; I told him, that I conceived I was robbed of my shoes, and I hoped he would return them, that I surely would not leave him till I had some satisfaction; he said, he would pay me for them; I told him I did not wish payment, I would have my goods again; while we were talking in this way he dress himself; he said, if I would stop till ten, he would pay me; I wrote a direction and went to the door to call to a boy that was at some distance that I might get some assistance, and he pushed the door against me and shut me out; I then looked through the parlour window and saw him making his escape backwards; I ran round to where the back door was, but he had made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a house was this, that the merchant lived in, in Goswell-place? - A. A small house, in a must contemptible place.</p>
               <p>Q. What rent was the house, do you think ten pounds a year? - A. I dare say it was full that; it was apparently let in lodgings, for Mason and his wife slept in the parlour; I then immediately went, as I clearly saw I was tricked; I went to seek after Tyler, I found him, and related how I had been served by Mason, and hoped that he would restore me the goods; he made many pretences, at last he consented to go in search of them; he said, that he knew he was an honest man, and that he was sure I should be paid, and begged me to go home. and a great deal to that purpose; after this, he confessed that they were sent to Purse's auction-room, in Cloak-lane; he took me there, and there I saw them; it was twelve o'clock before I could get him to tell me where they were; a friend of mine went with me and Tyler to Purse's, and my friend, in the presence of Tyler, asked whether some goods had not been sent there from Mason; it was Mr. Purse's clerk, Mr. Job, that we saw, he hesitated for some time, at last he consented that I should see them; he then told us, that they were sent in the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the day you had sent them? - A. Yes; he said, that they were lodged there, and that he had advanced some money upon them; I saw my goods, and my name in a printed label in every pair of shoes, and the women's shoes had never been unfolded when I saw them in his warehouse; we then took Tyler to Guildhall, and he was committed; about six days after I found Mr. Mason, I had frequently applied at his house, but could not find him there, I found him by accident; I was in a coach, somewhere behind Clerkenwell, I jumped out of the coach and took him; he resisted a little, but I got him into the coach and took him to Guildhall, and then he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the shoes that you delivered? - A. Upwards of fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you any partner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Tyler's son was an errand boy of your's? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. The representation that Tyler made to you of his having a master in St. Thomas Apostle, you found to be true? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He never represented to you that the goods were to be bought by him, but by his master? - A. Certainly not; but I surely should not have left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not find that all the purposes were answered when he declared that his master was the person to whom you were to sell the goods? - A. I have understood from him, and from the boy, that he was a clerk to Mason.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the goods which were to be sold by you, and for which he had recommended you, were sold to the master, and to the master alone? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And you found at the accompting-house that there was a person of the description of master, who had an accompting-house there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It had the appearance of being an accompting-house, from the outside at least? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tyler did not bargain with you for the goods, but Mason? - A. Certainly; but Tyler was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand that Tyler was to have any concern whatever in the goods? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Tyler, at any one part of the transaction, appear any other than as the clerk of Mason? - A. He did not appear as his clerk; I thought he seemed to make too free a great deal; I certainly understood Mason was to be my payment.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300078"></xptr>Q. You left the goods, and gave implicit credit to Mason till the next morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Something in your mind misgave you, and you returned at three in the morning? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned at three in the morning, neither Mason nor Tyler was there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found Mason at Goswell-place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tyler was not there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You met Tyler afterwards, another day? - A. I know I took him that day, at his own apartments near St. George's-field.</p>
               <p>Q. He afterwards told you where you might find those things, and actually took you to the place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore Tyler took you to the place where your property was, and where you recovered your property? - A. I have never recovered it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was the next day after you left the goods, that you took Tyler? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had agreed with Mason, and entered into a consent that he should pay you the day after? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that time had not expired? - A. No; but I did not mean to give him credit for a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a bill of parcels? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no receipt to it? - A. No; I had a receipt, though I did not produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. It was the very next morning that you saw Mason at Goswell-place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From the first time that any negociation had been entered into till you delivered them, what time had elapsed? - A. From the Monday morning.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I keep a house, No. 11, Great St. Thomas Apostle, and did in June last; there is an accompting-house belonging to it, which the prisoner Mason occupied at that time; the other prisoner, Tyler, I took to be Mr. Mason's clerk; the accompting-house was taken by Mason about three weeks before Miosummer; I asked him what line he was going into, and he said the mercantile line; I asked him for a reference to somebody, he gave me his address, and said that was enough; he wrote his address, No. 8, Goswell-place, Goswell-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after Mason had taken the accompting-house did you see Tyler? - A. Within a very few days afterwards, I saw them together consulting about a desk; there was not a desk there at that time; but after they had consulted together a desk came: there were some books and papers used to lie upon the desk, about two or three books.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some appearance of business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever learn what Mr. Mason was? - A. I took him to be a Hamburgh merchant; there was some wine and some casks came in a coach, and some men fetched it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this parcel of shoes come in? - A. I saw the trunk after they were in; I think it was about noon that I saw it; Mason and Tyler were both there then; but I did not see Mr. Grieve till Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see done with the trunk afterwards? - A. About five o'clock the same afternoon that the shoes came in, a porter with a knot came for the trunk, Mason and Tyler were both in the accompting-house when the porter came; the next morning about seven o'clock Mr. Grieve came and took hold of the trunk, which was empty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mason, the merchant, come to his accompting-house the next day? - A. No, I never saw Mason afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Mason gave you a reference when he first came? - A. Only his own adress.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you had an opportunity of enquiring whether he gave a true account of himself? - A. Yes.</p>

No; I saw a man come out from the back of the houses in Goswell-place; he got over the wall by out gate into our cotton manufactory; the prisoner Mason is the man; I asked him what business he had there; he said he wanted to get out; I told him he could get out till eight o'clock; he said, if he could get out, he would give me a pot of beer, and a shilling; I told him I would see our foreman, and hear what he said; I then fastened the door, and told him he should not go till I knew how he got there; I went to look after our foreman, and when I came back he was gone; he had gone through our foreman's house; I traced the man's feet a considerable way, but could not find him; he must have come over a wall into our yard, of twelve feet high: shortly after that I saw Mr. Grieve.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am clerk to Mr. Purse.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300079"></xptr>Q. Where is Mr. Purse now? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately have you seen him? - A. I saw him yesterday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he is in town now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why is he not here? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he subpcenaed to attend here? - A. No, not I neither.</p>
               <p>Q. Has a subpoena been left at the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A subpoena was left for Mr. Purse too? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In the mouth of June last did you see Mason? - A. I did; on the 28th of June he called in the morning, to say that he had sent in a parcel of shoes for Mr. Purse to sell for him; and about seven o'clock I came from dinner, and found Mr. Mason; there was nobody with him that I recollect; he said he wanted some money upon the shoes which were then in our warehouse; I called to the porter to know if they were there, and he told me they were; I advanced Mr. Mason upon them, twenty-six pounds, one shilling, and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that odd sum? - A. I paid him in gold; so many guineas, half-guineas, and seven-shilling pieces; they were to be sold by public sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever look at the inside of these shoes? - A. No, I do not know particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose name is on the inside? - A. The name of Grieve, I think: I shewed them to Mr. Grieve the next day, and he said, if they were his, they had his name in them.</p>
               <p>Q. These were the shoes upon which you advanced the money to Mason? - A. Yes; they are in my custody still.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known Mason before? - A. I suppose about twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in the habit of dealing with persons whose business you cannot tell? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you frequently had dealing with him? - A. Perhaps two or three times in the course of a twelvemonth; he always gave me his place of residence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he always give you the same address? - A. I rather think not, but I cannot be positive; his dealings with Mr. Purse had been very incosiderable.</p>

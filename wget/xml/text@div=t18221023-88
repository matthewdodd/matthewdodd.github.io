            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On Saturday, the 12th of October, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I stopped the prisoner in the Commercial-road, with the sack and four loaves in it; he said he brought them from Worts his master, and was taking them to Curtis, Whitechapel-road. I asked why he did not take them in a basket; he said his master said the sack was more handy. I sent a man to Curtis with him, and afterwards saw him in the watch-house. I said he had told me a story, and I must detain him; he said he was very sorry, for he should loose his place.</p>

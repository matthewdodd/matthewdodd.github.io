He had not resided with me since I rent the whole house. I and my family sleep in it. The shop is attached to the house. We can go to it without going into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Hardcastle an apprentice of yours - A. Yes, and Miles. They sleep in the shop, in the same bed.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 6th of October, did you see any of your property that were put under the bed - A. I did; there were two ingots of silver, about eighty ounces, in a drawer, with watch-cases finished and unfinished, and two watches also.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they entire watches - A. No, only parts of watches. There was a drawer with silver watch-cases, and a box of silver cuttings, and different descriptions of silver. This was all safe on the 6th of October. The value of all was nearly eighty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q Did you see Hardcastle and Miles in bed that night - A I did. I looked through the window and saw them in bed. They went to bed before I did. They usually go to bed about half after ten, seldom later.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you never found any of your property again - A. No, except some little silver pendants in the morning. I went to bed a little after eleven, and my house was perfectly secured.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the last person in the shop - A. No. A lad of the name of Baldwin locked up the shop. I locked the street door myself. Before I went to bed the house was fast in all respects, as to the front of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How could any person get into the shop without getting in the front way - A. By the back way it opens into a place where there are new buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person get into your shop without getting into some part of your premises - A. They must get into my yard. The yard is fenced from a public passage, by a wall. In the morning, a little after six o'clock, I was called up by Hardcastle. I went into the shop. I perceived the drawers were all gone excepting two. They had taken the contents, and the drawers. There was no appearance of violence to the shop. I found a window open in the shop. I went to the window to see if I could see any footsteps outside. I found none. There was missing four or five boxes, which were emptied. The drawers, with two ingots of silver, and the watch cases, were all taken away. Hardcastle then went out of the shop, over a wall, and brought back an empty box, belonging to the shop. That is all I have recovered except four pendants. In consequence of that Hardcastle and Miles were taken up on the Wednesday morning.</p>

I left the shop on the 6th of October, about half past ten at night. The men were gone from the shop, only Hardcastle and Miles were in it. I put seven or eight boxes under the bed. Them boxes contained the work, and the ingots of silver. I locked the shop door, gave the key to my master, and then went to bed. I got up in the morning, about half past six. It was light then. Hardcastle knocked me up. I unlocked the shop door. I found the shop window open, with two boxes near the window. I had seen them boxes under the bed on the preceding night. I saw

               <p>Q. Do you recollect, the night of the 6th of October, your master lost some boxes - A. Yes. I saw Williams on the Saturday and on the Monday night before this robbery happened. Williams told me, that the party that were to come to rob the place, were not there that night. Williams told me, a month before that, that he would get a party to come and to rob the place, and I was to come and to meet them at the Grapes, Bridgewater-gardens, on the Saturday night before. I met Williams a week before this happened. He asked me where the work was put of a night. I told him, under the bed; and I gave him the impression of a key on soap. On the Sunday morning, I saw

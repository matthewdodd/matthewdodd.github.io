                  </hi>. I live at 53, Greenfield Street, Mile End, and am the wife of Henry Spurden—on the 9th July at about 6.15 in the evening the prisoner, who is my sister-in-law, came to my house with an infant in her arms, which she gave to my landlady—she said her husband went home and told her that I had said I would pull her wind-pipe out, and she pulled me down by the hair from off the stairs and dragged me along the passage, and I feel with my back against the room door in the passage and she threw the baby's sucking bottle in my eye-—it broke, and the sight of that eye is gone—she pulled me backwards and forwards and said come back you b-w-; I got up as well as I could and went to the hospital—what was left of my eye had to be removed—I did not provoke her in any way before she struck me, and I never threatened her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow and live at 53, Greenfield Street, where Emma Spurden lives—I came home on the 9th July and found prisoner and last witness standing in the passage—just as I got inside the passage the prisoner came to me and asked me to hold the baby, and she <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> it into my arms and went up to last witness and says "What are you going to say about me and Emma said "I have got nothing to say against you, what are you going to do?" the prisoner pulled her by the nose and then I ran out for assistance, and while I went out the blow must have been given—when I came back I see the blood flowing and said "For God's sake, Ann, leave her alone," and she took her baby and went away—I did not see the bottle used—I never heard the prosecutrix threaten the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prosecutrix never threatened me—she certainly called me twice out of my name.</p>
               <p>----(<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 234). On the day in question 1 saw the prosecutrix in the street bleeding from the face—I took her to the hospital and went to 53, Greenfield Street and saw the prisoner outside opposite and took her into custody—I told her she would have to go to the station—she said she had been fighting with the prosecutrix, but did not hurt her eye.</p>

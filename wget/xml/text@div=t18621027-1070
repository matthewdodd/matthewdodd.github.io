                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Barnham, of Zion-lane, Isleworth, and am the mother of the deceased Ann Jane Barnham—I have known the prisoner rather better than four years—he was married to the deceased on 29th September, 1858, in the name of Charles Robert Cope<lb></lb>land—she lived with him as his wife for some time, up to about eighteen months ago—they had two children; one is alive, and one is dead; the name of the one who is living is Mary Ann—my daughter went home to her grandfather and grandmother, who brought her up—she did not take her maiden name again, but she was called by that name through the vil<lb></lb>lage; she always went by the name of Barnham—I remember the 7th August last—the prisoner came to my house the afternoon before that, and stayed there that afternoon, had tea with me, and waited until my father came home from his work at the Duke of Northumberland's; he said that Annie and my mother were coming—my daughter was not at home when the prisoner came, she was at Richmond helping her sister do her work—she came home it might be from 6 to 7 o'clock—we have no clock; my father leaves the Duke of Northumberland's, which is about a mile off, at 6 o'clock, and when he came in he said that Annie and my mother were coming—the prisoner went into the washhouse—he was there when she came in—I went to the washhouse and called him out; he was doing something with his back towards me—he came out, and my mother came in at the time—she told him not to come there to up set her child, as she called her, for she said she had told her about his ill-treatment to his first wife, who he had married thirteen years ago—she told him to leave the house as he had upset her so the night before, telling her that he had married his first wife thirteen years ago, and that he would write and ascertain the rights of it whether she was alive or dead—my daughter told him that she could not trust him any more, and she had made up her mind that she would not live with him again, as his brother had told her he had had wives before, and that a policeman might come at any moment and take him as a deserter from several regiments, and she had made up her mind to stay with her grand<lb></lb>mother, and do the best she could for herself and child—he went across the room, took her by the hand, and said, "Then we will part mutual, Annie; I shall marry another woman; will you interfere with me if I do?"—she said, "No, I never will, if you will let me rest in peace;" she said, "I am a wife, and no wife"—they seemed very comfortable and quiet then, and he left the house very quietly—he left alone—I am speaking now of the Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening; the murder happened on the Thursday, the 7th—on the Thursday the prisoner came to my house after dinner; he came alone; he asked me where Annie was—I told him she was gone to Richmond to help her sister do her work, with my mother, and she would return with her—he stayed there that afternoon and had tea with me—he took some letters from his coat pocket, and a likeness of Annie, and showed me the likeness, and asked me if I knew it—I said, "Yes, it is Annie; there she is"—he said, "Yes," and he would not harm a hair of her head, for she had been a good girl to him; he put it back in his pocket again—he stayed there till she came home from Richmond, and then he went up on the top of the railway steps that lead to the top of the road—my mother told him to go away, or she would give him up to the police for desertion—I went out at the door, and beckoned to him to go away, and I would come down the lane to him—my daughter Annie said, "Wait a moment, mother, I will put on my boots and go down the lane; if I don't, grandmother will give him up"—we went down the lane, and halfway down the lane there is a turn that brings you across</p>

               <p>where the neighbours were looking at the riflemen shooting; I went down there, and met the prisoner at the bottom; he was looking over at the rifle<lb></lb>men shooting—I left my daughter talking to some women, and went across the road to Mr. Blackburn's to fetch a pint of beer—when I came back with the beer my daughter, the prisoner, and my father, were all standing talking together; we all four drank out of the beer—my daughter then turned on the Hounslow-road to go to Hounslow; the prisoner followed her, and I turned round the corner and watched them—that was the last I saw of her that night; I never saw her again alive; I saw her the following morning, dead, at the union workhouse—some months before, I remember seeing the prisoner at Chelsea—I found three bullets which were left in his waistcoat-pocket—I showed them to my daughter—the prisoner was not there at the time, he came home at dinner-time; I showed them to him when he came home—my daughter told me that he brought them home for us—she said, "Charley brought these home from, Ireland, and said one was for you, one for me, and one for the first man that took him"—I showed them to him, and he made no remark about them at all; he only laughed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you at any time any conversation with the prisoner about his having been previously married? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—my daughter and I went one Sunday, I cannot tell the day, about eighteen months ago, and found his brother in Red Lion-passage, and I there found he had married my daughter in the wrong name, Copeland; I found his name was Cooper, and his brother took me to the sister's husband—the prisoner came there while we were all there—the brother-in-law came, and my daughter told him how cruelly Cooper had treated her—he said he had treated her kindly to what he had done the other—I said, "What do you mean by the other?"—he said, "His first wife"—he said her name was Alice; he did not tell her surname—he said he had kept her at his house for some time, and would again, for she was a very nice little woman—he said, "I would advise you, Annie, to keep out of his way, and not live with him again."</p>

               <p>running towards me—I have not seen that person since—I did not know him—I can't identify him—a little further on in the lane I found a woman lying in the path—she was alive when I saw her—her bonnet was on fire—she appeared to be quite insensible—I assisted in taking her to the station house, and sent for the doctor—I was not there when Mrs. Barnham, the mother, came.</p>

I am a doctor of medicine and surgeon, at Isle<lb></lb>worth—on Thursday evening, 7th August, I was called to see a woman in the lane, on a report that a woman had been shot—a stranger came for me—she was on a stretcher when I saw her, in a dying state—life continued some little time along the road—being surgeon to the Union I ran on to give orders for her reception, but by the time she was taken off the stretcher is the infirmary she was dead—I examined her—I found a penetrating wound behind the ear, and I found portions of brains scattered about the neck and hair—I made a post-mortem examination by order of the coroner—I opened the head and found a bullet in the head—that was unquestionably the came of her death—in my judgment the bullet caused the wound that I saw the night before—that was certainly the cause of death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The following letter was put in and read:</hi> "Isleworth, Wednesday evening. I am wretched, indeed. I am sorely depressed. I love my dear Annie. How can I see her with another man night after night, and pro<lb></lb>mising me that she never do go with another man; but when I met her at 12 o'clock, or rather 1 o'clock, on Tuesday morning, arm-in-arm with another, and a little the worse for liquor, and when I accosted her, and she did not scarcely notice me, my blood at the very moment curdled, my brains were hot with passion, and Satan, that goes about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour, I am his victim, and may the Lord have mercy. Oh, I cannot bear to live to see my dear, dearest Annie, that I love better than my own life. Yes, I would starve for her. I have fallen on my bended knees, while the tears fell like large drops of rain from mine eyes. I have begged, time after time, for her to be true to me, but she has dis<lb></lb>carded me, and how can I live when she has trifled with me whom she has once loved, and who knelt on his knees and prayed to his God, from his heart, to guard her life through her confinement, scarcely two years ago. Yes, I am sorry for her; my dear, dearest Annie, my heart bleeds for you. I am a wretched young man; I find you have deceived me. On Sunday, when I came from the country, you said you were happy to see me. I said, 'I am overjoyed to see you; and how is your dear babe, Mary Annie?' You said, 'Dear Charles, she is quite well,' and immediately kissed me. I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270032"></xptr>
               <p>gave you ten shillings to put into your pocket, and you seemed quite glad, and said, 'Charles, you are very kind;' and you spent the remainder of the day with me; but when I asked you to stop with me till Monday, you said you could not, and I found out you wanted to meet another, and he was the one that you were with on Monday night, between 12 and 1 o'clock. Oh, Annie, my dearest, dear sweet Annie, how I love you; and that very day, in Brentford Park, you and I walked affectionately together with our lovely babe in your dear arms, and there you promised me that you would visit the Crystal Palace with me, on the Tuesday, and that I was to come early in the morning. I gave you a sovereign, and you went to fetch everything you thought best, to that amount, out of pledge, of your wearing apparel, and I found that it was all you wanted from me. Your grandmother told me to come and have some supper along with you, and you told me in the park you would go to bed early, as we had not much rest on the Sunday night, for you and I did not go to bed at your grandmother's till half-past 12 o'clock. I slept with you, and how affectionately you acted towards me, and promised, that day week or so, you would come back to your dear Charles; but when I went home to supper, you told your granny to say that you were gone to Turnham-green; but I myself thought different. Some sudden change came over me, and told me that you were with another, and my steps were directed to Hounslow, and it was there that I met you arm-in-arm with another; and your wicked mother—a bad, bad woman—she brought you to ruin. Many a time hast thou said those words to me, and, my dear, dear Annie, it is her that stole you from me, full of deceit. (Read the seventh chapter of Proverbs.) I was driven to commit the fatal deed; and oh! what an awful thing it is to commit murder; our dear babe left behind. Oh! young girls of Brentford, think of the result of tampering with a young man's feelings that love you; take my advice, and do not (<hi rend="italic">here a word was omitted</hi>) a man that loves you. Look at me, poor, wretched, unhappy man, how kind I have been to my Annie—people knows it in Brentford (Mr. Upton does). I told him on Tuesday morning how unhappy I was; he pitied me. How can my Annie respect herself, and go on board barges up and down the river for two or three days? But the deed is done; look to my child. Good-bye. Farewell all who know me May God have mercy upon me. I am writing this in a public-house, in Isleworth. Annie, dearest Annie, if you had not tampered with me I should not have felt the pangs I now feel. How could you pull one young man's face downwards to yours, and kiss him, time after time, in front of me, and tell him you loved him, and yet told me quite different? Did I not send you ten shillings, and seven shillings, weekly, when I was away from you? I have wronged you, I confess, but I have been forgiven by you; and you told me my kindness made you so that you could not keep away from me. You really did love me, but your mother was the cause of our separation. I have suffered for her, and bad has come to her; she is the cause of all this. Good-bye, sweet Annie; oh, that I could lie is your grave with you, that we could be buried together, but I shall be else-where. I have watched and guarded you, and my heart has been breaking for you a long time. You remember telling me that your mother gave you those bruised eyes that you had a few weeks ago, but, Annie, I have found out that you told me a falsehood; it was at Ealing fair, by some man. You have deceived me, cruel-hearted Annie. Several men I know have cohabited with you. I hope they will remember seeing me. They may live to think of the manner in which you and I met our deaths; and all young females,</p>

               <p>take a warning by me; do not deceive one that loves you. I leave this world a wretched sinner; and may the Lord have mercy upon my soul through the blood of Jesus Christ my Saviour."</p>

I am the wife of William Johnson; we live at Hanwell—the prisoner buys and sells in the market On Tuesday last, about two o'clock, she came to my stall, and asked me to give her a bit of snuff—when I opened the box to give it her, I saw my half-sovereign in it, and when I closed the box it was gone—I am sure it was there, and I never opened the box to any body but her—I went and accused her of it—she said she had not got it, and declared to G—she had not got a half-sovereign about her—she said, "Here is my silver"—the policeman found the half-sovereign on her.</p>

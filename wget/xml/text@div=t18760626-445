                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">interpreted</hi>). I live at 55, Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, and am an importer and manufacturer of bronzes—about the last week in September the prisoner called at my premises, and asked to see some bronzes—I showed him a clock and a pair of candelabra at 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he offered 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I at first declined to take—on 2nd October he called again, took out a cheque-book, and said "If you will give it me for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will give you a cheque at once"—he said his name was Plato, and that he was principal agent for the Australian business for all sorts of things, that he did a great deal of business, but he did not exactly say the extent—he said he wanted these to send with other bronzes, china and porcelain, to Australia—I consented to let him have the goods for the cheque—he told me to deliver the goods at Mr. Southgate's, in London Wall—on Monday I went with somebody and delivered the goods at Southgate's—they did not seem to know anything about the goods coming—I went next door to Plato, who was waiting for me—I said to him "I bring the goods here, but I have not unloaded them—he said "I will come down with you"—he did so, and told Southgate's man to receive the goods for him; they were then unloaded—the prisoner said "After you have unloaded the goods come upstairs to my place," and I did—he made me enter a second room, which was full of bronzes and china goods, and he said those were to be sent off with mine to Australia—he said "I can't give you a cheque to-day," and I was asked through bis head clerk as an interpreter whether, as the bargain could not be concluded that day, I would take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—what passed at my place was in English—I saw "London &amp; Westminster" on the cheque<lb></lb>book he produced—I never got a cheque—I was induced to part with the bronzes seeing the quantity of bronzes and china goods—I had also confi<lb></lb>dence in the house of Southgate, also having shown to me some invoices and receipts showing that he was in connection with many French houses—I expected to receive a cheque for my goods, and I went to him three weeks after, and he then offered me three bills—I told him before taking those bills I must have his private address, but I never could get it.</p>

I did not first call at your place of busi<lb></lb>ness to say that I had goods for sale—I sent somebody to see the appearance of the place—it was a cheque-book, and not an inquiry-book, that you had when you came to my place—you gave me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at your office after the goods were delivered at Southgate's—I did not agree to accept bills for the re<lb></lb>mainder; the transaction was for cash—I tried to see you many times afterwards, but only succeeded four times.</p>

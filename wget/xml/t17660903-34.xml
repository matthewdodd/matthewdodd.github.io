               <p>Q. Where did you put your stockings when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>M'Intosh. I put them under the foot of the bed, there was no body else but she in the room with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been asleep?</p>
               <p>M'Intosh. I had; and when I awaked, she was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say when you charged her?</p>
               <p>M'Intosh. She said nothing at all, but came down after me making a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>M'Intosh. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>

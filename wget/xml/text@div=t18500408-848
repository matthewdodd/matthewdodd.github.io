                  </hi>. I am a labouring man. In the latter end of Feb., I assisted the prisoner in emptying some cesspools at the Royal Arsenal, at Woolwich—on 28th Feb., at twelve o'clock at night, I was there, and the prisoner also—we had two carts there to take away the soil—while they were being loaded, I saw the prisoner take six pieces of timber, and put them in a cart—they had been about eleven yards from where the carts stood—there was a stack of new timber there—these pieces were new, they were the out<lb></lb>side cuttings of the timbers, what are called slabs—I did not notice what kind of wood it was, I was a little way from them—the pieces were thrown in amongst the soil—the prisoner said he wanted something to help to pay us men for our labour—the carts went on to Plumstead—I did not go with them—I was there the next day after they were taken, and saw six planks concealed under some straw—I was there on the Sunday following—I did not see any planks there then, they were removed—I cannot exactly say when I made any communication to the police about this—I am no scholar at all—I told the police on a Friday, but I cannot say what Friday—I went to some premises belong<lb></lb>ing to the prisoner, and saw the six pieces of timber there—I pointed them out to the policeman—this is one of the pieces(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—some of the others were about the same size, and some not quite so big as this.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, R</hi> 42). In consequence of a communica<lb></lb>tion from Adamson, I went with him to the prisoner's premises, in Church-street, Woolwich, on 22nd March—Adamson pointed out this piece of wood, and five others, he said, "These belong to the Arsenal"—they were in a dirty state, as if they had been in a soil cart; but it has been dry weather, and a great deal has been knocked off it now—the pieces were produced at the police-court, they were a great deal worse then—I took the prisoner on this charge—he said he came to meet the case—he said that all that he had taken away, he had a right to take, they were his property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you merely told him it was for six pieces of wood belonging to the Arsenal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he is a contractor for Government—where I went to his place, at Woolwich, there was a good deal of timber—I do not know that he deals in timber; his yard looks more like a dust yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am timber-master in the carriage department, at Wool<lb></lb>wich. I have understood that the prisoner was employed by contract to empty the privies there—I have looked at the six pieces of timber, of which this is one—I believe this to have been the property of the Government, and in the Arsenal—when I saw it before, it was in a dirty state—the prisoner had no authority or right to take away any timber, that I am aware of; none what<lb></lb>ever belonging to the carriage department—I know this has been in the car<lb></lb>riage department—I know it by the mark of this iron on it—here is "C.D. issued," and the arrow—the timber is selected that is required, and a clerk goes down to take account of it, and then this impression is made on it—I find on this timber the trace of the marks of this instrument (<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>)—here are two marks—this piece was outside—Government sometimes sell timber—timber is sold with this mark on it, but such timber is unserviceable—this is not unserviceable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There are periodical sales of timber, and at those sales this might have been sold? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There might have been a possibility of a piece of this kind being put in, but I would not have done it—the prisoner has been a contractor a great many years, and his father before him—I do not know whether the prisoner has bought at our sales from time to time—I have seen him there many times, I suppose for the purpose of purchasing—I never saw him buy—I do not attend the sales myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>to be taken out—they are made up in a stack twelve feet high—I made a very strict examination—I do not believe there was a piece so good in quality as this is in the whole lot.</p>

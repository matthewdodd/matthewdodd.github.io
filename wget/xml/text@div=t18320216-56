On Monday morning, the 2nd of January, about eight o'clock, I missed all these furs, which I had seen safe the night before - (I knew the prisoner Harris; I had lived next door to his father - he came to my house about three weeks before the robbery, and said,"Oh, you have got a good stock of furs;" I said, "Yes, I wish I could sell them;") my lodger keeps a dog in the garret, and that had barked about six or seven o'clock that morning; one person could have carried them all away - Davey, the Policeman, found part of them next day; they were marked with my name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you purchased any thing from Harris before this? A. He once brought some old muffs - I would not buy them, but I believe my wife gave him 3s. for them to cut up - that was three or four weeks before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Harris that three men had attempted to break open your house that night? A. Yes, on the Friday night they had opened my shutters and looked in at the window; that was two days before the robbery - I told him so on the Sunday night, when he called; he did not sit with me that night - I never kept him in conversation. for I knew his character; he stood at my cutting-board for about a quarter of an hour - I asked what was his pleasure: he said, "Have you sold your muffs and tippets?" I said No; and next morning I was robbed of them - he saw them all that night, and said he had a customer, and could sell them for me: I said if he did I would give him a commission - his father is in the same business as I am.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he at your house three weeks before the robbery, and again on the night before? A. Yes - the property was worth 32l., 17s.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 3rd of January, I and Busain went to No. 10, Lion and Lamb-court, Playhouse-yard, and in a room up one pair of stairs, I found eighty-three pieces of fur, part of which the Magistrate ordered me to return to the prosecutor - I have a tippet, two skins, and three collars; I found no muffs - there are but two rooms in the house: Wood and Hambridge were in the room when we were searching - I found the skins on the floor, under a bed; I saw the letters M. T. on one of the skins - the inspector found the tippet on the left-hand side of the room, under another hed on the floor: Hambridge was up, but had not all her clothes on - I took Anderson that night, at the Castle,  reville's-rents.</p>
               <p>JOHN BUSAIN. I am a Policeman. On Tuesday, the 3rd of January, I went with Davey, about seven o'clock in the evening, to this house; Hambridge and Wood were there - I found this tippet between the bed and mattress; there were eighty-three pieces of fur in all found, but no muffs; there were two beds on the floor in the room - the skins were under the bed by the door, and only the tippet under the other bed; Wood and Hambridge were down stairs when the furs were found; the house is only one story high - I had taken Wood and Hambridge into custody in the ground floor room, before I found the furs; that was not on account of the furs - when the furs were first found, not suspecting they were stolen, we did not take them, but when we took them and counted them, the prisoners were in the room; they had been brought up - seeing some of them marked we said, "Here are some furs we don't think are honestly come by;" they made no reply.</p>

            .

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you remember seeing some bundles there when you and Mrs. Hambridge went up to light the fire? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you recollect whether Sunday was a wet night? A. I believe it was dry - I did not clean their shoes that morning, but they were dry.</p>

            . I live at No. 27, Playhouse-yard; Harris and his wife lodged at my house when he was apprehended, and for three weeks or a month before. On the first Monday in January I was going to my yard. about ten o'clock, and he was coming down stairs - I had not seen him before; whether he had been out before I cannot tell; Mrs. Hambridge was a particular acquaintance of theirs, and Mrs. Harris was a great deal at Hambridge's; I was recommended there for their character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About what time did they generally breakfast? A. I cannot say - I often saw them go out late in the morning, and come home late at night - I never saw him out so early as eight o'clock in the morning; he wore a dark brown coat - I do not recollect ever seeing him in a light great coat.</p>

            . I live in Michael's home. I went out a little before eight o'clock for milk, and fastened the door after me, and when I came back the door was still fast - it was on the single lock; a false key would open it- I returned about ten minutes past eight o'clock, and found it as I had left it: I went out afterwards, and left Dixey at the door.(Skins produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Harris' Defence. On Sunday I went to bed about twelve o'clock, and arose on Monday, between ten and eleven - I went down Peter-street, and two Policemen apprehended me with a brown bag and a black one; one was empty and the other full of furs, which were delivered up to the young man they belonged to.</p>

On the 10th of July I saw some persons in a boat; some of whom fell over and were drowned; the others were brought on shore by the watermen; they were very wet, and were taken to Mr. Gulston's; there was a coat left in the boat; I saw the prisoner step to the boat, and take it out, and walk with it towards our skittle-ground, and then through the half-hatch; I had seen him before, and knew him. The waterman said he could not stop, he must go with his fare - the next night, when I was out with my beer, he met me, and said, if I said any thing about it, he would knock my bl-y thundering head off.</p>

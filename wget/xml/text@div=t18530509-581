                  </hi>. I reside at No. 2, Little Queen-street, Westminister; I am a butcher. Smith was in my service, if he sold meat he was to take the money for it—he had no authority to sell meat on credit, without my permission—when he received money for meat, it was his duty to place the money in a bowl on the ledge in the shop—on the afternoon of 4th April, I left my shop about half past 4 o'clock—before I left I counted the number of legs and shoulders of mutton in the shop—I had thirty-seven shoulders and fifty-four legs—before I left, I made a communication to my wife—I came home about 10 minutes before 10 o'clock; counted the legs and shoulders of mutton, and missed one leg and one shoulder—Smith was then gone home—I have seen this shank with wool on it—Quinnear showed me at Bow-street a shoulder of mutton with this on it—I think I have no hesitation in identifying it as one I left amongst the shoulders when I went out—I left one with the shank about half jointed off and the black wool on it, and I missed that particularly—I compared that which was shown to me with what I had left, and it corresponded—I have no hesitation in saying, that that enables me to swear it was my meat—we sell them at 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—Smith certainly would have no authority to sell them at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not know Emmott at all as a customer—I have seen the beef that was in the basket, the lowest price of that would be 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—I had given information at the station before I went out—I went to market on the morning of 5th April, about a quarter before 6 o'clock, and returned 10 minutes before 8 o'clock, and found Smith in custody of Quinnear—Quinnear said, "I have taken your servant in custody on a charge of robbing you of some meat;" some beef, "I think it was"—Smith said, "I have not robbed you, I sold it at 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—it weighed four pounds and a quarter, and I took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it"—the value of it would be 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the marrow bone 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

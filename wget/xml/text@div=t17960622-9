               <p>Prisoner's defence. This young man was very much in liquor; he went home with me, and told me he had no money, that he would wish to stay, but he could not satisfy me; but he would leave his watch to satisfy me for his supper and sleeping with me; in the night he was dry, and he said he wanted a pot of porter; and he told me, when I came in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220033"></xptr>with the porter, that he wanted his watch back again; I was afraid he would take it from me, and I put it in my stomach; he told me he was ashamed to go on board his ship for money, he said he wanted it in the morning; he was very much in a passion, and being a foreigner, I was afraid he would use me ill; and then he shut the door, and shut himself out, and me too.

               <p>Prisoner. This witness has been under the predicament of losing his licence; this is through spite and malice.</p>

               <p>(The instruments handed to the court.)</p>
               <p>Court. Could the door be forced open by these things only? - There was a screw-jack in the basket, two crows, two blacksmiths hammers, several small wrenches, several rasps and files, and many picklock-keys, and a thing that the blacksmiths work with their hands in this way, a centre-bit,</p>
               <p>What trade is the prisoner? - I knew him to work in the gardens.</p>
               <p>Was he a blacksmith or a carpenter? - Not that ever I knew, he was only a gardner, such as ditching, or so; the night that these things were taken, I alarmed the whole neighbourhood.</p>

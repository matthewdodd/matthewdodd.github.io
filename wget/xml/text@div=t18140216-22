            . I belong to Bow-street. On Monday the 7th of February, I saw the three prisoners in Holborn, at the shop window of Mr. Grosvenor, and while they were there, the prisoner Burrell put his hand into his right hand pocket and pulled out a knife from that pocket; at Mr. Grosvenor's window he opened the knife and put it to the putty of the window, and as soon as he put it to the putty of the window I saw the glass fly across. Mr. Grosvenor came up to the door, and spoke to the lads, and they ran away. I followed them, and Mr. Grosvenor followed me to inform me that the window was broken. I then followed the boys down Holborn, until they came to Fleet-market, to a linen-draper's shop on the right hand side of the market. I followed them down Watling-street, where they cracked another window, and after they had done so a person disturbed them; they crept into an orange shop and stole some oranges and nuts. I pursued them to Mr. Atkinson's shop in Lombard-street. At this time it was about seven o'clock. Burrell placed himself at Mr. Atkinson's shop window; Solomon and Morris were at the door watching the motions of the persons in the shop. Burrell pulled out a knife and put it to the putty of the window; it gave a crack, and a piece of glass came out. I heard the crack. At the moment the knife was applied to the putty a piece of glass came out; then he left the window, and joined Morris and Solomon. Burrell left the window again, and Solomon and Morris left the door and went to the door adjoining the shop, in Lombard-street. Burrell put his hand into the window, and pulled out a shoe, which shoe he gave to Solomon, and Solomon gave it to Morris. Burrell then returned, and took the second shoe; he gave it to Solomon, and Solomon gave it to Morris as he had done before. He was then returning to the window again, and at that time a person was coming out with the shutters to shut up the shop. I then laid hold of Solomon and Morris, and on

             I found these shoes; I asked a person to lay hold of Burrell, and I took all three into Mr. Atkinson's shop. I searched Burrell; on Burrell I found a penknife, and the point of the knife appears to have been used.</p>

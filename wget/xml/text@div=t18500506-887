                  </hi>. I live with my father and mother in Duke's-place; the prisoner came to lodge there, I think on 8th April—her room is on the first floor—my father and mother's bedroom is on the second-floor—I was on the watch on 3rd May from half-past eight o'clock in the morning, till a quarter before two in the afternoon—I then saw the prisoner come up-stairs and peep through the keyhole of my mother's bedroom door—she then put a key in, opened it, and went into the room—she was in two or three minutes, and came out with a bundle—she locked the door, and took the bundle down to her own room—I went into her room, and said, "You are a thief"—she said she did not know what I meant, and asked me if I had been robbed again—I called my father, but before he came I saw the prisoner throw the bundle under the bed—my father came, and found it there—this dress was in it—it is my mother's.</p>

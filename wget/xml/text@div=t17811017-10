               <p>How do you go into it? - Out of my yard. My yard is fenced round, part with brick, and part with wood. I locked this hovel about six o'clock over-night, on the 5th of October. I was called up the next morning by my neighbours. I found, upon examination, that this place had been broke open; and I lost four geese. The lock had been wrenched off, but was hung on again; and the door was shut-to afterwards. The two prisoners were apprehended; and there were four geese brought to me, which I knew to be the geese I had lost.</p>

               <p>I was alarmed by the barking of my dog. I saw two men in a turnip-field. I got up, to see what they were about; but I saw no more of them. Afterwards I saw two men coming along the road, towards me, from the way that the prosecutor's house stands. I observed that they had with them three geese. One had a goose under his arm; the other had a goose in a bag, and had another goose under his arm: I could just see that in the bag, as the bag was not close at the top. I had a gun: I bid them stop, or I would blow their brains out. They dropped the geese, and ran away. I followed them into a field: there I lost them. I went and alarmed the neighbours. We searched the field. There we found a parcel of fowls. Some time after that, a man in a foul-weather waistcoat, which was the prisoner Garment, passed by. He talked to a waggoner going by, and asked some questions about a timber-cart. Afterwards, he came back again. I am sure he is the same man that I saw with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178110170011"></xptr> the bag, and having a goose under his arm. We secured him. Afterwards, Branson was taken by another man, and brought in. He had then the great-coat on which the prisoner Garment wore when I first saw him with the geese.</p>

               <p>I got up, upon the alarm. I saw two men in the turnip-field. I was not near enough to distinguish their persons, only that one was much taller than the other. I afterwards found Mr. Church's door broke open; and there were four geese gone out of the place.</p>

               <p>I am hostler at the White-horse, at Shepherd's-bush. I saw both the prisoners together at my master's house the evening before. There was a dispute between my mistress and them about some bad money. Garment offered first a bad half-crown. When my mistress refused it, he gave her a bad shilling. She refused that, and told him she thought he dealt in bad money. Then he gave her good money. I saw no more of them till next day. Then I saw Garment brought to the door of my master's house, dressed in a foul-weather waistcoat; and I observed there was upon it fresh goose-dung. I was sent to find out who was the owner of a parcel of fowls which had been found in a turnip-field. As we were going along the road, we met the prisoner Branson, in a great-coat. I saw something bulky on one side, in his pocket. I suspected him. I let him pass me. Then he entered into some conversation with a man who was coming by in a straw-cart. I followed Branson, and secured him; and I found a dead goose in his pocket. He at first said he found it; but when we told him we would carry him to the house where Garment was, he said, I will tell you the whole truth; I have a wife and three children: Garment drew me into this.</p>

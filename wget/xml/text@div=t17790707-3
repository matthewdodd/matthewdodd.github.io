            . Mr. Ashton came out of the Plough and saw me as I was coming home from church; he said Nanny, come here and drink a drop of beer with me; I said, yes Mr. Ashton, Mr. Church.</p>
               <p>Which of them called upon you to drink a pint of beer? - Mr. Church, and Mr. Ashton was in the house at the time.</p>
               <p>Did Ashton speak to you? - No, not till after I went in.</p>
               <p>Did the little girl with you go in? - No, he called her in, but she said she would not go in.</p>
               <p>Where did you go? - We went into the Plough, and another young woman that Mr. Church knows that lives close by our house.</p>
               <p>What is her name? - I do not know now because she has been lately married; her name was Peggy; he sent a letter by her to give to me. When we came in he gave me some punch to drink. He said Nanny, will you take a little walk; I said no, because chapel would soon be open, and I must go to chapel; he said never mind, only come round the brook, that will bring you in your way home again. I said I would.</p>
               <p>Where was Ashton? - He was along with him.</p>
               <p>Did you go? - Yes, I went round the brook with him.</p>
               <p>Who was with you? - Nobody but Mr. Church and Mr. Ashton.</p>
               <p>What became of the other young woman then, Peggy? - She went home with her husband. She said she could not take a walk with him because she had company at her house. Then he took me to the Shoulder of Mutton and Cat, as you go to town in the field.</p>
               <p>Did they both go with you? - Yes; then he gave me some more liquor to drink till past eight o'clock; I said, Mr. Ashton, what is it o'clock; he said eight o'clock; I said it is more, let me go home, chapel is done, my master will be uneasy; he said you shall not go home, come a little way with me; I said I could not, chapel is done; he made answer, if you are not at chapel you are at Church, and that is all the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not it occur to you that it was eight o'clock, and chapel was over? - I said Mr. Ashton, Mr. Church, let me go; they said I should not, it was too late to go home, and chapel was over.</p>
               <p>Court. But did not you think chapel was over before that time? - I did and said my master would wonder that I was not gone home; he said he did not care.</p>
               <p>But you was with him from three to eight o'clock? - I was.</p>
               <p>What happened next? - When we came from the Shoulder of Mutton and cat; it was past nine o'clock, and from thence he took me to another alehouse, somewhere in Spitalfields; I do not know the name of the alehouse.</p>
               <p>What happened there? - We drank something there; it was past ten o'clock I think going on for eleven. When we came from that alehouse, Church said to Ashton, Nanny and I shall go to my summer-house.</p>
               <p>What did he call you? - Nanny. We went to the summer-house; when we got into the summer-house, Mr. Church whispered to Ashton and went out; I did not hear what he whispered to Ashton. Mr. Ashton said something to Mr. Church, and then Mr. Church went out. Then Mr. Ashton carnally knew me against my will and consent.</p>
               <p>Immediately after Church went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This was in a summer-house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far was it from any other house? - It was in a wild place.</p>
               <p>How far from any other house? - I do not know because I was a little in liquor, but my father and mother went the next day and found the summer-house out.</p>
               <p>Did not you know where it was? - I did not, it was in a place I did not know; I was not used to London. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070007"></xptr> never go out from one year's end to another, without going out to church or chapel.</p>
               <p>Did Church leave the door open or shut. - There was no door to the summer-house.</p>
               <p>Had you much conversation together? - No.</p>
               <p>Nothing? - We did not speak together.</p>
               <p>Neither of you? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him? - I said, Mr. Ashton leave me alone; he said, no, I will not, Nanny. When Mr. Church came in, Ashton went out to get some beer.</p>
               <p>Which of them wanted the beer, Church or Ashton? - Ashton; he went for it.</p>
               <p>Did he give you any thing? - No, I had none, I could not drink it, because I was in liquor, and I was reaching all the time.</p>
               <p>When Ashton came again, did Church and Ashton drink together? - Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>How soon did they go home from thence? - Between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did they see you safe home? - No, they took me into a tavern in Goodman's Fields.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation with Church; did you ask him where he had been? - He went round the place in the time Ashton was with me.</p>
               <p>Did he say he was going round the place? - Yes, he whispered to Ashton.</p>
               <p>You said he whispered something that you did not hear; but did you hear him say he was going round the place? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did he ravish you more than once? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How often? - Twice.</p>
               <p>Both times before Church came back? - No.</p>
               <p>Was one time at a tavern? - No, it was on the Monday he did it again; he took me to a tavern on Sunday night to lie all night.</p>
               <p>And did you lie together all night? - No, he went home to his wife.</p>
               <p>When he took you to a tavern did he say you should lie all night with him? - No; he went to the house, and said, can you let this young woman lie here all night; the man said, yes, I can; he said, very well. Mr. Church went up stairs with me; he undressed me; I had no night-cap to put on; he gave me a handkerchief to put round my head.</p>
               <p>So they put you to bed there? - Only Mr. Church came up, Ashton staid below.</p>
               <p>What was Church an old acquaintance of yours? - I never saw Church before but once.</p>
               <p>How came you to treat one another so kindly, he called you Nanny, and you called him Church? - On Whitsun Monday I went out two days; he and I were going into the Blackmoor's Arms, by Rosemary-Lane; he said to the landlady at Goodman's Fields, dont let this young woman go away till I come and fetch her. Mr. Church came about a quarter after ten in the morning.</p>
               <p>You had lain a bed till that time, had you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they tell you they would come again next morning? - Mr. Church did.</p>
               <p>What time did the other come? - Not before three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Did you stay there till that time? - No, Mr. Church came for me in the morning; he said to the waiter in the tavern where I laid all night, can you get any breakfast for this young woman? Yes, said the waiter, I can. He brought some breakfast; it was then half after twelve o'clock as I had done breakfast.</p>
               <p>What did you do then? - Mr. Church came; I said I must go home; he said you shall not go to day; I said I would go home. He said you shall not, come along with me a little way; I said I would not; this is the street where my father lives, and down I will go, you shall not keep me. He said, I should not go; come a little farther, and this will bring you straight home. I said, very well, in the name of God, let me go. He said, come a little farther, and I will give you a little beer that shall keep up your spirits, that your master and mistress may not be angry with you. I said that would not satisfy them, for they would go to my father and mother. He said, I should not go home that day. He went a little farther, and went into an alehouse, and gave me some beer; he said, Nanny, it will chear up your spirits. I said it was not used to drink, it would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070008"></xptr>Where did you meet Ashton again? - We went a little farther, near the London Infirmary, there was Ashtop drinking some beer at a publick-house.</p>
               <p>What was the sign of that publick-house? - I do not know; but it was facing the London Infirmary.</p>
               <p>Did Church tell you that he intended to meet Ashton there? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you expect to meet Ashton on the Monday morning? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not expect to meet him at all? - No.</p>
               <p>What the sign of the house was you cannot tell? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>That was about three o'clock? - Yes, it was. Mr. Church said to Ashton, Ashton, we have spent half the day, we may as well spend the whole with Nanny. I said, I will not; I wish to God I knew my way home, I would go. He said, you shall not go home to day nor to-morrow. I said, I will go home, you shall not keep me. Mr. Ashton said, very well, Church, I will tell you where we will go; we will go to Clay Hall. I said, that is not going home with me; I wish I knew my way home. He said, you shall not go home to day nor to-morrow. Ashton said, Nanny, live with me two months, then your master will forget you, and your father and mother, and I will turn my maid away, and take you.</p>
               <p>Did you agree to that? - I did not.</p>
               <p>What else? - Then he took me to Clay-Hall; we went up stairs into a dancing-room; Mr. Ashton said to Church, let us have something to drink; I said, I want nothing to drink, leave me alone, or I will go and drown myself; he said, for my sake, you shall not make an end of your life; he went down stairs to the waiter of the house, or else to the master, I do not know which; he asked the master if he would let me have some tea to drink; I was almost a dying, I was so bad; they had some beer to drink; I had some tea; the woman brought the tea up; the woman asked Mr. Church if she should came and fill the tea-pot; he said, no, you need not come up into the room, I will fill the pot. When I had done tea, Church whispered to Ashton; Ashton went down stairs, and lit his pipe. When he was gone down to light his pipe, he stood upon the stairs to hearken.</p>
               <p>Who did? - Mr. Ashton.</p>
               <p>What was he to hear there? what was he to stand upon the stairs to hearken to? - To hear what Mr. Church did to me.</p>
               <p>What passed between you? - Mr. Church said to me, Nanny, come here; I said, no, I will not come there; he said, you shall come here; I said no, I will not; he got me up in his arms; I struggled from him, and ran down stairs, and Mr. Ashton was upon the stairs hearkening; he said to Mr. Ashton, keep Nanny up, for she is going down to drown herself. Mr. Ashton said, you shall not make an end of your life, so come up stairs, so they both came up stairs. After that, Mr. Church went down stairs, and walked round Clay-Hall, and Mr. Ashton was up stairs in the mean time, and Mr. Ashton said to me, Nanny, come here, I have got no wife, I should like you; I said, no, I want not to be married, I am not old enough; he said, that is nothing at all, don't tell me these things; I said, let me go home; he said, you shall not; I said I would go down and drown myself; he said, you shall not make an end of your life for my sake, and then in the mean time Mr. Ashton did lie with me also in that dancing-room, and then when Mr. Church came up -</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, if you have a particle of doubt, I will go on. If the cause strikes you as it does me, there is not a colour for the prosecution from her own account; she goes with him a second day, opportunities are given her to discover it; she sits and talks with him in the room, and permits indecencies, if you have a doubt, I will go on with it.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts are the stairs that go up to that dancing-room? - It went first up stairs, and the dancing-room looked out of window into a pond.</p>
               <p>What part of the house did you go into to that dancing-room? - I went out of the garden.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, we are satisfied.</p>

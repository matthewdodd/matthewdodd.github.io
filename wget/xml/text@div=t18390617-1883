I live in Basing-place, Waterloo-road—I have a wharf in the Savoy, Strand—on the 30th of May I took my watch to Mr. Tollit, in the Strand, and gave it to his young man, to be repaired—it had three seals, a ring, and two or three keys attached to it—I afterwards heard it was stolen.</p>

On the 31st of May, between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked if any thing was wanted—I have known him for two years, coming to the shop for orders—he was close by the drawer where the watch was, but I did not know it was there—he was near enough to have taken it—he might have taken it without my seeing him, as my back was towards him, and I could not observe all his movements—there was a looking-glass on the counter, and he stood before it.</p>

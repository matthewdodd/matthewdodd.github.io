I advertis'd this at 20 guineas reward on the conviction of the person that stole it. The day after the advertisement, Mr. Pell, a pawnbroker, came and brought 4 yards of corded tabby; I could not be certain to it, the mark being cut off, and it was cut into small pieces. I sent for my weaver from Spittle fields, who weav'd it, he brought the fellow piece to that I lost; the 4 yards tally'd with that. There were brought 2 yards the next day, which were pawn'd to Mr. Gunston, a pawnbroker, the very same sort. Mr. Pell told me, he knew the person particularly well that pawn'd the 4 yards to him. I apply'd to Justice Fielding for a warrant to take him up. It happen'd, he came again to Mr. Pell on the 30th of May to take a coat out of pawn, and he secur'd him; his name was Bradford. We detain'd him till we got the man at the bar; he was taken at the black horse in Bedford bury; we went in at the red lion in Russel street in a back room; he wanted to tell me something privately. I said to the constable, go and call for something at the bar; then the prisoner told me he was very unhappy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176007090009"></xptr> in a wife, she was given much to drinking, and had spent him 3 or 400 l. at Bristol, and she would certainly be the ruin of him. I order'd the constable to go and take the woman if he could. He own'd he had pawn'd 4 yards of this silk to Mr. Pell. 2 to Mr. Gunston, 4 at the bottom of St. Martin's lane, 4 in Holborn, he could not tell the names; he said he would go along with me to the places; we went, and found but 2 yards at that house in Holborn, and 6 yards we found put up his chimney where he lodg'd. We have found all but 2 yards; he acknowledged his wife had taken the piece; when she was taken, she at the same place in Russel street acknowledg'd she had taken it; she acknowledg'd she carry'd the 2 yards to Mr. Bibby.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 14.) On the 18th of Oct. I was in the Commercial-road, and saw the prisoner, with a bag in his hand—he was about ten or twelve yards from a wagon, which was standing about the middle of the road, with two hogsheads of sugar in it—before I got up to him he had got against the door of Mr. Mews, a confectioner—I asked what he had got—he said, "A parcel for the mistress"—he could see a woman in the shop at that time—I went in, and asked Mrs. Mews whether the parcel was for her—she said, "No, I know nothing at all about it"—he said, "Yes, you gave me the bag"—I said, "You hear what the woman says, have you got a bill of it?"—he said he had not—I said. "Where did you get it from?"—he said a man had put it into his wagon to leave at Mrs. Mew's, but who the man was he did not know—the bag contained sugar, and weighed 36lbs., bag and all—I compared the sugar in the bag with that in the hogsheads, and it corresponded in colour and quality—I looked into the wagon, and observed the tin over the drawing hole appeared to have been raised up, by, I should say, a similar thing to this small crow-bar, which I saw found in the wagon—the crow-bar appeared to be covered with the same sort of sugar—there was a leather apron spread</p>

               <p>down in the wagon, which was also sprinkled with sugar—the prisoner did not claim the apron—it was such a one as a carman would wear.</p>

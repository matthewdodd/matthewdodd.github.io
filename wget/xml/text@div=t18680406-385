                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Cartwright, a shoemaker, of 1, South Street, Forest Hill—the deceased, Alfred Cartwright, was my son—he was twenty-seven years of age in June last—he had a wife and three children, and another expected—he had a little shop, which his wife managed—he himself had been for nearly four years potman at the Swiss Cottage—last Thursday night, 2nd April, from 11 o'clock till half-past, I went to the Swiss Cottage, to get half a pint of beer for my supper—I found my son there, and my husband also—I did not get my beer—my husband, my son, and I shortly proceeded to come home together—I accompanied my son to his house; I was going to see his wife—when we got to the house, we found several persons round the shutters, making a disturbance—the prisoner was one of them—I did not know him at all—they were quarrelling, and knocking and battering against the shutters, and my son asked them not to make such a disturbance—he said, "Move on a little further; don't make a disturbance just here"—with that, the prisoner rose his fist, and made three strikes at my son, but he jumped from the blows off into the road, and missed them, avoided the blows—he went across to his father and said, "Father, I can't put up with this; I will go and see if I can find a constable, and have him locked up, at least, have him moved further"—the prisoner could hear that—we went across the road, and looked up the street to see if we could see a policeman, and we could not, and on our return we saw a policeman with the mob, dispersing them as he could—at that time, the prisoner and his party were just a few steps further on, and as my son came towards them, the prisoner said, "There is the fellow that I offered a <hi rend="italic">prop</hi> to"—I don't know what a <hi rend="italic">prop</hi> means, unless it is a blow; I under<lb></lb>stood it as that—he then rose his fist, and struck him a blow on the side of the right eye—it was a violent blow; the mark is on him now—the police<lb></lb>man was there then; he saw the blow struck—my son gave him in charge to the policeman, and he took him in charge for the blow, and proceeded to take him to the station—he took hold of his left arm, and they walked on in that way; I, my son, and my husband followed after—my son was walking on the left side of the policeman, and I and my husband walked by his side—as we were walking along in that way, the prisoner looked round in front of the policeman, and said to my son, "Here, I wish to know, do you mean to look me up for that simple crack"—we had then gone from about half to three-quarters of a mile—my son Raid, "Yes, I do mean it; if you don't know better, you must be taught"—he said, "Then you do mean to press the charge"—my son said, "I do"—for a moment or two after those</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186804060089"></xptr>
               <p>words they were quiet, and then he deliberately rose his right hand, and thrust it round into the body of my son, and he fell—he faltered a moment, but he never took another step—he fell into his father's arms; he supported him—he said, "Mother, I am stabbed"—I saw the glitter of the knife as the prisoner struck round in front of the policeman—my son sank to the ground, as his father helped him—I undid his waistcoat and the waistband of his trousers, and his warm blood came over my bands—the policeman directly conveyed the prisoner to the station; I and my husband remained with my son—a stretcher was afterwards brought, and he was taken into the station, and Dr. Wilkinson looked at him; he bound a large bandage round the wound—it was thought right to take him immediately to the hospital—a cab was procured, and I and the policeman went with him—but he died in the cab, in my arms—the prisoner was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it directly after the prisoner asked your son whether he was really going to give him into custody for the assault, that the blow was struck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was not more than two moments—he muttered some word but I could not understand it—when I first saw these people at my son's shutters they were making a great noise, quarrelling and talking very loud, and talking about fighting—they were challenging each other to fight for a shilling—I can't say how many there were, but there seemed to be a good many—they were making quite a riot when we came up—the policeman had a good deal of difficulty to disperse them—they were noisy and violent—there was some woman, I believe, that was in liquor, by the way of her talking and going on—I did not notice much, but I believe there was one in liquor—it was about from a quarter io ten minutes to 12, when the policeman took the prisoner in charge—this row was going on for some quarter of an hour or twenty minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of last witness, and father of the deceased—on Thursday last I was with my wife at the Swiss Cottage—I accompanied her and my son to his house—when we got there I saw the prisoner and some other persons—I did not know the prisoner before—he was quarrelling with some woman that was there—my son came up at the same time, and wished him to move on, as he did not want that dis<lb></lb>turbance in front of his place—the prisoner upon that aimed a blow at him—he stepped on one side out of the way of it, and sprang out into, the road—he said, "Father, I can't stand this, we will find a policeman"—after looking up the road, we came back and found a policeman a few steps from the place where the quarrel was—as my son came up I heard the prisoner say, "That is the man, 'or' the b——' that I wanted to give a <hi rend="italic">prop</hi> to, but he would not take it"—my son got closer to the prisoner, and the prisoner shot out his hand and struck him a tremendous blow in the eye; the marks are there now—I did not see that the prisoner struck him with any<lb></lb>thing but his fist—my son had not time to say anything—the policeman took hold of the prisoner in an instant—and my son gave him into custody—the policeman laid hold of the prisoner, and they walked along towards the station, and I and my son and my wife as well—when we got up before Mr. Beadle's house, the prisoner called my son in front of him—he nodded his head and said, "Do you mean to give me in custody for this simple crack?"—he said, "Yes, if you don't know better, you must be learnt better"—they had not gone another step farther, I think, before the prisoner muttered something else, and then he reached round in front of the police<lb></lb>man with his hand, and stabbed my sun in his side, and he fell down instantly</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 293). I was on duty last Thursday night in the Grove Road, Forest Hill—there was a disturbance in the Park Road, in which the prisoner and others were engaged—I tried to disperse them, and desired the prisoner to go home—he was about to fight with a man for a shilling; they were arguing together—I prevented the fight—they afterwards got together again, and said they were determined to fight—I again desired the prisoner to go home—at this time the deceased came up—the prisoner was close by me at the time—the deceased asked for the man that had previously attempted to assault him—I said, "I don't know the man"—he said, "I will point him out"—the prisoner immediately plunged forward, and struck him a blow on the right eye—upon that he gave him into custody—I took him, and we all proceeded together to the station—the prisoner did not say anything when I took him—I took him by the left arm—I put my right arm inside his left, and held him firmly—his right hand was free; he had not much power with his left hand, because I had him by the lower part of that arm—the deceased, and his father and mother, walked on my left—before we got to the station the prisoner asked the deceased if he intended to be so hard-hearted as to lock him up for that common assault—he said he did; if he did not know better he must be taught—we had walked about 300 yards from where I took him when the first question was asked; it was asked on two or three occasions—I should say we went over three-quarters of a mile before there was any further con<lb></lb>versation—when we arrived in High Street the deceased came by my left arm (I had previously warned him to go and walk by his father and mother in the road)—he came up as if to ask me a question, and the prisoner, leaning his head a little to the front, said to him, "Then you will lock me up, eh?"—the deceased said, "I will"—I then saw the prisoner's arm go very sharply in front of my body, in a moment—I seized the prisoner by the right wrist, and at the same time heard the deceased say, "I am stabbed"—I took this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the prisoner's right hand; it has a spring back to it, so that it will not shut until the spring is touched—it was covered with blood at the time I took it from his hand—I said to the prisoner, "What have you done?"—he said, "The b——won't get over that"—I called for help, and two brother constables coming up behind we took the prisoner to the station—he was sober—I afterwards went book, and took the wounded man to the station, and then assisted him to the hospital—he died on the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How often did the prisoner ask Cartwright whether he intended to give him into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two or three times—he did not ask it immediately on my taking him into custody—I should think we had proceeded about 300 yards—up to that time I had not the slightest diffi<lb></lb>culty in holding the prisoner—he did not become excited then; he did after he had stabbed the deceased, not before; and he was not continually addressing the deceased while I was conveying him to the station—I requested the deceased to walk in the road with his father and mother, and no further conversation took place—it was after the deceased answered "I will" that the stab was given—after that it was with great difficulty that I took him to the station—I had to carry him on my right side; but previously to that</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—about 2.30 last Friday morning, the deceased was brought there by his mother and the constable; he was quite dead—later in the morning I examined the body: there was a large bruise on the right eye, and a wound in the side, which had penetrated the liver and a large artery in the abdomen; it went back to the spine—the front wall would press in with the knife, so that it might not be more than three inches in extent—the loss of blood from that wound was the cause of death—a knife of this description would inflict such a wound.</p>

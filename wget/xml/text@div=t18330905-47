            . On the evening in question, I was told of this circumstance, I missed my handkerchief, and two boys were pointed out to me; I followed them - the prisoner secreted himself behind a stone in St. Paul's, Covent-garden, church yard; I went to him and asked him for my handkerchief; he said he had not got it, and he did not know who had.</p>

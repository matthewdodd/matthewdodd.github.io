               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did not she say that she objected to let her box be searched except by an officer? A. Yes - she left several boxes behind her - I did not open any of them in her absence - the box she took away was found at the next door neighbour's - I expect she was not staying there, but I was sitting in my parlour when she took the box, and saw it was so heavy she could not carry it far - I made inquiry, and found that she had left it there.</p>

I saw the prisoner, who asked me to treat her with a glass of porter. I said if she would go into a house I would, and did. When we came out, she wanted me to go with her, and I said I should not. I stood talking with a friend of mine at the door - she kept asking me to go with her. I then felt her hand coming out of my breeches pocket. I missed a crown piece, and two half-crowns - she ran away, and was pursued - the money was found upon her.</p>

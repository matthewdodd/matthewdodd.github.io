                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer. The prisoners are not related to me—I have employed the prisoner, James Kent, at times—on the 21st of March, I employed him to do a job for me—I met him very late in the even<lb></lb>ing of the 23rd, in Seward-street, Goswell-street—the other prisoner is his wife, I believe—she was with him—it was about half-past eight o'clock—I told him if he would come down I would pay him—that was to a public-house, about half-way down the street—we went there, but before that, I had pointed out a public-house, and they said, "Don't go into such a b—hole as that"—we at last went into the White Horse—I said to the man, "Now, James, make your charge; say plenty, for I shall be sure to beat you down"—he said, "Well, I will say ten shillings"—I said, "Very well," and gave him ten shillings—we sat there some time, and drank together—I called for a pot of beer, just before I paid him, and we had a quartern and a half of gin—in a few minutes we went outside the door, and went together to the Cock, at the top of Brick-lane, and had a quartern and a half of gin, and I think three or four pots of beer—while I was in the Cock, the two prisoners got into very close conversation together—I said I never knew such behaviour between them before—I came out of there about eleven o'clock in the evening, or after that, and went away to go home—I said, "Now I shall go home, my wife is waiting for me"—the male prisoner said, "If you will come down to a house below here, I can get in at any time;" and I went with them to the Goat, and there had a quartern and a half of gin, or a pot of porter, I can't be certain which—I was then going home—they told me to come to their house to partake of some porter, which they had in a bottle, and some gin which was bought at the Goat—I went up to their own room—there was a girl there, who told me, after a short time, that my wife had been there—I said, "When?"—she said, "To-night"—the female prisoner said, "You lie, you d—d young b—, it is a fortnight ago, hold your tongue"—the servant said, my wife came there and said that I had money about me—I had five pounds worth of silver, and</p>

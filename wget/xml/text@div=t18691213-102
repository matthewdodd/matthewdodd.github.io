I am assistant to Mr. Beed, a fishmonger, of 292, Mare Street, Hackney—on 25th November I served the prisoner with two bloaters, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a florin, and I gave him a shilling, a sixpence, and a fourpenny-piece—I kept the florin in my hand, and after he had gone I tried it and found it was bad—I went after him, found him across the road, and said, "Do you know what you gave me, this bad two-shilling-piece; I want you to give me back the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I gave you"—he said, "No, let me go back to the shop"—on the way I said, "If you do not give me the money I shall call a constable; if you do, I shall let you go"—he made no reply, and I gave him in custody, with the florin—the policeman told him to give me two good shillings, and he did so.</p>

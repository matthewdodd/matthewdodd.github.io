I am an engineer—I live in Cavendish-row—I was in the Robin Hood on 10th May—I saw the prisoner and another man come in the tap-room—I saw the prisoner put his hand in his pocket and pull out a handful of money from his pocket, and he was scraping it over with his other hand; he then took a half-crown and went to the bar—the other man went with him—I did not see the prisoner served, but I went out when I heard him abusing the last witness and her mother to see if I could see an officer—I was turning back and the other man was at the back of me, running down the road—I went back to the bar and the caps were there which the other man had had for sale—the constable came in and Miss Nash gave the prisoner in custody—the prisoner threatened to bite my nose off because I interfered—I told him if he had done wrong he would suffer for it—he wanted me to show some resistance—he made two or three jumps at me with his mouth wide open.</p>

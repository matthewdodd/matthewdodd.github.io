               <p>Princes Street, next door to our counting-house—he was perfectly sober then—I did not speak to him—about half past 10, on going towards the doorway, the prisoner walked towards me from the Salutation, and asked me whether I would give him back his job—I said "Certainly not, after the way you conducted yourself last night I will have nothing more to do with you, be off about your business"—I turned to go into the counting-house, my head was partly in the office when I felt a blow on my left ear—no word was uttered till I felt the blow—I then turned round, and the prisoner said something—he had a brick held up and was about striking me again, saying he would do for me—I put up my hand and caught his wrist as he was going to strike me again with the brick, and whether I took it out of his hand, or whether it fell, I am not certain, for I became insensible, and was taken to the hospital—for 20 days I was not able to take off my clothes or go to bed—I suffered very much, and I suffer now—the injury is still visible—I am partly deaf with that ear—I did not use bad language to the prisoner on the Monday night, or strike him—he did not say to me on Tuesday morning, "Why did you cut my head yesterday?"—I did not say I would give him a great deal more—it is not true that after he struck me with the brick I struck him three times on the head with it, and then followed him into the middle of the road and struck him again—it is all decidedly untrue—I have given a true account to the best of my belief.</p>

I attended Mr. Ernest Day on 4th March—the upper portion of the left ear was cut right across to the extent in depth of about half or three-quarters of an inch, and was smashed entirely off; it could not be found; we searched for it; the head was cut into down to the skull-bone to the extent of about three inches—this brick was shown to me at the time; it had blood on it; it was a very hard brick, and the cut was exactly the kind of cut as would have arisen from a blow with such a weapon—it must have been a very violent blow, but from the ear inter<lb></lb>posing the force of the blow, if that had not acted as a buffer in stopping the force of the blow, he would have been either paralysed or killed—he still suffers pain—he is permanently disfigured—he had to keep in one position for some days—when he attempted to lie down for two or three weeks he had such intense pain in the head I was afraid he would have abscesses there—it was a very serious injury; he was in danger of his life for a consider<lb></lb>able time.</p>

I had been at work going on four years there, and never had any quarrels. I have been a quiet, hard-working man. It was Mr. Ernest's fault that this row was caused between us; if he had not insulted me on the Monday night this would not have happened. I did not intend to inflict such punishment on him as I have done.</p>

            . I am niece to Mr. Read. I recollect my uncle going out on the evening he has mentioned; I was at the time sitting in the parlour, facing the shop door; was shut, the parlour door faces the shop; the shop door was shut, the parlour door was open. In my uncle's absence, a person came in; I did not go out at all. The servant girl was down stairs. A gentleman came in, and bought an umbrella; we did not touch any thing in the window; he did not touch any thing in that part where the umbrella; was stolen from. When he went away, I shut the door myself; it has a brass handle to turn, so that a person may open it from the outside by turning that handle; I latched it. After that I went back into the parlour, and sat there. To the best of my recollection, in about ten minutes after, I perceived that the shop door was open, by the difference in the sound of the coaches made in going past; I had not heard it opened; I instantly got up, and found the door was partly open; it was wide enough open for a man to put his hand in. I did not, at that time, miss any umbrella; I had no idea that any person had taken any thing out; I had no suspicion, but thought that the door might have given way of itself; it never did so, that I found out before. In about two minutes, I heard the cry of stop thief; Mr. Lee came to the shop, and brought one of the prisoner with him, it was the tallest. The umbrella was thrown away. After Mr. Lee brought the prisoner to the shop, he was taken to St. Martin's watch-house. A search was made, for the umbrella, but it was not found. When Mr. Lee came. I missed the umbrella, and even before, when I first heard the cry of stop thief; it was missed from the left hand as you go into the shop; I had it in my hands two hours before, and I am certain it had been there. A person, by putting his hand in at the door, so far open only as I found it, could reach the umbrella down from the form on which it was hanging. I am quite sure that might have been done. I know nothing more.</p>

            . On the night at the 24th of January, I was passing Mr. Read's to a neighbour's; it was hardly eight, it might want about ten minutes to it. I observed the two prisoners looking in at his shop window; I am most positive of their persons. I went where I was going, and on my returning, I found their nearly in the same situation. I have suffered repeatedly from depredations of the same kind as the present. I passed them, and went to my own door; I cast my eye so as to get a view of them, and see their faces; there are two very small houses and Richardson's lottery office between my house and the prosecutor's; there are only two doors between us. I took advantage of a very strong gaz-light to look at the prisoners. I then crossed to the King's-mews gate, which enabled me to watch them without their seeing me, as I hoped; I saw them very intent upon the window, and then the gentleman alluded to by the last witness, went into the shop; upon that, they walked off. I followed them round Spring Gardens completely, and then they took their situation as before; I followed them, and I did not go as far back as the mews gate, but I went about three parts across the crossing. I then observed that the prisoner Babb, was very intent upon one of the lower squares of glass immediately adjoining of the door; from his manner, as from the first, I had a suspicion that he was going to cut the glass. Crow, the other prisoner, came close up to him at that time. I had a suspicion they were going to cut the glass; but before I had crossed, they both retired towards the Phoenix engine-house, where they were in the dark. I had an opportunity of seeing through the door that

             had taken her seat again in the parlour; it is a glass door. Babb then stepped forward, and I saw him most distinctly put his hand to the latch, and open the door; he opened it just sufficient to put his hand in the direction where the umbrellas was, and I saw him take the umbrella out most distinctly; I instantly ran, and he had put the umbrella into the left hand of Crow. I could have taken Babb, but I followed Crow, he having the property. Babb, but I followed Crow, he having the property. Babb ran almost against me; Crow went Westminster way, round the statue of King Charles; I pursued him; not having disengased the umbrella from his left hand, he threw it towards the coach stand; he then ran round the statute towards St. Martin's-lane; I pursued him, crying stop thief; by that cry, several persons came out, and he was impeded, and brought to a dodge, and I came up to him, and took him. After having taken him back to Mr. Read's, I went in search of the umbrella; I did not find it. I re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140018"></xptr>turned to Mr. Read's, and questioned the prisoner Crow, who that other man was, and where he was to be found; he very redily told us where we should find him. I took him to the watch-house. He said Babb lived in Gardener's-lane, York-street, Westminster; they both lodged in one house; in Crow's mother's house. The constable of the night and the officer went after him. I have tried all means to recover the umbrella; but can't get no tidings of it; the coachman on the stand have denied all knowledge of it.</p>

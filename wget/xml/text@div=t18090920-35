            . On the ninth of this month I in company with the officers went to search the prisoner's house, he was at home. We found two blankets in his bed-room on the bed, and one on the box, they being government blankets I was certain he could not have bought them, we found a saddle-girth in his drawer, which I have no doubt was taken from the house, in the cellar we found a table cover under a garden light, the table cover we had used for domestic purposes, we also found 2 pieces of green baize these are the blankets, I know them to be mine, they are decayed government stores, they are manufactured on purpose for Chelsea College, the family has had the contract for forty years and no one has had them ever since. We never sell blankets in that state, we always boil them before they are sold, this is a saddle girth, we could not miss them because we never take stock. I know the table-cover, it was made on purpose for a table, it is worth sixpence, and the piece of baize, we had baize of that description. I was in the cellar when the officer found it, the prisoner gave us the key of the cellar when we asked him for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else live in the house besides the prisoner. - A. Yes, several other persons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. None of this property you can swear to in any other mode than it is like the property which you had. - A. Yes there is no doubt about the property.</p>
               <p>Q. As the green baize was in your domestic use, you had servants in the house had not you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether any of them might have taken it away you do not know. - A. I suppose they would not, it might be so.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in the habit of working in the first respectable houses in the city, and for my prosecutor and have received bills for them, I defy my prosecutor to say, or any person that ever I injured any person of a farthing.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner called eight witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

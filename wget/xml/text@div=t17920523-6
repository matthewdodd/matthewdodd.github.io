On Thursday, about two o'clock, while my father's servants were taking in ten hogsheads of sugar, after two loads had been delivered and paid for, at the compting-house, the prisoner came to me, and said he had brought a load of sugar; I asked him his number? he said 395; I told him I had no silver, but desired him to call in half an hour; he objected, and begged I would let him go and get change; I gave him the guinea to get change; he never returned.</p>

               <p>Please you, my Lord, and Gentlemen, I went along with a carman, and he advised me to give in that number: I took the guinea to get change; and going down Fish-street, the guinea slipped out of my hand into the kennel; and several people looked for it; and there was an odd sort of a man, who I would not swear did not pick it up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses to his character.</p>

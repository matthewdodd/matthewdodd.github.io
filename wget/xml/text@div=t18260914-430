On the 11th of September, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was in the shop - I saw the prisoner enter and take three pieces of bombazeen from a shelf behind the counter, about eight yards within the door - he went round the counter - there was only myself in the shop, and I was in the second division; the shop is divided into three divisions; the prisoner could not see me, but I could see him very well - he said nothing, nor made any observation, when he took it down - I followed him fifteen or twenty yards from the shop, when I seized him, and brought him back; he said he was employed by a person who gave him a shilling to take it to the bottom of Old Bond-street; I sent for an officer, who took it from him, and here it is; there are fifty-eight yards - the lowest value is 10l., it cost my employer that money.</p>

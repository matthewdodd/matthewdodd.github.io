                  </hi>. I am twenty-two years old, and am a labourer—on Monday, 20th December, about 1 o'clock in the night, I was in John-street, Deptford, going home—I was the worse for liquor—I met the prisoner, who I had never seen before—he pushed against me in the road—I asked him what he was doing—he said he would tell me if I stopped—a constable came up, and I told him if he did not go on he would lock him up—I walked on, and he walked in the same direction—when I got to the bottom of John-street he struck me on the forehead, and cut the peak of my cap right in half (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but my forehead was not cut—I then pushed him in the chest—a policeman came up, and he said he would watch him—I went on towards Creek-road, and the policeman was behind—the prisoner called me over, and I had one foot on the kerb, he being five or six feet away from me—he rushed at me, struck me in the throat, and I felt that I was cut, but saw no knife—I called "Police," and fell on the ground—I called out that I was stabbed, and the policeman tied a handkerchief tightly round my neck twice—I went into Guy's Hospital on the 20th, and came out on the 31st.</p>

On Sunday morning, 20th December, I saw the prosecutor at the corner of John-street, Deptford—he was very drunk, and I advised him to go home—I saw the prisoner and another man bidding one another good morning—the prosecutor came staggering along—the prisoner went to him, and wanted to fight—I told him to go home about his business—I kept him in front of me to the corner of the Creek-road where the prosecutor came up, and wanted to know what he meant by insulting him—they exchanged blows, I got between them, and told the prisoner if he did not go home I should lock him up—he then called the prosecutor across, I advised him not to go across, but he did, and immediately <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out, "I am stabbed"—I picked him up, and found blood gushing from his throat—I tied his neck-handkerchief tight, and sent</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—the prosecutor was brought there with an incised wound on the right side of his neck, about two and a half inches long, apparently made by a sharp instrument—I think he had lost a good deal of blood—the small arteries were divided—he was under medical treatment nine or ten days—the wound is quite healed now.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found the mutton in several pieces? A. Yes; the prisoners live very near the prosecutor - I heard of the sheep being stolen on the Friday; it was generally known that inquiry was making about it: William occupies the house - he seemed much flurried; the mutton was in a safe in the first floor room - it is common for poor people to have a hatchet; William was very drunk when he made resistance - he did not tell me he had bought the meat at Brentford; the field the sheep was slaughtered in was closed on one side by a wooden fence and a bedge on the other side; I examined the marks on Tuesday, before twelve o'clock - it is a grass field, but the marks were close to the bedge, where there is no grass; I swear one shoe has not had a tip on it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I heard of Minton losing his sheep on the Friday afternoon, and on the Saturday morning I was at Queen-square; before I went away I advised my brother officer to get a search-warrant, as I suspected the prisoner; I returned at night from Queen-square, and went to assist in taking the elder prisoner at his own house - he was very drunk, and made a great deal of resistance, called for his spade, and said he would split our heads in pieces; the mutton was taken to the station-house before I got there - Minton saw it at the station on Monday, and claimed it; I never saw any cut by a butcher in that way: I was present on Monday when George was secured, on the road to Brentford - we had been looking for him from the Saturday, but could not find him; he had a bundle, which he threw away - a girl with him took it up, and went away with it; I heard William say he had bought the mutton, and would clear his robins, by which I understood his children: I went to the field, saw the shoes fitted to the marks on the Tuesday morning, and some corresponded with George's shoe - in my judgment that shoe made the impressions.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You examined them six days after the sheep was slaughtered? A. It was Tuesday morning; I did not search their house; the father was in custody at the time I took the son, and the meat was in possession of the officer; a reward of twenty guineas had been offered for the apprehension of the thieves - I did not see the bills till the Friday; they were at the station-house: I did not see any posted; the shoes were given to the prisoner again.</p>

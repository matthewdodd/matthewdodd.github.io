               <p>10th February, about midnight, I was returning home from my club, and just as I got opposite the Victoria Theatre, facing the stage door, I acci<lb></lb>dentally came into collision with a woman who was turning out of a coffee-stall—she had an apron full of marketing, and we both ran against each other—I apologised to her and begged her pardon, and while I was doing so, the female prisoner walked up and struck me in the mouth—I rushed at her—another woman named Bartholomew ran between us—I forced both of them down—Doulton then walked up to me, asked me why I had upset his coffee, and struck me a blow on the mouth, which staggered me—he came at me again before I had time to defend myself—while I was endeavouring to do so, Day, who was about a yard behind him, followed up the assault, and I was knocked down again by Doulton—Day then kicked me in the left jaw—I saw Jones go behind me, and I received repeated kicks on the back of the head, but I could not say who inflicted them, though I believe it must have been Jones—I was kicked till I was insensible—when I came to myself, I found my waistcoat torn open, and my watch and chain gone—I had last seen them when I met the woman Bartholomew—she was taken to the police-station, but she was found to be a respectable woman, going home with her marketing and discharged, as having no connexion with these people.</p>

I live at 3, Holme's-terrace, Waterloo-road—on 10th February, about ten minutes past 12 at night, I was in the Waterloo-road, opposite the Victoria Theatre, and saw Mr. Bird talking to a woman, who said she wished her husband was there, and she would give him in charge—they were having a little quarrel together, and, until I heard her say that, I thought it was man and wife, and did not take much notice—just after that Butler came up and smacked him in the face—he went towards her to retaliate, and the other female, Bartholomew, the one he was first talking to, tried to prevent him from touching her, and he knocked Butler down upon Bartholomew—it was a push—Doulton then came up, and asked Bird what he had knocked his coffee over for—I did not altogether hear what Bird said, but I saw Doulton <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his right hand, and knock him into the road—he got up again and tried to defend himself as well as he could, but as Doulton was ready before he could recover himself, he knocked him about right and left—they struggled for three or four yards from the place where Doulton first knocked him down, and then they both fell together, Bird first, and Doulton on the top of him—four or five others rushed from the coffee-stall, and picked Doulton up—I do not know who they were—I do not see them in Court—after that they were two or three minutes round Bird, as I thought, picking their mate up—then I saw the prosecutor coming towards me, with his and up to his face as if he had received a blow or cut, and then I heard them halloa out "Police!" and I ran with the police-man, but did not succeed in catching him.</p>

I am a cabinet-maker, of 10, Princes-street, South<lb></lb>wark—on the morning of 11th February, about a quarter past 12, I was in the neighbourhood of the Victoria Theatre, and saw Bird and two women together—one of the women said she would give him in charge for insulting her—he said he had not insulted her, and told her to keep a respectable distance from him—whilst they were talking, she went up to a man at the corner, and afterwards came back and gave Bird a blow in the face—Bird then knocked her down, and they fell against the coffee-stall—a man came up to him, asked him what he was doing, and said he had knocked his coffee over—Bird said he was taking care of himself—then the man knocked him on the face, and said, "Take care of yourself then"—he was knocked down and kicked about most brutally, and when he got up, they commenced fighting, and three or four men ran to the assistance of their companion—I do not know who they were—I cannot swear to the prisoners.</p>

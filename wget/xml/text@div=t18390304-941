                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live on Great Saffron-hill. The prisoner had been my journeyman for three years—he went to bed a few minutes after twelve o'clock on Monday night, the 25th of February—it was customary for him to call me about three o'clock in the morning, but he did not do so—I went down, between four and five o'clock, and he was gone—I found a brandy-bottle empty—I found that the counter had been cut, and the till taken out—the till was then empty, and about ten shillings' worth of copper, which had been in it, was gone—I went with the policeman, and found the prisoner in bed, in about twenty minutes—the policeman showed this one farthing to me, which is one that I had in my till the day before—I know it, because I gave it to a person, and it was returned as being a bad one.</p>

               <p>I lost two sheets and a blanket, having lost several things before I went to search for them, and found these at the Pawnbroker's, that was the 18th of March, it was at Mr. Howard's in Hounsditch, the prisoner continued in my house, she denied knowing any thing of them, and would not let us come in till the constable came; when we told her we had found them, she said she would fetch them out if we would have patience with her, and forgive her.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker, I have two sheets and a blanket pawned by the prisoner for nineteen shillings, she pawned them the 26th of February, she had several times pawned things, and redeemed them, I asked her if they were her own property, she said yes, I asked her whether she lived in ready furnished lodgings, she said no, I am certain she was the person that pawned them, they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tiley proved the two sheets, one is marked, the other not, I gave them her to put on the bed, I am sure of it, I mangled this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I acknowledge making use of the things, I had not left the apartment, I told her I would put them in the place, I am innocent of the other affair, I had a witness here, a gentleman who keeps his carriage was here to give me a character, but my name was not in the bill, it is all spite and nothing else.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did this woman ever pawn any sheets and blankets before with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And redeemed them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. If you think they were pledges with intent of redeeming them it does not amount to a felony.</p>

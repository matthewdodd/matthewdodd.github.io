               <p>GEORGE BOOTH. I am shopman to Mr. Death. On the 29th of September, about nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came into the shop, with another man, who went to the right-hand counter, the prisoner to the left. The other man asked for some shoe-ribbon-the prisoner asked for nothing, but stood at the counter; there were nine cards of lace on that counter - I was at the other end of the shop; I moved them all into the window, they were still within the prisoner's reach-the gas was lighted - I was going out for a candle. The other man had got his ribbon; the prisoner asked him if he did not want some white? he said, "Yes, I will look at some." The young woman brought the drawer to him. I went out to buy some candles, but seeing the prisoner shift nearer to the counter, I stopped outside in the street, at the corner of the window, to watch him. I had not been there a minute before I saw him take the whole of the nine cards, and put them under his great-coat, which hung on his arm. I immediately ran over to the watch-house, and got a constable. As the constable came out of the watch-house door, the prisoner and his companion came out of the shop - I pointed them out; he secured the prisoner, his companion immediately ran away-the prisoner took the lace. I saw it fall from him immediately as they collared him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. My suspicions were excited by seeing him shift towards the window. I am certain the prisoner took the lace - He was never out of my sight; the watch-house is immediately opposite. I could see the shop all the while. I picked up some of the lace.</p>
               <p>JOHN FORRESTER. I am a constable. Booth came to me - We ran out immediately from the watch-house, saw the prisoner, and collared him. Some person said he was the man. I found nothing on him. I picked up a piece of lace about half a yard from him. Only Love and myself were near him-Hargrave came after.</p>

            . I went with Forrester. The prisoner and another man came out of the shop at the same time - I seized the prisoner. There was some lace scattered about the pavement; no other person was passing-it could not have fallen from any other person. I found 11l.4s. on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoner came out first. I believe the other man had not left the shop when I first saw the lace-my attention was directed to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HARGRAVE. I am a constable. I came up, and picked up six pieces of lace. Booth found the others - I produce them.</p>

               <p>Wade. She said, she had a brother that lived at Chatham, that had bought them in the country, and sent them to her. I have bought odd volumes of her for three or four months, one a week or so.</p>

He brought in a book, and said I had conveyed it from under my petticoat. He carried me before justice Welch, and he committed me to Bridewell.</p>

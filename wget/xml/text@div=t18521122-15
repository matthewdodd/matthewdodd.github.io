On Wednesday, 10th Nov., at half-past 2 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in the Harrow-road, and saw the prisoner with another man—they were standing talking very loud—they walked on towards Kensal-green—they stopped after a short time, and returned to where I was—they were talking very loud, and I crossed over to where they were—the prisoner asked me the way to Kensal-green—I told him straight up the road as far as be could go, and that they had better go on, as they were making such a noise that they would disturb the inhabitants—the prisoner said, "B—r the inhabitants, and on too"—the other man went on and said to the prisoner, "Come on, mate;" the prisoner followed him towards Kensal-green—I followed seven or eight yards behind them—the other man said, "I think he is an Englishman"—the prisoner said, "D—n and b—r the b—y Englishmen"—they walked on, and I walked behind—the prisoner turned round and said, "You h—r, if you follow me any further I will give you something (or yourself"</p>

               <p>—at that time I had nearly got up to them—the prisoner went a step or two forward, turned round, made a rush at me, and struck me on the left side of my cheek—I did not at first feel that I was stabbed—I caught hold of the prisoner, and said, "You stabbed me, you rascal"—he said, "Yes," you b—r, and I will do it again"—the blood poured out of my mouth and down my cheek—the prisoner struck me again—another constable came up—I told him I was stabbed, and he took hold of the prisoner by the collar, and threw him down in the road—I afterwards had my wound dressed—I am still very weak—I have lost a great deal of blood.</p>

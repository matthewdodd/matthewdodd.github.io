               <p>On Wednesday night, the 9th of June, I was accosted by a female named Howard—I went with her into a house and slept there—I had a watch and chain with me—I got there about two o'clock, and stayed till the morning with her—when I awake I found I had lost my watch and chain—I saw nothing of the prisoner till the morning—I went out, brought in a constable, and told him what I had lost—he accosted the prisoner, and said what I had lost, and he denied my having anything of the kind at the time I came into the house—I am sure of that—I told him that I had, and had lost it in the house—he gave the officer permission to search the house—the officer said he was not authorized to do so, and did not—I gave the female into custody about nine o'clock on the Thursday evening—the prisoner was not arrested till after the female was taken—the watch produced is mine, and the one 1 lost on that occasion.</p>

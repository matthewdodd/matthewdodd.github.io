                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Statham, of Crutched Friars. On Saturday afternoon, 1st Aug., I had a horse and cart in Blackman Street, Borough—a mob had collected, and I saw the prisoner conversing with another man close against the tail of my cart—I saw the prisoner point the prosecutor out to the other man, who put his arm across the prosecutor's chest, and took his watch out of his pocket, not using the hand that was closest to the prosecutor—I saw him give the watch a snap; they then both stooped down together, and the other one handed the prisoner something; I could not distinguish what, but I spoke to the prosecutor—the prisoner and the other man ran up Vine Court, and the prosecutor and I ran after them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far were you from the prosecutor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a yard—there were about 100 people there, looking at a horse which had fallen—I had seen the other man before, and saw the watch in his hand; I also knew the prisoner.</p>

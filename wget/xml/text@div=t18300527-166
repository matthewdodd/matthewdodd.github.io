            . I took the prisoner on the Saturday evening, and found on him 4s. 6d. in silver, and 8d. in copper - I said, "This is a serious charge; what have you to say?" he said, "What I have to say I shall say in another place;" I found some papers in his jacket pocket - I said,"I must take them;" he said I should not, but he gave them up - he acknowledged before the Magistrate that he took the money, thinking it was his own, as he had received 10l. a short time before. 5l. he paid his landlord, and the other 5l. he thought he must have hidden, and thought this was it - he said he had taken half a crown on the Friday, and as that was not asked for he thought it must be his, and on Saturday he took the remainder.</p>
               <p>JAMES BARKER. He had paid me 5l. 2s. 6d. for board and lodging, but he owned me 7l. odd still - he received 10l., and spent the rest; I do not know whether my bills were in that jug.</p>
               <p>SELINA BARKER. He saw me in the parlour - he was neither sober nor drunk; I did not tell him he was doing wrong - I did not know the money was in the jug.</p>

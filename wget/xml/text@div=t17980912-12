               <p>Q. How were you dressed at the time? - A. I had the same jacket on that I have now; I had pulled off my waistcoat to wash the blood off of me.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the bundle contain? - A. A coat, a pair of pantaloons, a pair of stockings, and a pocket-handkerchief, and the handkerchief that it was tied up in was Mrs. Prager's; he said, if I would go home with him, I should have my cloaths again; I did go home after him directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened next? - A. I asked him if he would let me have my cloaths; he said, no, I should not have them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any reason why you should not have them? - A. No, he went out of the house directly; I asked his wife several times afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. But did you see him afterwards? - A. Yes, at the Flying-horse, on the 23d, opposite the Justice's office; I had applied at Lambeth-street for a warrant on the 22d in the evening to Col. Williams, and he was taken up; he came to the Flying-horse, and two or three along with him, and asked if I was going to make it up; I said, yes, I had no objection if he would give me my things; he said, not till I had paid him his bill; he said, if I would give him two or three glasses of wine, he would talk to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other conversation with him? - A. No; then I went over to the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention at first that you had lost the goods, or did you only complain of the blow that you had received? - A. I only took out a warrant for the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. After that you mentioned more particularly the whole of the business? - A. Yes, and then the Magistrate committed the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the cloaths since? - A. Yes, I saw them at the Justice's, and my watch with them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. So this man brought you from on board a ship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I strongly suspect he paid for your carriage to London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he occasionally lent you some money? - A. He gave me two guineas in money.</p>
               <p>Q. Which, I dare say, you, like a silly sailor, just come on shore, spent as fast as you could? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He bought things for you, did not he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And paid money for you for different things? - A. Yes, in bad company.</p>
               <p>Q. He bought you a jacket, did not he? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did not he spend a great deal of money in liquor for you in your drunken frolics? - A. He paid for liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he told you, I believe, that you owed him a great deal of money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he asked you to give an order to receive your wages? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By that time you had ran up a good score, had not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were a little quicker than him, for you went and got your wages first? - A. I asked him if he had seen the captain, and he said no, he had been, and he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he tell you your bill was? - A.Twenty-two pounds seventeen shillings and eight pence.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not till after he learned that you had got your wages from the captain that he gave you that blow upon the nose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He was very angry that you had received your wages? - A. I did not know that; he ran up stairs, and gave me a blow on the nose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you take out the warrant for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120010"></xptr>blow upon the nose, and nothing else? - A. Yes, the Justice would not hear it that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you get a warrant for, for the blow on the nose, or for taking the bundle? - A. For the blow on the nose.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not say any thing about the bundle then? - A. They said, if I had any thing more to say, I might say it to-morrow morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the sweetheart he recommended to you, and went to your other sweetheart, Mrs. Prager? - A. No, she was no sweetheart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you sleep there? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not he say he would take that bundle, and keep it till you paid him? - A. I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did he not say he would keep that bundle till you paid him? - A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. He took the bundle to his own house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say, I will keep this bundle till you discharge my bill? - A. No, he gave it to his wife for her to lock up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you repeatedly, that when you paid him his bill, you should have your cloaths, and that you should not have them till then? - A. No, he did not say so that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not tell him, if he would give you your cloaths, you would give him a note upon your return from the next voyage? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There were persons there who heard you, now be a little careful; did not you tell him at the Flying-horse, that you would give him a note for the remainder of his bill, if he would give you up the cloaths? - A. He said he would not give them me if I did such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. When you made him that offer to give him a note for the remainder of the money, did not he refuse it, and say, he would not part with the cloaths unless you paid him ready money? - A. He did not say any thing about ready money.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he not say I must have my money, or something of that sort? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Mrs. Prager was by at the time he took the cloaths? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He made no secret of it to her, did he; he took them away before her face? - A. Yes, he took them out from under her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the people asked you at the public-house, what you did owe him, did not they? - A. I do not remember that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say at the office that you believed you owed him eighteen or nineteen pounds? - A. No, I did not say any thing about how much I owed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never asked by any body whether you owed him any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You are sure that the prisoner took the things in the way in which you have described? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A great deal has been said of what passed at the Flying-horse-you were anxious to get on board a ship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the reason you offered him the note, that you might get your cloaths, and not be detained from going on board? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason then for offering the note? - A. Because I wanted to go to see if they would let me have my cloaths.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the last witness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were employed to wash for him the last month? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time that he bought any things? - A. Yes; he bought a coat, a pair of pantaloons, a pair of white stockings, a pocket-handkerchief, and a watch, to the amount of 5l.; he paid for them, and desired me to bring them home to my lodgings, which I did; when I got home, I put them upon the table, and soon after he came in all over blood, and soon after that the prisoner came in; I think it was the 22d, it was on a Wednesday; when he came in, I had my hand upon the bundle; I was talking to Barry, and he came in and said, whose bundle is this? I said, it is mine; he said, I will let you know it is mine, and took it away from me; from thence he returned to the chair, and took the outside jacket that the man has on now, and put it under his arm, and then he took the waistcoat; he put his hand into the pocket, and took out a watch; he told Barry that he had robbed him, that he would have him to Newgate; upon that he went away from the house.</p>

               <p>Q. So that these things were taken away from your house? - A. Yes; I rent the house.</p>

Yes; Barry then went away after Purnell; I saw them both the next day at the Flying-horse; he got abusing of Barry, and said he would have him out of the place because he was a foreigner, and he could get five pounds by him; I told him he could not, for my husband was a foreigner, and I knew better than that.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. So I understand you are an old acquaintance of the prosecutor's, but a stranger to the defendant? - A. Yes; I washed for his brother three years ago.</p>

               <p>Q. What passed at your house? - A. Mr. Purnell asked whose bundle that was, and I said it was mine.</p>
               <p>Q. How come you to say that it was your's? - A. The handkerchief was mine, and it was delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know that the sailor owed that poor man money? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard any conversation about his owing him money? - A. No, never till after Purnell was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the prosecutor said after that, that he did owe the prisoner money? - A. He said he owed him some money for board and lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he say he owed him? - A. I cannot say; he said, if he would give him his clothes, he would give him a note to pay the remainder of the money that he owed him upon his return from his next voyage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know you told a lie when you said it was your bundle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You had this bundle delivered to you by the poor sailor, to protect his property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your reason for so saying was, that the handkerchief was your's and the bundle being delivered into your care - Upon you oath did you yourself take any part of this poor sailor's money, or receive any benefit therefrom? - A. Yes, I sent for a pot of ale to drink, and that was all.</p>

             sworn. I am one of the officers belonging to Lambeth-street: On the 22d of August I received a warrant for an assault, and on the 23d I went down to execute it; I saw Purnell, and told him I had a warrant against him; he said, very well, he would go with me; he said, it would be more convenient to go at six o'clock in the evening, and he did come up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you made no search, as you had only a warrant for an assault? - A. No; the next morning I went to his house with a search warrant; I asked for Mrs. Purnell, and they told me she was in bed; I desired one of the young women to go up stairs with me; I went into the room, and she delivered this bundle up to me (producing it); I have bad it ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You went in consequence of a warrant granted by the Magistrate against this man; that was for the assault only? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe Purnell knew who it was that charged him with the assault? - A. The sailor went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then attempt to charge him with any thing else but breaking his nose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear Purnell mention that he had those things, and would keep them till the money was paid him? - A. I believe I heard him say he had them at home.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that before you executed the search warrant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. He made no secret of it that he had these goods? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What did he say he had them for? - A. I was there but a very few minutes, and I cannot recollect what passed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you not hear him say he took them for the payment of his bill, and he would not part with them till the bill was paid. - A. No, I did not, nor any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prosecutor talked about giving him a note? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Barry.) Look at these things, and tell the jury if they are your's? - A. Yes, they are.</p>


               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Upon you oath do not you believe that that man took them for the security of his debt, though it was against your will? - A. I did not know what I owed him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you believe you owed him some money at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath do not you believe he took these things to make you pay him the money you owed him? - A. It might be.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe he did? - A. I cannot tell, I had paid him eleven pounds before, and I did not know that I owed him any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe he took them to force you to pay the money? - A. He might; he said he would give me the clothes when I came home; it could not be upon that consideration.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not believe that he took them to compel you to pay him the money that he said you owed him - Did you think he took them for any other reason? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury. Under the circumstances of this case, I think it is a very different thing from a larceny: to be sure this man seems to me to have behaved extermely ill, and that we shall have him here again, I think is by no means improbable; but it is your duty and mine, to keep the time between an immoral act and a felonious act, otherwise, we shall have enternal confusion, It is very clear that this man has attempted to screw as much as he could out of this poor foreigner, but the question for us to decide is, whether it was a deliberate plan from the beginning, to get his goods, or was it his intention merely to secure the payment of a very extravagant bill? - The latter seems to me to be the case; and therefore, with my utter disapprobation of the whole of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120012"></xptr>transaction on the part of the prisoner, I think you will do amiss if you see it in any other view than as a means of extorting from this poor sailor, an extravagant bill, and that it was not a plot originally laid for the purpose of obtaining his goods. You see, when he was apprehended for the assault, he makes no secret of having these goods, but says he shall not have them till he has paid him his bill. That seems to me, very plainly, the state of the case, and therefore you will acquit him of this charge, however much you will convict him in your own minds of having extorted this money from the prosecutor.</p>

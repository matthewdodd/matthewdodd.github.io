I did not miss this cheese till the officer brought it in on the 21st of February - I knew it to be Mr. Shaw's, by a cross on it, and a piece of tin was nailed on it; I doubt whether it had been sold; a lady was looking at it on the Saturday - she objected to it on account of its being bored so many times.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 18th I saw Nathan turn the corner of Lime-street, with something under his arm, which he gave to Fell, and walked back himself; I followed Fell, and saw him putting this cheese into a bag - I went up, and asked what he had there; he said a cheese, which he brought from Rose-lane, and then he said he was going to take it there; Nathan came up just afterwards, and I took them both into custody; I went to several shops, and at last to Mr. Shaw's, where they claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. About a quarter-past six o'clock.</p>
               <p>ROBERT WILLAVIZE. I am sure the cheese was safe on Saturday, and am certain it is Mr. Shaw's.</p>

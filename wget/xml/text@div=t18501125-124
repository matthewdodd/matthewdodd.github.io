                  </hi>. I am secretary to the Directors and Guardians of the poor of St. Marylebone. I live in Marylebone workhouse—the prisoner was my assistant clerk—he first became so in 1848—amongst other things, it was his duty to receive moneys in my absence which were due to the parish—it was his duty to hand them over to me immediately he received them—there was a cash-book kept in the office, which was accessible to him at all times—it was his duty to make entries in it of all moneys he received—15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was due to our parish from Bishopsgate on the 29th July—I have never been paid that sum—on 13th Nov., I told the prisoner he had received 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the parish of St. Botolph, Bishopsgate, which he had not accounted for, and for which there was no entry in the cash-book—he said, "O, I paid it"—I replied, "You certainly did not, and there is no entry of it in the cash-book, where there ought to have been, in your handwriting"—he made no reply—I said, "Besides, I can produce the party to whom you made the admission that you intended to apply this money to your own use"—he said nothing to that—I produced the person—it was a person named Crook, a lithographic printer—here is the cash-book—there is another book, the maintenance-book, in which another officer enters the sums due to the parish—when the prisoner receives these sums, it is his duty to make an entry of them in that book, and of the day on which he receives them—here is an entry in the prisoner's writing of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 26th July, 1850—it is my habit to enter my name against these entries—the effect of this entry might be to induce me to sign my name there—I have not signed my name to this.</p>

               <p>in the cash-book—the cash-book was accessible to him and to me—I kept it in my office—the prisoner was a pauper in the workhouse some six or eight years ago, and after he got some employment which he left, he was taken into my office for the purpose of improvement—I paid him no wages—he went off to better himself, and came back after a long time, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for casual employ—at the time of this occurrence he had 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, he had not to pay anybody out of that—when I gave him the employ, he paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to a person to assist him—he paid that to Jan., 1849, when he was first fully engaged—after that he did not pay anybody'; he had no assistance at all—I knew he had been a pauper, and I had reason to believe he had no property—I do not know that he had a mother and sister to maintain—his sister had been in the workhouse, and had obtained a situation out of the house—he paid this 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to my step-son—I did not make it a condition that he should pay it—he paid it of his own accord—he did all the work himself subsequently, and not very hard work; he had sufficient to do—my son is filling the same situation that the prisoner did before I charged him with this embez<lb></lb>zlement, but without having any salary—he is doing it for my interest—I have never omitted to make entries in the book—I know the prisoner had no property—I had fifty shares in the Taw Vale Railway Company, for which 1 paid 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had no immediate prospect of getting into difficulties with them—I did not expect to get into difficulties about them—I expected to be called on for further calls—I was not aware how much I should be called on for—the usual call was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a share—I did not consider the property utterly worthless—I sold the prisoner the shares—he paid for them with the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which was given him—it did not come directly from me; through a person that I instructed—his name was to be transferred to the Company's books; that was to avoid my own liabilities; I did not approve of the proceedings of the Company—I parted with those shares, because I did not approve of the Company—I decline to answer whether I did it for the purpose of committing a fraud upon the Company—these shares were shown to the prisoner at the time, by me, in my house—the nature of the transaction was explained to him—I took him in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the office, and saw him sign the transfer—he asked me to keep the shares for him—I have not got them now—I delivered them up to him before he went through the Insolvent Debtors' Court—I have given him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay his expenses of going through the Court; being connected with him in the way I was, I wished that he should not suffer any pecuniary loss—he went through the Court —I did not afterwards stop any of his wages—I paid him 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I have his receipts—I gave him notice to quit about two months ago, about the 11th or 12th Oct.—at that time not a word had been said about this embezzlement—he accused me of this, before the Board, subsequently to his being given in charge—he did not to my knowledge send in a statement to the Board the day after he was dismissed—he was given into custody on 13th Nov.—the Board day was on the Friday, after he was charged—there is no Board on Thursday—the first day of any application being made was on the Friday—I stated I could produce the party to whom he stated it was his intention to appropriate the money—I had heard that, on the day the prisoner was charged—Crook told me this for the first time on 13th Nov.—on looking over the books I discovered that something was</p>

               <p>wrong, and I inquired of Crook, because I was informed there were other things which took place in my absence; he was in my office, and I asked him whether he knew anything about this 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he knew that the prisoner had received it, and intended to apply it to his own use—Crook is a lithographic printer, he was formerly a pauper—he is now under my entire control—he is paid by me, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, or rather he is paid by the Board—he never told me anything about it previously—I spoke about that, and other matters that had taken place in my absence—I have been censured by the Board for having any transactions with Cheeseman.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLIER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know that the consequence of transferring the shares to the prisoner would be anything more than that they would be forfeited? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; when I found he got into difficulties, I did what I could to assist him—I inquired of Crook, because I knew there was great neglect in my office while I was withdrawn from it for other duties—I spoke on other matters which had reference to him—Crook had informed me that the prisoner opened a sealed letter addressed to me, and abstracted half a sovereign, and appropriated it to himself—the prisoner complained to the Board, on 15th Nov., two or three days after I made the charge against him—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) from the prisoner on 15th Oct.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been employed as a printer in Mr. Thorne's office; I was so at the latter end of July and the beginning of Aug. I saw Courtnell come and pay the prisoner 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—the prisoner gave him a piece of paper; and after he was gone, he said to me that he should either stick to the money, or borrow it, I am not exactly certain which he said; I think he said he would borrow it—I said, "How can you think of doing such a thing as that, because you will be found out?"—he said, "I can save a trifle a week, and put that back again, and he will know nothing about it," meaning Mr. Thorne, of course.</p>

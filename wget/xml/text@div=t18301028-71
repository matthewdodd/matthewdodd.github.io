            . I am a Police-officer. On the 19th of September there was a fire in <placeName id="t18301028-71-crimeloc393">Chiswell-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. It was a very bad fire? A. Yes; there was a great crowd - many were carrying things to this yard; the prisoner came from towards the fire to where the goods were deposited, and as he returned I took him; I had seen him carrying goods into the yard - I do not know that he was directed to carry them to a neighbour's house.</p>

            . I saw this man removing goods from the fire to the yard - when he came back he turned to the right; I suspected, and took him - the witness caught hold of him, when I saw him take a parcel and throw it from him - I could not get that, the crowd was so great; these key-hole saws were found on him at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether he has a brother who was an officer at the fire? A. No; I thought the prisoner was going a wrong way - I was going towards him when he turned round and went towards the house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe there were a great many things thrown into the street? A. Yes; a great deal was taken and carried away; here is the maker's name on these- I bought them in Sheffield myself, about three years ago; I have sold many of them.</p>
               <p>ANN GARDINER. I occupied the parlour of the house; this bag is mine.</p>

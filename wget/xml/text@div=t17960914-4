               <p>Q. What time of day was this? - A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock, on Wednesday, the 20th of July; I took the pint-pot from that place, and gave it to a man that was pursuing him.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of Cheap-Ward; there was a person pursuing the prisoner; I was not ten yards behind, when I saw them turn towards the Hospital-gateway; the man that was pursuing him gave me the pot, the Bluecoat-boy gave it him; I saw the boy give it him, for I was close to his heels; I have kept it ever since. (It was produced in Court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Powell. It is my pot, my name is on it; I saw it in the house the day before; I know it by the number, there is No. 36 upon it; when I came home, I missed the pot with that number on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Neither the woman or the boy saw me lay hold of the pot, nor had I it in my possession; I went into this yard on a private occasion; when I came out this man laid hold of me, and said I had a pot; I said I had not; afterwards the boy produced a pot from behind the door; I don't know any thing of it, whether it was Mr. Powell's or not.</p>

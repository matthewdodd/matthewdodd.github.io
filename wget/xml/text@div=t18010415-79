               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long has the prisoner lived with you? - A. The beginning, of January last.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not foolish enough to take a person into a confidential situation, without a character? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your partner's name? - A. Steele.</p>
               <p>Q. The house was preparing for you and your partner to go into business? - A. Yes, but the premises are my property; I did not take any partner till the 3d of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the property of that house belonging to the partnership account? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that the weights were concealed? - A. I believe they were concealed from me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not live in the house, did you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had the care of the property in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. These weights were concealed between the bed and the sacking, were they not? - A. No, they were upon a shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. These sash-weights were fixed to the freehold? - A. They were taken down by the carpenters.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever asked him for these weights? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in custody before you thought fit to charge him with this? - A. He was taken up on the Friday, I cannot say exactly, but I think it was about a week.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not send for you to give him a character before the Lord-Mayor? - A. He told the Lord-Mayor that his master would give him a character, and at that time I had discovered the weights in his closet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not solicit him to go for an East-India soldier? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And was it not upon his refusal to go for an East-India soldier, that you thought proper to charge him with felony? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he prevented the carpenters from taking away what they called chips, but which he called pieces of wood, of your property? - A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, that in consequence of that, they charged him with stealing this apron? - A. He said so.</p>

             sworn. - I have been in and out at work these three months where the prisoner was porter; I was there on the 21st of February, and this man interrupted me, and I told his master of it, and he told him of it; in the afternoon he interrupted me again; he came in where I was at work, and he offered to fight me, and then I pulled off my things; I pulled off my apron, and put it upon the packing-case; I asked him whether he would shake hands with me first; he took hold of my hand, and went out of the room; he said he would not fight me there; and when I was putting on my things, I missed my apron; I asked him if he had seen it, and he said he had not; this is the apron; I tore one of the strings out.</p>

               <p>Q. And it was cunningly contrived to be found under his bed? - A. I was not there.</p>

               <p>Q.Were any geldings missing at any time? - Not before them two; that was the 8th of January, I don't know the day of the week, this here man came into our yard, and he wanted an employment; it was about eleven o'clock, between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean in Lad-lane? - Yes, he said he lived with Mr. Bolton as horse keeper, at Charing Cross; I desired him to ride the horses round Moorfields, Finsbury-square; they were some that had bad colds on them; and I asked him if he knew where our farrier lived? he said he did, some wanted something done to their shoulders, I told him to ride them to him; instead of riding into Moorfields, he rode up Silver-street, across Smithfield into Holborn, and here he sold them. I told him I would satisfy him for riding them out a bit, as he had nothing else to do. He was not in any employ otherwise, when the time was up, I found he did not come back, I began to be rather uneasy about four or five o'clock; he went out with them between eleven and twelve; then I went out to Charing-cross to Mr. Bolton's head hostler, to know if ever he knew such a man, and whether he lived there? he said he did not, but I might hear of him at the Ship, at Charing-cross. I went down there and the master gave me a very bad character. I did not find him, I heard of him; he was taken in the Broad way, Westminster. I never saw him till he was taken, it was in the same month, about eight or nine days afterward, I saw him then at the office, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your horses again? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not ask you to ride them out? - No, I asked him to ride them out for an hour or two, and would satisfy him.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they? - Geldings.</p>
               <p>Q. How many had he? - Two.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the value of them be? - I don't know, the horses were in bad condition, worth about four pounds in that condition, but we do not sell them, we keep them when they are worked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190110"></xptr>down to get them about again if possible. I am sure that is the man.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a horse dealer, the prisoner at the bar brought me two horses on the 8th of January last, nearly about twelve o'clock, Tuesday, I think the day was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he bring them to? - Oxford-street, where I live; he asked me if I would buy them? I asked him what was the matter with them? he told me they were glandered. I asked him where he brought them from? he told me from Lad-lane; I asked him why he brought them so far? he gave me for answer, that he was going into Piccadilly to fetch a letter bag back, that was left by one of the mail coaches, and that he might as well bring them to me as any body else; he said he was going to the White Horse Cellar. I asked him what he wanted for the horses? he asked me two guineas and a half for them; I told him it was more than I gave any body at that time of the yeat, I would give him but two guineas; he said when he lived with Mr. Parminster I always used to give him a shilling when he brought a horse for himself; I told him I would not go from that rule, I would give him a shilling for each horse, besides the two guineas, which I did; he had lived with Mr. Parminster, Duke-street, Manchester-square.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That there gentleman told me that the horses were glandered, and told me to try to sell them some where.</p>
               <p>White. It was some days after this that Mr. Smith and another gentleman that is here, asked me if I did buy two horses? I told them I did; they were both glandered, to the best of my knowledge, it is impossible for any hostler, or any doctor, to swear positively to that kind. I took them to be slaughtered the same day myself, and Mr. Smith called on me after he had apprehended the prisoner. Mr. Smith called at my house, and I told him they were down in the inspector's book; one was a chesnut, very much rubbed, and the other, I think, was a dark bay, or a brown, I am not clear to that.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. What was the description of these horses that you lost? - One was a chesnut horse, cut a little with the barness; the other was a brown bay.</p>
               <p>Q. You never see them after they went out of your yard? - Never.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in the public house, the corner of the gateway, and the hostler asked me if I would have a ride? why, yes, says I, I don't care if I do; he went up and asked me if I would ride them geldings? when he got them out into the street, he said they were glandered, and says he, go try and sell them, and I knew this gentleman in Oxford-street, that he bought horses, and I went to him and sold them; and I had to go to Piccadilly and I never returned again.</p>

               <p>Court to Smith. Are you positive that you never held any language to this man that he could understand that you wished him to sell them? - Nothing at all, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the horses glandered? - I cannot say they were, or were not; the chesnut horse had some little appearance of it, but the brown horse had no appearance at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him directions to go to the White Horse Cellar? - No, none at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you enquire for? - A. Mr. Hilditch.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. He is only deputy.</p>
               <p>Court. It is signed by Mr. Hilditch, as deputy clerk of the assize, and therefore as such I shall certainly receive it.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Alley contended, that it ought to be signed by the clerk of the assize himself, and not by his deputy, and that therefore it ought not to be received in evidence.)(The Court over-ruled the objection.)(The copy of the conviction read.)</p>

               <p>(Here Mr. Knowlys and Mr. Alley contended at considerable length, that there was no proof of identity of the prisoner's person.)</p>
               <p>Court. What is the evidence here? I have under the King's signed manual an assertion of this fact, that the prisoner, George Williams, otherwise Christopher Holyland, the very man at the bar, was convicted of stealing goods, the property of

            , and received sentence of transportation for seven years; that the King says, and then he says, he shall be pardoned, on condition of serving in the navy, and the prisoner admits that he is the man, for he accepts the terms of the King's gracious pardon, by going on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I take it that is by no means proved. The man having him in custody delivers him over to a person who gives a receipt for him, but it is by no means proved that he is called up and asked whether he will accept it.</p>
               <p>Court. I hold that not to be necessary; the favour of the King's mercy it shall not be in his power to refuse.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Alley also contended, that there were but three Acts of Parliament which related to the offence of returning from transportation, and that the present case did not come within either of them.)</p>
               <p>Court. I am perfectly satisfied that there never was a clearer point before a Court. The learned gentleman says, there are but three Acts of Parliament which relate to this offence, one making it selony to be found at large after having received sentence of transportation; another, where a man having first received sentence of death, and after wards the King's pardon, if he is found at large that shall be felony; and the third is, where he undertakes to transport himself, and is found at large. Now, what is the case here? This man is under sentence of transportation upon one of these very acts of Parliament, he is proved to be in custody under that sentence, he is discharged from thence on condition of entering and serving on board his Majesty's navy, and he is to remain there till he is duly discharged. If he deserts, he is directly within the Act of Parliament for returning from transportation. It seems to me, therefore, one of the clearest points that ever came before a Court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am no deserter; I was regularly discharged.</p>

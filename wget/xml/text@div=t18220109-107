               <p>JOHN M'LAREN. I suspected the prisoners of the robbery on the 3d of January. On the 4th I met Hayman, and accused him of being one of the party who broke my room open; he denied it; I told him I would take him up if he did not tell me where he lived; he took me to Church-lane where he lodged; I met Kelly in the passage, and said I suspected him also; he denied it; I found nothing in the room; I took them both to the watch-house; Hayman said if I would step on one side he would tell me all about it; I made him no promise; he told me Burgess brought a bed to his lodgings that morning, and that it was placed under his bed, and if I would go with him to the room I should find it; I went back with him, and there it was; he took me to Parker-street, Drury-lane, and there I found a pair of sheets, blanket, a quilt, chairs, and bellows; he said Burgess took them there, I brought them away; the witness was in the room, and said a young man who lived in the room with him, and a person he did not know brought them there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Richard and Williams Brook. They have a dwelling-house and manufactory in Southwark-bridge road, in the parish of St. Saviour's, Southwark—they are tallow-chandlers and melters—I have been in their employ about two months—the premises are entered by a gateway—there is a counting-house on the left-hand side of the gateway when you go in, and a door on the left, which leads into the packing-room—the counting-house door opens into the packing-room—there are three desks in that counting-house—there is a double desk near the window—the other desk is on the right hand—there is a flight of stairs leading out of the packing-room into the kitchen—the counting-house and dwelling-house are all one building—you can go from the counting-how into the packing-room, and then into the kitchen, without going into the street—there is another door out of the packing-room, leading into the yard—there are two doors, one at each end—the further door leads to the melting-house, through the yard—there it a flat trap in the roof of the melting-house—it lifts up and down by a weight—there is a yard at the back of the melting-house. On the night of the 14th of March, I was in the kitchen, which is over the counting-house—while I was there I heard a noise about half-post eleven o'clock—the noise proceeded from the counting-house—on hearing it I went down stairs, and discovered the counting-house door open—the one leading into the counting-house from the packing-room—I had been in the counting-house about three-quarters of an hour before—when I left it it was locked, and the key in the door, on the side towards the packing-room—I had left a candle burning—when I found the door open, the candle had been put out—I had fastened the packing-room doors before I went into the kitchen—I locked the door on the counting-house side—I did not fasten the other door, but I saw it was fastened—both the doors of the packing-room were fastened on the inside—one was barred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having discovered this, what did you do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went out into the yard, by opening the packing-room door—I found the bar undone—on getting into the yard, I asked who was there—I saw a person upon the roof of the melting-house, and when I said, "Who if there?" the reply was, <hi rend="italic">"Harry</hi>, they are coming"—I then ran for a policeman—I saw them get<lb></lb>ting out of the trap-door, in the roof of the melting-house—I saw two or three persons—I cannot say how many—there were some persons—I got</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183504060011"></xptr>
               <p>a policeman, and took him to the back of the premises—the front gateway in the Southwark-bridge-road was safe, and the private entrance was also safe—the persons who had been in the house must have got out by one of the packing-room doors, both of which had been unfastened inside—there was a petty cash-box in one of the counting-house desks before I went up—that desk is never locked—the box was locked—it has a small hole cut in the top of it to drop money in—that box was kept in the double desk by the win<lb></lb>dow—there was money kept in the other desk, which was locked—I did not go into the counting-house when I came down stairs after healing the noise—I did not miss the petty cash-box till I came back—I was with the policeman when he found that box on the roof—there were no men melting on the premises at the time—it is usual to melt every night except Saturday night.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any way from the pack<lb></lb>ing-room into the melting-house and manufactory, without going into the yard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; there is no communication from the dwelling-house to the melting-house or manufactory, except through the yard—one factory is by the side of Southwark-bridge-road—there are sheds which run from one manufactory to the other—the flaps in the roof are in the manufactory—the melting-house and manufactory are together, but are separated by a wall—the flaps lift up towards the roof of the factory—there is a yard behind the melting-house and manufactory—I saw the per<lb></lb>sons get out of the trap-door, and go along the roof to the right—I could see any person as I was standing in the yard, at the top of the manufactory—the flaps are very near the furthermost will of the manufactory—I had left a candle burning in the counting-house all the evening—I am quite sure I locked the door of the counting-house leading to the packing-roonm—the servant was up stairs with me in the kitchen—Mr. Richard Brook lives in the house—the other partner lives in the Borough.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You locked the counting-house door—did you leave the key on the packing-room side? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the trap-door draws down by a weight—a person not acquainted with the premises, I should say, would not know how to open it—it is not like a trap-door usually is—the yard is a quadrangle, the Southwark-bridge-road being on one side—the stable and out-buildings on the right hand, that joins the factory and melting-house, they form the third side of the quadrangle—end the pack<lb></lb>ing-room and dwelling-house form the fourth side—there is no entrance to the building from the outside, beside the one is Southwark-bridge-road—the gateway and the private door of the dwelling-house are the only en<lb></lb>trances, unless you clamber over the wall—the windows of the factory outside were all secure when I heard the alarm—there was no means by which a person could have got into the factory.</p>

               <p>the packing-room and counting-house—he has been in the habit of fetching the petty cash-box from one premises to the other—I think I have seen him carrying it from one premises to the other, at any rate he must have known that it was fetched from there—it is kept for the purpose of placing small sums in, for goods sold at the warehouse—the box is sent by some of the servants from the premises, to Blackman-street, but not by any one in particular—this petty cash is kept separate for a particular use—on the night in question, before I left the pre<lb></lb>mises, I removed the petty cash-box and the till—there was a con<lb></lb>siderable quantity of petty cash in it, but what, I do not know—I left the premises about twenty minutes after nine o'clock, and went to my uncle's—I saw all the premises made fast and safe—I had put money into the box several times that week—it had been there about a fortnight—our men are up every night in the week, generally, except on Saturday—Parker would know that, and he knew I am always away on Saturday night, as I always go to Blackman-street—I got home this night just as Taylor was giving an alarm—I went down the yard, and heard a rattle spring—next morning I saw a chisel, found on the premises behind ours, in the yard adjoining the side of the premises where the flat is in the roof of the manufactory—it is Stevenson's yard—I observed marks of vio<lb></lb>lence on the desk, which was kept locked, and this chisel exactly cor<lb></lb>responds with the marks where the desk had been attempted to be wrenched—that is the single desk—it is usual to keep the desk in which the petty cash-box is, unlocked, and the other desks locked—this desk had marks of violence, and they exactly corresponded with the chisel—in wrenching, they had turned the desk off the stand—it is not usual to keep money in that desk for more than two hours together—it is usual to de<lb></lb>posit money there, under lock and key, till I take it to Blackman-street—Parker most likely would be aware of that—I saw the prisoners when they were brought out of Stevenson's yard, at the back of our premises, in Guildford-street—that was Parker, Parkenton, and Wayling—I saw New<lb></lb>man brought out of a ditch, over some pales, at some distance from Steven<lb></lb>son's yard.</p>

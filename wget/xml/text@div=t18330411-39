On the 7th of March I came to town by one of the coaches, and when I returned home I missed a shirt and these things from my bed-room at Brentford - the prisoner was "boots" at that inn; I found my jacket at a pawnbroker's - I then went to Hempstead, and found the prisoner; I said, "You did not expect to see me here to-night" - he said No; I then gave him in charge to the Policeman - he said, at the station, that there was a bundle in the cart, which the Policeman went and found in Taylor's errand-cart; my waistcoat and shirt were in the bundle - my shoes were on the prisoner's feet.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HUNT (Police-constable S 68). I was on duty at Hempstead on the 7th of March; the prosecutor gave the prisoner into my charge for stealing his clothes - I knew the prisoner, and asked what he had been doing; he said, Nothing of any consequence.</p>

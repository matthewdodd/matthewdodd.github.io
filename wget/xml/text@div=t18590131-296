                  </hi>. I am an India rubber manufacturer, and live at No. 3, Fort-street, Spitalfields—I know the defendant acting as foreman to Mr. Roberts, living at No. 27, Prior-place, East-street, Walworth—I did not know his name—I first knew him on the 17th of March last year—I was passing Roberts' shop, and I called there with a view of leaving my card—Roberts was at the door speaking to some gentleman, and on my presenting my card, Roberts said, "Walk into the counting-house"—I did so, and Mr. Roberts said, "Have you some samples?"—I presented to him some twenty samples, and while Mr. Roberts was looking at the samples, the defendant came into the counting-house, and said to me, "Are you in a position to take a large order?"—my answer was, "Yes, to any amount; I can execute any order to any amount"—upon my saying so, Mr. Roberts presented me with an order on the back of his card—I saw him write it, "2 pieces of 4 1/2 inch at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 2 pieces at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2 pieces at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." 6 pieces altogether—the cost of the whole would be about 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I took his card and this order on it—I said, "Thank you"—the defendant opened the door for me, and he said to me, "Be quick and deliver those goods, because we</p>

               <p>want to send them to our manufactory in the country"—on the following Saturday, 20th March, I took 63 yards at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was about one third of the order Roberts had given me—it came to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the defendant, he was there, Mr. Roberts was not—I left them with the defendant—he said Mr. Roberts was not in the way, I had better call in any time that I might be passing, and he would get him to give me an order every time I looked in, because Mr. Roberts was in a position to want a great quantity of goods, and he said, could I supply them with cashmere and linings, and other things, I said, no, the elastic trade was the only thing that I had anything to do with—I then left—I did not execute any further portion of the order—I went on the Wednesday following, which must have been the 24th, and I saw something that excited some suspicion—I saw my six pieces of elastic placed on a high stool, and I saw no other goods there—the defendant had told me that the elastic was to be sent to the manufactory in the country—I then began to make inquiry—I never called at the place again till I had sent, a letter which I addressed to Mr. Roberts—this is a copy of it; "Mr. Roberts, I beg to inform you that the order you were pleased to give me will be completed in a few hours I shall be obliged if you will favour me with one or two London references." To this I received an answer, dated Prior Place, April the 3rd, and signed "C. Roberts:" "MR. Ferdinando,—Sir, I beg to refer you to Mr. Talk, No. 5, St. Dunstan's-hill, Lower Thames-street, and Mr. Stanton, No. 10, Hampton-street, Walworth"—in consequence of this I went six or seven times to No. 5, St. Dunstan's-hill, Lower Thames-street, but I was not able to see Mr. Tulk—I went to Hampton-street—I there saw a woman who called herself Mrs. Stanton—I have found since it was Mrs. Stanton—I had some communication with her—I went to Hampton-street, and not being satisfied, I wrote a letter to Mr. Stanton, to which I received this answer—I have seen the defendant write since, and he made an admission that he wrote this letter—the defendant came to me on the day after I received this letter, and I said to him. "I received a letter from Mr. Stanton, which is not to my mind satisfactory" (I did not know the defendant then by any name, I only knew him as foreman to Mr. Roberts)—I said, "Will you be good enough to tell me what his position is in trade"—he said he was a man of the highest position, he frequently would have goods in to the amounts of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and always paid ready money, he was quite an independent sort of man in trade—he said he had served Mr. Roberts for a period of four years with various kinds of leather—I made a remark that it was strange I had never seen him, and I asked what sort of a man he was in appearance—he said, "A man somewhat like yourself, small in stature, dark complexion"—I then said, "What is the position of Roberts in trade?"—he said Mr. Roberts was a man of considerable property, and he had a large factory at Wellingborough in Northamptonshire—in the course of that conversation I addressed the defendant by the name of Mr. Roberts—he said, "My name is not Roberts"—I said, "I know that very well, but as I don't know your name, I address you by the name of the firm; it is usual to do so; we always do so in the City"—he seemed a little annoyed by my calling him Roberts, and I said, "Pray, what is your name"—he said, "My name is Smith"—we had some further conversation, and he left my house at No. 3, Fort-street.</p>

Sir, We received yours this morning; I beg to state I have always found Mr. Roberts a very respectable tradesman, and I should have no objection to credit him to any amount that my means would allow"—on the day after I received this letter, the defendant came to me, and we-remained together good friends two or three hours—I addres<lb></lb>sed him by the name of Smith—he told me he lived in the New-cut, Lam<lb></lb>beth, but he said I might address a letter to him at 27, Prior-place, in the name of Smith—he wanted me to let him have the goods—he said he was prepared to take the goods: would I consent?—I said, no; I could not see my way clearly—he told me that Stanton had supplied Roberts for three or four years with top leathers—I said I did not see my way clearly—he said, "you are a man of the world, you could not do wrong in trusting him a month"—I still objected—I he said, Mr. Roberts was a very generous man, and if I could make friends with him, he would assist me in getting machinery, and in other ways—I still made the same objection, that there was something I could not understand, and I said I would call and see Mr. Roberts on the following day—on the following day, I went to Prior-place—I saw Mr. Roberts and the defendant—Mr. Roberts seemed very much incensed—he seemed in a passion—he said that he was a respectable trades-man, and I had humbugged him, that he had given me an order, and good references—he said Mr. Tulk was a merchant of long standing in the City of London, and that Mr. Stanton was a highly respectable man, and he had always paid Mr. Stanton for whatever goods he had had of him—I said it was painful to my mind, that I could not understand the references, and that I must decline bringing the other portion of the goods—he then accused me of detaining his foreman—I said, "Your foreman appears to be a man of intelligence; I could not detain him"—he still persisted that I had done so—I said, "Well, Mr. Smith, I am sure, could not tell you so"—he then went into a violent passion, and said, You did, Sir; Mr. Smith told me that you detained him, and made him drunk"—I said I should feel obliged if he would pay me for the goods he had had, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or return them—he said he should not do that; when he had references respecting me, he would then pay me, and not till then—he said, "You have demanded references of me, and now I demand references of you; when I have those references, I will pay you"—I could get neither money nor goods, and I then left—this was on the 8th April—I did not send any more of the order—I went again on the 20th April, but in the interval, I had sent a letter to Roberts, to which I got no answer—I went on the 20th, but I did not see Roberts—I went again on Saturday, the 24th, expecting to receive my money—I found the place shut up and all gone—I went from Prior-place to Hampton-street—I did not see the defendant there—I saw the woman I had seen before who called herself Mrs. Stanton—I saw Roberts about two months afterwards on the pier at Hungerford—I did not speak to him—he jumped on the steam-boat, and I went on the same boat but I could not get at him—I saw the defendant again on the 24th June, in the Borough—I had a considerable conversation with him—I made a remark that it was very unmanly to come down to me in a fictitious name, and give me a glowing description of Stanton, when he was the real man all the while, and that he had said that Roberts was a man of large property;</p>

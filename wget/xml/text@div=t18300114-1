On the 4th of January, about nine o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in the shop; two persons were with him - one about two years older than himself; they came in together- the prisoner asked for a pair of stockings: I took down some to show him; I was the only person serving in the shop - there is a staircase leading from the shop to the upper part of the house; I cannot exactly recollect which of them asked for the stockings - they said they only had 6d., and we had none so low; they left the shop - a little boy who was in the shop at the time gave information; I immediately went out, and laid hold of the prisoner and another man - I charged the prisoner with stealing some silk, and found it under his apron - there were sixty yards of it; he had not asked to look at it - it was on the counter, within his reach, when he came into the shop; I was obliged to turn my back to them to get the stockings - they could take it in that time without my seeing them; it is worth upwards of 6l. at the manufacturer's price - I have a good knowledge of the value of silk; I sent for an officer, and had him secured - I took him sixty or seventy yards from the shop door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said at the Mansion-house the silk was sixty-five yards. Witness. I said it measured sixty-six yards, but I would call it sixty.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL DODSWORTH NICHOLSON. I am the prosecutor's son. On the 4th of January, I was on the staircase, looking through a window at the top of the door leading into the shop; I could see into the shop, and saw the prisoner there, and three others, I think - I saw the prisoner go to the opposite counter, take this roll of silk, and put it under his apron; I told Paul, who went after him, and brought him back - be let it fall when he was caught; I saw it fall from him when he was caught, and picked it up; my father has no partner - he lives at this house.</p>

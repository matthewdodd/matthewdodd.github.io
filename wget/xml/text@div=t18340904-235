               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did you say your daughter put any thing near the drawer on the till? A. No. There was a little chest of drawers, which we use as a till - my daughter had put out 6d. towards the change - the prisoner could not be putting his hand over to take the 6d. - I swear I saw his hand in the till - I did not like to give him in charge, as it was a disagreeable thing - I did not say I would have 2s. out of him - he snatched the bad shilling out of my daughter's hand, and gave the two shillings back - he had not left the shop before I sent for a policeman - he was gone out when the policeman came.</p>

            , Jun. The prisoner came for the oysters, and paid me 1s. - I put 6d. on the top of the till for him, and then went to get change - I had looked into the till to see if there was change, and there was not - there was 2s., and the 6d. laid on the top - they were both good shillings, I believe - when I returned, my mother told me what had occurred - I said, "You good-for-nothing man, you have taken two shillings out of the till, and put this bad one in" - he snatched the bad shilling out of my hand, and put 2s. into my hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you not insisted on his giving two shillings before he left the shop? A. I said, "Give me the 2s. you have take out of the till," and he gave it me directly - I might have taken a bad shilling without knowing it.</p>

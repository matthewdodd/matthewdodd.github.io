                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Sutton—the prisoner was also in his employ until 13th September, on which day he disappeared—his duty was to attend to the foreign department, in sending parcels away—it was not his duty to receive money for Mr. Sutton; but if he received money on behalf of his employer, it was his duty to hand it over to me the same day—he has been there a year or two—Mr. Sutton succeeded to the business carried on by his predecessor, in whose employment the prisoner was—the prisoner has received amounts and paid them over to me—it was his duty to receive certain money, but it was not part of his employment to receive money—he never, on 13th September or at any other time, handed me 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as having received it from Mr. Dumont—he had only one book to keep, in which he made his foreign entry—I should make an entry in my petty cash-book of what I received from him—I have no such entry; here is my book.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this a very large business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there are two departments, home and foreign—the prisoner had nothing to do with the home department; he was over one department and I over the other—I am cashier; I account for cash every morning to the principal—the prisoner has handed me oath two or three times—if he re<lb></lb>ceived cash it was his duty to account for it to me—his duty was to dispatch the foreign parcels abroad—he used to measure the parcels and charge them to the agents—if they were town parcels, I should receive them—he would send over to me, and tell me the proper price to charge, and I should enter it—it was not his duty to receive the money for the foreign department—he could make a bill out, but it should be paid to me—I should receive it either from the messenger or from himself—it was not his duty to receive it, but he has done so—he generally received the money for the foreign parcels, and handed it over to me—I cannot say whether he ever handed money over to Mr. Sutton—Mr. Sutton is the general cashier of the establishment—I belong to the petty cash—it is my duty to receive the whole of the money for the foreign parcels, and enter them in my book—I have no knowledge of ever receiving money from any one for foreign parcels, besides the prisoner—our foreign business is small; we send off, I daresay, fifty foreign parcels a day—some foreign parcels come from the agents, but the prisoner would see me make an entry in my cash-book, discharging him and charging myself; that was done in every case—I have been in Mr. Sutton's employment twelve months—nobody else enters in my book, except when I am away or unwell—the prisoner would not pay the money to any<lb></lb>body but me, and if I was not there he would keep it till I was there, I should think—either the prisoner or the clerk would attend to the books when I was away—the clerk is not here; he attended to the books when I was away at Bradford—the moment I receive the money I put it down in the cash-book—the prisoner's duties were not heavy, but he was canvassing lately for receiving-houses; he was also canvassing about the beginning of September—there are some expenses incurred in canvassing—I have can<lb></lb>vassed latterly, and have spent money—the prisoner came at 10 or half-past 10 in the morning, and left at 6, 7, or 8 at night—he had not regular hours to my knowledge—his wages were 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was no salary due at this time—he had told me some weeks before this that he should not stop.</p>

               <p>—the prisoner was in my service at a salary of 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—it was part of his duty to receive money and account to Granger or me for it on the same day—he did not account for 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., as received from Mr. Dumow on 13th September—I did not know that he was going to leave on Saturday; I was laid up with rheumatic fever at the time—I did not see him again till he was apprehended three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long were you laid up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ten or twelve days—I live at Morton now—the ordinary way was for the prisoner to pay the money to Granger, who entered it in the cash-book—the prisoner's duties were to take the foreign department and receive foreign parcels; that and canvassing were his only duties—I have sixty or seventy receiving homes—I have been in the business since last April, when I bought it of a Mr. Scott, who has nothing to do with it now, but in whose employ the prisoner was—I gave the prisoner express instructions always to pay Granger or me—Granger is the chief of the home department, and I of both—I check the receipts by this cash-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which is kept for the trans<lb></lb>actions of the day—if I sent a foreign parcel, and it was unpaid, it would be entered in the prisoner's own book—this is the foreign book—I do not keep a ledger with the weights and amounts of parcels.</p>

               <p>Mary Stiles. My husband's name is Paul; I keep a cloaths shop. On the Monday before Christmas, about eight o'clock, the prisoner came in with a pretence to light her candle, and, in a stumbling manner, lighted it ; I was backwards ; she and her mother lodged in my garret; she came to light it a second time; after that I went towards my counter, and saw it stripped of the goods mentioned, which were lying there before; I went up to her apartment ; I found her all alone there; she endeavoured to get as way, when she heard there was an officer sent for, in searching her, a person saw something on the tyles, near her window; I went, and out of her window I poked somewhat down; it was taken up below, and proved to be one of the linnen gowns. ( Produced in court and deposed to) I have found nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other person in the shop<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175201160029"></xptr> between the time you saw the things lost, and the missing them?</p>
               <p>M. Stiles. There were none but one girl who came in with the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Did that other girl go up stairs?</p>
               <p>M. Stiles. I don't know that she did?</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stiles came and challenged me with these things, after I had been an hour and half in the washhouse; I knew nothing of that gown: she said before the Justice, she had lost many things before, and that, as she had lit of me she would hang me, and make me pay for all.</p>
               <p>To her character.</p>

I am a cab proprietor, of 37, Canonbury Road, Isling<lb></lb>ton, and have stables in Little Queen Street, Kennington, at the back of the Horns Tavern—on 31st March I received a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in the Horns at about 4 p.m., from a customer from Mitcham—I knew nothing of Risden then, and had never spoken to Green, but had seen him in the neighbourhood—I did not notice if other persons were in the bar when I received the money—soon afterwards, while I was drinking with four customers, I noticed the prisoners come in with others—we had four small 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. bottles of cha<lb></lb>pagne, and I stayed after my friends had left, but had not spoken to the prisoners; Risden said to me, "Is not your name Mr. Sheen?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Used not you to have a lot of numbers at the London and Brighton Railway?"—I said, "A few"—he said he had a quantity there—I said, "I had eighteen there this time three years"—he said, "Oh! I used to be in that business myself, but I am out of it now, I am a barman"—he had a double-breasted black frock coat on, and was dressed very respect<lb></lb>ably, not as he is now—he said, "I am cut of a situation, I have a friend or two here and we are not very <hi rend="italic">cashy</hi>, would you mind standing treat?"—I said, "Oh, with pleasure, anybody thirsty can have a drink," and they all drank and I paid for it—Green was standing by and had not spoken, he and Risden drank with the others—I should think there were seven or eight of them—I had had a little and might be a little fresh—I did notice what I paid—I pulled out a sovereign to pay for it—I had about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loose in my pocket—they had what they liked to call for, and when they had drank it Risden tapped me on the shoulder and said "Well, we could do another one"—I said "Not with me me you won't"—he said "A pretty b——sort of a cabmaster I expect you are"—I said "I never said I was a cabmaster"—he said "Oh! a nice fellow, no doubt; I don't know how many of you I could not do"—I replied, "No doubt-; I am not a fighting man, but I should take my own part with the likes of you"—he then shoved me and I hit him back—this was in the front of the bar, and about seven or eight people were there—he said "Come outside"—I said "Yes, if you like," and we began to fight, and the police came up and Risden went away, and I went straight to my stables—about 20 minutes afterwards (about 7 o'clock), as I was washing my hands, Risden came rushing into the stable with his coat on his arm and said "Oh! this is your b——stable, is it?" and struck me with his fist just in front of the ear—nobody was there but my stable boy, a one-armed lad—Green and two others followed Risden in within a minute—Green took me by my trowsers leg, tearing it up, and another man caught me by my collar behind, tearing it from my shirt—they were all round me, and got me down, and kicked me when I was down—while I was on my back Green was kicking me and Risden punched me about the head—I managed to turn over and get up, and then Risden pinned me from behind and Green put his hand in my right-hand trowsers pocket, pulling it inside out, and the silver flew about the coach-house—I saw him pass the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note over to Risden—I said "So that's your game, is it?" and seized Green and put him on his back—they cried "Loose him, you s——," and commenced kicking me—I said "I'll never loose him unless you cut my hands off"—I heard a cry of "Police!" and Risden and two others jumped into a cab which they had at the gates waiting for them, and away they wentc—I stuck</p>

My first order at the Horns was for dour bottles of champagne, and after my friends left I had several small glasses of ale by myself—I was not noisy or intoxicated, and was not turned out—I had been to the Rifleman, near my stables at the back, earlier in the afternoon, and to the Alderman in the morning—Eisden struck me first when we fought—I swear he is the man—I had not been fighting before with another man, nor had Eisden been taking my part—I never invited him to finish the fight at a future time, or said anything about taking down the Kensington boys—I did not hold up my hands in a threatening manner to Eisden after we had been separated, or beckon him to the stables—I had my coat off washing my hands in the stable—I did not strip to my waist and put my braces round my waist—I did not say to him "I will pay you now"—Eisden's pals kept the gates shut so that he should not be seen; I did not order anybody to shut them, and nobody pushed a cart back to make room for fighting—I told the policeman I had lost a 51. note; I did not say 50?.—Eisden did not show any inclination to go away until he heard the cry of "Police I"—I received the 51. note at the Horns from a man from Mitcham—he bought a brown cob, van, and harness the previous week for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave me ten 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., notes and I have him the change and a. receipt—he gave me two names, Thorn by and Gardner—I never knew him before and have not seen him since—I have not seen his name in connection with any legal document or proceedings—he came back the next week and said "I don't like this mare, I should rather have a smaller one, have you got one you can exchange with me?" and I exchanged a pony with him for the cob and 41. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the difference in price, and he took a set of harness for the 10«. and-gave me the 51 note at the Horns—it was not paid at the Alderman—I deal in horses and am a cab proprietor, and have been so for 18 years—I was tried for horse chanting once—it was a mare that was returned to me in exchange for a pony—the man did not say it was worthless, but that it was too big—I have never heard that the pony died four days afterwards of structural disease, and I do not know that it is dead, or that criminal proceedings have been instituted against me in respect of it—J have not heard of any dissatisfaction at all—I was tried at the Middlesex Sessions for selling a horse which died, but I was acquitted.</p>

I sent a sailor boy for a policeman—I got the broom-handle up, and they took it away and knocked me down—I have only one arm—the sailor boy is not here—he was called at the police-court—when I had sent for the police I came in again, and saw Green with his hand in my master's right-hand pocket; it was turned inside out—he had shown me a little hole in that pocket before, and he put the large money in it—the hole might have let half a sovereign through—I saw three half-crowns, several florins, and some coppers on the floor while ha was holding Green down, and we picked them up and gave them to my master—as soon as the policeman was coming Risden and somebody else jumped into a should cab and drove off—my master was not drunk, he was sensible—I did not hear him challenge Risden to fight, and heard nothing said about closing the gates so that they could have a fair fight—somebody pushed them to, but they were soon pushed open again—I did not push them to—there was a cart there, but I did not see it moved to make room.</p>

I am a cabdriver, of 133, Vauxhall Walk—on 31 at March, between 5 and 6, I saw Sheen and Risden struggling on the ground outside the Horns—Sheen was drunk—I saw a policeman trying to part them—I went back to my cab, and somebody fetched me to Queen Street about 20 minutes after, and I saw Risden standing on the edge el the pavement with his coat off and bleeding from the nose—there was a crowd and great confusion, and I could not see whether the gates were open or not—he walked across the road and got into my cab—he said, "Do you know where t) go?"—I thought he was going to the</p>

I am a cab driver, of 277, Beresford Street—I saw Sheen outside the Horns—he seemed the worse for drink—I said, "What's the matter?"—he said, "Go to b——y"—I asked him why he spoke to me like that, as he had known me many years, and we were great pals and drank together, and I was surprised—he replied "Hallo! Cruet, is it you? I've been having a scrap"—I said, "Who with?"—he said, "Oh, there he is; I'll go and finish it; I'll give it him," and went towards his stable—I did not see Risden, and did not know who he meant, as I had not seen the beginning of it—I saw him again afterwards lower down, and asked him who he had been fighting—he said, "One of the Kennington lads; I can do him myself"—some minutes afterwards I saw a constable, and asked him who he had been fighting with, and who started it"—he said, "That man (<hi rend="italic">Sheen</hi>) started it, and I ought to have locked him up"—I then saw Sheen coming down the street, and Green standing by the public house door, and I went up to him and said, "Who's he been fighting with?"—he said, "Shiner"—I said to Risden, "Come down and see it out"—he said, "Don't you interfere, Crust"—I said, "Come and finish it not; he means to finish it," and we went down the street all together—the gates were shut—Green rushed across and got into the stable, and I attempted to open the gate, but Sheen said, "Shut them b——gates; I can do him by myself; I don't want no help," and the gates were shut and pinched my fingers—Sheen had neither coat nor waistcoat on, and his trousers were buckled round his waist with his braces—Risden, I think, had a waistcoat on, but I am not sure—they appeared to be both stripped for a fight, and I saw them fighting for about two minutes, when Sheen pulled himself together to rush at Risden and got a blow—he then turned round and called "Police!"and a sailor boy fetched a policeman—I saw them on the ground—I was looking through the crack of the door, and tried to open the gates, but the horsekeeper kept it shut—when the policeman came Green was trying to part them—Sheen knocked him aside and called out, "Policeman, hold him; I felt his hand in my pocket"—he said he had lost 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or that he had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—</p>

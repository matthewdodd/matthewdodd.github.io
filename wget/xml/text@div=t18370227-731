                  </hi>. I am the wife of Anselmo Chiarizia, we sell sugar, coffee, tea, &amp;c, in Johnson-street, Somers-town. The prisoner came on the 26th of January to buy a candle, at about seven o'clock—I served her, and she offered me in payment a shilling—I gave her a sixpence, a four-penny-piece, and a penny—I put the shilling into the till, there was no other money in the till—no one else was in the shop—Mr. Boulanger came</p>

I was not at home when the prisoner first came to the shop—I went to the till a few minutes after the shilling was received—there was no other silver in the till—we had taken the money out, as we had been robbed by a servant—I examined the shilling, and Doubting whether it was good, I took it to a chemist's shop to inquire—it proved to be bad—I put a mark on it—Mr. Boulanger was with me at this time—I took the shilling in my pocket—there was no other in my pocket at the time—when I got home I put it on the mantelpiece—I was at home when the prisoner came the second time—I took the shilling that was on the mantelpiece, and gave it to the constable at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Charlton-street, Somers-town. I was in the prosecutor's shop on the 26th of January and saw the prisoner, but did not pay any particular attention to her—as far as human recollection goes, she is the person, I have no doubt—I did not see her served with the candle—I saw she had something—it was not quite seven o'clock—I was in the parlour the next day, and Mrs. Chiarizia called me to look at the shilling, saying, "This is the same woman that was here last night"—I looked at it, and considered it bad—I looked at the prisoner and said, "I think you are the same person, though you have neither cap nor bonnet," and went out for a policeman—the prisoner said, "You may have seen me, I have sold celery here"—I handed the shilling to Mr. Chiarizia, who was in the coal-cellar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller. On the 27th of January I was in the parlour, when the prisoner came in—Mr. Boulanger was present—I went into the shop, hearing there was a bad shilling given—Mr. Chiarizia gave me the bad shilling—that was the second one—I went for a policeman, and examined the shilling—I have not the least Doubt but that it was bad—the prisoner wanted to snatch it out of my hand—I returned it to Mr. Chiarizia, and saw him give it to the officer—he bit it—I went with the prisoner to the station—I went back to Mr. Chiarizia's shop with him, and fetched the first shilling, he returned to the station and gave it to the police-constable.</p>

               <p>The Case opened by Mr. Peatt, Council for the Prosecution.</p>
               <p>NEWBERT ABBOTT sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Clarke, of Shadwell, butcher; I had a conversation with the prisoner at the White Swan, where I lodge, in New Gravel-lane, I have lodged there near two years, sometimes I kill beasts or sheep, and sometimes I fetch sheep home from market; the prisoner and another man desired me to go and ask my master, whether he could kill a heifer for him at his slaughter-house, I asked my master, and he said I might; I informed the prisoner of my master's assent, and the prisoner said he would go and fetch the heifer as soon as he could.</p>
               <p>What time did the conversation between you and the prisoner happen? - About one on the 3d of February.</p>
               <p>What time did he return? - He returned between six and seven.</p>
               <p>What did he bring with him? - Two bullocks.</p>
               <p>Dead or alive? - Alive, on Wednesday between six and seven in the evening, I think it was the 3d of February, I put them into my master's pound.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Clarke within? - I do not think he was; the prisoner and another man, whom I do not know, had been with me, to put the beasts into the pound; the prisoner was one of the persons that put the bullocks into the pound; I have known him for years at different times.</p>
               <p>What kind of bullocks were these, that were in the pound? - They were brownish, they had no mark upon them to my knowledge, but a little was cut off the end of the tail of both of them.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing particular in their horns? - Nothing, the man that came with the prisoner, came to help me to kill it the next day; I began about nine o'clock; they might weigh about three-score stone apiece.</p>
               <p>Did you kill one or both of them? - Only one.</p>
               <p>Was the beast you killed on that morning, one of these bullocks that was put into the pound, the preceding evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any other beast in the pound? - Only them two, the door of the pound is only bolted, the prisoner came to Mr. Clarke's about two in the afternoon, on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present at any conversation between you and Clarke? - Yes; the other man came to kill the bullock, the bullock was hung up, and left in the slaughter-house, I had no order to carry it any where; the offal was left in the slaughter-house till a discovery was made whose bullock it was, and that it was stolen.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher, I keep a house at Shadwell, and have a slaughter-house; I have lived there a twelvemonth last Midsummer, I am a cutting butcher, I sell sometimes alive, and sometimes dead.</p>
               <p>Did your man Abbott ever come to you and ask you to give permission to kill a heifer in your slaughter-house? - Yes, for two persons, he said, it was to kill a heifer.</p>

               <p>What day of the month or week was it? - On Wednesday about twelve, the 2d day in February, in lieu of that they brought something the over night about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner one of the persons that came with the bulloks? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230134"></xptr>Did you ever know the prisoner before? - I saw him once before.</p>
               <p>What did he bring to you? - I did not see it till Thursday morning, then I went up to the market, to buy some meat at Leadenhall, and Whitechapel, and in consequence of my permission, one of them was killed, the weight was about sixty stone apiece; when I went down and saw what they were, I did not expect to see anything of that kind, for I thought it was a thing of no extraordinary value; I says to the man, ask the prisoner who these bullocks belong to, and the prisoner replied, they belong to us both; I said, I should be glad to know where you bought them, and he did not give me any answer at all to the purpose.</p>
               <p>Court. What answer did he give? - He said, he had fetched them a great way, and for that reason he desired, I would let him take his property away; I said, I shall not unless you give me a particular account how you came by them, from some sufficient house-keeper, in the parish of Whitechapel, or Mile End; he would not give me any answer about them; after this I gave information to the Magistrates, and then he desired to take the hide away.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see any marks anywhere on any part of these bullocks? - There was no marks, nor no scissars had been upon them, as though they had been bought or sold; that made me suspicious, I thought the property was rather too good to be their own; I had no other reason as there was no mark on their hips; the prisoner returned afterwards, and desired to take away the hide, I went to Justice Green's office, and two of his men came down to us, and when they saw the men, they made their escape.</p>

               <p>Between four and five in the afternoon, the 2d of February, I was feeding my master's bullocks in a field, there were some brown ones among them, they are what they call Welch-runts or steers; I fastened the gate in the usual manner, they were folding gates, there was a large wooden bar with a padlock; I saw one of those beasts afterwards at Mr. Clarke's, on Thursday morning between seven and eight, the padlock was undone and hung on; the bullock was a darkish brindle on the head and sides, more so than on the back; part of the hair and tip of the tail was gone, some white on the legs within the legs, I know him by his marks, he was very tame, and used to feed out of my hand, I saw a hide at Mr. Clarke's, I examined it and thought it was the hide of the other; the cattle of my master were left to me to feed and take care of.</p>

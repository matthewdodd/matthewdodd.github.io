I came to London on the 15th of May, and lodged in the Hackney-road - about eight o'clock, I and my wife were going to Maiden-lane; we had each a bundle, and she had my arm; we were going along Long-alley, and when I got to <placeName id="t18220522-62-crimeloc339">Angel-alley</placeName>

I put my hand down and pulled up my watch before it broke, and these two bits I caught in my hands; it was a violent blow I received, more than the weight of a man's hand - I suppose there was some weighty substance besides the hand, either iron or stone - the blood came from my nose. I let go my wife's arm, and called Stop thief! pursuing him down Angel-alley, where he ran. I should have overtaken him, but three men stood in the alley, and gave way to let him through. One of them in an apron caught hold of me, and asked what was the matter - I rushed through them, and saw a man turn round a corner to the right; he was the same man who struck me and took my watch - Ramsay is the man to the best of my knowledge - the impress on my mind is such as to leave no doubt of his being the man. The men who stopped me were about twenty-five yards from the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call Stop thief! before they stopped you - A. Yes, and after I got through them; they were in sight when I called Stop thief, and near enough to hear me call. Greenwood was the man who had the apron on, and Bowers was with him; after I got through them, they turned to look after me; and when I lost sight of the man, I saw three or four women, I asked them for a drop of water to wash the blood off my face, which they refused. I suppose the man who struck me went into the house, but I did not see him go in. At six o'clock the next night I saw the three prisoners in the watch-house; I had described them to the officer; I knew them as soon as I saw them; it was not dusk; the alley is dark. I did not suspect he was going to ill use me, it was done in a moment; he did not speak. I noticed his face. I had not run many yards when I saw the other man; I believe Ramsay to be the person; I did not see his face after he got the watch. Greenwood hustled me, and Bowers stood on his right.</p>

I cannot swear to any of the men - I saw four men. I was agitated, but I think the man who ran away from him was taller than the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 15th of May I was called by a boy to go to Straughton, and found him bleeding in the nose. In consequence of what he informed me I went in search, but without success. I went next day with Gregory, and found the three prisoners about five o'clock in the afternoon, at a public-house, in Skinner-street, Bishopsgate, playing at skittles - it is about one hundred yards from Angel-alley - when they saw us, I saw a change in their countenances. They went on with the game in a confused state; we took them to the watch-house. Gregory fetched Straughton - he saw them in the watch-house, and identified the whole three. They said they knew nothing about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Birch, a tobacconist, in High-street, Camden Town. The prisoner came on Monday, the 5th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock, for an ounce of the best shag tobacco—it came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put the shilling into the till—there was only two sixpences there—I am sure there was no other shilling-a little while after another man came in for the same quantity—I served him—he gave me a shilling—I put it into the till the same as the other-no person came in between the time that the prisoner and the second person came—I only took some pence—when my mistress came home she was going to give change for half-a-crown, and saw the two bad shillings in the till—she put them on the mantel-piece—they were there till the evening, when my master nailed them to the counter—they remained there until Thursday, when about the same time as before, the prisoner came for half an ounce of the best shag—I knew him to be the same man—I am quite sure of that—he offered me a shilling, and I showed it to my mistress before he went out—she looked at it, gave it me again, and fetched a constable—the prisoner took up a paper and looked at it—the constable came in, and he was taken into custody—I took the other bad shillings to the station-house, and kept them there till I gave them to the constable.</p>

I took the prisoner at Mr. Birch's—I searched him, and found a tobacco-box, a comb, a latch key, and half an ounce of tobacco, which he had just purchased—I received the shilling taken on the Thursday, and the two were taken from the counter in my presence—I took him to the station-house, and the charge was taken—he said he lived at No. 4, York-street, Camden Town—he was asked who kept the house—he said a man—the officer said, "What is his name"—he said he might go and see, that was his business—the officer said, "You are a sharp youth"—"Yes," says he, "these are sharp times"—I went to inquire at his lodgings, where he said he lived, and found it all false.</p>

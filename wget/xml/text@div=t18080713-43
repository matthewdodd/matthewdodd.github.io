               <p>Q. When you got into this Angel public house, did any body ill use you - A Yes, my breeches pocket was cut with a knife; and my money, whatever it was, was taken from there; I perceived it at the time, and said what are you about; I was too much in liquor to stop him.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no force made use of; it did you no mischief - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Whoever did it, meaned to do it slightly without alarming you at all - A. I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the person was that was sitting near you, and had this knife, and cut your pocket - A. The prisoner, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more than one person sitting with you at the same time your pocket was cut, and your money was taken from you - A. I believe there might be one more in a smock frock; to the best of my judgment it was this man that did it; I went outside of the door and called out immediately; the patrol was going past, he came to my assistance, I called out in the house, the landlord was not at home, nobody came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that this man was one that sat by you, did the man in the smock frock get away - A I cannot say; I was so far gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be certain, had you your senses enough about you to know that you had the money about you in your breeches pocket when you came into the Angel - A. I can; I took it out of my pocket to pay the reckoning at the Angel; and then I am quite sure I had the dollar and some silver, as to gold I cannot say; the officer has the money; I saw the dollar before the magistrate, and half a crown and two shillings; I had no mark on the dollar, or any of the money.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the night of the 15th of June, I was about twenty yards from the Angel; I heard this man complaining; I went up to him, he seemed very much intoxicated in liquor, he told me he had been robbed, and shewed me the place where the pocket had been cut out; I saw his breeches had been cut: I asked him if he could give a description of the person; some person answered the man is gone up here in a smock frock; I went up Angel alley, I met the prisoner and another person coming down the alley; Angel alley was stopped up at that time with boards, they were building there; when it is open it leads into Wentworth street.</p>
               <p>Q. How were these two men dressed - A. One a light coloured coat, and the prisoner in a smock frock.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor.) How was the man dressed who cut your breeches - A. He had a smock frock on.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said the other man had a smock frock on - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. He did say so.</p>
               <p>Patrol. I took him in custody, I had only hold of the man in the smock frock, he called the other man Bob; I told the prisoner I had a suspicion of his robbing Pardon, he denied it; I took him into the watchhouse, then I fetched in the other man into the watchhouse, they were both searched by the officer of the night; I saw the dollar, half crown, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130035"></xptr>two shillings, found upon the prisoner, and the bottom part of the pocket, he had a large knife in his pocket: the other man had a small knife; the other man was discharged, there was nothing found against him.</p>
               <p>Q. From any thing that the prisoner said, or from any enquiry you made, you do not know that ever the prisoner was in the Angel - A. No.</p>

            . I am a headborough; I searched the prisoner and the other man in the watchhouse; upon the prisoner I found a dollar, a French half crown, two shillings in silver, two knives, and the bottom part of a pocket. I found upon the other man, five penny worth of halfpence, no knife at all. The prosecutor could not tell what house he had been in; I found it out afterwards; the prosecutor said he had lost a seven shilling piece, a dollar, and some silver; the bottom of the pocket matches exactly the place where it was cut from.</p>

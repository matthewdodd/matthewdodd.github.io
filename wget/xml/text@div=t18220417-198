On the 4th of April, the articles stated in the indictment were in my room. I went out between five and six o'clock in the evening and locked the door; I returned about a quarter before nine. The prisoner Avis had lived with me as a wife, nearly a fortnight; she went out one day, and did not return for a week; she had a key of the room, but told me she had lost it. The shift was mine. I had been living with a woman before, who is dead. I knew the prisoner wore it. I missed all these things except the shawl, I am not certain whether I missed that. The prisoner was taken on the 15th of April. She used these things when she lived with me.</p>

Murrell brought the prisoner home; she lived a fortnight with him, and then went away, and came back in a week, and Mr. Jarman called him down, and said he would not suffer him to be in the house if he lived with her, and they Murrell turned her away; this was on the day before Good Friday. On the 4th of April, the male prisoner came between seven and eight o'clock, and asked me for a 1 d. of tobacco, and while I was serving him, she came in, and went up stairs. Agent gave me a bad sixpence, which I refused, and he went out, and then Avis came down with a large bundle in her hands. I was afraid to stop her. When Murrell came I told him.</p>

She said she lodged at No. 2, Clement's-lane; when I came there I found a Agent there; he said it was his lodging. I found a handkerchief, an apron, and two small keys, one of which fits the prosecutor's room.</p>

            . I went to the prisoner's house with a search-warrant, and found part of a kettle strap among a parcel of old metal, in a bag, tied up, ready to be sent off; I found the mark on it, and told the prisoner there was a piece answering the description, and laid it on the counter. I told him I had come to look for stolen goods. While I was stooping to look over the remainder of the metal, I saw the prisoner put the piece in his pocket; he produced it from his pocket - I believe I asked him to produce it. They said he had put it in his pocket, I told him to pull it out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He has a workshop about five yards from the house; that piece was all that the prosecutor claimed, and all that we found in his possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it worth a penny - A. It weighs three ounces; he shewed me every thing willingly; his wife serves in the shop-there was no occasion for him to put it in his pocket to prevent its being mixed.</p>

            . I was in the employ of Messrs. Tylor. On Thursday, the 17th of July, I stole two new copper tea-kettle straps, from my masters' shop; I took them home, and sent them to the prisoner by my child, who is between six and seven years of age - I got four-pence for the two - They were whole when I sent them, and quite new, not polished - They were perfect; the prisoner knew where I was working at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I stole them both together, their value is according to their weight; they would be worth 1s., to any body that had the same use for them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go with the child, therefore you did not know that she sold them? - A. No; I did not quarrel with the prisoner, I left the prisoner about seven months ago - I never said I would be revenged on him.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not say you would have your revenge with him for turning you out of his house? - A. Never such a word came from my mouth; I never saw the prisoner from the time I left him till I saw him at the office; I was taken into custody the next day, I was committed here and have been at largeo since. I had no promise made me to give evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever have any conversation with him, either before or after you were taken up? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It came innocently into my possession.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM HARCOURT. I am a brass-founder and a judge of copper, (looking at the two straps) they are sold by weight and are worth 13d halfpenny per pound; as old copper they are worth 9d., at the full extent; if I was to purchase them I should think 9d., the full value of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you venture to buy them as old copper? - A. NO. I have known instances of such things being sold as old copper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I live in Sutton-street, Clerkenwell, I am not a master.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth in the manufactured state? - A. Thirteen pence halfpenny a pound. I never saw the prisoner before-my master sent me to value them.</p>

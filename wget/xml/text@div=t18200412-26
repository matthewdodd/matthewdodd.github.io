            , ESQ. I live in Doctors' Commons. On the 10th of March, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in <placeName id="t18200412-26-crimeloc142">Guildhall</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18200412-26-crimeloc142" type="placeName" value="Guildhall"></interp>

I was unconscious of having been robbed till half an hour after, when I went into the Irish Chamber to write a letter, and enclose the Bank post-bill in it, I then missed my purse. I saw the prisoner a few days afterwards, with my purse, in possession of the officer - I knew the purse from its contents and appearance.</p>

            . I was an extra-constable. On the 10th of March I saw the prisoner go into Guildhall, just before the poll was closed, I suspected and watched him; he was alone - I lost him in the crowd, he came out in about half an hour, I then secured him, and found the purse in the left-hand pocket of his trowsers - it contained a 20 l. Bank post-bill, six 1 l. Bank notes, and some memorandums; I also found a silk handkerchief on him. Next day I took him before Mr. Alderman Ansley - Mr. Slade appeared at the second examination and claimed it. The prisoner said he found it in Guildhall.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>JOHN GARTON. I am a constable. I followed the prisoner into Guildhall. I did not observe Mr. Slade. I was with Markwell, and saw the purse found on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found it, and asked several gentlemen if it belonged to them.</p>

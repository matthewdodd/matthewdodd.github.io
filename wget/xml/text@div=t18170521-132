               <p>EDMUND PAYNTER. My father is a market-gardener; I know the prisoner, he lives with his father; there is only a hedge between his ground and ours. On the 1st of May, I was looking over the hedge, and saw the prisoner digging a hole, when he had finished he got into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210041"></xptr>into the hole, lifted a deal box out, and a canvas cloth, he then filled the hole up, took the box and the cloth, and walked past his father, who was at work in the grounds, and carried them to the pig-sty, he then moved two sliding boards and put the box into the sty; his younger brother, who is about twelve years of age, was with him. His father could see him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. His father must have seen him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WELCH. I am gardener to Mr. Brown, who lives about half a mile from the prisoner's house. On the 29th of April, about five o'clock in the morning, when I came I found the gate broken open, and the articles stated in the indictment gone; on the 2d of May, I went with the officer, and saw the prisoner in the garden, as I stated before, and found part of the property concealed under the floor in the house, and the rest of the things in different parts-the seeds hung against the wall, and had my hand-writing on the papers. The prisoner said there was nothing there belonging to me, and that he had had the seeds more than three months. I found the mats in an empty well, and am quite sure they are my master's property.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WESTCOAT. I was present when the things were found.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

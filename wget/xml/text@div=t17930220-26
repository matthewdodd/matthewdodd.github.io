On the 24th of January he was along with Bryant in my tap room drinking a pint of beer; Bryant took his place; he lived with me at this time. Mr. Farmer wanted a man and Gregory went to live with him, within two or three days after he left me; Bryant was along with my servant at that time; they had been backward and forward together, and were often juggling together; in the night they appointed at this time to meet there, and to come early together on Friday the 25th the next night; I heard them set and whisper, and say, come here to-morrow night, come earlier; they came again on Friday night the 25th, and there they sat till such time as it was time to shut up, which was about five minutes to eleven, and I unbolted the door and I let them go out into the gateway, and I saw them go down to the yard, and was there a little while, and I saw the stable door open; I saw Gregory run out of the stable and ran by the door into the street, he ran out of the gateway as hard as he could; this was about five or six minutes after I let him out; I don't think the whole was ten minutes; Gregory was against the stable door where the hay was carried, in which I first saw him; that stable is much about eight yards on the left hand side going down, it is one of the stables that Farmer occupies; he ran by me as fast as he could, then I opened the door and I went and I found Bryant standing at the door locking of it; he could not get the key out; this was after the other had ran; I said to him, you scoundrel you have been robbing of me; No, says he, I have not; Bryant did not lodge in my house, nor Gregory; I went a little further to my next stable door and I found the door open; it is my own, one of the six that I occupy; in the mean while I then went up and looked at my hay; Bryant went away after that; I went up to my own loft and I missed two trusses of hay from the loft of the stable that I occupy myself; I had four trusses of hay in particular on one side of my loft, I had laid them there that very evening about six o'clock at night; the hay sometimes runs better than it will at others, and I had a horse that was not well, and I made a reserve of that for that horse; I picked it out on purpose from among the other hay, I thought it was sweeter and better; I suppose there was a load and a quarter in the loft at that time, and this was laid by itself; Bryant nor Gregory had nothing with them when they went away. When I found Bryant at the door I asked him where the lanthorns were; says he, my wife was in the yard and I gave it her to carry home; I went back to the stable door again and I stopped a little while, and my son happened to come home from his work and he came into the yard, and he asked me what was the matter; I told him I had been robbed, and I sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200047"></xptr>him down to Mr. Farmer's for somebody to come up and open the stable door, to see if my property was there; I traced the hay from my own door to Farmer's door.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a great deal of hay carried up that yard? - No, there is not, only at different times. Farmer sent somebody and we unlocked the door; at first I found the two lanthorns inside of the stable door, shut in on the right hand; then we went a little further into the stable and we found one truss of hay, we looked down a little further and we see the other; one lay on the ground and the other in a little binn. I can swear to the hay.</p>
               <p>Q Will you undertake to say that these two trusses are those which had been in your loft? - I can; I had picked them out by themselves, and I had laid them up; I can swear to it by the colour and herbage of the hay; I deal with two farmers.</p>
               <p>Q Do either of these farmers sell hay to any body but you, do you know where all these people in your yard buy their hay? - This is a lighter coloured hay and a deal more herbage in it; there is no such hay in the yard.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you find any more hay in Farmer's stables besides these two trusses? - I dare say there was not two pounds; the man had borrowed a truss for Mr. Farmer's horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to say, supposing you had seen these trusses of hay without these circumstances, that this was your hay? - When I took Bryant to the watch-house he told that he took my private keys. When Bryant came to work Saturday morning, about six o'clock, I charged the watch with him; he told me then that he did not take the hay, nor did he meddle with the hay; I asked him how he came to rob me; he told me he did not rob me; he told me he should have gone home about his business, but

             said, damn you stay, and Gregory made up to a private place were my keys hung and goes up to my stable, and unlocks the door; he said he held the two lanthorns himself; I said nothing to him more than asked him how he came to rob me? this past; in the morning when he came to work he said, Gregory swore that he wanted two trusses of hay and he would be damned if he would not have them, and he held the two lanthorns, and stopped there while Gregory took the two trusses; he said, that he put them in the stable himself, into Farmer's stable. The watchman came and took him to the watch house, and from there to the Rotation office in Marlborough-street. Gregory was taken up last Tuesday week, he absconded, we could not hear any thing of him; he was apprehended at a place called Winchmore Hill; the constable told me he knew the man and he would take him directly; I had a warrant for him the same day as Bryant was taken, but he was not taken till last Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gregory. Please you my lord I belong to east Middlesex militia, they were embodied the 28th and I was obliged to go on Monday the 28th. Ask him my lord, whether he saw me take the hay out of his stable - I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bryant. When I came to work at six o'clock, as usual, my master charged the watch with me; there was no such charge, as my master has said; as to carrying in a bit of hay, or locking or unlocking the door I never did.</p>

               <p>I live with Mr. Farmer; I know nothing more than that the gentleman's son came to me between eleven and twelve o'clock, and took me out of bed to open the stable door that night, I went, but I could not find the right key, for the man Gregory did not come back that night; Mr. Mole and his son unlocked the door with another key; I had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200048"></xptr>the right key; and the trusses were there in the stable, they were both laying in the stable, one at the end binn and the other on the ground; I can say we had no hay of our own and we borrowed a truss, and there was no hay in the stable but what was out of the truss; I had not looked after the stable that night; I was in the stable before in the forenoon between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot undertake to say what kind of hay there was in that stable? - I went to Mr. Haywood in the evening, just about sun set, and borrowed the hay, because there was none for the horses that night; Mr. Haywood gave it to Gregory; I was not present, but I went and borrowed it of Mr. Haywood, and it was to be used for Mr. Farmer's horses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Gregory. That man lives fellow servant with me. Please you my lord and gentlemen of the jury, I lived along with Mr. Mole about eleven weeks, I left Mr. Mole and he gave me an exceeding good character, and I went to live along with Mr. Farmer; at the time I went to live along with Mr. Farmer I did not know about the militia; after I had lived there about nine days I heard that the militia was to be embodied; accordingly I went on Sunday morning down to the militia at Edmonton; I was down there better than a fortnight; two men came down while I was in the ranks and asked me if my name was Gregory; I said, yes; they wanted me to go up to London with them; I asked them for what? They told me Mr. Mole wanted me, and had not I lived with him? I said, yes; I told them I would go; they went to my officer and and they said, that they had got a warrant against me; I came accordingly up to London with them; I know nothing of the affairs no more than a child that is just born.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bryant. I lived along with Mr. Mole. About three days before I came to Mr. Mole, I lived with Capt. Morrison of the Guards; I had been out of place, and having nothing to do I heard that Mr. Mole wanted a man, and then after I had been there nine days, I was taken up and accused by my master of robbing him of two trusses of hay; he accused me of locking the door, and taking the key out of the door, which is no such thing; I never touched the door.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Gregory called two witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What do you value your hay at? - Three shillings.</p>

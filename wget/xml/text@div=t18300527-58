            . I am a publican. Andrews was at my house on the 12th of May - I went to the door to see if the horse and gig were safe; it was safe, and I took a great coat and threw it over the horses' loins - the prisoner was there, and knew me; he said, "Master, I have been watching this horse and gig, and suppose when the gentlemen come they will stand something;" he asked me to drink, which I refused - he came to the bar, had a glass of gin, and went out; Moore gave me information - I ran with him in search of the prisoner, but could not find him - he was taken at ten o'clock that evening.</p>

            . I live next door to Seward. On the 12th of May I was in my shop, and saw the prisoner opposite my window; he had come down the street with two women - he left them, and went over to the horse and chaise; I knew him, and watched him - I saw him take the coat off the horses' back, and put it on his own back: he took another coat from the chaise, put it on the horse, and then walked away; I told Mr. Seward of it - we went after him, but could not find him; I have known him these two years.</p>

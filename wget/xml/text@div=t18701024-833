On 25th September, about 5.30 in the morning, I was in Bartholomew Close—I saw the prisoner there with another man—he was carrying this counterpane under his left arm—when he saw me be dropped it on the pavement, and ran away—I went after him, and he was stopped by City Policeman 277—I picked up the counter<lb></lb>pane, and asked him how he came in possession of it, and he said he picked it up in Half Moon Passage—I took him to the station—Mrs. Pearson came there and identified the counterpane as her property—he was about twenty yards from the prosecutor's house when he dropped the counterpane—the other man was discharged.</p>

I am the wife of Richard Pearson, and live at 11, Half Moon Passage, Bartholomew Close—on Sunday morning, 25th September, I was awoke about 5 o'clock in the morning—I heard a man drop down from somewhere, and a shutter fell down and broke a pane of glass that was underneath the window—I jumped up and opened the window—when the man dropped down the peg from the counterpane fell—when I opened the window I heard the man run down, and I could see the left shoulder of the man with a white smock on—the counterpane had been hanging outside the window all night to dry—I went to the station, and saw the counterpane and identified it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was going through Half Moon Passage, with another man, and saw the counterpane on the ground. I picked it up. He said "Don't have anything to do with it, I daresay it belongs to someone in the court." I put it down, and started to go home, when the policeman ran after us.</p>

I am a marine-store dealer, carrying on business at 5, old Boswell-court—on 22d April, about half-past 8, the prisoner came to me with the copper produced—a boy accompanied him—I asked him where he got the copper from—he said his employer gave it to him—I said I did not like to have anything to do with it, but if he liked to leave it until to-morrow morning, and get his employer to say he gave it to him, I would buy it—he gave me some address in Bear-street, Clare Market—the constable went there, but could not find him, and I gave him into custody.</p>

I am foreman to Mr. Grant, a printer, of Pilgrim-square—the prisoner was in his employment at the rolling-machine for six months—I have no doubt the copper produced is our property—it appears to have been out off some large pieces in rolling—it is merely waste and thrown away—I never gave him any leave to take the copper—I have nothing to do with it—I believe he had the idea that he had a right to take it—in the trade it is generally allowed as the perquisites of the rolling-machine man—the value is about 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my master is not here.</p>

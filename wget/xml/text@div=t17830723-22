               <p>I lost a mare on the 12th of June, she was turned out between six and seven in the evening, and the 13th she was up here, at Smithfield; I missed her the next morning; and Bradbury came to let me know the mare was at Smithfield, and after that he offered to give me ten pounds not to appear against his brother-in-law, who he said had bought her; he said, he would give me ten pounds, and give me the mare again; I sent for a constable and took him up, and had him before the Justice at Uxbridge, and he had two men to be bound for him; the next morning I came to see after my mare, and I found her with a lock round her foot, the same that she had on when she was turned out; I found her at this man's house.</p>
               <p>Court. How came Bradbury to apply to you? - He came down to let me know where the mare was, and then he said, a brother-in-law of his had bought this mare in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Court. Had the mare been advertised and cried at Smithfield, before Bradbury came to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>- BRADBURY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a butcher, I know nothing otherwise than I saw the prisoner come with the intention to sell the mare at Sharp's alley, and Mr. Beaumont stopped her directly, on suspicion of being stolen; that was the 18th of June; I cannot particularly recollect the day, she had not been advertised then; Beaumont is a stable keeper in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Court. What had you to do with the mare? - I had nothing to do with the mare, only seeing her stopped, I never offered him any such thing as he says; he said, the mare was worth ten guineas, but that is more than anybody liked to give, and I never offered him ten guineas.</p>
               <p>How came you to go to Smith at all? - They said, I should he troubled about it.</p>
               <p>Why so? - On account as the mare was stopped in a yard where we live by; but it is an open yard, where the people put carts and things; it is a place called the coach yard.</p>
               <p>That is your yard? - No, only we have a place that joins the yard.</p>
               <p>Do not you buy horses to kill? - No, Sir, I never killed one, nor I never bought above two horses in my life; I never was in trouble in my life; I am sure I cannot tell how I came to be afraid of getting into trouble; the mare was offered to me for sale, by the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>What bargain did you make for her? - The time we was going to buy her, he brought her down to our place, to sell her as a glandered mare; he said she was old.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you buy horses to kill? - Upon my oath, I never bought one to kill in my life; I took it round to one Mr. Bosworth.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230047"></xptr>What is he? - He is a neighbour of mine, not a brother-in-law, and while Bosworth was bargaining for it, Beaumont came down and took charge of it; the mare was hardly down in the yard.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it a glandered horse? - I do not know what a glandered horse is.</p>
               <p>You were bargaining for this horse for Mr. Bosworth? - I was.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner there when Mr. Beaumont came down? - He was.</p>
               <p>How came you to offer Smith the ten guineas? - I never offered him any such money.</p>
               <p>Did you offer him no money? - Yes, I have offered money, I cannot particularly say what; I cannot recollect what I was going to do directly.</p>
               <p>Recollect Sir? - I cannot, I do assure you, it might be a pound or two for ought I know.</p>
               <p>What did you offer him that money for? - I cannot tell, I never was in such a thing in my life, I suppose with intent to make it up.</p>
               <p>Make what up? - Because I should not come into trouble.</p>
               <p>What was you afraid of? - I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>Have you any other witnesses here, that were present when the prisoner offered the horse to you for sale? - No.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell why you was afraid of coming into trouble? - I cannot tell; one and another told me I should come into trouble.</p>
               <p>What for? - Because I bid money for the horse.</p>
               <p>Did not they tell you, you would be in trouble because the mare was found in your possession, and she was stolen? - She never was in my possession at all; I did offer money, but I cannot tell how much.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. What did this man say to you when he came first to you? - When he came to me first, he told me where the mare was, and after, he offered to give me ten pounds to make it up for a brother in law of his, on account of buying her; but this was the man that bought her, I told him I would not take it; here is a witness at the door that heard him.</p>

               <p>Did you hear the conversation between Bradbury and Smith about this man? - About ten o'clock, on the 16th, I was sent for to take charge of Bradbury, on his offering him money in my hearing; he repeated that he came down on purpose, and would give Smith ten pounds, or any sum he should mention, not to appear against the man who bought her, or the man that stole her; for the man that bought her was brother in law to him, and therefore he was afraid that they both would be hanged; that his brother in law had bought the mare, with the lock round her foot.</p>
               <p>Court to Bradbury. Now, what do you say, have both these witnesses sworn falsely? - I do not say they have, I do not deny that I offered money, I cannot take upon myself to say how much, I have only one brother in law; I cannot recollect having said such words, I was so much confused, I never was in any trouble.</p>
               <p>Court. Let Bradbury be kept in court.</p>

               <p>A person that went down to my stable told me, he had seen a man, the 13th of June that had stolen a horse; I went to Sharp's Alley, and the mare was standing in a stable, and the prisoner and Bradbury were together; I do not know whose stable it was; Bradbury shewed it to me, he was standing with the prisoner, and this acquaintance of mine asked him if he did not come down there on a mare; my acquaintance's name is Lamb, I took the prisoner into custody, and brought him to my own yard; the prisoner said nothing about the mare, Bradbury said to the prisoner, it is a stolen one, give me my money again, and the prisoner returned some money back, I did not see the mare sold, but I saw some money returned, there was half a guinea, and half a crown, and to the best of my remembrance two shillings in silver; I saw the mare.</p>

               <p>Court. Then the money was returned to Bradbury by the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did not see the prisoner sell him? - No.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say about the mare in your hearing? - He said nothing; I asked him going along about this mare, and he said it was his own property, he had had her above a twelvemonth.</p>

               <p>Are you sure he said the mare was his own property? - Yes.</p>

            , Gardner, of Slough, in the county of Bucks.</p>
               <p>On Friday June 20, I came up to London, setting out at five o'clock in the morning, to walk up to see a father who was ill, and my having occasion to purchase a horse, which I wanted for a temporary use to go in a cart to bring up fruit to the London markets, the produce of my own garden, and what I might occasionally purchase, and being informed it was the market day at Smithfield, I repaired there, where I spoke to a man going through the market with a horse, I asked him the price thereof, he told me twenty shillings; I told him I thought the horse was glandered; he said that was not a found price, and asked me my use for the said horse, which I informed him was to bring up fruit from Slough twice or three times a week to the London markets, and should not have occasion for him above three months; after which time I must sell him again, which was my reason of purchasing one at so low a price; he then answered me, that if he was well kept, and going to grass a day or two in a week, he might answer my purpose for that time; I offered him sixteen shillings for the said horse, which he took and we parted.</p>
               <p>Some few minutes after a man came to me, and asked me, had I that horse to sell, I answered, no, but had just purchased it; he asked me what I had given for him, I told him sixteen shillings; he said, what might be my use for him, I told him to bring up fruit from Slough to the London markets: he said he was very bad with the glanders, and was certain he would not be able to perform or go through one journey, and was of no use but to kill for dogs flesh, I then asked the advice of one or two persons standing by, who answered the same; and said, that in the time of the market, I might purchase one for twenty-five or thirty shillings, which might answer my purpose, there being such brought into the market at this time of the year.</p>
               <p>I having then the said horse on my hands, had not cash enough to purchase another, without disposing of the said horse, which I was unacquainted with where to do; they informed me there was people who bought such horses to kill for dogs flesh, at Cow Cross, where I went to dispose of him, when a person came and took me up.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, If you can place a thorough reliance on the evidence; the property was found in the possession of the prisoner, and offered by him for sale very recently after it was stolen; but the prisoner is certainly intitled to the benefit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230049"></xptr> of the contradictions arising out of the evidence against him, and there are as strong contradictions in this case, as there can be; for Smith, who seemed to speak fairly, he gives an account of Bradbury, in circumstances, that shew a consciousness of his being himself a guilty man, for there is no way of accounting for his offering so large a sum, without being conscious of having a share in that transaction; Smith's evidence goes strongly to impeach the evidence of Bradbury, who, upon the whole, appears a witness very little deserving of your credit.</p>

               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. RECORDER.</p>
               <p>Court to Bradbury. From the circumstances that have appeared in evidence, in this case, if you had not been examined as a witness, and a part of this case came out from your own evidence, I should certainly have directed you to have been detained, and indicted for buying this mare, knowing her to be stolen; I therefore recommend it to you, to be very careful in future how you conduct yourself; there is also another thing to which you might have been liable upon the evidence you have given in this case, and that is an indictment for perjury; you may therefore think yourself very well off that you are permitted to depart the court.</p>

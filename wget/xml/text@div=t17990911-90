               <p>- WALLINGER sworn. - I am a waterman; I happened to be at Paul's Wharf; I saw the prisoner go past me with a truss of hay; I said, Jewell, that will not do, I will tell Billy Bazzel of you; he said he was in liquor; in a quarter of an hour I saw him take another truss of hay out of the stack upon Paul's Wharf; he could not go any way without passing by me; he went up St. Peter's-hill with it upon his back.</p>

               <p>Wallinger. He came back again; now, says I, I will go and tell Billy Bazzel, and I went into the White Lion, and told him of it, and he and I went down.</p>
               <p>Tarling. I have enquired after Mr. Smith's servant who bought the hay of the prisoner, but he has absconded.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Wallinger.) Q. Why did he not stop me? - A.Because I did not think any thing at all of it; I was not told to stop any body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a looking-glass maker at 97, Nichols Square—I sent the man Attwood for the cheque—he did not return to me with it—on the 4th of January, the same evening, I went to the Birdcage public-house in consequence of what I heard—I saw there the defendant, who was the manager—I saw this cheque in his possession—it was not endorsed—I said "Have you the cheque in your possession"—he said "Yes"—my father and two other friends were present—I am the drawee of the cheque—this endorsement is not mine, and is not made with my authority—the prisoner asked me to endorse it—I said "No, I will see how the thing goes first," or words to that effect—I intended looking for the man who had absconded with it that night—I communicated with the police, and returned in about an hour's time with. Police-Sergeant Jenman, and was present when he spoke to the prisoner—Jenman asked him if he had received such a cheque—he said "Yes"—Jenman said "Don't part with it until you hear from me"—I do not recollect the prisoner's reply—I have had several cheques cashed at the Birdcage—it is not above three minutes' walk from my house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the name of Billinghurst and Clifford over the door of the public-house, and 1 believe they are the proprietors—I may have seen Mr. Billinghurst, but do not know him personally—I have cashed cheques there before—I sent my wife there with a cheque to be cashed, and on one occasion I went myself to cash a cheque, when I saw the prisoner's wife, they paid me the money and I came away, and forgot to endorse the cheque—I went again shortly after with another cheque, and the prisoner's wife said she had a few words over the other cheque because I had not endorsed it; they had saved it for me, and I endorsed it then—I did not say "You need not have got into any bother; you might just as well have endorsed it yourself"—if she makes that representation it is not true—as to this cheque I sent round first to know if they had received such I cheque, and then I went myself with my father and another gentleman—I asked to see the cheque, and it was shown to me by the prisoner—this is if; it is for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not ask him for it—I believed he had honestly paid the 21. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I went with a constable afterwards—my friends have not been trying to get any money out of this—I did say before the Magistrates, my friends have not have offered to settle it for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I am aware of"—I cannot say how many cheques I have cashed there, I have not kept count—it might be a dozen, probably two—I have known the prisoner as manager about three months—I occasionally went in as I passed; only since 1 went there to change cheques—I always found them very civil when they changed cheques.</p>

I went with the officer and Marks and two others—I went afterwards on another occasion with a friend of the prisoner, Jennings, I believe, is the name—we went for no purpose—Jennings asked me to go there with him—he was not a stranger; I had seen him before—I had no object to interest me whatever in going—I will not swear it—I am not sure.</p>

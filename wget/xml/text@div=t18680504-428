On the evening of the 9th March, about a 5.45, I was on duty in Aldgate High Street, with Green, and saw the three prisoners together walk through Fenchurch Street—when they came to Mr. Ivimey's shop Gardiner and Bennett stopped at the door, each of them handling a coat that was hanging within the doorway—Searle walked about two houses away to the west end of the shop—Gardiner and Bennett passed the shop once or twice—Searle then shifted his position to the east side of the shop—Gardiner then took the coat down—I could not say whether he cut it down or whether he broke it, but he took it off a brass rod, being covered by Bennett—Gardiner went away with the coat—I took Bennett on the spot—I saw no more of Searle till he was brought back by another officer, the coat being brought back with him.</p>

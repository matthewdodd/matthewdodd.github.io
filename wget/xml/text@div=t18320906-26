            . I am a Policeman. On Thursday, the 23rd of August, I received the prisoner in charge from the prosecutor; he at first accused her of taking the change of a sovereign, and then with stealing his watch -I searched her, and found this duplicate of the watch on her - I took her to Penny, who said, in her hearing, to the best of his knowledge she was the person who pawned it; she made no answer.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lodged there, and paid him 1s. a week; his wife was out, and they asked me to mind the children; he had a fight with his lodgers, and took them to the station next morning, and swore they had stolen his watch, but the inspector would not take the charge; on Wednesday morning his wife took two tickets out of the box, and asked if I could read; I said No, but one was marked 1s. 6d.; she then went to the box, gave me this ticket, and told me to mind it for her - I did not know what it was for till I was taken.</p>

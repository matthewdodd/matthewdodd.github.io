                  </hi>. I am a miller, living at Stanmore. The prisoner was my wagoner—on the 29th of June I sent him to London—he was al<lb></lb>lowed three bushels of beans, and three pecks of pollard and chaff a week for each of his horses—it is mixed, and he goes into the mill, and has it as he requires it during the week—a man in the mill measures it to him—he is allowed about a sack at a time, sometimes two sacks—he takes it into the stable, and puts it into his bin, and takes as much as he requires—the largest quantity he takes to London is about two bushels—here is from two to five bushels, and it is mixed up as mine is—I have no doubt about its being mine—he would not be allowed to take as much as this.</p>

            . I lodged in this house at the time of the robbery - I worked and slept in the same room with the prisoner. On the night of the 13th of December, about ten o'clock, I went to bed, leaving the prisoner at work in the room - I went to sleep, awoke about twelve o'clock, and missed him, but supposed he had gone into the yard for some purpose and would return - he had not intimated that he was going away; I went to sleep, and awoke again about three o'clock - he was still absent; I then concluded that he had left - he could not leave without getting into the yard, and over a wall six feet high - I got up at half-past eight o'clock, and found the room door wide open, which I had shut, and the yard door was wide open - I never saw him again till he was apprehended; four pairs of boots were gone - before I went to bed the prisoner wanted me to go up, and ask Mr. Umfreville to lend him 1s., and while we were talking we heard the door fastened.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not hear a noise in the adjoining place while we were at work that night, and ask me what it was? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and work for Mr. Umfreville. He informed me of this transaction, and on the 7th of January in the evening I met the prisoner at the corner of Huntingdon-street, Kingsland-road - I followed him to the top of the road, and met a Policeman; I went before him to tell the Policeman to take him, and when I turned round I missed him - I saw him again, and followed him to Shoreditch; I met another Policeman, and told him to take him in charge; he asked what for - I said,"For robbing my master;" he said he did not know that he had robbed my master, and shook his pockets and asked if there were any thing there belonging to my master - I said I did not know.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. The prisoner was given into my charge on the 7th of January - as we went to the station he said, "I know I am done this time; I have been in prison before - I have been to the Old Bailey not long ago, and if I had had the use of my other leg I should have been hung before now."</p>
               <p>MR. UMFREVILLE. I never found the property - they were children's boots; my street door was locked, and the back door bolted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He used me very cruel; they were children's half-boots - I went and asked him to give me work, being distressed - I have got the King's evil, by which I lost my leg - he said, "I will give you 13d. a pair, if you like to work for that;" they were doublesoled welts, and it is not the regular price - in about a week he said my work would not do, and I might go about my business - I said if he would pay me I would; he took a week's rent, and gave me 6d. - he said my work was not fit to be seen, and he would give me no more - he afterwards gave me four pairs to make; I told the witness I would not work for him any more, and I must go to the workhouse, I was so bad; I finished the boots, left them on my place, and went away; I took my tools in my pocket, and that is what I asked the witness if they belonged to his master - as to getting over the wall I could not do it, on account of my affliction - I was never here before in my life.</p>

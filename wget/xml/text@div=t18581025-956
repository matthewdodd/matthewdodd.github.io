On 2d September, the prisoner came to my house with a female, about 12 o'clock in the day—the female asked for half-a-quartern of gin; I served her—she gave me a sixpence—I looked at it and told her it was a bad one, and I wished her to give me good money for the gin—she said she did not know it was bad, and she took it at the City of London public-house, which is near there—I told her it was a pity she should have taken it, and I would go back to the house with her and set it to rights—she refused that—the prisoner was there at the time—the woman paid for the drink with coppers, and she and the prisoner left together—I followed them into Queen-street, Golden-square—they had some conversation, and the prisoner went into the Devonshire Arms—the woman was outside—when the prisoner came out the woman joined him, and they went on together. I went into the Devonshire Arms, and spoke to Miles the barmaid—she showed me something—I then followed the prisoner and the woman again—I saw them together near the Regent-circus in Piccadilly—I called the attention of the policeman to them.</p>

On 2d September, about the middle of the day, Mr. Dodson pointed my attention to the prisoner and the woman—I followed them for about an hour—they went to different places and ultimately to the Camden Stores—I went in shortly afterwards, and they were both in there—I asked the barmaid in their presence what sort of money they gave her; she said the prisoner gave her a sixpence—the prisoner said it was a shilling—the barmaid said, "No, I am sure it was not;" and she produced two sixpences, one of which was bad; this is it—I asked the prisoner what he had got about him, and said I should search him immediately; and he produced another bad sixpence—this is it—I received from Miles part of another sixpence.</p>

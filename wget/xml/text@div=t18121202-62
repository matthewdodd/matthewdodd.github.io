               <p>Q. Was your house broken open - A. It was on Wednesday night, the 25th of September, I believe it was, or early in the morning. I retired to rest about half after eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your mother unwell in the house at that time - A. She was indisposed, and had been indisposed in the house a considerable time. My sister attended her. There was a light burning in the house in consequence of my sister being unwell.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020044"></xptr>COURT. She was indiaposed - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When you went to bed was your house safe - A. To the best of my knowledge it was.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first learn that your house had been broken open - A. About six o'clock the following morning I received the information from my groom. I went into the room which had been broken open, at the back part of the house, looking into a garden. The first thing, I observed the window up and down. It is a sliding window; the lower part was up, and the upper part down, with one or two panes of glass broken. A desk, close to the side of the window, was broken open, and the papers scattered under the desk. I missed two gold watches; one was a hunting watch, the other was a lady's watch, with a gold face, and a gold chain. I also missed from fifteen pounds to twenty pounds of silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind - A. Dollars, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences, and about the same quantity in gold, in a separate bag. The silver was in a bag, and the gold in a small bag in the large bag, with the silver. I then opened a blank pocket-book, in which I kept a number of private papers, in which I had, I believe, fifteen hundred pounds, in bills of different description, but I only missed a ten-pound bank-note, and five or six Uxbridge country bank notes. That was chiefly the property that I missed out of that book. I then went into the dining-room, from the parlour door I went in. It had been broken. When I got into my dining-room I perceived the whole of the plate was taken from the sideboard, and a candle left burning in the room; it was burning then. I omitted to state that there were three great coats taken out of the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss the key of the street door - A. Not then, I afterwards did. It has never been found since. I have never recovered any of the property whatever since. I think it was the most dreadful stormy night that we had the whole season.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You was not the last person up at night, were you - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>COURT. You lost property out of the house to a considerable amount - A. To the best of my belief to about two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH BROWN. Q. You are a relation to Mr. Hodder, by marriage - A. I am. I and the late Mrs. Hodder were the last persons up in the house. Before we retired to rest we examined the fastenings of the house. That was at half past eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the house secure - A. That part I am sure it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the part that you found broken open, can you speak to it being fastened - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By what part did the robbers cuter - A. They entered the back part, by the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. That you found was broken open - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you see that was fast at night - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I understood you to say, that you and Mrs. Hodder were together - A. Yes; we went up to bed immediately, we only examined the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, as far as you know, the other part of the house might not be secure - A. I examined the back parlour, and all the way leading to the hall was secure.</p>
               <p>Q. The other part you did not examine - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. The other part was the front of the house - A. And the back door, I did not look at them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that part which you speak to is the parlour which you found broken open the next morning - A. Yes. With respect to the back window, I saw it was secured.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. With respect to the back door and the front part of the horse, you did not - A. No. I made no observation on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you and Mrs. Hodder go to bed at the same time - A. Yes; Mrs. Hodder and myself went up to bed together, and went in bed together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect in the course of the night hearing any noise in the house - A. None in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house did you sleep - A. In the front two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>JAMES MOBBS. Q. I believe you are a groom to the prosecutor - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the night in September last year, in which the house was broken open - A. Yes. I sleep in the house, in the top part of the house. I went to rest about a quarter past ten o'clock. I got up in the morning about six o'clock. First of all, when I got out of bed, I felt a strong wind come underneath my bed-room door. There is a large sky-light, I thought it was broken. I found it was not broken, but I still perceived the wind as I went down. When I got to the bottom of the stairs on the right hand I perceived the parlour door. I then looked in the parlour, and there I saw the parlour all littered over with books and writing. I saw the window open; on the other side of the window I saw the gardener through the window coming to his work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive how the glass of the windows were - A. Two squares were broken of the back parlour window, the window that looked into the garden. I let the gardener in. I then went up stairs, and told my master. My master and I came down stairs together. My master sent for the constable of the parish; his name is Murray.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the dining-room - A. Yes; there was a candle alight upon the top of the table, and the plate was gone from off the sideboard. When Mr. Murray came I went to the stable to my work. It was quite light when I came down stairs.</p>
               <p>CHARLES MURRAY. I am high constable for the Uxbridge division. On the 17th of September I was sent for to the prosecutor's house. I went there between six and seven o'clock in the morning. I saw the window had been pushed down in the back parlour. It is a circular top window; the shutters go no farther than the spring of the arch. I found the window had been pushed down, the top sash. The fastening was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. The catch of the sash was broken - A. Yes. It would admit of a person getting over the shutters themselves. I found the mark of two feet upon a chair that stood under the window. I observed Mr. Hodder's desk broken open; it appeared to have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020045"></xptr>been broken open with a chisel. It had the mark on the top. A part of the lock had been forced up from the desk. I found a bit of a wax candle and matches; the matches have been used; and a mother-of-pearl button was laying on the floor. The button has no shank to it. I found the door that comes into the parlour from the passage broken open. It had been forced away, and open. I told Mr. Hodder to enquire if any people had been about the town of that description. I went to the Ram inn and made enquiry there. I enquired of Todds; he said, the ostler could give me information.</p>
               <p>JURY. We wish to know whether the inside shutters appeared to have been made fast - A. There is no doubt of it, because the fastenings were broken.</p>
               <p>JOEL WARE. - Mr. Gurney. This man has been convicted, and has received a pardon under the King's seal.</p>
               <p>Q. In September, last year, were you acquainted with the prisoners - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time where did Moss live - A. In a court in Fleet-market. Norman lived in Plumb Tree court, Shoe-lane; I lived at 24, Mitchell-street, Lisson-green, Paddington.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them make any proposal to you to go to Uxbridge - A. A few days before we went to Uxbridge, Norman and Moss came to my house, and we were talking about going in the country, and on the next day I went down to Norman's house, Plumb Tree-court, and Moss came there to Norman and me. They asked me if I would go with them to Uxbridge. Moss said, that he knew of a place that could be served very easily. I agreed to go with him. We agreed to meet at the Key in Fleet-market, at seven in the evening. We met there all three of us at seven o'clock in the evening,</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect on what evening it was that you all met there. How long was it before you went to Uxbridge - A. The night before we went off to Uxbridge we agreed to start the next day morning to go to Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it settled that you should travel - A. I was to ride with Moss in his cart, and Norman was to ride the poney. The poney was a borrowed poney. We had borrowed the poney a day or two before. I knew the poney to be borrowed for that purpose. The next morning we started from Plumb Tree-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in the cart - A. No. Moss was known by the Bow-street officers, and very likely, if they saw us go over the stones together, they might stop us, and search the cart, and enquire where we were going.</p>
               <p>Q. If the officers had searched the cart, what would they have found in it - A. The house-breaking tools, and therefore Moss went in the cart himself. It was not fit for me and Moss to be together, therefore it was settled that I should ride the poney, and that Norman should walk. In Oxford-road we met. Norman got up in the cart, and I followed with the poney. Then we went on towards Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop and bait on the way - A. Yes, at the Green Man, at Ealing common. It is a public-house just out of the way. We did not take the mare out of the cart; we stopped, and gave the mare and the poney their corn in a bin at the door, and then we went on to Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came opposite of Mr. Hodder's house did anything pass - A. Moss and Norman, at Mr. Hodder's house, were in the cart; I was behind on the poney. They pointed out Hodder's house to me. The house was on the left hand side from town. It was too soon to do business; it was in the afternoon, quite soon, between three and four o'clock. Then we went to a public-house on the right hand side, just on the other side of the bridge. We put the horses in there, and gave them some corn. We returned up the town on foot. We went on towards the market-house. We passed Mr. Hodder's house. I went and bought some walnuts. After we had seen the house we returned back to the inn, and asked if we could have tea. We went and took the horses and cart, and went to Rickmansworth. We went to a public-house just by the caual, kept by one Hubbard. We got there just before dusk, between six and seven o'clock. We put up there; we asked to to stay all night. They said, yes. We staid there all night. We had tea and supper together.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how did you sleep - A. We were all three to sleep in one bed, but when we got up to bed Norman and Moss went to bed together; they objected to my sleeping with them. I went into another room, where there was a bed. I slept in a bed in the other room. The house-breaking tools were in a handkerchief; we brought them in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they consist of - A. A dark lantern, a little japan case of phosphorus, and two little crows, (they go by the name of jemmys), and some skeleton keys. These were brought in the house in an handkerchief. Moss, when he went to bed, he took them up stairs; he had the care of them. We got up in the morning, and had our breakfast. In the course of the forenoon I took the poney and went about three miles to a sister of mine, and returned back to dinner. They remained there both of them, and when I came back we staid there till about six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember having any conversation with any person of the house - 
               <persName id="t18121202-62-person688">A. </persName>
            The landlord asked us what was our business, and where we were going to. We told him we were going to see the fight with the Black and Crib.</p>
               <p>Q. That is Molineanx and Crib - A. Yes; that took place at Stamford on the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Q. When you set off in the evening, was it said by any person which way are you going - 
               <persName id="t18121202-62-person689">A. </persName>
            There was a gentleman that came out of the door and said to us, we better stay, it being wet and windy. Moss said we would go on to St. Albans, and when he got there he knew the country well; and when we quitted the house we went over the bridge, as if we were going the St. Albans road. After we had got over the bridge there is two roads; we turned to the left, towards Uxbridge, the back way. We went to the Ram inn, Uxbridge. We arrived there a little after seven. We all staid there till about eleven, or a little after. There we had refreshment. Norman and Moss had mutton chops; I could not eat any.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020046"></xptr>We all drank rum and water. Then we all went out; Norman and Moss in the cart, and I on the poney, and turned as if going towards the bridge, and then turned round. When we saw the inn gates shut up we came back again, through Uxbridge, through a lane at this end of the town. We turned down the lane; a little way to the right. I rode up to the horse in the cart, and held the horse's head, while Moss and Norman got out of the cart, and broke open the gate, that led into a paddock. We took the cart into the paddock, took the mare out, and tied her to one of the wheels of the cart, and the pony to the other. Then we all went down she town, taking the tools with us. When we came to Mr. Hodder's house there was a light in the upper chamber, in the front of the house. We walked about a bit. We saw the light did not move, therefore we thought it was a night-light. Then Moss said, we had better go to the back of the house, as the light was in the front.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get into the garden - A. There was a little iron garden gate; we took the skeleton keys out of the handkerchief. Norman and Moss fitted one of the keys out of the handkerchief. They fitted the key to the lock of the garden gate, while I looked at the top to see that nobody came down. Then we went into the garden.</p>
               <p>What part of the house did you go to - A. The lower parlour window, at the back of the house, a very large window. Norman took out his knife, and cut a little away of the putty, to take out the glass, to push the catch back that fastened the two sashes together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you push the catch back - A. Yes; we pushed the catch back and the top sash was throwed down.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there inside shutters - A. Yes, but they did not come to the top of the window. It is an arch top; a kind of an oval top. The shutters did not come up to the top. There was room for one to get in over the shutters. When the sash was pulled down, after we got the window pulled down, Moss got up and broke a pane or two of glass with his feet, stepping over. Then we all went away. This made a great noise.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night did you say it was - A. A very dark, wet, windy night.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you quitted the window - A. We all went out of the garden, and pulled the gate to. We went into the street, across the road, on the opposite side of the house. We waited there a few minutes, and the watchman was crying one o'clock. There is a turning by the side of the house. The watchman went down the turning. Moss said, give me the pistol. The watchman went down the turning; he took no notice of the gate; he did not try whether it was fast or not, and then he went away. He went up towards the market house. Then we found the people of the house were not alarmed, they did not come down, and the light did not move, we went back again into the house, at the window. Moss stooped down; they helped me up. I got over the top of the window shutters. I was leaning over: they held my legs while I was unfastening the catch of the bar. I then opened the shutters and then Norman and me got over. We got a light from the phosphorus, and then we went to the parlour door that opens into the passage. We bursted the lock open with a gimblet. We opened the street door, and let Moss in.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the front door - 
               <persName id="t18121202-62-person690">A. </persName>
            Yes; it opens into the turning, not into the street. We shut the front door again. Moss bid us stand a bit, and he went up two or three stairs to listen if any body was moving up stairs. He come down stairs, said it was all right. We then went into the back parlour, where we got into, and went to a little desk that stood by the side of the window. We broke it open with a crow. We found a pocket-book with notes in it; there was one ten-pound bank note, I believe, and some Uxbridge notes. There was a bag with some silver, foriegn dollars, half-crowns, three-shilling pieces, and silver of all descriptions to the amount of, I believe, fifteen pounds. There was another bag, a little bag, in that bag, with about fourteen guineas in it, two gold watches, one a lady's watch, with a gold face, the other a hunting watch. We opened a drawer in the table in the same back parlour; we found nothing there. We then went to the front parlour; the door was locked, but the key was in it. We opened the door, and went in, and the plate stood on the sideboard, and such as were silver we put in the bag that we had taken with us. I held the bag open; Norman and Moss examined the articles, and such as were silver we put into the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they - A. A pair of silver butter-boats, n skewer, salts, some spoons, and a punch-ladle, and several articles of plate. These we put into the bag. We came into the passage and took three great coats, and then we opened the street door and went out. We pulled to the street door, locked it, and took the key away. We all went to the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you got into the window did either of you have an accident with a waistcoat - A. I lost part of a mother of pearl button from my waistcoat. The button broke off the shank, my wife afterwards put on a new button.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this pearl button does it match with the other buttons on your waistcoat - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you took a light in the house from the phosphorus - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you afterwards to light you in the house - A. A wax candle; they are two-pence a piece. We had two or three with us.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose, whether there was any left behind you do not recollect - A. No, I do not recollect. We went to our cart, and found it in the place where we left it. We put the mare into the cart; they two got up. I got on the poney, and rode on towards town. When we came about half way to town the mare knocked up. We took the mare out of the cart, and put the poney in. I rid the mare. We got into town just by five o'clock. We got into St. Giles's about five o'clock; it was just day-light. We went to Simons's house, in Crown-street, Seven Dials. There is a string left on the door to pull the lock back, so we can get in any time. We got in, and went up to Simons's bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he up - 
               <persName id="t18121202-62-person691">A. </persName>
            No, in bed. We knocked at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181212020047"></xptr>his bed-room; he came into his dining-room to us; he brought his scales and weights, and he weighted the silver.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the price - A. Plain silver he gave five shillings an ounce for; if there were crests and cyphers on them he gave four shillings and sixpence. I forget what it fetched altogether. We sold him some coin, and the three coats for one pound.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the ten-pound note - A. Simons looked at the ten-pound note, and I think he offered seven pound for it. We objected letting him have it, and I think Norman had it. He allowed something more than Simons would. It was reckoned about eight pounds. Simons bid ten pounds for the two gold watches; we would not let him have them. Moss said he would give more himself. Moss had them; he gave eleven pounds for them; he gave one pound more than Simons would give for them. Simons's boy took the mare to the Angel inn, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the mare remain to your knowledge at the Angel - A. Why, two or three days; that day and the next I know.</p>
               <p>Q. While she was there did you or either of the prisoners go to see her - A. We all three went in the morning. The ostler found fault, and said, that she had been used cruel. She came in without shoes, and looked very bad; her knees were broken, her bag was swelled. I milked some milk out of her; her bag was diseased.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, about the month of January, after this you left London - A. Yes, with Norman, and Norman and me were apprehended at Cheyneys. We were taken at a public-house in Cheshunt.</p>

               <p>Q. While you were there do you remember Mr. Hubbard, at whose house you had been at Rickmansworth, seeing you and Norman - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when you were so in custody, did you make a confession of this and other transactions to Mr. Bailey, the high constable, and then to the magistrate - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you have told me before that you had known for some time Moss and Norman - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever receive from 
               <persName id="t18121202-62-person692">Moss</persName>
             any information about tools - A. Yes; I heard him say that he had a little set of tools that fixed into one stock, but I never saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of tools do you mean - A. Centre bits, for house-breaking, that would cut a bit out of a shutter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I observe you have got a good memory - A. Middling.</p>
               <p>Q. You are speaking of a transaction now, in the month of December, of a transaction that took place in September twelvemonth, that you know - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been examined to it - A. Twice. I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you told this story to different people - A. To two magistrates. I do not recollect mentioning it to any body else.</p>

I could not do a great deal of business lately; I have been in trouble and confinement. I worked for my father just before I was apprehended; three years ago. I was then apprehended for house-breaking.</p>
               <p>Q. And was brought here and tried - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had sentence of death passed upon you, had not you - A. Yes.</p>

On the next day after the men left my house I heard of the robbery, and these men were at my house the day before the robbery. They came to my house on Tuesday evening, two of them in a chaise-cart, and one on a little black poney. They came in my house on the Tuesday evening, and went away the next evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they stay with you all the next day - A. They were in and out of the house. They slept in my house on the Tuesday night.

I believe the poney was a little black stallion. I saw neither name or number on the cart.</p>

The night Mr. Hodder's house was broken open it rained very hard, and they ordered the horse and cart out, and the poney. It was then pretty near six o'clock. I went out and said, gentlemen, it is a wet-night, you had better stop another night, as you were here last night. They told me they did not mind the wet they were going to see the battle between Crib and Molineaux, and if they could reach as far as St. Albans that night they should do very well. They went towards Rickmansworth, and I saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they quitted Mr. Hubbard's, as if they were going towards St. Albans - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 5th of October, I was at Croydon-fair, in company with Bishop. We there saw the prisoner Moss, and took him. I told him then that he was charged with different robberies, in company with Norman, and others. He said directly, he knew he was in my custody, he should behave himself as a man, but he knew nothing of the charge of felony. On the Thursday following, I, in company with Bishop and my son, went to a back one pair of stairs room. I had every reason to believe it was Moss's lodging. The house was No. 8, I think. The door was locked. My son went in, and opened the window before we proceeded to search that room. I and the other officers brought the things away that we found there.</p>

               <p>Armstrong. I found this pistol, tinder-box, and this little square box, it contains a number of implements; they go into one and the same stock.

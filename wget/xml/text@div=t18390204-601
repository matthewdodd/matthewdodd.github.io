                  </hi>. I have a sister named Honoria Maria. In 1835 she was residing with her parents, at Galway, in Ireland—the prisoner had been acquainted with her before she lived at Galway—he used to go to the Roman Catholic church to confess to the priest—my sister was a Roman Catholic—I was present when she and the prisoner were married according to the rites of the Roman Catholic church, by the Reverend Father Peter Healey, curate of Kilrea, at his house—that was the place where Roman Catholic marriages were ordinarily performed—there were other marriages performed there at the same time—the prisoner continued to live with my sister, from time to time, for about three months—we then lost sight of him, and were not able to trace him—my sister came home to reside with her friends—she had one child, which is now three years old—in 1838 I came to London, and found the prisoner at the Portland Arms, in Long-lane—I had another young man with me—I brought the prisoner out to his first wife, and he received her very kindly—he said if he had only three halfpence, he would give one to himself, another to his wife, and another to the child—we had heard about the second marriage, and asked him—he said he had lived with a woman in London, but was never married to her—my sister lived with him again in London for about three weeks, and then a discovery took place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was not married by a priest, it was a friar. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, it was a Roman Catholic priest—he officiated in a place of worship—he used to read mass very frequently.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> They sent me tipsy to the priest—he would not marry us, and then they set the friar tipsy—they gave him three bottles of whiskey. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> It is false, he had none at all—the priest did not say he would not marry you—I did not tell him you were going to America—the priest was paid 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for marrying them—the prisoner was about twenty-two years of age, and my sister about twenty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> No, he was only paid 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was all the money I had—I was not, twenty-one—I wanted four months of being out of my time—I did not receive some money that was coming to me on that account.</p>

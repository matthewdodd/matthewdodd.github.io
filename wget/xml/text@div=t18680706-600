I am the wife of Johann Heinrich Panning—I did live at 30, Grove Street for a week, a year-and-a-half ago—in February, 1867, I brought an action in the County Court against Heinrich Dersen, and recovered 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I employed Lammers as my agent—I have not received any money from the Court—I never gave authority to either of the prisoners to receive the money for me—Nemia told me that Hersen had paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into Court for me—she did not say she had received it; she told me that afterwards—she did not tell me she was going out of the country, but last year she made a voyage to Bremen; and when she came and told me about that, I said I wanted to go to Lammers and see about the affair—she hesitated a little, and then said, "Well, I must tell you I have fetched that money"—she then went to Bremen—I did not see Lammers again till last October, when I met him at a beer-shop in, White<lb></lb>chapel—I asked him how it was about the money, for Nemia had told me she had fetched it—he told my husband and I to come to him next morning—we did so, and instead of taking us to the County Court to see about it, he took us to the house where Nemia lived, she having returned at that time—he asked us to remain outside whilst he went in—he came out and said he could not get anything—I said "Then I must go and apply somewhere else"—he said, "If you do that, I shall go and swear that you said you owed Nemia 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that she kept the money for that"—being in service I did not see Lammers again till three or four weeks ago, when I saw him in the street; I spoke to him, but he would not be spoken to—I did not see him again—I went into the hospital after that, and when I came out Nemia had moved, and I could not find her.</p>

I said, 'I know it is, I was present when Wallis got it; you must go and tell her to come with the plaint note, and take the money.' I was speaking to Wallis in the passage. Nemia said, 'I can take the note.' I said, 'Well, there is the money office.' She went in, and came out with the money.

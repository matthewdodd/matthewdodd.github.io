                  </hi>. I live at No. 31, St. George's New-town, Southwark. On Monday, 30th Oct. I was in company with Elizabeth Hazle at a public house—I don't know the sign of it—the prisoner and Nelson came in, and we afterwards went together to another public house—there was some quarrelling there—we took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> from there—there were five of us got in; the prisoner, Nelson, my companion Elizabeth Hazle, a man I knew as an Irishman, and myself—we drove into Mint-street, where Hazle lived—we had some drink there, and they quarreled again—the Irishman and Nelson were quarrelling first—Nelson then called Brown a son of a b—, and told him that he was no mate not to take his part—I believe they were ship<lb></lb>mates—Nelson then caught hold of the prisoner by the collar or handker<lb></lb>chief, until he was nearly black in the face—upon that I ran for the police—I left the Irishman and the two men in the room—when I came back I heard an Irish girl who lived in the next room, Mary Ready, halloo out that he was stabbed—I went into the room and saw Nelson lying dead on the ground; he was bleeding—there was only Brown, Nelson, and the Irishman in the room—the deceased was lying on his side and a dagger was sticking in his neck; I pulled it out and put it in my pocket, and afterwards gave it to the policeman—when I left the room I left Brown on the bed nearly strangled by the deceased—I can't say that the Irishman was drunk, but Nelson and Brown were very much in liquor.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I went into Hazle's room on 30th Oct., between 3 and 4 o'clock—I saw the man, Nelson, on the floor, and the prisoner holding him by the hair of his head with his left hand, and a dagger in his right hand—I tapped him on the shoulder, and said, "Bridle your temper, and don't spill blood on a shipmate"—he did not say anything—Nelson was then lying on his back, with his head against the door—I saw blood upon him—I tapped him on the shoulder, and said, "Mate, you are stabbed," and found that my hand was covered with blood—I saw a wound in his neck—I did not see any weapon in the neck—the prisoner had it in his hand—I saw no blow struck—fie was bleeding from the neck—I went down stairs, and met sergeant Davis at the door of the house—I saw no weapon used.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Harrow-street, Southwark, in the same house as Hazle. On 30th Oct., I saw the prisoner and two other men there—I did not notice them when they came in, but I saw afterwards that they were drunk—I saw them standing up against the mantel-piece, and I thought they were fighting—I heard the deceased say to the prisoner, "You son of a b—;" (that was after Hazle was gone)—he said he was no son of a b—; he said, "I will fight you; I will fight the best of the two, but don't let the two of you come on me together"—I saw the deceased come up and hit him with his right hand in the left breast, and knocked him on the ground—the deceased afterwards stooped down to hit him in the face, and the prisoner caught hold of him with his right hand and said, "Don't hit me while I am down," he then pulled a dagger out of his left hand pocket, and stabbed him in the neck—I only saw him do it once—I then ran into my own room, rose up the window, and screamed out "Murder!" and "Police!"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the deceased using the prisoner with great violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and calling him very bad names—he hit him three times before he chucked him up against the bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am senior surgeon of St. Thomas's Hospital. The deceased was brought there, between 4 and 5 o'clock, on 30th Oct.—he was then very drunk—I examined him, and found a wound on the left side of the nape of the neck, about one inch long; a wound on the back of the blade bone, on the left side of the spine, which was the important wound; a deep wound in the left loin; a superficial skin wound on the outside of the left knee, and two other superficial wounds—he died from wound of the lung—the wound between the spine and blade bone penetrated the lung—I found that afterwards, on a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I have no doubt that was the cause of death—it is very probable that that wound might have been inflicted by a person lying below him, by striking round him over the shoulder—this dagger might produce such a wound.</p>

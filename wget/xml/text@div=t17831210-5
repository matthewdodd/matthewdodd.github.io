               <p>What is your master? - He carries on the business of a silversmith, he kept a pawnbroker's shop, he left off the pawnbrokery business; I asked them what they wanted, I said, it was too soon to disturb my master, Horne said, he had a gold watch to sell, and two rings, I told him he might leave them with me till my master was up; they left them with me and returned in about an hour and half, then I went up and called my master, he came down in his morning gown to the foot of the stairs, and I shewed them to him, he bid me ask them what they asked for them, they said, twenty guineas for the watch and rings; he told me to bid them four guineas and a half; which they agreed to take; my master gave me the money to pay for them, I came down and I paid them, and they went away.</p>
               <p>What became of them afterwards? - I do not know, my master bid me put the watch safe up and take particular care of it, till he went to give information to Mr. Clarke.</p>
               <p>Did you know who the prisoners were and their names? - Yes, I had seen them once or twice before, I had drank with Horne before, I knew him by name, but not the other.</p>
               <p>Your master knew them I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he know where they lived? - No.</p>
               <p>Then how could he give information? - Mr. Clarke found out where they lived.</p>
               <p>Had your master bought things of them. before? - No, Sir, not as I know of, I never saw them at our house before.</p>
               <p>How came he to think of giving information after he had bought these things? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester, Council for Prisoner Kennedy. How long had the melting pot been off the fire that morning? - I do not know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Do not you, why Henry Lee No. 19, Petticoat Lane, is known as well as any person in this Court; well then the crucible had not been on the fire that night? - I do not know what you mean.</p>
               <p>Why what does your master melt his plate in? - He does not melt any.</p>
               <p>He buys it all ready made, does he? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is he by trade? - He deals in the silversmith trade, he buys any thing that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100024"></xptr> he can come honestly by, he will shew receipts for every thing that he has bought.</p>
               <p>Where is the receipt for this watch? - I do not know about that, we have no receipt for that.</p>
               <p>He is not here? - He did not think he should be wanted.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived with him? - Two years and a half.</p>
               <p>During that time upon your oath you have never seen any plate melted in that house? - No, Sir, none at no time.</p>
               <p>And as to the goods that are bought they are bought in an open way? - Yes, Sir, I can mention several working silversmiths that he buys his goods of.</p>
               <p>He buys all kinds of goods you know, he is not very nice? - It is nothing to me.</p>
               <p>You are present, are not you? - No.</p>
               <p>Oh, he does not trust you with that; however Clarke knows him very well. - Very likely he does, he knows him to make a discovery of many things.</p>
               <p>You knew the watch was gold? - Yes, it was bought as such.</p>
               <p>What were the rings gold? - One was a mourning ring, and one an enamelled white head.</p>
               <p>There was a seal to the watch and a string? - Yes.</p>
               <p>All for four guineas and a half, that is the honest way your Master deals. - That is the way he dealt for that.</p>

               <p>PRISONER HORNE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never saw this man Donnedy but once before; he then said, that the gentleman in the red coat sold him the watch; he made a remark of the young man in the red coat, and Sir Sampson Wright asked him once or twice. I will leave it to the gentlemen whether they did hear him or not.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Adey how is that? - Donnedy swore that the man in the light coat gave him the watch; the one had on a blue coat and a red cape, and the other a brown coat.</p>
               <p>Court to Horne. Have you any witnesses? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Kennedy. I leave it to my Council.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner Kennedy called three witnesses who gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, the fact with respect to the prisoners rests on the evidence of Donnedy; there is no doubt but Mr. Adey's watch was found on Lee by his information: Donnedy and Lee certainly stand under circumstances of particular discredit; and it is evident what sort of a house Lee keeps; and if the circumstances respecting Lee had come out any other way than they have done, I should not have hesitated to have bound over Donnedy an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178312100025"></xptr> evidence to support a prosecution against Lee as a receiver.</p>

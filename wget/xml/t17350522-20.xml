            , unbolted the Door, and presently five Men rush'd in with ten Pistols, each of the Men having one in each Hand, I cannot say positively that the Prisoner was one of them, but there was a Man among them pretty much like him. They swore they'd kill me, if I did not give 'em my Money. They took out of my Pocket a Guinea, a six-and-thirty. Shilling Piece, and between ten and twenty Shillings in Silver. They broke the two Buttons off my Breeches and let them down. They took me up Stairs, and said they wanted more Money. They broke open a Door there, and took out two Guineas, ten Shillings, a Silver Cup with two Handles, four Gold Rings, and three Silver Spoons - they had taken another Silver Spoon below Stairs - still they wanted more, and swore they would kill me if I did not tell them where the rest of my Money was. My Breeches being down, they set my bare backside on the Fire. I was not burnt indeed, but sorely scalded. They took a Case Knife, and threatned to rip me up, and brought a Bill to chop my Legs off to make me confess. They carried me into a Back Room where the Maid was beating up Butter, they took the Kettle off the Fire with two Pails of Water in it, and throwing me down, they threw the Water all over me, but it happened not to be quite scalding hot. My Son had in the House between twenty and thirty Pounds which was all lost - They took my Sheets, Table Cloths, Napkins, and all the best Linnen I had - They broke my Head with their Pistols, so that the blood run down and matted my Hair, and swore that I should not live till Morning if I did not discover where my Money was - One of them had a Linnen Cloth over his Face, and they had pull'd up the Capes of their Coats - At their first coming in, they broke a Fowling Piece which they found in my Room, and before they went, they said they'd go and serve my son Joseph just as they had served me, and bid my Boy shew them the way to his House; but I having another Son who was not come home, they were afraid to venture after they had staid three Quarters of an Hour for his coming. They then tyed my Hands and Legs, and the Hands and Legs of my Man and Maid and Boy, and so leaving us lying upon our Backs, they lock'd the Door and went away - They took from my House in Money and Goods to the value of about sixty Pounds.</p>

             at the Black Horse Inn in the Broad Way, Westminster, where my Horse and Gregory's stood. The Prisoner told us he had worked at Edgware, and had shod this Farmer (the Prosecutor's) Horses, and that he was worth a good deal of Money, and it was by his Advice that we went thither. The Prisoner and I, and Rose went out first; Turpin and Fielder follow'd, and overtook us on the Road; we drank two or three Pots at the Bowl and Skettle on the Hill on this side Edgware. Thence we went to the Queen's Head at Stanmore, where we drank Beer, and eat Bacon and Eggs for Supper. We set out again between six and seven. I believe it wanted but a small matter of seven, and so rode into the Farmer (Lawrence's) Grounds, as I suppose they were, and tyed up our Horses within a Quarter of a Mile of his House. Hearing the Boy calling up the Sheep, we staid a little and then went forward, and Fielder jumpt over a sort of a half Door and seiz'd the Sheep-boy, and tyed his Hands, and bid him go to his Master's Door and knock, and answer to any Body that asked who was there. He knock'd, a servant Man open'd the Door; I and Rose and the Prisoner had two Pistols each, but I think that Turpin and Fielder had but one a-piece. We all rush'd in; we bound the Boy again (for we had unbound him) and then we bonnd the Man and the Maid. I stood over them, while the others carried up the Old Man to make him shew them the House. All the Money that I saw was three Guineas, two Half Crowns and eighteen Pence. The Prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173505220011"></xptr> came down to the Maid, and said, Damn Ye, shew me where your Master's Money is. She made him a Curtesy, and said, she did not know. But he made her go up Stairs with him: And when she came down, she cryed; I asked her if any body had beat her; she answered, No, But one of your Men has lain with me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she say by force?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I did not hear her say so. We put the Linnen in Sacks - the Plate I believe they put in their Pockets - and carried all to our Horses. We came home about eleven, and next Day we divided our Booty. Rose gave us fifteen Shillings for all the Linnen, and he likewise bought of us the two handled Silver Cup, three Gold Rings, three Silver Spoons. but I can't say now for how much; and Mrs. Rose made them off for him. The Prisoner, as we were going home, told us, I believe twenty times, that he had lain with the Maid in the Garret.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say by force?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. He said, he bolted the Garret Door, and laid a Pistol on the Bed while he lay with her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't deny that I was with them at the Prosecutor's House, but I had nothing that came from thence, for they were taken that Day sennight.</p>
               <p>Wheeler. He was with us when we divided the Money, and had his part, and perhaps more than I, for they cheated me in every respect; so that out of sixty Pounds, I had but four.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I ought to have had my share of whatever was taken - though I cannot say that any thing was taken, for I went no farther than just within the Door where I stood to watch.</p>
               <p>Court. But when they went away, Did you see no Sacks carried out?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Not to my knowledge.</p>

I did not see them take the Goods, for I and the Man and the Boy were tyed in the Parlor. But then the Prisoner came and said, I should go up Stairs with them. Wheeler went formost, and the Prisoner took me up after him into my Master's Room, and they said, they'd Rankshattle in that Room. Wheeler went to the Foot of the Garret Stairs and would go no farther; but the Prisoner swore that he would go up, and he forced me up with him into the Garret, and there he swore he would lie with me. I told him I was a young Girl, and knew nothing of the matter; but he bolted the Garret Door, and swore if I would not yield, he would kill me; and so he threw me on the Bed, and laid one Pistol upon the Bed, and another on a Chest just by, and forced me.</p>

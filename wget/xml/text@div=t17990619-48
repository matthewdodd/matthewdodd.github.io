             sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness: I was at the lodgings when the prisoner came, she went into the closet, I was in my own room; the door was locked, and the key in the door; she packed up a great many things, which are here; I found the door open, I gave it a push, and found there was a woman in the room; she said she came to enquire for Mrs. Riley, a barrow-woman, and that she had got a drop too much; she then dropped a bundle; she did not say what she was going to do with them.</p>
               <p>- COTTRELL sworn. - I opened the door when Mrs. Adams alarmed me; the things were in the closet, they were packed up in a bundle; I saw her take the knives and forks out of her pocket and convey them into the bundle she had packed up. (The property deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going out to Kensington to enquire for a day's work, and I met a woman who told me there was a woman who could tell me of one, I went to make enquiry and forgot the name; I went up into this house, and was really saint, and very ill, I put my hand to the door to support myself, and the woman came out and asked me what I wanted; I told her Mrs. Riley lived there; she said I came to rob her; I made answer, I had no property about me; immediately she made an alarm, and that woman came up, and a young fellow; I asked her to let me go; then something dropped off the chair, and he took up some knives; they took me up, and took a pair of boots, and stockings, and other things, and produced at Bow-street, but the parcel has increased very much since.</p>

I live at 1, Eaton Place, Wandsworth—on Wednesday night, 22nd August, I was serving at the bar of the " Wardell Arms, " kept by Mr. Clark, at Wandsworth—a little before six Murphy and Wilson came in—Wilson called for a pint of sixpenny ale, and put down a florin—it looked very dirty, and I showed it to Mr. Clark—he did not think it was bad, and threw it into the till, and said, "That is all right "—there were not any half-crowns or florins in the till; not any money at all—they both drank of the ale—after that the other prisoner came in, and wanted a smoke or a pickwick, I am not sure which he said—that was not more than a minute after the others had gone out, I think.</p>

I am landlord of the " Wardell Arms, " Wandsworth—on the 22nd August I saw Murphy and Wilson in my bar—there are three doors, and they were in the third—the last witness was serving in the bar, and she put a florin in my hand and said, "Here is a florin; it is a very dirty one, but it is a good one"—I said, "All right," and threw it in the till, which was open—I should think were five or six shil<lb></lb>lings and some sixpences in the till together—there was no other florin—as I was going out through the trap I turned my head and saw the two prisoners, and I thought they looked rather suspicious—I went out, and was back in ten minutes—I went to the till, took the florin out, put it in some water, and it came bright—I went half-way to the station and came back—over half an hour after I heard the prisoners were locked up—I took the florin out about ten minutes after the prisoners went away—I marked it and gave it to the inspector, and saw the inspector give it to the constable.</p>

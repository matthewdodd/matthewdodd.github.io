                  </hi>. I am gardener to Mr. Wilson, of Wandsworth-common. On the evening of the 29th of July I heard a scream, went to the pond, and found the prisoner and her two children in the water—the little boy (Alfrey) was then endeavouring to keep the children's heads above water—I assisted, and got them out—the children were placed one on each side of the prisoner—one was tied to her body with a shawl, but in my flurry I did not see whether the other was or not—the prisoner was lying on her back in the water—it did not cover her face at that moment—she was very much exhausted indeed—the only thing I heard her say was "My children," in a very low tone—I got them all out of the water, and they were conveyed to the workhouse—I untied the knot of the shawl—it was a double knot, by which the children were fastened to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It was the mother's scream you heard, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was the four screams—the whole of them screamed—I did not par<lb></lb>ticularly distinguish the mother's scream—the place where I saw them was very shallow at that particular time—some parts of the pond are deep—the part where they were is not more than a foot deep, and for a considerable distance round—I think she was not sensible—she was very much frightened indeed, her hands and finger-nails changed quite into a blue state—the only thing she said was, "My children," so very low that no one but myself heard it I think—I assisted in taking her part of the way to the workhouse, but could not maintain my strength to carry her all the way—I know nothing of her circumstances, or of the man French, or of her having been in a place of confinement, only from what I have heard.</p>

You need not trouble yourself in seeking after me, for I don't mean to have any more to do with you or any other woman at present. I will do what I can for the children; (God bless them!) but unfortunately it is out of my power at present to do any more than I am sending. I have had to walk a great many miles in seeking employment; whereas if you had let me have been at T. Morison's a little while longer, till I had got into work, which I had a good prospect of summer work; whereas if you had let me be, we might have been comfort<lb></lb>able now. But where is the man that will stand the hunting as I did, which you are now hunting me night and day, and actually drove me from my native land, where I meant to be, unless I have to come, on particular occasions, to Wandsworth. Make up your mind for industry; and throw off that inde<lb></lb>pendent spirit which is your enemy. If you have any thing to say to me you can send word by J. Cremer, where I shall be, at his place, one day in the week, as I have little or nothing to do. No more at present. Adieu.</p>

               <p>The Prosecutor (a plain Country Man) depos'd, That he and another mistaking their Way, asked at the Gate of New-Prison, if there was not a Thoroughfare, for they wanted to go to Islington; upon which, the Man at the Door let him in, and immediately a Woman seiz'd his Hat, and two Men, the Prisoners at the Bar, shov'd him into a Dungeon, where they unbutton'd his Breeches, tore down his Waistcoat, and took away his Money mentioned in the Indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Caddie depos'd, That he saw the Prisoners take hold of the Prosecutor and dragg'd him along, saying they would shew him the back Way to Islington, that they carried him into a Place, where they had not been long, but they ran out, and that this Deponent complaining of the hard Usage of the Countrymen, Shaw, the Under Keeper laugh'd at it; but when this Deponent found that the Prosecutor was robb'd of his Money, he very generously stood by the innocent Countrymen and complained of them to the Head Keeper, who threatened the Prisoners, but could not get them to confess the Fact.</p>

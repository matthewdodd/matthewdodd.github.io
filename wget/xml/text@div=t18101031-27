            . I am a fruiterer in the City-road. On the 1st of September, in the morning about seven, I saw two baskets of peaches and nectarines exposed to sale in Spitalfields market, I asked Cracknell who they belonged to, he said, the person they belonged to was gone into the city, he believed the price was five shillings a basket, but he would not venture to sell them untill the owner came; during this time, Norris, the prisoner, came up and stood against the post close by, I knew him by sight perfectly well, I immediately went to purchase some other fruit, and turning round, I saw the prisoner with the two baskets of fruit on his arm; they were the same baskets; he was then nearly behind Cracknell's cart; I went up to him and asked him if they were for sale, he said no, he had just bought them. As I never saw him buy fruit before, it astonished me very much; I instantly went to Cracknell and informed him of it, we both concluded they were stolen, we did not think ourselves authorized to stop him. When the prosecutor came, I informed him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner - A, He went behind a row of carts and disappeared.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been thirty five-years in Spitalfields market, and always got my bread in an honest way; I was in the market every morning afterwards, and was not taken untill a month afterwards.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

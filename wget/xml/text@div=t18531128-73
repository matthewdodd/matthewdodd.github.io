About 3 o'clock in the morning, on 25th Oct., I was on duty in Percy-street, near the premises of Mr. Wells—I observed the street door of his house was unfastened, but it was put to, as close as it could be—I rang the bell, and knocked—I went in the house, and went up stairs; I met Mr. Lancaster on the first floor—I searched the house with Mr. Wells—I went down in the kitchen, and found the window had been broken into—the hinge of the shutter had been broken off; the bar had been forced out, and bent—the window was shut down again, and the shutters put to, as close as they could be.</p>

On 25th Oct., about 3 o'clock in the morning, I heard the noise; I heard the rap at the door, and on coming down I found the last witness in the drawing room—Mr. Wells and the other members of the family were present—I examined the secretary in my room; it was wide open, the lock having been forced—I immediately missed this cash box (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I cannot say whether I had seen it the night before, or the day before, but I am in the habit of seeing it every day, and opening it—there was 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money in it—there were six 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, thirty-three sovereigns, and 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 100 bonds in the Mexican and South American Company—they were all in the box the last time I saw it, the day before—I never opened the secretary without seeing the box.</p>

On 25th Oct., about 3 o'clock in the morning, I was disturbed by the ringing of the door bell, and the knock—on coming down, I discovered the policeman, Avery, in the passage—I accompanied him over the house—I went in the kitchen—the window had been forced open; the bottom hinge was broken off—most of the things in the kitchen had been removed—the hinge had been a strong one; very great force must have been used to break it, and an iron bar was bent—I should not think one person could have done it—I missed the whole of my silver, I should think to the value of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or it might be more—I lost a silver watch, an opera glass, and a gold eyeglass—I was the last up in the house—I did not go down stairs, but the door was secured with two bolts, three locks, and a chain—the other rooms were safe.</p>

On the 11th of November, I was out with my basket and bread—I left it against the Red Cow, and went up a little street to serves customer, and when I came back, my basket and ten loaves were gone—I did not know where it was gone till the Monday morning, when I saw Morgan, and he told me he saw the prisoner with it—I found the baskets week afterwards—it was my master's basket—I saw the prisoner just be<lb></lb>fore he took it, and spoke to him.</p>

On the 11th of November I was coming through Cut Throat-lane, and saw the prisoner with a basket on his back, running—I thought there was something in the basket—I called to him—he nodded and went on—on Monday morning the prosecutor met me, and I told him what I had seen—I went after the prisoner on the Monday, I found him, and asked him whether he was in work—he said, "No"—I said, "Were you when I saw you going with that basket?"—he said, "Yes, at Mr. Wittenburg's,</p>

On Tuesday, the 15th of March, I fastened the stables up - there were four geldings and two mares three. I went to the stables about half-past three o'clock in the morning of the 16th, found the lock of the door broken to pieces, and laying on the ground - three geldings and one mare were gone; another horse had been untied, and tied up in a different place; that horse was marked in a particular manner: the mare was in foal. I saw two of them on the Sunday following, and two on the Monday, one at the Plough public-house, Mile-end, and one at the Nag's Head, public-house, Whitechapel, in care of the officers.</p>

            . I keep the Sun, public-house, at Lemsford-mills, Hertforshire, about three quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's. On the 15th of March, about six o'clock, the prisoner came to my house with another man, by the Hitchin coach; they had a flag basket, which they threw down off the coach, and something rattled in it like iron; they came into my house, staid about an hour, and went away about seven o'clock, up the road which leads to the prosecutor's. On Friday, the 18th of March, I went to the Plough, Mile-end-road, and saw the mare in foal - I knew it very well to be Batten's; I knew all his horses. On the Saturday I went to the King's Arms, public-house, at Bow, and saw a horse called Black Jack, in possession of Butcher; I knew it, having sold it to Batten. I found two more of Batten's horses at work in Mr. Rayment's field, at Bethnal-green.</p>

            . I am hostler at the King's Arms, at Bow. On the 17th of March, about half-past nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came there, in company with another man, with three horses, and a mare in foal, brought them into the yard, and left the mare in foal and one horse with me, for the night; next day he came for the mare - he said he should either come or send for the other, and if he sent he would send a note in the name of Williams, with the money for the keep of the horses, and told me to let nobody have it, and not to let it be seen if I could help it, till he came or sent for it. I saw the same mare at the Plough, at Mile-end, on Saturday morning - I have since seen the four horses at a stable in Whitechapel, (I think the Nag's Head,) and knew them again: they were the same. Clark claimed the one which was left with me, as Batten's. Clark and Batten were present when I saw the four horses.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know the person who came with him? A. No. Most that was said was by the prisoner - I do not recollect the other person saying anything: I know the horses very well - I did not know them before; I believe them to be the same. He came for the mare next morning, and took it away with him; I knew him before, but did not know his name. On the Saturday the other horse was claimed; I delivered it to Clark; it was one of the three which the prisoner brought.</p>

            . I live in School-house-lane, Ratcliff, Middlesex. The prisoner, to the best of my belief, is the man who came on the 18th of March, in company with another, and brought two black cart horses; he said he understood I wanted to buy two, and he thought they would suit me; I looked at them, and thought they might suit me; he said I might take them, and put them to any work I liked for two hours; I said I always expected to have them on two or three days trial - he said he had heard my character, and was not afraid to trust me, and I should have the trial if I gave him 10 l., and when he came up from the country he would call for the rest, or return the money if I did not like them; we were to meet at the Red Lion, public-house, in the evening, to tell him how I liked them; I went there about seven or eight o'clock, but did not meet him or his companion - I went again next day, but did not see them. I saw a notice up in that public-house, offering a reward of 20 l. for some stolen horses. They never came to me for the horses or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190007"></xptr>money. Clark claimed them on the Saturday morning, and the prosecutor claimed them; I delivered them up by the Magistrate's order, to Jeffries and Judge, the officers, in the prosecutor's presence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Will you swear positively to me? A. I really believe him to be the man. When I first saw him he was dressed decently; I did not see him again till he was in custody; his dress was altered then; I was not more than half an hour with him, and have no doubt of his person.</p>

            . I am carman to Mr. Rayment. - The prisoner is very much like the man who brought the horses to him - I was about five minutes in his company, and heard him speak; I saw him at Worship-street, and heard him speak there; the voice was the same: I believe him to be the man.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BATTEN. On the 15th or 16th of March I lost three geldings and a mare with foal. I afterwards went to the Plough, at Mile-end, and saw the mare in foal; I saw my horse the next morning, at the King's Arms, at Bow; Butcher was there - it was one of the geldings I lost. I saw the other two in possession of Rayment. The geldings were worth 90 l., and the mare 30 l.</p>

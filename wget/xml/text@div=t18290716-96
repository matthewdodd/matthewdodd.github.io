On Wednesday, the 15th of July, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was there; while I was engaged in a cause, the officer came in, and told the Master of the Rolls he had taken a man, whom he suspected of stealing a hat; I looked round, and missed my hat and gloves - I went, and saw the hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you any initials in the hat? A. No; I would not venture to swear to it - I would not swear to my own hand-writing; there were other hats there.</p>

            . I belong to Bow-street, and attend the Lord Chancellor's Court. I was on the alert outside, and saw the prisoner go into the Rolls Court, and sit in the window - he had a hat on when he went in, which I particularly remarked; in about half an hour he came out with another hat, and a pair of gloves; I said, "That hat does not fit you very well." and he said his own hat had laid by the side of the gentleman's; I took him into the lodge, and he owned it was not his; I found 6s. on him, and the duplicate of a hat - this is the hat the prisoner left in the Court. and which I believe is the one he went in with.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you said, "This is not your hat," he owned to it? A. Yes; he said, "Mine lies there," and it did; the hat he had on came over his eyes - it did not at all fit him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was desired to put on the hat, which seemed to fit him extremely well.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Rolls Court. I saw the prisoner go into the Court with this old hat; within half an hour he came out - I went, and said that was not the hat he had on when he went in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you ever make a mistake in your life? A. I may; the prisoner did tell me where to find his hat - he said it had laid on one side where the others had been; he did not say he took it by mistake.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was entirely a mistake; I should have returned it in a moment. I have been in the habit of attending Courts for seven or eight years; I was intended for a very different character to this.</p>

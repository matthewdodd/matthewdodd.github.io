                  </hi>. I am the master of a schooner. On the 29th of May I came to London on business—I saw the prisoner that afternoon near Lon<lb></lb>don-bridge, with a boat, and I engaged him as a waterman to take me on board my schooner—I got in his boat to look for the vessel—we could not find it, and he rowed me back—I asked what he would take me to Greenwich for—he said 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we then went to have a pint of beer, and I thought I would stop till my vessel passed—he said he would wait no longer, and I paid him the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he then said I might as well give him the preference to put me on board my vessel when it came—the vessel did come, and he put me on it—I told him to come up, and I would settle with him—he would not, but he pulled off with my coat in his boat—on the Friday following I saw him in a public-house—I asked what he had done with my coat—he said he had pawned it—I said he had put himself to a great deal of trouble, when he might have had his money at first—I gave him in charge the next morning—this is my coat.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Lamb's-buildings, Limehouse. I saw the prosecutor about eleven o'clock at night on the 29th of May, when he was about to take water—he and the prisoner staggered down the shore, and the captain tumbled over a boat—I was about to pick him up, but he got up, and they went off—I saw the prisoner come back, but I did not go to his boat—he is regularly at those stairs—on the following morning I heard from two or three, who were standing at the stairs, that the captain had left a coat in the prisoner's boat, and if I saw the captain I was to remind him of it—I saw the captain on the Friday—he did not appeal to me, but he sent a person I knew very well to find the prisoner.</p>

I am pot-boy at this public-house at Limehouse-hole-stairs—the prosecutor and prisoner were drinking there on the Monday—they had six pints a-piece as near as I can tell—on the Tuesday morning the prisoner came and had a pint of beer—he said, "I put the captain on board, and he would not pay me; if you should see him, tell him I have got his coat safe enough"—on the Friday evening the captain came with another man, who went out, and brought in some waterman, and said, "Captain, is this the man who has got your coat?"—the captain said, "No, it was an older man"—I then said I saw Campion, and he said he had the coat—the man that was with the captain got up, and says, "He has, has he? do you know where he lives?"—I said no—a man named Sykes said, "I know where he lives," and the captain said, "I will give you 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to fetch him," which he did—they stopped together till about eleven at night, and had some pots of beer.</p>

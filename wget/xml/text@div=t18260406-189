            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Goswell-street. On the 28th of February, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner pawned this coat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ROBERTS. Q. Was it dark at the time? A. I had lights there - he went into one of the boxes; there were other persons there - he stopped about five minutes. I had frequently seen him before, and am certain he is the same man; another man was pawning a coat - the prisoner spoke to him - he did not appear to be pawning the coat for him - this is the ticket I gave.</p>

            . I am the officer. I went to Mr. Bath's shop to take the prisoner, one Friday in March, about eight o'clock in the morning. I found the duplicate of the coat and some others upon him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he say he pawned it for another person? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to a public-house on the 28th of February, and a young man had a coat for sale - he wanted 12s. for it; I said, "I have not got 12s., but if I can get 8s. lent on it I will give you 12s. for it," which I did. I went on Friday morning to pawn a waistcoat, and the pawnbroker said the coat I had brought was stolen - I said I did not steal it.</p>

Yes, at Ratcliffe-cross: On the morning of the 27th, I was walking through Church-lane between the hours of eight and nine o'clock, and I passed a waggon that appeared to have one sack taken out, and the cords were loose; I turned round to look at the horses, and I saw a sack thrown up; there was the prisoner and another man at the horse's head; when I got up to them, I said, have you been selling a sack of coals, lads; he said, no, it was a customer his master served; I thought it probably might; I mentioned it at the Coal-exchange to Mr. Turnbridge; I have seen the prisoner about the streets a great many years; I never saw an improper thing by him before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 69.) I was on duty at Rattle-bridge on the 26th of November—the prisoner came to me, and said he wished to give himself up for stealing a coat, in Gravel-lane, from a Custom-house officer; and when he got to the station-house he told me he pawned it, op<lb></lb>posite Whitechapel church—that is where Mr. Aaron lives—he said he wished to give himself up, he did not wish to get into further trouble, and that he came out on Sunday evening with the purpose of committing another robbery.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been escorting a man to his home who was in liquor, and they treated me and gave me money—I then met the pro<lb></lb>secutor, he staggered against me—I said, "My friend, the pavement does not seem to be wide enough for you"—he said he had been with some friends—I said, "Make your way home as quick as you can"—he said, "I am a public officer, I have got 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I am going to get a drop of beer"—I said I should go and have a drop—I went in, we drank a pot of beer, and half a pint of gin—I related my case to him that I had no where to go, that I had been nineteen years abroad, and when I returned I bad not a relative alive—he took me down to his box, and said he would give me a warm place for the night—we went down, he relieved the officer, and then</p>

               <p>he took a book, and entered in it "mid-watch," and signed his name—it was then two o'clock—the officer he relieved said to me, "You are a rum Jim"—I went into the box, the prosecutor gave me this coat to put on, and he buttoned it up—"Sit there, my boy, (says he,) and keep yourself warm for the night"—this he will have to answer for before the great tri<lb></lb>bunal—I gave him some money to go and fetch some beer for his kindness, and I gave him a handkerchief to put round his neck—he absconded, and I saw no more of him till four o'clock—I thought he had gone to some public-house with my little money which I gave him—I went in pursuit of him, but could not find him—I strolled away till I came to Mile End—I saw allseed fixed to a public-house—I sat down there and fell asleep—when I awoke, it was day light—I went and got a pint of beer and some gin—I went on and met a man, who said, "That is a good warm coat you have got on? "—I said, "Yes," and told him how I got it—he said, "If I was you I would go and pawn it"—which to my shame and sorrow I did—and this is the first time I was brought before a bar for any thing; and here is a man who comes to swear away the liberty of an honester man than himself—now what do you think of this—I submit my case to you. and bow with submission, humility, and respect, to your verdict.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. It don't stand to reason that he should leave it in the box and go walking about without it—he has perjured himself, and at the great day of judgment it will be seen—he will find out he has been guilty of perjury as sure as ever a man trod in England—I thought he had a better conscience, but it seems his conscience is asleep—I would have had the landlady here, and his brother officer, that he relieved, if I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I am captain of the Argosy, belonging to Mr. Friend, of Plymouth; she is a British ship sailing under the British flag—on 14th January last she was at Port Adelaide, Australia—I there shipped the prisoners as able seamen, Ryan as boatswain—I paid them wages in advance; Clifford and Leverson 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and Ryan 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they joined on 4th February—on 11th, as I was going ashore in the boat, I saw the point of a knife sticking through the stern of the ship—on the 12th Leverson came and wanted to know what I was going to have done to the sides of the ship—I asked what he meant—he said the ship was making water—I told him she was thoroughly staunch and strong and in every way seaworthy to perform the voyage, and he should attend to his duty and not interfere with mine—after that a note came to my hands which Leverson had written to the merchants; I showed it to him and he acknowledged that he had written it—this is it. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: “To Messrs. Caner and Gay. Gentlemen—Having been informed that a member of the firm visited the schooner Argosy to draw the conclusion of the amount of water that vessel made, I think it my duty to inform you that he has been trumped, and in this manner; after the survey was held yesterday afternoon, the captain made great haste to shift the cargo to take the list out of the vessel so that the seam that made water might not be under water. I must also state that there are several butts which you can stick your knife into as far as the hilt; all round the stern you can see daylight through the seams. If you wish to assure yourselves of the ship make a thorough examination of her. Yours truly, Incognita.”) I consider that the ship was fit to go to sea—there is the surveyor’s report there; she was a new ship—she was surveyed the day before by two surveyors, and they reported her thoroughly seaworthy—on 18th February, about 6 a.m., we were in the Adelaide roadstead, off the semaphore, three miles from the shore; Ryan came to me on the poop and said “Captain, I want to go ashore”—I said “For what purpose? ”—he said “I am sick, and I want to see the Magistrate”—I told him he should go to his duty in a quiet manner—he repeated “I want to go and see a Magis<lb></lb>trate”—I told him that I was the Magistrate there—he thereupon struck me with his right fist—I took hold of him with both hands and said "What!</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060045"></xptr>
               <p>you strike me?"—I called Cousins, the mate, who-was to leeward of the mizen mast, and told him to hold Ryan till I got the handcuffs—Cousins took hold of him and he struck me again—I gave him to the mate and went and got the handcuffs and put them on him, and he went forward—about 8 a.m. I sent the mate forward to tell Ryan to come aft to me; the mate returned and told me he would not come—I then walked forward and said "Ryan, I want you for a few minutes, please"—he began to abuse me; he said he would murder me and used other imprecations and expressions that I cannot remember now—I then went aft and went ashore in the boat and sent a police officer on board to arrest Ryan—he was taken before a Magistrate and a sentence was passed upon him, but I requested that he should be sent on board, and he was sent on board under arrest—he had been boatswain up to that time, I then disrated him, and put William Glanville in his place—the ship sailed on 20th February—on the 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. t Ryan was continually using threatening expressions upon myself, the ship, and those in charge—on the night of the 26th a quantity; of cooking utensils were thrown overboard, and we stopped the coffee; that was not as a punishment, coffee was served afterwards; through the cooking utensils being thrown over we could not or did not serve any more, unless we had put extra labour on the steward; the men had the allowance of coffee served out weekly and they could make their coffee if so minded in a pannikin; the coffee pot was thrown overboard—on 4th March I found that the flying-jib had been cut away—on 6th I spoke to Leverson about steering badly—I requested him to keep the ship her course, she was ranging off her course from 1 to 5 1/2; points—he replied with a lot of cool insolence, I cannot recollect the expressions; I have forgotten; this <hi rend="italic">educated</hi> insolence we don't understand, not to keep it in our heads for a con<lb></lb>siderable time—on the 10th I again requested him to keep the ship her course—he said she would not steer—I said she would, and told him to put the helm down—he did not do it at first; I ordered him a second time and he did not care to do it then, and I put it down myself—on 24th March Ryan was in charge of the wheel, he ran away from the wheel, leaving no one there, to aid and abet Leverson to fight with West, another seaman—. the mate sang out to him to go back; he did go back in about two minutes—on 23rd April, about 2 a.m., when we were off the Cape of Good Hope, the mate told Clifford to haul tight the lee jib sheets—Clifford told him to go to hell—I went to see how the compass was, and as I returned I saw the mate on the deck scrambling towards me—Nash, the steward, came out of the cabin, and I gave the mate into his charge; he was bleeding; he made a complaint to me—on 11th May, at I am., I went forward and found Clifford asleep; he should have been on the look-out—I woke him up and cautioned him that that was no sort of a way to keep a look-out—he said he got up every five minutes or so—some time after that, after we had passed the line, in consequence of a complaint the mate made to me, I went forward to Ryan and asked why he did not attend to his duty in keeping a look-out—he said he did keep a look-out—I said the house was no piece to keep a look-out in, and asked why he was so insubordinate and insolent to the mate—he said he would plug the mate's nose—on 10th June I heard him say to the mate "You old b—, if you came here again I will take you by the breeches and throw you overboard"—Ryan was at the wheel and the mate was walking the poop, and went aft to look at the compass—on 28th June,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060046"></xptr>
               <p>at 10.45 a.m., I was awoke by a disturbance on deck—I went on deck, and Ryan came running aft, saying that Clifford had threatened to murder him, and he wanted me to put Clifford in irons, saying "That is the man that cut your jib, captain; that is the man that struck the mate"—Clifford replied "That is the man that was going to sell your hawsers, captain; that is the man that cut the ropes" (speaking of Ryan) "and threw things overboard"—in fact, he said a great deal which I cannot remember now—I told them to go to their duty, and at 12 o'clock I would give them a hearing—at 12 I could not call them; but at 1.30 I called them aft to know what their com<lb></lb>plaint was—they had very little to say; I could not give you the exact words; I think it is in the log, but I would not be certain—the ship arrived in London on Saturday, 6th July, and the mate, in my presence, gave Ryan and Clifford into custody—Levereon was given in charge on the Monday through the declaration made by Jacobson—he had previously left the ship—I was at Arbour Square, and heard Jacobson make a statement before the Magistrate there; it was after that that he was taken into custody—during the voyage from Port Adelaide to London the mate made complaints to me on several occasions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Leverson was not at Arbour Square for the purpose of preferring a charge against me—I have received three summonses for assault, not at that time, it was some time after—Ryan was one I was summoned for assaulting—Leverson might have been one; I really can't remember; I took very little notice of it (<hi rend="italic">There were five summonses produced, three for wages due</hi>—25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to Leverson</hi>, 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d. to Clifford, and</hi> 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to Ryan—and two for assaults on Leverson and Ryan</hi>.) The Magistrate declined to hear those summonses until this case was finished—I did not stop anywhere on the way from Port Adelaide to London—I did not stop at St. Helena; we went close by; it is in our course—I did not think it worth while to make any complaint there—I took provisions on board there—I did not make any complaint or mention the matter to any one—I was not justified in making any complaint—I did not choose to stay there—the harbour-master came on board—Ryan and Clifford were given into custody directly we arrived at St. Katharine's Docks, as soon as we were alongside and the ship was fast; the mate gave them in charge to a policeman—it was on 12th May that we were off St. Helena—I did not let go the anchor there—before the surveyors came on board at Adelaide I did not give Ryan orders to shift part of the cargo in order to get a defective place above the water line and alter the list of the ship—the surveyors suggested that the ship had a list, and I spoke to Cousins to righten her—the surveyors sealed the pumps in order to see whether she made water—the stevedores had left her with a list on her—she did not list all the way from Adelaide—it was a very little list; it was only just to shift a few bags of cargo—there was not a quarter of a plank under water on one side more than the other—she might have had a list of an inch or three-quarters—Ryan did not say why he wanted to go ashore and see a Magistrate—he did not complain that the ship was unseaworthy; she was perfectly seaworthy—we had to pump every two hours throughout the voyage—I thought that necessary for the protection of my cargo and to get my ship home—she might have been making an inch and a half of water an hour—it was a private leak that had been in the ship since she was new—I have since had her in dock and had the copper stripped off, and we found a small bolt-hole in the bilge: that was where the water</p>

               <p>came in: there was no other source—I never assaulted any of the men on the voyage, or used bad language to them—I am not in the habit of using bad language—I never used bad language to Jacobson, and never assaulted him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The surveyors came on board on two occasions at Port</p>
               <p>Adelaide to survey the ship; the list was discovered on the first occasion and was corrected before they came again—they came the second time through the letter Leverson wrote—I could not say exactly what water she was making then; it is entered on the surveyor's certificate; it was very little, nothing unusual—the crew consisted of myself, the mate, steward, and six able seamen—I could not have navigated the vessel with only three able seamen—I can't say whether I could have shipped hands at St. Helena, I never was ashore there.</p>

                  </hi>. In February last I was mate of the Argosy—I kept the log and entered there what occurred every day—I have my log here—on 18th February, at 6 a.m., I saw Ryan strike the captain; he wanted to go and see a Magistrate, I don't know what for—I had heard him say three or four days previously that the ship was unseaworthy—she did make a drop of water in Adelaide, 4 3/4; Inches in 18 hours—he said he wanted to leave the ship because she was unseaworthy—the captain told him he could not go now as he was ready for sea—he struck the captain with his right fist and the captain called me to get the handcuffs and put on him—I held him and the captain went and got the handcuffs—he did not struggle while I held him—at 8 a.m., in consequence of instructions from the captain, I went to Ryan in the forecastle—he had not got the handcuffs on then—I told him to come aft, that the captain wanted him—he said he would not, and if the captain came there he would brain him—I went and reported to the captain and he went forward, and Ryan said he would brain him if he came nigh him—next day, after returning on board from the Magistrate, he refused to set the anchor watch; he refused to do anything in the ship, and hoped his right hand would drop off if he did—he said then or the next time that if he had two men to join him he would take charge of the ship altogether—on 7th April it was my watch on deck from 8 to 12 p.m.—about 11.30 to 12 o'clock the wind shifted, and we were setting sails; Clifford, Leverson, and West were on deck, and Ryan was standing at the door—Jacobson was inside—I told him to set the mainsail before we went below; he declined to come out of the forecastle—I went in and told him quietly to come out and set the mainsail, and he struck me, and the other two joined, and then Leverson joined them—Clifford said "Now is your time to drive your knife through him"—I was knocked about and scarred about the face; I felt a prick of something, but it was dark and I could not see—Jacobson struck me with his fist, I could not say who else struck me, I was right among the gang, they were all round me—after that they went to their duty—on 21st April, at 2.20, I and Clifford were engaged in stowing the jib and coiling the ropes, and I ordered him to hold tight the flying-jib sheet; he grumbled and refused to do it—I asked him three times to do it, and he then came and struck me with his fist in the face; then Ryan joined in and struck me three times in the face with his fist, and as I was going off Clifford struck me with a belaying pin and knocked me on the deck sense<lb></lb>less for three or four minutes—when I came to my senses I scrambled up on my knees and met the captain as I crawled to the mainmast and he took</p>

                  </hi>. I was an able seaman in the Argosy—when we were off the Cape of Good Hope I remember having a conversation with Leverson and Clifford in the forecastle; Ryan was present, and Tom West was in his berth asleep—Ryan and Leverson said "We are going to kill the captain and the mate, the steward and the boatswain, and cut Tom West's throat when he is asleep"—Glanville was boatswain at that time—I can't tell the date of this. (<hi rend="italic">The captain stated that by the log it was the</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st April</hi>)—that was all I heard then—about two days after I was at the wheel—I came forward, and the three persons were on the fore-hatch yarning about the same thing; they said they would kill the captain, mate, steward, and boatswain, and take the ship into the Bay of Bahama and sell her—they wanted me to join—I went aft to the wheel—I heard them going on several times at it for about a week—they were on deck growling at each other—Ryan and Leverson threatened to knock off my face and one thing or another—about six or seven weeks afterwards I heard a quarrel between Clifford and Ryan—I could not make it out; Ryan came on the poop and told the captain that Clifford had cut the jib, and Clifford said that Ryan was going to cut West's throat when he was asleep—they accused each other.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Cousins came to me in the forecastle one night about 8.30 and pulled me out—he had an iron belaying pin in his hand, and tried to strike me with it, and Clifford took it away from him; I was growling because he had kept us up when it was our watch below; we had only eight hours' sleep out of twenty-four—I cannot remember any other occasion on which the mate used violence towards me; I have got a bad memory—the captain used violence to me one morning when I was steering; he said "Where are you going to?" and he struck me on the cheek with his right hand closed, and kicked me and called me a Dutch son of a w—I called Clifford and Ryan as witnesses—I am a Norwegian—at the end of the voyage Clifford was doing something to the fore rigging and talking to Ryan, and the captain came up and told them to go on with their work; Clifford said "All right"—the captain said "It is not all right, it is all wrong; you are one God d—n Cannock and Liverpool shoeblack"—one morning the captain sent Levereon from the wheel, and he went forward to the forecastle, and the captain came forward and struck him with his fist and shook him as hard as he could—he wanted him to go to the wheel again—I and Ryan and Clifford had just turned in, and it woke us up; it was about 4 a.m.—one night Ryan said he was sick, and went to the captain for some medicine—the captain gave it him, and Ryan went and sat down in the forecastle, and the captain came forward and said "Come out here and haul down the stay<lb></lb>sails"—Ryan said "I cannot do it, I am sick"—the captain said "If you won't stand on your legs I shall stand you on your head, and stop your supper"—Ryan then went aft and asked for some bread, and he would not give it to him the first time—Ryan went and did his work then; the captain called him on one side, and they were yarning, but I could not make out what about—the captain carried about a revolver with him; I saw it sticking in his breast pocket that night; I could see the butt-end of it; that was the only time I saw it—before that he said he would put the ship under martial law; he said that several times, and so did the mate—one morning the captain said he would shoot Ryan; he said he would mark him for life—I did not see the revolver then; that was about the middle of the voyage; he had called us out of bed at four o'clock, and we complained of our breakfast getting cold—at Adelaide the captain said to me "I shall give you ten shillings if you will tell me who took the irons off Ryan, and tell me what is going on on the passage home, and after we get to London I will give you an introduction to the owner, and he will give you a few pounds"—the con<lb></lb>versation on 21st April was between Ryan and Levereon—they were speaking rather loud—it was after supper; we had tea and biscuits, no grog—they seemed to be in a passion because the captain had been growling at them the night before about reefing the mizen—the steward was in the galley—I could not say whether the people in the galley could hear them—the second time they were whispering—the captain was always growling at one thing or another—everything the mate used to tell us we had to do it twice over; the captain said it was wrong, and would make us take it to pieces and do it over again—West was asleep in the forecastle when the first conversa<lb></lb>tion took place—if he had been awake he could have heard it; he was a friend of the captain's, a fellow-townsman, and was treated by him as a friend all through the voyage; he used to be in the cabin with the captain almost all day, and dined with him, and the captain used to give him pickles and one thing and another; he was favoured above the rest of the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The second conversation took place about forty-eight hours after the first—I heard the captain and mate threatened on several occasions—one day the captain was going to take Leverson and Clifford for<lb></lb>ward and lash them to the windlass and ropes-end them—the two occasions I have named were the only two on which I heard the prisoners threaten to kill the captain and mate—I have seen the prisoners since their committal—I visited them once in prison.</p>

I am living at the Sailors' Home—I was one of the crew of the Argosy—while I was on board I never saw the captain ill-treat Clifford, Leverson, or the other men—I remember Ryan being taken on shore at Port Adelaide—a few days after he came on board again—he had a conversation with me; he wanted me to join them in many matters; he said "West, why are you with them aft?"—I said "I am neither on one side or the other"—he said "Why don't you be with us?"—I said "No, I am going to be on the right," and I advised him to do so—he then went away—I never heard the captain threatened.</p>

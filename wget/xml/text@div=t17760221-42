               <p>On the 14th of February, as I was going home, just by the Green Dragon I saw three or four men together; one of them went to Alexander's cart, which stood opposite the Green Dragon gate, took out a tub of grease, and carried it over the way to the prisoner; I went and told

             a man had taken something out of his cart, and immediately pursued the prisoner; when I came near him he threw down the tub and ran faster; I called stop thief, and he was taken.</p>

               <p>I was going along Bishopgate-street; the last witness called stop thief, and they laid hold of me; he said I had dropped a tub of grease; that he saw a boy take it out of a cart and give it me; I asked him why he did not stop the boy, and he could give no answer.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called a witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

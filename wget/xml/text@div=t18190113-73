            . I am a corporal of the 79th regiment. The prisoner was in the same regiment. On the 29th of November, at eleven o'clock, I put him on sentry at the front gate of the barracks - he was to remain sentry until one o'clock, but would be on guard until ten o'clock in the morning - the guard was stationed in the guard-room in the yard - no person could get out of the front gate without his knowing it. There was another sentry at the back gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. Where is the key of the riding school kept - A. In the orderly room, which is not locked, anybody could not get in. I relieved him off sentry at one o'clock; he lodged in Seymour mews. He could have gone there, and returned in about a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 29th of November I was on duty in Seymour mews, which is a quarter of a mile from the barracks. I saw a soldier going down with something on his shoulder. I do not know what it was, it looked like a box, and was about the size of that produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that person - A. The prisoner, I knew him before. I saw him come back, and suspected him to be the same man, and told him it was not a right time to bring a box down, he said they were in a hurry to go to Windsor - I saw no other soldier. He had no box with him then. I was a quarter before one o'clock when he returned, not when he passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How was he dressed - A. He had regimentals on; it was about a quarter before one o'clock when I saw him with the trunk. I did not know him then - he returned in about five minutes.</p>

            . I am a corporal. I went to the barrack-yard, about eight o'clock on the Monday morning that the portmanteau was missed. I examined the list to see who was on guard that night; I suspected the prisoner, and went to search the stables in Seymour mews, where he had the care of his master's horse. Lieutenant Greaves is his master - the stables are rented by the regiment; only his master's horse stood there - the prisoner did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130039"></xptr>sleep there. We found the portmanteau in the loft over the stable, covered over with hay - we broke the doors open; the prisoner occupied the loft at the time. I took it to the barracks, and shewed it to the watchman, in the prisoner's presence, between ten and eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There were only the prisoner's and his master's horses kept there, that I know. I found two dead rabbits in the loft.</p>

             re-examined. I had the key of the gate - he could not get out at the gate. He might get away without getting out of the gate, as many have done, without being seen by the sentry - the wall is not high.</p>
               <p>- I am a coachman. I saw two men take their horses out of that stable about eight o'clock on the Monday morning. The prisoner had the care of the loft. There were two keys to the stable door, which hung up for the men to take. They were soldiers.</p>

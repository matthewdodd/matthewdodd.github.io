                  </hi>. I am in the employ of George Harker, merchant, of Upper Thames-street—the prisoner was a porter there, and had the care of the upper floor, where the pepper is kept in two bins. On 28th Nov. I went to one of the bins which he had charge of, and beside the bin I saw two bags; I did not open them—I went again on the Thursday afternoon, and one bag was gone—I went on the Friday morning, 29th, at half-past eight or nine, and there were two—I went again at twenty minutes past twelve, and the two were there still—at half-past twelve the prisoner came down to dinner—I then went up again, and there was only this one bag(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw it opened at the Mansion-house—it contained pepper—the other bag was similar ta this, and about as full.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Mr. Harker. On 29th Nov. I saw two bags at the side of the pepper-bin, at twenty minutes past twelve o'clock; this produced is one of them—the pepper on that floor was under the prisoner's control—I saw the prisoner, about five minutes after, take up one bag, and put it into his hat—he put his hat on, and walked away—I was on a platform above him, where he could not see me.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner was my porter—the pepper was on the upper floor, which the prisoner had to keep clean—on 29th Nov., at seven o'clock, as the men were going away, I called them together—the prisoner was among them, and I asked him what he took away in his hat when he went to dinner—he said, "Nothing"—I told him one of the men had seen him put a bag into his hat, and take it away with him—he said he did take some pepper in his hat, in a bag—I asked what he had done with it; he said he had taken it to his lodgings, and I should find it in a bag, in a drawer, in his bedroom—I went with a policeman to his lodgings, I think, in Seward-street, Goswell-street, and in the drawers found the bag containing 3lbs. of pepper, and another in the same drawer containing 61bs. or 71bs.(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—one of these is marked "F," similar to the one before produced, and the pepper is similar to that which was in my bin—the prisoner had no right to take pepper from my ware-house—I have a person named Berbier in my employ—an attorney appeared for the prisoner, before the Magistrate, and Mr. Berbier was asked for.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Drew, of College-hill. Thompson was minding the house; I heard of her lose between eight and nine o'clock on Sunday morning; I went and found the prisoner in Shoe-lane, where he lives - I had given information to his master: I went for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100085"></xptr>an officer, and on returning found him with his master at the corner of the court where he lived; the officer took him back into the house, and asked where the watch was-he denied all knowledge of it; the officer refused to take him in charge in the morning - I went in the afternoon with another officer; he then took the watch out of his sob, and I caught hold of it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner, and in crossing from Plough-court, Holboru towards St. Andrew's watch-house, he called Jones - I saw something pass from him to Jones; I saw him take it from his sob - I caught hold of it; it was this watch.</p>

I worked at Mr. Drew's, and was several times in the kitchen; I saw the watch under the cover, with the key hanging out - something tempted me to take it; I kept it, but did not mean to steal it; I wore it on Sunday, and meant to return it on Monday morning - I denied having it on Sunday, because I meant to return it: in the afternoon I put it in my pocket, and meant to go to Mrs. Thompson's with it; Jones said he would do nothing in it if I would give it to him, and I did; If I had wished to steal it I could have made away with it.</p>

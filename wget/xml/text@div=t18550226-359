                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, of No. 9, Artillery-passage. About half past 6 o'clock on the evening of the 22nd Feb. I was outside my shop, putting up the shutters—there were people about the shop who were all for plundering and thieving, and as fast as I could put up my shutters they pulled them down again—I saw some of them taking things out of my shop, and missed two cheeses—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—I did not see the prisoner till a policeman brought him back.</p>

I was on duty and saw the mob—a constable laid hold of the prisoner within a few yards of the shop, and he knocked him down—I had not seen the prisoner before that—I followed him a few yards further, took him into custody, and found this cheese under his coat—this large hole in the side of my hat was made by a large brick which was thrown.</p>

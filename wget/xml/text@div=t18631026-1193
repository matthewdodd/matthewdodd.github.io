               <p>his head. I was then turned round to the light. I coughed, and he looked at me again, and said, "I think that is the man." They refused to take his evidence at the Mansion House because it was so slight, but on the second occasion, when it was fixed upon his memory by previously seeing me, he said that I was the man, and this is supposed to have happened six weeks before. I am in a consumption, and am travelling the country for my health. The boy only recognised me by my cough. On the second occasion I bought a <hi rend="italic">Shipping Gazette.</hi> He could not give me change, but he went and got it. I walked with him to Bow lane, and had the opportunity of running away, for he left me, and went across to three gentlemen standing outside a public-house, and had five minutes' conversation with them. One witness has told you that he took a bad crown and paid it away again; is not one person as likely to do so as another? I am perfectly innocent.</p>

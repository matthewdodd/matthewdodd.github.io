On the 23d of October, I went with Mitchell into the City, and at five o'clock we were going to Drury-lane Theatre, we went to a house (I do not know the name of the place;) when we got inside, the prisoner Sullivan said to Mitchell "I know you," and asked him up stairs - he went up with her, and I went up with Turner; we two were in a room by ourselves - she demanded 4 s., which I gave her; she then asked for another shilling, and I gave it her - about that time Sullivan came into the room, and said she wanted 1 s., and if I did not give it her, she would knock my brains out, and tear my coat off my back - I gave her 1 s.; Turner then demanded another shilling, which I gave her - Simmons then came into the room, saying she was mistress of the house, and asked for 2 s. 6 d. for the room, I said "If you will let me come down stairs to the street door, I will give you what money I have about me" - Then Sullivan and Turner demanded 2 s. 6 d. each, more; I said, "Let me go down, and I will give you all I have" - they would not agree to this, and the two women knocked me down - Simmons was present then; one of the two women laid hold of my neck, by thrusting her fingers into my cravat - I called out Murder! to my friend, he did not come - I heard one of the three say, they would throw me out of the window; one of them put a chair against the door, I asked them to let me go down stairs. In consequence of their violence I gave 14 s. 6 d. to Turner and Sullivan, and they let me go down stairs - Simmons then opened the door and let me out - I do not think she had any of the 14 s. 6 d.; when I got down, I found my friend alone.</p>

               <p>Q. Simmons did not attempt to keep you in the room - A. She let me out when I gave the 2 s. 6 d. and the 14 s. 6 d. - she did not put the chair before the door; I did not want to go for an officer, for fear of my character, but my friend took me to Bow-street - I never sent any message to them that I would go to Gravesend, some people came to me.</p>

            . I am a planter, and lodge with the prosecutor. I went with him to Drury-lane, intending to go to the Theatre; we had dined together in the City, we had two pints of porter between us, and a glass of rum and water - we were going to the Theatre, it wanted a quarter to five o'clock when we got to Drury-lane, we sauntered about and went to several courts; he pointed out a house in Swan-yard, and said, "I knew a young woman, named Mary Ann, who lived there, I wish you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240014"></xptr>would ask if she is there now, as I am a foreigner," he said he knew her as a lady's maid; I went to the door, which was open, I knocked with my hand against it, and four or five women came up from below; I asked for Mary Ann, they said she did not live there; one of the women said she knew me, I said that was strange, for I had not been in England for eight years; Baytiste stood by the stairs, one of them caught hold of him and went up stairs with him; I went up stairs to follow him, but when I got up, I saw no more of him - I went up to the second story with Sullivan, I said, I thought my friend was there; I had no money, and did not wish to go with her; she said I had better go down stairs and wait till he came, I did so, and sat down in the room on the ground floor; I heard him call me before he came down, he said, "Charles! Charles!" three times; I did not hear a cry of Murder! - when he came down he said he had been robbed; the women were present; there was a good deal of talking, I could not hear what was said; he said he would not leave till he had got his money. I told him he would never get it by waiting there, and went with him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. AIKIN. Q. What planter are you - A. Of sugar canes. I told Sullivan I had no money, she said my friend would pay her, I said, I knew nothing of that - Baptiste called out to me while I was down stairs, nothing passed about his having no money - I do not know what became of Sullivan, I was down in the parlour, he did not call her up; I heard feet shuffling about - it is a small house, I think if he had called Murder! lustily, I should have heard him; when he came down, he said he had been robbed of 2 l., but on coming out, he found he had a sovereign and two or three shillings left; then he reckoned his money, and said he had given them 13 s. 6 d. in silver, and 13 d. in copper; he said he was robbed, and had given them money, that one demanded 2 s. 6 d., another 3 s. and 1 s. and another 4 s.</p>
               <p>Q. When he called out Charles! if you thought he wanted assistance, you would have gone to him - A. I did endeavour, but Kelly was in the parlour, and said, If I tried to go out, she would tear my liver out - I got hold of the door to open it, she prevented me, and said she was in the family way, and would swear her life against me - I said, I was not going to fight with her, and sat down; I was detained in the parlour about five minutes, Baptiste came down soon after he cried for me.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN MORRIS. I am a constable of Bow-street. The prosecutor came to me, I took him to Swan-yard, and found them all (the prisoners) at the house; the last witness pointed out Kelly, and the prosecutor the other three; he said, in their presence, that they had robbed and beat him up stairs.</p>
               <p>TURNER'S Defence. Two gentlemen came and asked for Mary Ann, we said she was not there; he said, "You will do the same, let us go up, we went up," he wanted us to do wrong, but we refused.</p>
               <p>SULLIVAN'S Defence. We were down at dinner, Mitchell asked if I knew him, he said, "Come up stairs," and offered me 2 s., I said that was too little, he said his friend would pay me; he did as he liked, I went down and he gave me 1 s.; I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>KELLY'S Defence. The gentleman came into the parlour, and being a stranger, I was in care of the parlour; he would pay nobody but the landlady for the room, she went up for it, I remained in the parlour, the man went towards the door, and I said he should not go till his friend came down, if he did, I would tear his coat, he pushed me, I said, "Don't, for I am in the family way."</p>
               <p>SIMMONS'S Defence. He sent word that he would pay nobody but me, and I went up.</p>

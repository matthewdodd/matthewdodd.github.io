            . The two Prisoners, and Jemmy Tripland, and I were drinking at a House in Stepney, where the Prosecutor was drinking too; about 10 at Night he went to the Door, and we followed, though with no Thoughts of robbing him; for we had a Design upon another Man who was going over the Fields. But the Prosecutor sitting down upon the Bench at the Door with some others, he told them, that he had not spent all his Money yet, for he had enough left to pay for a Crown Bowl of Punch. Upon hearing this, we concluded that he was the fittest Man for our Purpose. It was not long before he got up, and went away in Company with 3 Men and 2 Women. We followed at a Distance till his Company parted with him, and then mending our Pace, we came up to him in Sun-Tavern-Fields and stapp'd him; we took some Half pence from him, and his Hat and Wig, and Coat and Waistcoat, and Shoes; we knock'd him down, and Osborn stabb'd him in the Hand, and so we left him, and were going quite away, but Osborn said, Damn him, he knows me, I'll go buk and give him another Stab; and so he did. As we were going off we met 2 Men who went towards the Prosecutor, I followed them as far as to where the Prosecutor lay, and asked what was the Matter, they said, Matter enough; a Man had been robb'd; and so I left 'em, and went again to my Companions. Osborn pull'd off his own ragged Coat, and left it in Stepney-Fields, and put on that as we took from the Prosecutor. His Wife afterwards sold the Coat and Waistcoat in Chick-Lane, but she would never tell us what she did with the Hat and Wig. I was apprehended first, and on my Information the others were taken up.</p>

It was then near half an Hour after Eight in the Evening. Presently several Sticks were about my Ears.</p>
               <p>Court. Several? Panton. Yes, I was attacked by three or four Men. Court. Did the Prisoner strike you? Panton. Yes, he struck me first, and several times afterwards, and the others laid me on as well as he, but don't know any of the others; I made what Resistance I could, upon which one of them swore, Damn him, Does he Rebel? Cut his Eyes out. At last I was knock'd down, and lost my Watch and 4 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Court. Which of them took your Watch and Money? Panton. I don't know, I was fast. Court-Fast ? Panton. Yes, I had no Senses left, I lay upon the Ground like a dead Calf. Court. Was it dark? Panton. No. Court. Was it Moon-Light? Or were there any Lamps? Panton. Neither, but being in the open Field it was Light enough, I could see his Face as plain as I do now, and he own'd the Money before Justice Philips, but said he knew nothing of the Watch; and that if there was a Watch, his Companions had sunk it from him. Sunk is a Term of Art among them for conceal'd.</p>
               <p>Mr. Philips. When the Prosecutor was before me, he said he believ'd the Prisoner was one of them, but was not positive. He described the Prisoner to be such a sort of a Man, but could not then swear to him directly.</p>

               <p>Mr. Philips. The Prosecutor is a little mistaken in that particular, I did not say that the Prisoner told me that he had the Money, but that one of the Gang, who was in Newgate, told me, that the Prisoner told him that he had the Money.</p>

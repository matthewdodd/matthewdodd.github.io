                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I attended the deceased, and attended the Coroner's inquest on his body—the prisoner wait present during the proceedings—he was not sworn nor examined as a witness—I believe the coroner's clerk took down all that passed—the prisoner came forward to the coroner and said, "I admit I have committed an error"—there was an adjourned examination—this was at the first examination—the de<lb></lb>ceased's wife was examined that day, but I was not—I cannot say whether the coroner or his clerk took down what the prisoner said—he said, "I cannot deny having sold the tartaric acid by mistake, and I am sorry for it"—I do not recollect his saying how it happened—his brother said he could not deny its having come out of his shop—I was called to attend the deceased on the 7th of Dec, and attended him till he died, which I think was on the 10th—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, but I was not present; but from his symptoms my impression is, if tartaric acid was taken in such a quantity as an ounce it would cause death—the symptoms were such as would arise from an over dose of tartaric acid—I do not, know the prisoner—his brother keeps a chemist's shop in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the College of Surgeons. I attended the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the 19th of Dec, before the Co<lb></lb>roner sat. The intestines were inflamed, congested, and red; the liver and kidneys enlarged—judging from the appearance of the body, from the throat down to the rectum, I should say decidedly he had taken some inflam<lb></lb>matory matter, which had given rise to those appearances, and which caused death—an over dose of tartaric acid would produce that effect—I was be<lb></lb>fore the Coroner when the prisoner made a statement—I think the Coroner did not take down what he said—after the depositions were taken on the first day he came forward, and said he had committed an error, he had given tartaric acid instead of tartarate of soda—they are both the same in appearance—his brother produced two bottles in his presence—there were two small labels on them, one marked "Acid tart." the other "Sodae tart"—the prisoner said he had taken the powder from the wrong bottle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist, and live in Myddle<lb></lb>ton-street, Clerkenwell. The bottle of tasteless salts generally stands nearest to the wall; and in this instance, from what my brother tells me, the sodae tart, stood next the wall—I had used it late the night before, going home, and I believe, in my hurry, to the best of my belief, I changed the places of the bottles.</p>

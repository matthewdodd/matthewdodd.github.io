                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Henry Ernest and Mr. Cresswell, accountants, in Cheapside. The prisoner was in their employ—it was his duty, amongst other things, to collect certain rents—he was to account to me for the money be received, either on the same day or the day following—he has not accounted to me for this 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. Or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he kept this cash-book, and it was his duty to make entries in it—this book was usually kept in the iron safe—the entries were posted into the ledger from this book—he kept a draft-book, and the money would be entered there, and he would afterwards enter it up fairly in the other books, under my direction—he had also a pocket-book, which he kept himself, in which no doubt he entered the sums at the time he received them—I have looked into the cash-book—these sums are not entered.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had the prisoner been in this employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nearly twelve months; he had a good character—these moneys are received on account of an estate that is in Chancery—Mr. Ernest is the receiver appointed by the Court of Chancery—the moneys are received on account of Mr. Ernest—the other gentleman has nothing to do with the receiving—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the prisoner in any way whatever servant to Mr. Ernest, either as receiver or any other capacity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, only jointly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who is accountable to the Court of Chancery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Ernest; sup<lb></lb>posing Mr. Ernest received it, and did not account, it is not for me to answer whether the firm or Mr. Ernest would be answerable to the Court of Chan<lb></lb>cery; no doubt primarily Mr. Ernest would be—he gives a bond and sureties—Mr. Ernest, I believe, would lose the money.</p>

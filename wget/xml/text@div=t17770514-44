               <p>Who was with you? - The best part of them; we came along the road; he gave me his hat across the bank; he said, For God's sake take hold of my hat; I asked him if he was hurt; he said, His head was cut, and he thought his fingers were struck off; while I was talking to him, the deceased came up; I asked him whether he was hurt; he said, That he was almost killed.</p>

               <p>Did he name any of their names? - No; I asked him what he was cut with; he said, A stick, that if it had been cutlasses, he should have been in pieces he had so many blows at a time; I asked him what he was cut through the cheek with; he said, With a knife; he was cut through and through his cheek; he said they returned again; he heard them a coming back again, and lay still in the ditch where they left him. stisted his breath in the ground; then they stamped upon his back, and said, He was not quite dead, and his mouth was full of mud and dirt, and they wanted to pull his coat off; they took away his hat, his handkerchief, and shoes; he told them he would sooner lose his life than his handkerchief.</p>

               <p>You don't know either of the other two prisoners, and don't speak positive to Seagrove? - No; I thought I saw him next day at the butcher's shop buying some meat; I went into the shop and looked at the meat; when I went in to look at the meat they talked Irish to one another and went off and left the meat in the scale; I went to get somebody to take them, and we pursued them, but could not get them.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You had a candle in your hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The first person that you saw was a man you have described as being pitted with the small pox? - A very little, and with white coloured hair, and a light-coloured surtout coat with a crimson collar that had been worn a good deal.</p>
               <p>What buttons? - I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>That man is not here? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you the candle in your hand at the time you saw him? - Yes, I had a light; I came up close to him, looked in his face and spoke to him before he made a blow at me.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you had been in the ditch and the candle went out before you saw the man that you say is Farrell? - About ten minutes to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How had you been employed during that time? - I wanted to get this man up.</p>
               <p>You was struggling with him all the time? - No, I had got him upon his knees.</p>
               <p>Whilst you had hold of this man some people, one of whom you think was Farrell, leaped over a ditch? - I had let him go at the time when the women called out to me that they were coming.</p>
               <p>Was he near enough to strike you from the top of the bank without leaping down? - He jumped at me at once.</p>
               <p>How wide is the ditch? - It is only a drain that is cut down.</p>
               <p>Is it a yard wide? - Not quite a yard I believe.</p>
               <p>He leaped upon you suddenly? - No, I saw him perfectly, he stood upon the top of the bank for a couple of minutes I believe, and then jumped vigorously at me when I let the man go.</p>
               <p>Was your attention more engaged in looking at him or in scuffling with the man that you had hold of? - I could not scuffle with him then, because I left him when the women called out to me.</p>
               <p>I presume the reason why you held the man was to carry him to the watch-house or some where? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then your attention was engaged by securing the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to let him go? - Because of the rest of the party coming.</p>
               <p>You would not have let him go if you could have kept him? - No.</p>

               <p>How long was it? - About a yard.</p>
               <p>How broad? - About the breadth of three fingers; I picked up some of the pieces next morning.</p>
               <p>When he struck you you closed with him and gave him a cut under the right eye? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know him then by that cut? - Yes; and by his complexion.</p>
               <p>This was not a very moonlight night? - No, it was a dark night; I was much resolved to know some of them.</p>
               <p>You know his complexion too? - Yes; that is the very man, I described him before he was taken.</p>
               <p>You had never seen him before? - No, never to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>And you know him particularly by the cut you gave him under the eye? - Yes; I described him as to his person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you see the cut under his eye at the time you gave it him? - At the same time I struck him I cut my own kunckle with the blow; I saw then that I had given him a cut.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Have you never said that it was with a knife you cut him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why did you say so? - Because it was so.</p>
               <p>Then how can you say you cut your knuckle? - With the knife; it was a little knife that the woman gave me that she picked stitches of the cloaths she mends; she gave it me out of her pocket to assist me; the spring broke and turned and cut my knuckle.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the blood come from the wound immediately after you cut him? - Yes; and these girls picked up the knife in the grass next day in the field; the boy lost the knife out of his pocket coming home, or I should have had it here.</p>

               <p>I was with the company in Stepney-fields upon the first of April.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoners; were either of them there? - I cannot swear to any one that was there.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I saw the deceased as soon as he was brought into the hospital; when I examined his head, I found two or three contused wounds; one was of a considerable length on the left-side; I dressed the wound superficially that evening; the next morning it was thought adviseable to scalp him; when the scalp was removed I found a fissure of the skull; the man was perfectly sensible.</p>
               <p>How long did he continue so? - I only attended four days; he remained perfectly sensible all the time I attended him.</p>
               <p>Do you know how long he lived? - No.</p>
               <p>And you did not see him afterwards? - I saw him occasionally.</p>
               <p>Did you see him when he was dying or after he was dead? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the wounds he received were the cause of his death? - I cannot say that; during the time I attended him he was perfectly sensible.</p>
               <p>The prisoners were not put upon their defence.</p>

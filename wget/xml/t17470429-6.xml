               <p>Short. Next Door to the King's head, in Queen's-Street Bloomsbury , my Mother and Father keeps the House, and Lawrence lodges at our House; I was going up Stairs , so I called at one of our Lodger's Room (about seven o'Clock at Night) one Mr Boyce, and as we were talking together, he says , Daniel, there is some Body coming down Stairs; so I went and looked, and saw the Woman coming down Stairs .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Woman?</p>
               <p>Short. Yes, the Prisoner is the Woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she these things in her Hand ?</p>
               <p>Short. Yes, she had these things, and I cried out, Mother, a Thief! she was below Stairs .</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prisoner do then?</p>
               <p>Short. She ran down Stairs, and stared me in the Face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her throw down the things ?</p>
               <p>Short. Yes, and my Mother and a Boy pursued her.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did they take her?</p>
               <p>Short. Not long, I believe, about five or six Minutes .</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that is the very Woman you saw coming down Stairs?</p>
               <p>Short. Yes, I am sure of it.</p>

               <p>Short. I sent the Boy up Stairs on an Errand, and he stayed about five Minutes; and he cried out, Mother , there is a Thief! I ran up Stairs, and saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174704290008"></xptr> Cloaths at the Bottom of the Entry; I was in the Kitchen, the Prisoner run towards Russel-street; a Boy, one Boyce , that was with me, took her in Duke-street; he cried stop Thief, and they stopped her, till I came up to her, then I charged her with the Fact; I did not know but she might have had something else, or I should not have troubled myself to have went after her.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of any Goods taken out of the House?</p>
               <p>Boyce. On the 11th of April , the Boy, a former Witness, came up Stairs to me; I said to the Boy , there is some Body gone up Stairs, I suppose 'tis Mr Lawrence; while the Boy and I were talking, I thought I heard some Body come softly down Stairs, so the Boy opens the Door, and cries out , Mother, here's a Thief; when I came down, the Cloaths were at the Bottom of the Stairs; as soon as I came to the Door, this Gentleman that lives opposite to us, he was leaning over the Door; I said, do you know which Way the Woman ran? he told me; with that I ran after her, and turned the next Turning, and I saw the Woman running in the middle of the Street, and I called out Stop Thief! with that she partly stopped herself, so I overtook her, but she denied it ; when I came up to her, she seemed to be quite out of Breath .</p>
               <p>Burgess Wilson. I live opposite to Mrs Short's, I was leaning ever the Hatch, the 11th of April, about seven o'Clock at Night, and I saw the Prisoner come out of the House; she run very fast, and turned the Corner on the Left-hand .</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoner . What have you to say for yourself ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner . My Lord, I have a Husband abroad; I had lost a Child with one , that was sick, and as I was going along the Street, one cried Stop Thief ! I do not know, where they live.</p>

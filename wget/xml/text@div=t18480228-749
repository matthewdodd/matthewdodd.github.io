               <p>the money on a warrant of attorney, from Mr. Wrench—the prisoner had not a lease of the house, he was a yearly tenant—Mr. May was his landlord—we wanted possession of the premises—we should not have brought the prisoner here if we could have got possession—we offered, if he would go out, not to prosecute him—I told him it was no benefit to us to bring him to the Old Bailey: to give up the premises, our property, and our house, and we would not prosecute—I considered at that time he had committed a felony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you wanted to compromise this felony? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—we had not then taken any proceedings—I said, "Hodges, we will take no further pro<lb></lb>ceedings against you; give us up our premises, and go about your business"—I believed at that time that he had committed a felony, to the best of my knowledge—I do not consider it was a compromise—if he had gone away, and given up our premises, we should not have prosecuted him—I said, "We won't ask you for the money"—I do not know that the business is a very lucrative concern—I borrowed the money, and supplied money for working the business before he got his certificate—I think he got his certifi<lb></lb>cate about six months after we took the business—I cannot say whether he got it in Oct.—our name was lent to the business during the suspension of his certificate—he did not want to take the business again in Oct.—his name was up all the time—we got it painted out one time, and then he washed the paint off again with <hi rend="italic">turps</hi>—that was about two or three months after we had taken the business—I think we took the business in Dec. or Nov., 1846—upon my honour I do not know whether the name was painted out till last Nov.; I do not think it was so late as that, the matter is so complicated I will not swear about it—there was a brass plate likewise; I did not take it away, Mr. May took it off, not with my concur<lb></lb>rence or knowledge—I told Mr. May to go and take possession of his place, and take off the plate—I do not think that was on the day on which the suspension of the certificate ceased—the prisoner's name was on the brass plate—I do not know that he charged me with stealing that plate; I never heard of it—I did not return the plate—I think I went down to Mr. May, and said, "Hodges is finding fault about that plate; let him have it back again'—we had got a bad man to deal with, and the law might have afforded him a felony for it, so we took back the plate—we wanted to get rid of him in the best way we could—I took him before the Magistrate some time after I discharged him—Mr. Parker was my attorney—I did not au<lb></lb>thorise him to compromise the case—I did not offer to withdraw from all pro<lb></lb>ceedings if he would give up the premises; it was their offer to do it in six months—I said, "No"—Mr. Parker did not offer, before we went into the office, to withdraw from the whole proceedings if he gave up the premises at once—if Mr. Parker did so, he acted without my authority—I would not have compromised it then on such conditions.</p>

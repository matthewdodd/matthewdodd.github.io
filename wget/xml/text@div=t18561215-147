                  </hi>. I am single, and live at No. 8, Vine-court, Spitalfields, with my father. On Saturday night, 1st Nov., I was in conversation with Henry James Moules, at the top of Vine-court—the prisoner came up, and asked for water, as well as we could understand him—he appeared to be quite sober—Moules told him to go to the public house for water—upon that the prisoner took hold of me by the arm, touched me under the chin, and put his foot behind mine, and tried to throw me down—Moules pushed him away—the prisoner then made a snatch at Moules's pocket—the pri<lb></lb>soner came up to me again, and put his foot behind mine to throw me down—I pushed him away, and so did Moules—I saw that Moules had a silver watch guard at that time—after he had pushed the prisoner away the second time, the prisoner pulled out a knife—it was open—I saw the blade in his hand—I called out "Murder!"—the prisoner came back, and stabbed Moules in the back—Moules did not say anything to him when he returned</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Crown-court, Pearl-street, and am a brush maker. On 1st Nov., shortly before 12 o'clock at night, I was at the top of Vine-court talking to Briant—the prisoner came up and said something—I was not able to understand him at first, but after he had said six or seven words, I understood he wanted water—I put my hand up to my mouth to see whether I understood what he did mean, I did not know what he wanted—he nodded his head—I told him to go to the public house and they would give him a glass of water, I dare say—he stood there a minute and he went up and caught hold of Briant by the arm as if he meant to throw her down—I pushed him away, and he made two or three blows at me with his fist and instantly caught hold of my breast—I had a watch guard round my neck and a watch in my pocket—he held the chain and struck at me with his fist—I caught hold of my chain and be instantly stabbed me three or four times in my neck—I saw the handle of a knife in his hand and the blade—the knife went through the collar of my coat—it touched my neck and cut me, the blood is on my waistcoat now—he then ran away and returned again—I then went up to him and told him I would give him in charge—he said not a word, but he looked round at me very fierce, opened the knife and said, "Do you?" as I understood him, and made a plunge at me with the knife—he olid not wound me—he ran away then, and I saw a policeman catch hold of him—I was at the corner of Vine-court, and he was at the corner of Brown's-lane, which is near Commercial-street—I saw the policeman catch hold of him, and directly I saw the prisoner stab him in the breast—I saw them struggling together—the policeman was trying to hold him, and he tried to escape—I did not see him give him the second wound on the leg—I saw him struggling very much, and stabbing at the policeman—I did not fetch the policeman—I did not see him till he caught hold of the prisoner—at the time the prisoner was in Commercial-street he was flourishing the knife about—I went up to the policeman as fast as I could, and endeavoured to seize the prisoner—I told the policeman I would give him in charge for stabbing me—the policeman said, "He has stabbed me"—I said, "Yes, I see he has"—and I saw from</p>

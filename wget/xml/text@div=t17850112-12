I said, what has any body fallen over, he said no, the ship is robbed; then I immediately went into my state room where these things were laid, and I opened my chest, and found all these things taken away, the casks and the two boxes.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Silvester, another Council for the Prosecution.</p>
               <p>I am a linguist, I know the prisoner Payne, I lived along with his mother, in Brook-street, Ratcliff, No. 114; and being informed that one Payne a waterman had been upon the river, and concerned in the robbery of these dollars; about the 16th or 17th of October, I saw the prisoner, I went with his mother to him at some house in Goswell-street, and he said he would be glad to go with me to Lynn, in Norfolk.</p>
               <p>Court. For what purpose did you and his mother go to him in Goswell-street? - Only to see him, he then asked me if he could go to Lynn.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did you and the mother go to him? - As I was going down to Lynn, she thought I might be a means of keeping him out of the way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What passed at Goswell-street? - On the Tuesday or Wednesday evening, we set off in a post-chaise for Lynn, in Norfolk.</p>
               <p>What did you go to Lynn for? - I went about my business, and he went with a thought, as far as I understood, to go into some foreign country or another, because he asked me if there were any Norway ships, or ships for Norway, I told him I believed there were; when we came to Lynn we went to the Rose, we continued there about five or six days, nothing passed during this time than this; I was willing to know whether he had been concerned in this robbery or no; upon this he did tell me that he had, but I could not get any thing further out of him.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him, if he was concerned in the robbery? - Yes, I asked him how they could presume to do things of this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120016"></xptr> kind, being a heavy matter; oh! says he, when we get it into the boat we do not fear, we have always assistance to get it out again; or words to that purport.</p>
               <p>Court. Before you set out from London, how came you to know any thing about the prisoner being to go down to Lynn, or any other place? - Upon the anxiety of the mother I had a suspicion.</p>
               <p>Was you yourself intending to go to Lynn before? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did the mother know that you so intended? - Yes, four or five days before, the mother seemed very anxious for her son to go with me, and that gave me a suspicion.</p>
               <p>Had you no other conversation with him? - I asked him several times what he had done with the property, he told me he would give me no particular answer; he said, that he wanted to go over to Norway; I questioned him several times, what use he had made of the property, but no reply was given, only that he was concerned in it, and that he had seventeen watches left in the hands of one Woolfe, or something to that purpose, for which he had not paid him, and he damned him for that; and that he had eighty pounds in some man's hands somewhere near Moorfields, and that man had not paid him; I do not know what that eighty pounds was for.</p>
               <p>You do not know whether it was for the watches or the dollars? - No, he asked me what he should pay me, says I, I came down here to serve your mother, I did not come here for the lucre of gain, and he flung down ten guineas, which I took as a present from him, as the money was offered to me, I, like a great many more folks, did take it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. So this man told you the only thing in the world that could hurt himself and take away his life, and nothing else but that one fact? - No.</p>
               <p>Why, it is something very astonishing that he should not tell you what became of the property? - He did not, I asked him several times.</p>
               <p>You did? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever read the New Testament? - I have.</p>
               <p>You remember the character of Judas? - I do.</p>

               <p>How long have you lived with the prisoner Payne?</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. You need not answer that question.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you live with him on the 6th of October last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Payne lodge in the same room with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he at home on the 6th of October? - Sir, it was a Wednesday morning in October when he was out, he came home on the Thursday morning, between five and six, I was in bed when he came home, he desired me to get up, and put my clothes on, and go with him as far as Limehouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. I am very unwilling to take exceptions, but, upon my word, this is such betraying; she says they are his children: are you married to this man? - No, Sir, I am not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did you do together at Limehouse? - He went into a house in Narrow-street, Limehouse, they say it is a brewhouse, and stayed, I believe, a quarter of an hour; he came back, and brought with him a little small bag, and desired me to carry it in my apron.</p>
               <p>Is that the same house you have shewn to Mr. Vyson since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did the bag contain that he put into your apron? - I saw it when I was at home, it contained dollars, I cannot tell how many; he went home just before me; it was a very small bag, there might be a hundred or more.</p>
               <p>What became of those dollars afterwards? - I desired they might not remain in my place, and he told me Wolfe was to come for them in the evening, but he did not;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120018"></xptr> he then desired me to carry them to Goodman's-fields, to one Mary Ann, a woman he kept company with, Payne came after me in a short time, Mr. Wolfe came, and an old Jew man, and a Jew boy.</p>
               <p>Is that Moses? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What passed between Wolfe and the prisoner? - I cannot say, I saw the Jew man and Jew boy put something in their pockets, I do not know what it was, I do not know who gave it them, whether it was Payne or not; afterwards Mr. Wolfe gave me his pocket handkerchief, tied up with something, and desired me to take it to Petticoat-lane, he went with me and Payne, I carried it into a court in Petticoat-lane, and they took it from me, and went into a house and shut the door; I went the next morning between five and six, and carried the remainder of the dollars to Mary Ann.</p>
               <p>How long did Payne continue in London after? - I cannot say, I never saw him but twice after.</p>

               <p>Mr. Morgan. There is nothing to affect the prisoner Cook.</p>
               <p>Court. It is very weak, but I think there is such evidence given in regard to him, as has been held sufficient to put him on his defence, for it has been proved, I think, by the woman, that he was in company with the prisoner three different times before the robbery, that is a circumstance to be sure.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester to Dolfin. Which of the prisoners do you know? - I know all the prisoners.</p>
               <p>What happened on the 6th of October?</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. I hope your Lordship will be of opinion, this man is not intitled to give evidence against Jameson, because there is not a tittle of evidence against him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. There cannot be any objection to this witness's competency; the question is, how far the Jury will believe him.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not absolutely a rule of law, that accomplices cannot be examined, it is rather a rule of prudence and humanity; but wherever there is any kind of circumstance that gives an air of probability to a story, there it is for the Jury to judge of the credit; now, where the prisoners have been proved to be together in company, previous to the robbery, that is a circumstance which has been left to the Jury, and I think it sufficient in point of law.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. I beg leave to remind your Lordship, that she has only spoken to Jameson, Cook, and to one Miles; Miles is not here, and with respect to Jameson and Cook, I beg leave to refer to my Lord's notes, there is no evidence against either of them; Miles is not here; if they had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120020"></xptr> proved Payne to have been in the house there might have been something in it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There are some of your Lordships would call him first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. This witness cannot confirm any thing, or corroborate any thing against Jameson, because nothing has been proved against him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Take it so, Mr. Scott, but he may be confirmed by and by.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Ashurst. What you say is true, that some of the Judges do take an accomplice first, but unless he is confirmed, it all goes for nothing; the only question I think will be, whether there has been any evidence that applies to any of the prisoners, because the woman's evidence goes to this, that she saw Miles and Jameson at the house; now, wherever you bring home clear evidence to one person of a fact, and you give evidence by witnesses, that that person was in company with another or two, that will be sufficient to let in the evidence of the accomplice, that the other two were present at the time of committing of the robbery, but you must have some fact that applies to this robbery, now there has been no evidence proved against Cook and Jameson as applying to the robbery; the only evidence that has been is against Payne.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. We must first hear this man's story, we are giving evidence against Payne, and your Lordship will take care to distinguish it in your directions to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Court. Now tell us all you know about this robbery.</p>
               <p>Dolfin. I think it was on the 7th of October, about seven in the evening, we went on board the brig Elbe,

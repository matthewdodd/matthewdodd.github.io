                  </hi>. I am an Italian, and live in Church-street, Hatton-garden—I am a thermometer maker—the prisoner resides in my house, in the first-floor front room—he is something in my business—on the 20th of Sept., when I came home in the evening, I went up stairs to my bed-room, and saw his door wide open—after I got opposite the stairs, I heard John Hare coming up stairs—I stopped on the staircase, hearing some words between him and the prisoner—my wife came up, and called me back to shut the prisoner's door—he was in the room, and lately has been in the habit of leaving his door open—I shut it because I was told, and he had been threatening to take my life—after shut ing the door, he opened it three or four different times—Mander was also in the room—I then went into the room, and said, "There has been a great deal of disturbance in this house for the last four or five weeks, through you, I am determined to put an end to it, I will suffer it no longer"—I can<lb></lb>not say what answer he made—we had a few words, and very soon afterwards the prisoner used a few words, and I gave him a push, and pushed him away—that was not with violence—he immediately struck me a violent blow with the poker on the hinder part of my head—I cannot say whether he had the poker in his hand when I pushed him—it knocked me down, and I was senseless for several minutes—he hit me again with the poker, while I was down, on the back part of my head—I got up, and he struck me again across</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the prosecutor's house—when the prosecutor came into the prisoner's room I was in the next room, and hearing words, I left my own room, and went outside the door—the prisoner said to the prosecutor, "I will take away life," two or three times—he had a poker in his hand, and he aimed a blow in a most malicious and inhuman manner at the prosecutor, and struck him on the head—I was agitated, and left the room, to call assist<lb></lb>ance, and when I came back the prosecutor was lying on the ground—the prisoner struck him several blows with the poker while he was on the ground—he held it in both hands, brandished it over his head, and exclaimed some<lb></lb>thing in Italian, something like occapano, to say, "I will settle him"—I went for a policeman, and found one in a few minutes—on entering the room</p>

It was called in to attend the prosecutor about half-past twelve o'clock at night, and found two wounds on the back of the head, an inch and a half apart, and each about the eighth of an inch deep; one was a little more than an inch long, the other about half an inch—they appeared to have been made by some blunt instrument—a poker or a stick would produce them—he lost very little blood—I strapped them up, and attended him about a week—he is perfectly recovered now—I did not apprehend danger.</p>

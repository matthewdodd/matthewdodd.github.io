            . On the 31st of May, between nine and ten in the evening, I took a coach in Oxford-road; as I was going into the coach I gave the man the shilling, and bid him drive to Argyle-street; he drove me down into <placeName id="t17740706-59-crimeloc302">Soho-square</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17740706-59-crimeloc302" type="placeName" value="Soho-square"></interp>

               <p>Q. You must tell what he did to you?</p>
               <p>Neale. He had proper satisfaction of me, the same as my husband would.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to you after he had thrown you down in the coach?</p>
               <p>Neale. He had satisfaction of me.</p>
               <p>Q. You must answer my question - Were his breeches unbuttoned?</p>
               <p>Neale. Yes; he pulled my clothes up and had his will of me.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he do when he pulled your clothes up?</p>
               <p>Neale. He put what he had into me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing come from him?</p>
               <p>Neale. Yes; I have been ill with it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. How was you lying when he had to do with you?</p>
               <p>Neale. On the bottom of the coach between the two seats?</p>
               <p>Q. Were both the doors of the coach shut?</p>
               <p>Neale. Yes.</p>
               <p>On her cross examination she said her husband was a hackney coachman, and lived in Bloomsbury; she was asked how far she was from Argyle-street when she took the coach; she said she did not know the street; she was asked how she came to walk to Oxford-road, and then when she was so nigh Argyle street to take a coach; she said she was not well, and could not walk any further; she was asked if she did not tell him she was a coachman's wife; she said she did not; she was asked if they did not go and drink together; she said they were not in any house together; she was asked if they had any conversation in the coach; she said they had none at all; she was asked how she came to pay him beforehand; she said she knew he must be paid, and thought then she should have nothing to do but get out; she was asked if it was a light night; she said no, but it was light enough to take the number of his coach, and she did take the number of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure both the doors of the coach were shut?</p>
               <p>Neale. Yes.</p>

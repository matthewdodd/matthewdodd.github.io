            . I live with Mr. Gofton, a pawnbroker, in Gilbert-street, Berkeley-square. On the 29th of December, between five and six o'clock, the prisoner came to pawn a silver gilt watch - he offered me only one; he said it was a metal watch, which caused me to suspect him - we questioned him about it, and he said he had won it at a raffle; I detained it, and while we were questioning him he ran out of the shop - I followed him round the corner, but could not see him; a person came from Mr. Gillam's next day, and claimed it - I saw the prisoner at Marlborough-street about ten days afterwards, and am certain he is the man.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 7th of May, between eight and nine o'clock, I was nearly home. I was going along stooping my head, three or four young men were coming along High-street, and when they came up to me one of them struck me under my chin, and my watch was taken by one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the blow knock you down - A. Not that blow; they hit me on the back of my neck and then I slipped down, that was after my watch was taken. I recovered myself, and as soon as I could get up, I looked round, and saw the prisoner running across the road. I ran after him, calling Stop thief! I lost sight of him hardly a minute in turning the corner of Little Woodstock-street - the watchman stopped him in Weymouth-street. My watch was found next morning down an area, at the corner of Weymouth and Wimpole-street. I am sure the prisoner is one of the four persons that met me. I did not notice him more than the rest till I saw him running. I have seen him many times before. The others ran in different directions, none of them ran to Little Woodstock-street. The watch was found in the area of No. 43. I saw him pass that house, and saw him stopped a very little way from it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was you not in Little Marylebone-street, when I was stopped - A. He was stopped as I turned the corner, I did not see the watchman actually stop him. I said at the office that I did not know him to be the man that took my watch, but he was the man I pursued - I know him by seeing him about the street. Some person pointed him out to me, saying that is the one who has got your watch, and I pursued. I did not say I did not know what time I lost it. I had been with some friends and was rather in liquor, but knew what I was about; and with the blow that I had at the back of my neck I fell against the curb and it stunned me. I recovered myself as soon as I could get up, it was getting dusk - part of my ribbon was in sight.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner running, sprang my rattle, and saw him stopped by Gage. About four o'clock in the morning I took the watch out of an area, within a yard or two of where he was stopped - it was then light. I looked for it at eleven o'clock at night, but could not see it because it was so deep - it was general suspicion which induced me to look there. I did not see him throw it down.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you spring your rattle - A. I heard the cry of Stop him! in Little Marylebone-street. I was then in Weymouth-street, and saw the prisoner run up Little Woodstock-street as hard as he could, and three or four more running after him, crying out Stop thief! I sprang my rattle, and saw Gage stop him - I brought him into Little Marylebone-street. Sanderson came up, and said he was the man who had taken his watch - he was stopped in Weymouth-street, and ran through Little Woodstock-street. I suppose Sanderson was about two or three hundred yards behind him, and he must have lost sight of him. Nobody was running before him.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the night of the 7th of May I stopped the prisoner in Weymouth-street, between Wimpole-street and Wimpole-mews - I did not see him throw anything away, but I saw the watch found in the area of No. 43; I stopped him by that area. I heard the rattle spring, and a cry of Stop thief! and went to meet him - nobody was running before him; he was very quiet when I laid hold of him - I met him just by the corner and stopped him. Sanderson came up in about two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170012"></xptr>minutes; the prisoner was close to the area-railings when I caught him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not hear them say it was about six o'clock - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was to meet a young man about a quarter before nine o'clock in Foley-place - it was gone nine, and being late I ran, heard the cry of Stop thief! and was stopped.</p>

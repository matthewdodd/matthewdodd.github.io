            : On the 13th of April, I missed the masts mentioned in the indictment, they had been in a private dock which we made to accommodate ourselves; and, to prevent the masts going adrift, we placed an old mast, that was condemned, to hinder them going out; the dock was wet or dry, as the tide came down. On the Sunday I saw them, I marked them with my own hand, all of them; we had them from Mr. Osborn, from on board the ship Empress of Russia; Mr. Mills, the rafter's man, brought them, and he set his mark apon them; in consequence of some information I received, I went in pursuit of them; I went to a lane nearly opposite Hungerford coffee-house, and there I saw best part of the property I had lost; two of them were cut up into two foot and a half, and three foot lengths, it was on the Thursday before Good-Friday; I missed them about twelve o'clock at noon, and I got there a little after four in the afternoon; I found them on Mr. Germaine's premises; the two masts that were cut up were valued at one hundred pounds; I took Germaine into custody; I have no doubt but the short pieces of wood were part of the masts, because the number and contents all agree with my book; there is a piece in particular that has R.T. upon it, and another marked 82, which I rased with my own hand the day we bought them; there was considerably more of it upon Germaine's premises.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search after any person you supposed to be the thief? - A. We had constables all about the town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The only mark you put upon it was R.T. and the contents? - A. Yes; most watermen in the river Thames know our mark; I found only two masts at Germaine's, but we lost four.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since found those two other masts? - A. We found them the same evening made fast at Temple-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not timber of this description frequently get afloat? - A. A gale of wind will occasion it often, (and we cannot guard against it); small timber, that runs from about sixteen to twenty feet long will get afloat, but not timber of such magnitude as these are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Q. Was it such a stormy windy night that it was impossible to prevent them getting adrift? - A. No; they were fastened to a boom, and that boom we found fast, and exactly in the situation we left it; if the boom had gone adrift, I should naturally have supposed it was caused by some accident, but the boom being made fast, I concluded they must be stolen; this is the wood I lost.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that timber brought the next tide, that Mr. Ferguson found upon your premises cutting up? - A. Yes; I paid him for the timber.</p>

               <p>Q. There is a reward given? - A. You are allowed a salvage, but when you take it to those water bailiffs, you never get any thing for it; it is a common thing to see timber adrist, when I see it, I generally lay hold of it; I have taken up some hundred sticks; I am quite certain that this happened between two and three o'clock, day light was beginning to appear.</p>

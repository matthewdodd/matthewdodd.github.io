            . I am a surgeon and man-midwife.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known the prisoner any time - A. Four months prior to this business. I understood she was a <rs id="t18090920-114-deflabel663" type="occupation">single woman</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you ever attend her before the 11th of September - A. Yes; I attended her about four months ago; she came to me and complained of the dropsy. On the 10th of September, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I taxed her with being pregnant, she said she was not, she never knew a man from a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form a judgment whether the child was born alive - A Alive, I should suppose, from the appearance - from the loss of blood, the navel string not being tied.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form a judgment what was the cause of its death - A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your judgment now - A. The loss of blood from the navel string.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the neck - A. There were no marks of violence about the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course there would have been if it had been strangled - A. No doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your judgment is, it died of neglect from not tying the navil string, not from strangling - A. Being rolled up in linen might still tend to increase the death of the child. The child was rolled up at the time I saw it; whether it was rolled up in linen at the time it was alive that I cannot say, except that blood was found in the linen, which I suppose came from the navil string.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole your judgment is that it died on account of the navil string not being tied - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether she was with child or not - A. I thought she had some other complaint; I never taxed her with it till the morning after she was delivered.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the child after it was born - A. No; the officer came into my room after I was in bed. The prisoner came into my room with the child in her hands while they were at my door; I said what have you got there Beckey; she said a child; I said take it away, I will have nothing to do with it; she made answer, I will put it in the closet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she want to hide it - A. Why, she wanted to put it into my bed; I do not know what the meaned, I was frightened; I do not know whether it was alive or dead.</p>

            . I was at the prisoner's house about four months ago; she told me that she was censured by all the neighbours for being with child, but she was not so; she asked me how I felt when I had a child, whether of a morning I was sick, and whether I had milk before I was delivered. She told me Dr. Wallis attended her for the dropsy, and a water doctor in town. She denied to me being with child two or three times, she said it was the dropsy, with wind on her stomach. I was there on Friday before she was delivered, and on Saturday when she was in strong labour. I did not see her again till the Monday after, then she was in the street; I thought then she was a different woman to what she used to be.</p>

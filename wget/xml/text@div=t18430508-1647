On the 5th of April, I was working with the prisoner and four others in a field on Tuffnell-park estate—we discovered a copper pot, not above two inches under ground—the lid had been on the pot, but when I struck it with my pick, it came up—the prisoner, Page, and Abraham were with me—under the copper pot there was what ap<lb></lb>peared to be a little white jar, but it was broken all to pieces—there were sovereigns in it, and when we struck the pick into it, they flew out—I and the</p>

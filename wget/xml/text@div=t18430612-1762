On Friday, the 25th of May, between five and six o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, the prisoners came into my shop to look at some lace—I showed then some, which I took out of boxes, and pot on the counter—they both looked at it, and asked the price—it was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a yard—I showed them some lower—they chose some which came to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Allen gave me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to my desk for the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., leaving my son three or four feet from them—when I returned with the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I saw Green stoop towards the floor, as if picking up something—I gave them the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they left the shop in a mo<lb></lb>ment—after they were gone I missed three or four pieces of superior lace, and others not so expensive, between thirty or forty yards in all, worth 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I directly went to look for them, but could not see them—I gave in<lb></lb>formation to the police—on Thursday, the 1st of June, the prisoners came again, and asked to look at some cuffs, which I showed them, and then some lace—they said I had sold them some cheap lace last week at 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the other</p>

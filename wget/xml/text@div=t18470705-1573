                  </hi> I am a clerk, employed at No. 14, Gresham-street. On the 26th of June I had a coat there, hanging up behind the door—I saw it safe at one o'clock, and afterwards missed it—this now produced is it—it had in the pockets two books, a card-case, a pair of gloves, and a key, which are here now—they are all my property.</p>

                  </hi> On the 26th of June, a little after four o'clock, I found the prisoner coming down the passage of the office of the Great Northern Railway, in Moorgate-street—I stopped him, sent for a policeman, examined his bundle, and found it contained this coat.</p>

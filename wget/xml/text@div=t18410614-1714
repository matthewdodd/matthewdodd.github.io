                  </hi>. I am shopman to Edward Grant, a leather<lb></lb>seller in Tottenham court-road. On the 12th of June, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came to the shop to buy leather—he went to the bin to help him<lb></lb>self—I saw him put a pair of soles into his breast-pocket, and afterwards place two more under the waistband of his trowsers, and cover them order with his handkerchief—he then came towards the counter—I went round the counter, and said I must see those soles he had placed in his breast, and in his waistband—I took them from his person, and sent for a policeman—he wished me to send for his mother, and not to give him in charge, and said he would never come into the shop again if I would let him go—I gave him in charge—he had been in the habit of coming to the shop for four years—he used to come with his father occasionally, but since his death I have only seen him three times, which was last Thursday, Friday, and Saturday—it is customary for persons to go to the bins, help themselves, and bring the leather to the counter—he has paid on former occasions—he did not bring any leather to the counter in his hand—he never put the things into his pocket and waistband before.</p>

On the 30th of August, between half-past three and four o'clock, I was in King-street, Covent-garden, returning from the City; I had been to see some friends from the country - my husband was not with me; I saw the prisoner in King-street, in company with another - the prisoner came, and asked me to go and have some gin; I refused - they followed me to <placeName id="t18320906-365-crimeloc2068">Berwick-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where had you been? A. To No. 21, Shoe-lane - I cannot tell at what time I left; I walked as fast as I could - I was not tipsy; I had only taken part of a pot of half-and-half - I should have left at twelve o'clock, but it rained; I had been in Farringdon-street with my friends to see the illuminations; the prisoner did not insult me, further than asking me to have gin - they followed me sometimes behind and sometimes at my side.</p>

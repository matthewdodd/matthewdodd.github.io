                  </hi>. I am assistant to George Thompson, a pawnbroker, of 48, New North Road—I sleep on—the premises—on 7th January, about 11.30, I fastened up the house, and secured the first floor landing window by a catch—about 1.451 heard a dog bark, and awoke my fellow-servant—I went into a back room and heard a rattle springing—I stood at the street door and saw constable Doughty, who made a communication to me—I re<lb></lb>turned upstairs and he followed me—I then saw the prisoner with his legs and part of his legs and part of his body through—the window which I had secured over<lb></lb>night, and which was then open, there are bars inside the window, and there was a bradawl inserted in it to help it up—the policeman pulled the prisoner into the Tiouse—he said "'Help"—two constables came, and one of them went into the back yard and brought back the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and dark Lin-tern—the prisoner said he would use the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> in self-defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> The bars are about 12 inches high and 7 inches wide—I did not know that you were fixed, and I did not think you could get through—I just pricked you in the thigh seven times with this swofdstick.</p>

Iwas on duty and saw the pri<lb></lb>soner half in and half out of the first floor landing window, which was partly open—I sprang my rattle, Sanders let me in, and I saw the prisoner in the window—I pulled him through and took him into custody—I found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and dark lantern—I searched the prisoner and found this rope, and this American glass cutter—I found this gimlet in the window to keep it up, and this mask and hat outside the window—I took him to the station, and on the charge being read over, he told me that I should have done the same if I had been out of work for three months.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> You offered no resistance but you were kicking very violently in the window—Sanders was using a sword stick—I was present when the surgeon examined me—I saw seven marks of wounds, on your thighs.</p>

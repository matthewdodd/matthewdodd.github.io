               <p>Day. It opens backwards into my yard: and I found the parlour window broke open in the fore part of my house, the iron bar that is keyed on the inside: the bolt was drawn thro' and taken away: I missed two spades, which I had put into my cellar over night, five bottles of cyder, the belt and the key: what beer they took in the cellar, I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Day. They were to my certain knowledge, at about nine o'clock, and the Tyles all on the house: but in the morning, there were two of them taken off a place that jetts out over my cellar door: that door was broke open by the staple being bent: about a week or ten days after I heard the prisoners had been drinking cyder: and having been told one of them was a lusty Black, I seeing Robertson at St. Mary Overs, I apprehended him; then he told us where he sold the spades, and owned he broke open the cellar, and that Jackson and one Conningham were along with him: we went and found one spade, where he told me, at Rotherhithe, just by the Boatswain and Call: I asked him how he came to my house, he said he would go to any house where he could get any thing to make money of: I know nothing against the other prisoner, except what Robertson said: (one spade was produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>

I live at Rotherhithe : there were two labouring men came to me: I believe Robertson the Black was one of them: it is about five or six weeks ago: they asked me (as I break up ships) for work, I told them it was a dead time of the year: the Black said he had been from London Bridge, a great way, and could get no work: that as he had not any victuals, he must sell his spade, he asked me two shillings and six pence for it: I offered him one shilling and six pence: I went backwards, about my business, he went away, and some time after he came again, and let me have it.</p>

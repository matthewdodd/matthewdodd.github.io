I am a dealer in brushes, at 3, Kingsland Road—I was in this skittle-ground on 27th April—it was at the Birch Tree, Great James Street, Hoxton—I went between 8 and 9 o'clock, and saw Pulley there—the skittle-ground closes at 12 o'clock, and the shutters are put up at a little after—I remained in the bar till nearly 1 o'clock—Pulley was drunk, and I went home with him, which took about twenty minutes—he lives in Hoxton Street, Shoreditch—he was a little intoxicated when he came in between 8 and 9 o'clock, and then he was playing, and we had some <hi rend="italic">cooper</hi>—when we got to his house I saw a light on the opposite side of the street, where Colcleugh lives—it is a boot and shoe-maker's shop—the door was open—other people were there.</p>

My husband keeps a boot and shoe-maker's shop, opposite Pulley—on Tuesday, 27th April, after we had shut up, Mr. Pulley was led in drunk—his wife had been there during the day, but she was not there then—it was about 1.30 when Pulley came—George Lovejoy and Ephraim Figgins were at our house—Pulley took a bottle of gin from his pocket while he was there, and after that was disposed of Lovejoy and Figgins led him across the road—I followed across behind them—Pulley's wife had to take his boots off when he got home, and I helped her—I attended at the Police Court.</p>

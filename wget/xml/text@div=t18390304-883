I am a jeweller, and live on Ludgate-hill—I rent the shop of Mr. Croft, and the first and second floors of Mr. Harvey—they do not live in the house—mine is quite a distinct occupation from theirs. On the evening of the 25th of February I was called down stairs, and saw the prisoner—my young man had handed him a gold watch from the win<lb></lb>dow—I took two more from the window, and showed him—the highest price was six guineas—he wanted one about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I had not one higher, except one at 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked to see it—I was taking it out of the window, when he took up a six guinea watch and ran out—I pur<lb></lb>sued him up the Old Bailey—he was stopped just as I got up to him—I brought him back, and gave him in charge with the watch in his pos<lb></lb>session.</p>

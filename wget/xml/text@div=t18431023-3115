                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Knowles. The prisoner came on the 30th of August for a pint of porter—he paid me a bad half-crown—I examined it, and put it into the till—there was nothing else in the till but a sixpence and a fourpenny-piece—I afterwards went to the till, took out the half-crown, and showed it to my husband—I then took it up stairs, and put it into a box, which I kept locked—on the 11th of September he came for half a pint of sixpenny ale, and gave me a bad shilling—my husband went after him, but did not find him—I placed the shilling in a cup on the shelf, behind some bottles—he came again on the 16th of Sept., to see if I would let him have half a pint of porter on trust—he said he would come again, and I trusted him—he came in again, about half-past eleven o'clock, and threw down a penny to pay for the porter, then he threw down a bad shilling, and said, "Change, if you please"—I gave the shilling to my son, and told him to fetch a policeman—I told the prisoner my son was gone to get change, and he waited—my son brought Green, an officer, with him—I gave the officer the half-crown and the shilling I had received from the prisoner, and my son gave him the other shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. I deal in accoutrement stores—I know the prisoner—in the latter end of March, he came to me with this bill—it bore the acceptance it does now—I asked him whether he was sure it was his father's acceptance—he said, "It is, what makes you ask that question; do you think I would leave myself open to commit a forgery"—I discounted it for him—he had part cash, and part to take up another note which was over-due.</p>

            What day was it? - On Wednesday, the 15th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know it was missing from the warehouse? - I missed it about ten minutes I suppose after it was taken; we are in the habit of exposing the cheese at the door; this cheese was there exposed on the side of the door, in sight of the people that pass.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you charge the prisoner with having this cheese? - I do not charge the prisoner; I know no more than that; the cheese stood on the pile, on Wednesday morning, and I missed it on the evening; it was there the whole of the day till dusk; I was entertained in the evening by two or three customers, and afterwards I turned my eyes and missed this cheese.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the cheese in the prisoner's possession? - I have not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever get the cheese back again? - I saw it at a public house facing the office, at Queen's square, the sign I do not very well recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. What King-street, Westminster, near the Abby? - Not a great way from the office, perhaps two or three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that cheese again?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179411110041"></xptr>- I know it front a mark that was on it when I purchased the cheese.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178801090029"></xptr>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. Did you bring these curtains here? - I have brought them here; I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Is this your own chair, or are you only hired as a chairman? - This is my chair and my partners; our own property.</p>

               <p>I found these curtains at the top of Oxford-road; I had been at work three days in Holborn, and I went home just at eleven, and the woman was gone to bed; I could not get in, and I asked the watchmen where the watch-house was? they said, if I did not go about my business, they would put me in the watch-house; from thence I went to Charlotte-street, to a public-house, they were gone to bed, then I went to the Red-Lyon, Red-Lyon-street, Holborn, and could not get any lodgings there; then I went to go to Portland-mews, and coming back I found these curtains; I went into one of the coach-houses at half after five, and it was very cold, and I went to one of these houses where the watchmen go, and they took me.</p>
               <p>Court to Barnett. Was it at the public-house where the watchmen meet that you found this man? - He came into that house, and had a pennyworth of purl, and a halfpennyworth of gin, and the landlord turned him out, then I saw his pockets stick out; he told me he found the things at Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he said Whitechapel? - Yes, and then he said he found them in the city.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

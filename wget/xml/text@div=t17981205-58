             sworn. - I am a carpenter: On the 11th of November, I was sitting at dinner with my wife and children, somebody knocked at the door, my wife went, and it was the prisoner; says he, will you buy a shirt; he pulled one from under his coat, and she took it up to look at it; and he pulled out a pair of blue pantaloons, and put them on the counter with the shirt; my wife deals in these things to help maintain my family, I work for squire Perry, in the Dock-yard; she asked him if they were his own property, and he said, yes; says she, what shall I give you for them; four shillings, says he; he said he was very poor, and wanted a little money to have a spree with his shipmates; she told him she would give him three shillings for them; on the Friday, when I came home, she told me a man had been and claimed them, that they had got his name upon them; and on the Monday, I was coming down a ladder and saw the prisoner behind me, I was sure it was him; I met a headborough, and we laid hold of him, and took him to Mr. Green's, 'squire Perry's nephew; we had much ado to get him along; we did get him there, but he was not at home; then I took him to the watch-house; I am positive the prisoner is the man that sold them to my wife.

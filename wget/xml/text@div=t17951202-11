             the constable produced the boots, which were deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Miles. Q. I with to know by what mark he knows them? - A. They are large in the calash, and wide in the waist.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why should not other boots be large in the calash and wide in the waist? - A. I had them about a month, and they are very seldom seen so wide in the waist.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I think it impossible to swear to a pair of boots from such a description as he has given of them? - A. I could to many of my boots.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where were those boots? - A. Hung up outside of my shop, against the window.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When had you last seen them? - A. I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any doubt in your mind that they are your property? -

               <p>Prisoner Miles's defence. I was rather disguised in liquor; a man offered me these boots for sale; I told him I was a hard-working man; I did not want them, but being in liquor I bought them; I gave 6s. for them; I was going to get some money that was in arrears from the regiment that was with the Duke of Yord; that man knows I carried them publickly in the street; one man offered me 5s. for them, and I thought it was not enough; this man would not buy them, and I thought it better to lose 1s. than lose my time; I went back with the boots, and then he told me they were stolen, and he would swear they were; the man was sent for, and he owned one pair of the boots; I went along with the constable very quietly; he never held me; I might have run away, but I would not, because I know myself innocent; this man said he knew them that sold them to him; that they were such rubbish he could not make them up for his own shop; I asked this young man to go along with me and I would treat him with some beer when I got the money from the major; and the man at the bar said he would swear that this young man took them; he wanted to make it up if I would give him the boots, and I would not.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He said he picked them up in Bishopsgate-street, and the justice asked him if he broke his knees over them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Sullivan's defence. I know nothing at all about it; this young man asked me to go along with him, and he would give me some porter.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Have you sold any quantity of boots since you bought them? - A. Yes, a great many.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you had not sold those then? - I always remark the boots that I sell.</p>

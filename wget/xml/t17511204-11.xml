               <p>H. Wilson. I was in the fore shop and saw her take it, and put it close to her and go up stairs.

            . I was in the shop buying a piece of Camblet. I saw the prisoner take the piece of cloth and hold it close to her side and go up stairs. Then she came down and put on her hat and cloak and said she was going out. Mrs. Wilson desired her to go up stairs and take the child, while she had dispatched her customers, she came down with the child in her arms, as she was going up again, I saw a lump near her knee about the bigness of the piece, it was roll'd up. I saw her search'd and the piece fell from her cloaths.</p>

When I came back, Mistress went up stairs and tax'd her with taking it, she came down and was for going out; she went backwards to the very same place where she took it, and there dropt it down from under her petticoates.</p>

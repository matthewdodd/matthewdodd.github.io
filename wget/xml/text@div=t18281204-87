               <p>Prisoner. When I met you in the Strand you were talking to two women, and was so tipsy you could scarcely stand - you asked me and the others to have something to drink; we went and had a glass each, and then we went to that house: the woman who keeps it was forced to lift you up stairs, and you gave me 4s. - I said I would not stay with you for that. Witness. No; I gave 5s. to the person who keeps the house - she took 3s. for the room, sent for half a pint of rum, and gave me 1s. back - that shilling the prisoner did not take; she left her own articles in the room.</p>

The prisoner and prosecutor came there, and paid me 3s. for the room - the next morning he came down, and asked for the mistress; a person called Mrs. Wright - he said, "I think it's all wrong;" he stated that he had lost his money and shoes - I looked for them, but could not find them; I heard a little slam of the door about one o'clock, but thought it might be some dogs.</p>

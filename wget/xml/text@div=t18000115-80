               <p>Prisoner's defence. I met with the prosecutor, he wanted me to take him home with me, but he said he had got no money; he then told me to go up that dark passage, and he gave me the watch till the morning; and after I had obliged him he wanted the watch back, and laid hold of the chain to pull it forcibly from me, and that was the way the chain broke.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Negus.) Did she deny having the watch before you searched her? - A. Yes, she did.</p>

            . On Wednesday the 30th of June, about twenty minutes after eight, I missed two pair of boots; one a pair of top-boots, the other a pair of Hessian boots. I had seen them half an hour before I lost them, and they were produced at Bow-street office by Godfrey. These are the top boots; there is the name inside.

             was in the room, No. 10. We always put the number on the bottom of the boots with chalk; the number is on them now; that is my own chalking. They were taken from the lobby, one flight high, and they go three steps downwards. At the Bunch of Grapes in Bow-street the prisoner said he would take us to a place where he had sold one pair, and to another house where he had deposited the other pair.</p>

            . I am a porter in the Bedford hotel. I saw the prisoner at our door; I asked him what he wanted; he said he wanted to enquire about Mr. Watts, of Yorkshire. I told him Mr. Watts was not there, nor expected to be in town. He had no boots with him then. I saw him go to the Tavistock hotel, and when he came out he had a pair of Hessian boots. This was about eight o'clock in the morning.</p>

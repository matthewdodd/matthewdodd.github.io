                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of 5, Harrison's-buildings, Whitechapel—I married a daughter of the prisoner, and my wife has some brothers and sisters—the prisoner has again married a man named John Darton, who is not the father of those children—on the 25th of September, in consequence of something said to me, I went to where John Darton lives—he was kicking my wife's brother, Bill Saunders, up against the closet door—the prisoner was in the back room and could see what was going on, as the window looks into the yard—Saunders is nineteen—my wife took her brother away, and I held Jack in the yard—he offered to fight me, and called me "poor dog," and all the names he could lay his tongue to—he said he would give me three weeks, and fight for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after that was settled, we were all out in the court for about five minutes. I was standing next Darton, and my wife was next me—he immediately laid hold of my wife and began pulling her under the window where the prisoner was—he was kicking her and pulling her by her hair—I caught hold of her to try to get her away, and the prisoner leaned out of the window and caught hold of me by my hair—she lifted me off my feet down into the yard, which has two steps to go down—she then picked up a wash-hand basin and heaved it with great force, and cut the top of my head—I was attended at the police-station by the divisional surgeon.</p>

               <p>five feet from the back door—there were one or two persons there, who interfered, besides Saunders and my wife and myself—the officer saw it done—there were a number of people in the court looking on—a Mrs. Dawes was in the back room—I did not see Mrs. Williams there—I did not do anything against Darton—I do not know of the son doing anything; if he did, it was done before I came—I did not see a knife in his hand—there was something said about his having a knife in his hand, but I did not see it—when I first went into the yard, I saw Saunders there—when the basin was thrown, he was close by, outside the door of the court—Darton was not upon the ground—I did not take hold of him—I only had my wife by the arm—there was a John Saunders also—I can take my solemn oath that Darton was not on the ground under me at the time this basin was thrown out.</p>

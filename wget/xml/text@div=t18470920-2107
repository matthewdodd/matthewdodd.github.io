                  </hi> I am the wife of George Smithers, we keep a beer shop in Artillery-lane, Bishopsgate. On Wednesday evening, the 1st of Sept., the prisoner came in and said, "I want a pint of ale if you can give me change for a half-sovereign"—she gave me a good half-sovereign—I went to my husband who was sitting in the bar parlour, gave it to him, and got from him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when I came back the prisoner said, "I find I shall not want the change now, I have got enough coppers"—I said, "Then I suppose you want your half-sovereign back"—she said, "Yes"—I went to my hus<lb></lb>band, got the half-sovereign, and returned it to the prisoner—she put it into a little purse, began fumbling about in her pocket, and said, "I find now I have not got enough, I must have change now"—she laid down a half-sovereign—I took it up, and found it was not the one she gave me first, by its dulness—I said, "Ma'am this is not the one you gave me first"—she did not say anything—my husband came out and took the half-sovereign—he said, "I am used to these things, I have been acquainted with these things before, this is decidedly bad, shall I cut it in half"—she said, "Yes, and let me go," and was making a rush towards the door—I shut the door, and said to my husband, "You had better not cut it"—I said to the prisoner, "You cannot go"—a tall man, five feet ten inches high, came in with a half-crown for change, and wanted a glass of ale—I served him, gave 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the half-crown, and my husband gave him 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he made a bother about the halfpenny—he went close to the prisoner—I saw something pass to his hand, and heard silver rattle in his pocket—he went out and looked in at the window.</p>

                  </hi> I am the husband of last witness. I was sitting in the bar parlour, on Wednesday evening, the 1st of Sept.—my wife asked me for change for a half-sovereign—it was a Victoria one, quite new—I ex<lb></lb>amined it, found it was good, and gave her silver—she took it to the bar, and handed it over to the prisoner—my wife came to me again, and said, "The woman says she don't want the change"—I gave her the half-sovereign back—in a few minutes she came back, and said, "She does want the change," and gave me a bad half-sovereign—I went to the prisoner, told her it was a bad one, and asked her what she called it—she said it was a good one, and she began to cry—I said, "Will you allow me to cut this good half-sovereign, as you call it, in two"—she said, "Yes; and let me go"—my wife, and the customer said I had better not cut it—my wife sent for an officer—a tall man came in, and went near to the prisoner in the darkest part of the shop—I gave the bad half-sovereign up to the inspector, at the station—after I had marked it he gave it me back—I gave it to my wife—she gave it to the officer when he came again—this is it.</p>

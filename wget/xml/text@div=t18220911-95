I went to bed about twelve o'clock that night, leaving the prisoner alone in the dining room, where the desk was. She was standing by the sideboard where the bed candlesticks stood. I had a daughter ill at the time - she had gone to bed about an hour after; I had been up stairs about half an hour - I went from my room into my daughter's to get something from her drawers. I saw the prisoner about two steps from the top of the stairs, coming up; her bed room joined mine, and is up four pair of stairs; she caught by the banisters of the stairs, and made a noise as if very much agitated - she had a candle; I asked what was the matter - she said she was tired; I told her not to make such a noise. I went into my bed room, and thought I heard somebody at my door; I opened it and found she was at my daughter's door just adjoining; she said she had put out her candle, and that my daughter was giving her out a light; she went to her own room. About two o'clock in the afternoon of the next day, which was Sunday, I saw Captain Drew's writing desk; (the prisoner had gone out a few minutes before one o'clock.) The desk was in its usual place, with the lock next the window; I lifted it up and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110051"></xptr>put a table cloth under it to press, and it opened. I took it into the front parlour, and locked it up in a cupboard, of which I kept the key. Captain Drew had gone out on Saturday night, and returned on Sunday morning - he was not at home many minutes - and then went out to dinner; this was before I found the desk open. I did not see him till next morning at breakfast; as I had gone to bed before he came home. I produced his desk to him exactly in the same state as I took it from the dining room table. In consequence of what passed, a Bow-street officer was sent for - he searched the servants, and all parts of the house. Miss Butler was in her bed room, and had not been down that morning; when he had searched all but her room, I went to tell her, and found her door was locked; I knocked at it, and got in in about ten minutes; I stood just within the door, and requested her to dress herself - and when she had done so, I called the officer up, and saw him search her drawer. I saw two 5 l. notes found in the rosette of the bed, at the top of the bed post - the officer took them; there was a clasp of a pocket-book found in her drawer, which I had seen in a pocket-book of hers before; she had brought it down a few days before and shewed it me. When it was found it was separate from the book, it looked like silver. I did not hear her say where she got any of the money.</p>

            . I am a master mariner. In August last, I boarded and lodged at Mr. Cotterell's. The prisoner boarded there at the same time. I received sixteen 5 l. Bank notes from Messrs. Grotes. I have no memorandum of my own, of the particulars. I had seven of them in my possesion on Saturday the 10th of August; I went out on that evening, and immediately before I went out, I said in the prisoner's presence that it was too much money to take out in my pocket, and I would put it in my desk - I took three sovereigns out of the notes, and put the seven notes in my desk in the dining room in her presence. A gentleman who dined with me, and was going out with me (I believe Mr. Cotterell's daughter), and a Mr. Briscoe were present. I locked my desk, and am positive I left it locked, and took the key with me - it was a common lock, and new about a week before. I came home the following day, about one o'clock, and did not look at my desk at all. I stopped at home about twenty minutes, changed my dress, and went out again - I slept out that night, and came home about eight o'clock next morning, and about nine I saw Mrs. Cotterell, who produced my desk to me from the cupboard in the other room, which was locked, and found the desk open. On laying it open, I missed my penknife; I searched further, and missed the notes from under the place where I kept the pen knife. I desired Mrs. Cotterell to call the servants up, which she did - I told her to keep them all in the parlour till I returned. I went to Bow-street, and brought an officer - all the servants and Mrs. Cotterell were searched; nothing was found on them. The desk had evident marks of being broken open. I remained below while the officer went up to Miss Butler's room. He asked Mrs. Cotterell to go up and sit in her room till he came up. Some money and Bank notes were found - they then called me into the room. She disclaimed all knowledge of the two 5 l. Bank notes found in the bed; but said the sovereigns were her own. I have heard of another 5 l. note being found.</p>

            . On the 10th of August, I was servant to Mrs. Cotterell. Miss Butler was the last person up except myself - I met her on the first floor stairs, as she was going to bed; my mistress had gone to bed about half an hour. After Miss Butler went to bed she rung the bell twice very violently, and asked if I had seen her pocketbook, for she had put it on the bed, and afterwards she said she put it under the bed. She told me to look carefully for it, as she said I must have seen it if it had been moved out of the room. I am the only servant who goes up stairs - she said the keys of her drawers were in her pocketbook. I had never seen the pocket-book. She said she could not get at her night clothes for want of her keys. On the following day, as I was coming out of my mistress's room, I saw her. She said I must look for her pocketbook, for she had not a farthing of money, but what was there; this was between twelve and one o'clock. She said she had found the keys of her drawers on the carpet; but she had no money, and I must find her pocket-book. She went out before dinner, and returned between nine and ten o'clock at night. She had not been out between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you not find her a key - A. I got her three keys on Saturday night, and one of them opened her drawer.

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On Monday, the 12th of August, I went to the house, to search. I produce the desk - force had been used to it at some time or other. I cannot say whether it was opened by force or not. I searched the servants as well as Mrs. Cotterell, also the boxes and rooms, but found nothing. I sent Mrs. Cotterell up to the prisoner's room, and when she gave me notice I went in and told Miss Butler that Mr. Drew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110052"></xptr>had been robbed; that I had searched the servants and lodgers, and also Mrs. Cotterel and the rooms, and requested leave to search hers - she consented. The first place I examined was the top drawer of a chest of drawers, and in that I found four parcels of money wrapped in paper, and sealed up - the prisoner opened the first paper, which contained twenty sovereigns. I have the papers of some of them, but cannot distinguish them. Part of the money was given to the prisoner. Another paper contained 20 s. in silver, and another 10 s. in silver, all in shillings; there was another with ten sixpences; there were two loose sovereigns, 4 s. in silver, and 4 d. in copper, in the same drawer - it was a single chest of drawers. She was present at the search. I saw a clasp in the drawer where the money was, which Mrs. Cotterell has since delivered me. (The clasp was here produced, which Mrs. Cotterell identified as the same she spoke of). I proceeded in my search; no person told me where to look. I did not find any thing more at that moment, but left the room, for Mrs. Cottrell to search the prisoner. After she had done this, I was called in again, and recollecting there were parts of the room I had not searched, I commenced again. I searched the bed furniture - nobody assisted me. At the foot of the bed, in the drapery, there were three rosettes - I put my hand on the one on the right hand, and felt something rattle; I felt the next, to see if they were stuffed with paper, when Mrs. Cotterell directly said,</p>
               <p>"What is that rattling in the rosettes?" and put her hand to it, taking hold of the outside. I examined it, and took out two 5 l. Bank notes, which I marked at the time and produce; they were doubled up separately, not in any envelope. I asked the prisoner if she knew how they came there; she said she knew nothing of them, they were not hers. She said the money was her own, and she had had it by her some time, three weeks or a month; she did not say from whom she had it. The paper containing the sovereigns was a printed report, dated only a few days previous. Another 5 l. note came into my possession on the 27th of August, and I went with a Mr. Price, a surgeon of Kensington, to Tothill Fields, where the prisoner was, about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She was in bed when you first went to the house - A. I understood so. She did not know I was searching the people below. I found Mrs. Cotterell in the room; I saw somebody search the bed clothes before Mrs. Cotterell went to it, but not the furniture; I stood looking at them while they moved the bed clothes. The prisoner told the Magistrate that the money was sealed up as a provision to take her to France.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Grote and and Co. On the 26th of July I paid Mr. Drew 180 l., in eight notes of 10 l., sixteen of 5 l., and 20 l. in gold - the 5 l. notes were numbered from 17035 to 17050 inclusive, and all dated the 19th of June, 1822; they lay in regular order when paid to him - the lowest number being the top note - (looks at No. 17044, 17047, and 17048, 5 l. notes) - these are three of them; date and all correspond. I have the book in which they are entered by myself.</p>
               <p>MR. DREW. I received sixteen 5 l. notes from the banker's; I kept them in the order I took them; I paid away the eight first the day I received them, for seamen's wages; I took them regularly from the top; I paid away another on the day of the robbery; I took the outside one to pay that, but which outside I cannot say - it must have been been either No. 17043 or 17050 - I put the remaining seven in my desk, and did not miss them at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where had you kept them - A. They were always in my possession. I think they were in my desk till the day of the robbery, and I put them into my pocket on that day, expecting to leave town. I am sure I paid away the eight top ones, beginning with the lowest number. I paid them at the Seamen's Register-office, on the Commercial-road. I never gave two 5 l. notes to one individual. I went there straight from the banker's.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Kensington. On Sunday, the 11th of August, I sold a bottle of lavender water to the prisoner. I have no doubt of her. It was, as near as I can recollect, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; it cost 2 s. 6 d. She tendered a 5 l. note - (looking at No. 17044) - this is it. I wrote on it, No. 8, St. James's-place, St. James's-street; that was the address she gave me. She said Mrs. Gray was the person she took the note from, but that she herself lived in St. James's-place; that Mrs. Gray kept a school at Brook Green. The lavender water was in a very remarkable bottle - (looks at one) - this is it. I went with Ellis to Tothill-fields afterwards, and saw the prisoner in bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You do not mean to be positive to the prisoner's person - A. It is very painful to say so, but I am positive. My shop is open on Sundays. I was not told I was going to see the person who paid me the note. I gave her four sovereigns, and 17 s. 6 d. in silver, consisting of half-crowns, shillings, and about eight sixpences.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mr. Morison, a chemist at Kensington. To the best of my belief, the prisoner is the person I saw on a Sunday in August - the latter end, I think. A gentleman called next day, about a smelling bottle which the person left behind her.</p>

            . I am a pastry-cook and live at Kensington. I think the prisoner was the person who was in my shop one Sunday, about a month ago - I think it was the 11th of

             asked me to change a 5 l. note. I said I could not. She said she had been putting her little boy to school, and wanted change to go back by the stage. She was only in my shop a little time, but I think the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. What time was it - A. Between six and seven o'clock in the evening - I think it was nearly dark.</p>

               <p>- HODGES. I am a bootmaker, and live in Piccadilly. The prisoner came to lodge at my house on the 12th of July, and left on the 2d of 
               <persName id="t18220911-95-person957">August. She</persName>
             told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110053"></xptr>she was going. She did not board with me. She owed me six guineas, and did not pay.</p>
               <p>The prisoner read an exceeding long defence, much of which was in so weak a tone of voice as to be quite inaudible. From what could be collected, it went to deny any knowledge whatever of the robbery - that the money found in her possession she had received from a person, but whose name, from a delicacy to the family, nothing should induce her to disclose, although promises of the prosecution being given up were made to her, if she would disclose the source from which she received it. That when the officer was searching her drawers, Mrs. Cotterell stood within a few inches of the rosette, apparently looking for her pocket book, and then directed the officers' attention to the rosette; and that she left her bed-room door open on Sunday, which was no indication of her guilt, if the property was in her possession.</p>
               <p>MRS. COTTERELL re-examined. I know the prisoner brought the bottle of lavender water home on Sunday night, and left it on the table. I put it on the mantlepiece, and gave it to the officer. I dare say her door was open on Sunday. I did not point out the rosette to the officer.</p>

            . I saw the bottle of lavender water in her hand on Sunday evening, when I let her in. I do not know what she did with it. Her bed room door was always left open. I searched on and under the bed, in her absence on Sunday, for the pocket book, but not on the top; it has never been found.</p>
               <p>MRS. COTTERELL. The clasp produced is the one I saw on her pocket book. She brought it down one morning, saying,</p>
               <p>"See how this little rogue has broken my pocket book!" I did not suspect that the desk was broken open; I thought Mr. Drew had left it open. The notes were not visible till the rosette was turned down; they were completely inside.</p>
               <p>- HODGES re-examined. When the prisoner left me, she owed six guineas. She had promised to pay me several times in the course of the week.</p>

            . I am a porter. I brought a letter with money in it to the prisoner, about three weeks before she was taken, from Boodle's club-house.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where is your stand - A. I have an apartment. Mrs. Butler sent me to Boodle's for an answer to a letter; she then lodged at a china shop in Piccadilly. I lodged in Bury-street at that time. I will not swear it was not six weeks before she was taken up; she was three weeks at a bootmaker's, and it was about a week before that. I often went on messages for her. The letter I carried to her seemed to have both notes and money in it. I cannot swear what was in it, for I gave it her in the drawing room, and she took it into the bed room, and broke it open, but by the feel I thought so. I always went on her errands.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you feel the letter, to see if there was money in it - A. It was hard, and felt as if there was notes and money in it; it felt hard and soft, and was sealed several times round.</p>

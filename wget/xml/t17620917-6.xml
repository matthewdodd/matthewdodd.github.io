I heard her say she had lived with Mr. Smith, and apothecary in Hackney six years. She was sent down stairs in order to have some refreshment, and staid between two and three hours. After she was gone, my people missed the things mentioned in the indictment: We had a strong suspicion of her. I sent to Hackney, and was informed there was no apothecary of that name there. By mere accident we heard she lodged in Piccadilly, where we found her. We charged her with taking the spoons. She at first denied it; but after she was committed to Bridewell on suspicion, she confessed she had taken them, and sold them to a silversmith in the Haymarket; who owned he had bought such of her, but had melted them down.</p>

She desired me to draw her some small beer, which when I went to do, I suppose she took the spoons mentioned, which were lying in the kitchen.</p>

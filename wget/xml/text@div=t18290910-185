            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner; he said he had taken up the lead pipe to put down iron, and had taken off the locks to mend.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was to lay the pipe from the main to my house; the pipe was rather in the ground - the locks I took off to get keys.</p>
               <p>MRS. HARRIS re-examined. Q. Suppose he had to lay down the water pipe, was it necessary to remove the other? A. No, he was to lengthen it to run into the yard, to make a lodging-house of it.</p>

I hardly had time to speak when he had got my pocket book out of my inside breast coat pocket. I held him for a time, he scuffled and got away from me. I cried stop thief, he ran across the street, a man catched him by the collar; I was close to him all the time, and never lost sight of him. I saw the pocket book in his hand just as he got from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with your pocket book - A. That I do not know, I have never recovered it. I thought the first man that catched him got the pocket book, he did not like to come forward to prosecute; he came with us to the watchhouse but refused to come forward to prosecute.</p>

            . I am houseman to Castle Baynard ward. I was coming from my benefit Society last Monday week, and just as I got to the corner of Union-street a man had got hold of the prisoner; I said I am an officer, you assist me, and I will assist you. The prosecutor came up, he said he had been robbed of his pocket book, and forty-nine pounds in bank notes, and small bills and other things mounted to sixty or seventy pounds.</p>

On the 30th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going into my shop, and met the prisoner going out; I asked her whether she was served - she said she wanted some calico; I saw the stuff hanging down under her shawl; I told her to come back to the counter, and she should be served; she had a basket in her hand. I was called to another part of the shop to answer a question; I returned, and she was gone. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182512080056"></xptr>ran after her; she appeared confused; I said, "You are not served, come back, and you shall be served." I called Parry to serve her, and I stood behind her; when she put her hand into her pocket for her money, I saw the end of the stuff sticking out; a part of it was under her shawl. - I sent for an officer, and gave her into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you observe whether she was intoxicated? A. I did not notice - she seemed confused, and called for her sister. I did not notice whether she appeared wandering in her mind. I understand she has borne a good character. She appeared to put questions and answers in a rational way.</p>

            . I am the shopman. I was called to serve the prisoner with some calico; I showed her a piece at 61/2d.; she asked me to cut off two yards, lay it upon the shelf, and she would call in ten minutes for it; I took hold of her, and found the stuff - I said, "It is ours" - she said she did not know how it came there. It had been shown to a customer that evening. She did not appear to me to be confused at all.</p>

            . I live at the Castle Tavern, King-street, Cheapside - I am cook there. I have known the prisoner two years - she has had a hurt on her head, and was quite deranged on Wednesday week, when she called on me. - I have seen her for two or three days together, quite deranged, in consequence of being robbed and beaten dreadfully by a man, who was tried here for it. When she called on me that morning, she said her husband was dying, and she did not know whether she should make away with herself.</p>
               <p>Another witness gave the prisoner an excellent character, and engaged to take her under her care.</p>

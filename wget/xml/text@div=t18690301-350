                  </hi>. I am a wholesale provision merchant, and formerly carried on business in my own name, but it has been turned into a limited company, which for the last eleven months has occupied a stable and loft on the other side of Danes' stable—Tongue has been employed there about seven months, as horse keeper—he had the keys of the stable and loft, and had full charge—I never knew anybody to assist him, unless it was one of our boys—it was pretty well all he had to do—he ought to have slept at home—he did not deep in the loft, to my knowlege—I have noticed that the horses got thin and out of condition—about twelve horses were generally kept there—I put myself in communication with the police, and was present when some oats were marked, but did not see the whole of them marked—I saw some beans cut and marked on a Wednesday, about 13th or 14th February, in our Ware-house, 24, St John Street, but I did not see what was done with them—I have been shown some beans found in Danes' stable, and identified them as a portion of what I saw marked.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Crosse-examined. Q.</hi> Had Tongue been in your service, on and off, for twenty years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I considered him a very honest, industrious, steady man—there was a break of two or three years, but he has been back some years—I had no idea that during me absence in the day-time a man was left on the premises with the keys—I have said that a boy sometimes assisted him in turning the wheel, but no man has been em<lb></lb>ployed by me to assist him—I have twelve horses in the yard—it is called New Inn. Old Bailey—Tongue has been employed there between six and eight months, and it is only latterly that I have had complaints of the condition of the horses—I was examined before the Magistrate, and I may have said, "We have occupied the stable about eleven months; throughout the whole of that time I have complained of the condition of our horses"—if those words were taken down, most likely I said them—I did not notice it the first two or three months, but I heard other people make remarks—I think Tongue is married—there was no necessity for him to sleep in the stable, as he lived in the neighbourhood.</p>

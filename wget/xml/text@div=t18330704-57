            , No. 14, Poultney-street, White Conduit-fields. I am eleven years and a half old; I have known the prisoner two years and a half, he <rs id="t18330704-57-deflabel292" type="occupation">kept the toll gate in Hackney-road</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18330704-57-defend631 t18330704-57-deflabel292"></join>, and when we lived in Hackney-road, I bacame acquainted with him. My mother takes in washing - I go to fetch the dirty linen, and take the things home to the customers, and receive the money, which I ought to take home to my mother. I have given the prisoner a great many half crowns - I gave them to him because he persuaded me to do so; I remember the month of December, it is six months ago - I gave him some then, he told me he wanted to go to the country to see his father and mother, and when he came back, he would return it to me. I told him it was my mother's money, and we wanted it at home; when I went home I told my mother I had no money - I gave him a shirt in December - I did not give it to him, he took it out of my bundle and said it would just do for him to wear; I said it was too large for him; he said if it was he would pledge it. I asked what pledging was, he said, "Taking it to the shops where you see watches hanging in the window, come here, and I will show you one;" he took it to Mr. Harris's, pawned it for four shillings and kept the money - he used to meet me when I went out with my mothers' linen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You are nearly as old as he is? A. He is older than I am, Sir; he took the shirt from me against my will, I am sure of that - the money had never been in my mother's possession at all; I went to the pawnbroker's with him and stood outside, while he went in and pawned the shirt - I wanted to get it from him, he stole it from me against my will; I did not want him to take it, nor give him leave to take it - I did not tell my mother of it when I went home, for fear she should beat me - he took the half-crowns from me against my will.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he have a shirt of you on the 7th of December? A. Yes Sir, and two half-crowns; I did not give them to him; he would not let me pass - he never took any liberties with me.</p>

             NEWTON. I live in Bethnal-green. On Thursday evening, the 22nd of April, between seven and eight o'clock, I went down Shoreditch, to a Mr. Shippens, a linen-draper there. I purchased a shawl and a piece of cotton for a gown, for which I paid fifteen shillings. I left the house, and went on to Webb-square; there I met the prisoner; she asked me to give her something to drink. I went to the sign of the Crown, in Webb-square; there we had some porter and liquor to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you intoxicated - A. I was as sober as I am now. I staid there till near ten o'clock. There was another woman in company which I know nothing of.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020013"></xptr>Q. Had you known Wetherall before - A. I never saw her to my knowledge before, and by the time I was leaving the house I was the worse for liquor; I told the prisoner. I would give her a shilling if she would see me home.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man - A. I am. I had the gown piece and shawl in my pocket. We went up Bethnal-green-road, as far as the turnpike, and at the turnpike she asked me for the shilling that I had promised her. I told her I was not at home; I had got to cross a field to go home. She refused going across the field, and left me. As soon as she went away I missed the gown piece, and the shawl. I did not go after her that night. The next day, about one o'clock, I went again to the house in Webb-square. I saw the prisoner and the other woman in the tap-room. I accused the prisoner of taking the parcel from me. She denied it. She said she saw it. I had it in my pocket when she left me. As I could not get any information from her I went home. On Thursday following I mentioned it to my wife and a young woman that lodges in my first floor. We all three went to the public-house in Webb-square. We mentioned the affair to the landlord; he sent for the prisoner. He said he knew if she had got it, he could get it; and when she came she was accused of it several times. She stedfastly denied it. I then left the house, and went to work.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH JONES. On Thursday, the 29th of April, I went to the public-house with Newton and his wife to Webb-square. When Newton was gone, Mrs. Newton and me we knew she had got it by her countenance. She denied it a great many times. The landlord came into the room; she told the prisoner to give up the duplicates if she had them; he said he hoped it would be the better for her. She gave me two duplicates. I looked at them, and gave them into Mrs. Newton's hand. Mrs. Newton was angry with her husband; she said she would not be seen in it. I gave them to Mr. Newton when he came home. The prisoner said she would not have done it had he given her the shilling that he had promised her.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I got the tickets of Mrs. Jones when I returned home in the evening.</p>

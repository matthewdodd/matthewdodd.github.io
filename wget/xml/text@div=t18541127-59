                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at No. 8, Whitmore-road, Hoxton. On Thursday evening, 19th Nov., between 8 and 9 o'clock, I was in company with the deceased, William Henry Cooling, in Charles-place, Hoxton New-town; we were standing conversing together at the corner—I heard some person behind make some observation; I do not know exactly what the words were, but I know it was passed upon our collars—I turned round and saw the prisoner, and others with him, close by—we went up to them, and the deceased spoke to the prisoner, but I do not know what he said—a few words passed between them; I do not know what they were—the prisoner made use of a very bad expression, upon which the deceased struck him in the face with his fist—they immediately closed together—the prisoner lowered his head to the deceased's belly, and with the assistance of his arms he gave him a very heavy fall—they fell together, the deceased undermost—he laid flat, with his arms stretched out, and his head on one side; I did not see him move; he could not get up—I raised him up—his cap had fallen off in the scuffle—he fell in a kind of gutter; there are large pebble stones there—while he was lying there, the prisoner remarked that he was only shamming—he afterwards went for a doctor—the deceased was rather taller than the prisoner; he was just such another youth as I am, about an inch shorter.</p>

               <p>called to No. 54, Chart-street, Hoxton, about 9 o'clock, on Thursday night, 19th Nov.—I found the deceased lying insensible on the floor, from the effects of a blow at the back of the head; there was a large tumour, about the size of a hen's egg, at the back of the head on the right side—I opened the head, and underneath that tumour I found a quantity of blood effused, between the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> and the brain, which caused the death—a fall on the back of the head would be likely to produce that.</p>

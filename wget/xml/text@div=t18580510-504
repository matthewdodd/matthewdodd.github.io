               <p>Head Court—I did not hear the commencement, but I came to my door, and the policeman and a young woman were quarrelling—he said, "Don't be so fast"—he gave a whistle, and she flew at him, and struck him in the face—Shea was then standing by the side—after she struck him, the prose<lb></lb>cutor seized her, and said, "You shall not go," and they had a struggle, and then Shea seemed to join in—he seemed as if he joined in to prevent it—my principal thing was to protect my window, and the mob moved on—I saw no attempt at robbery whatever—they moved into the road, one house from mine— I did not see the end of the struggle—they fought in the road—they appeared to be down on the ground in the road, and when they got up, the prosecutor had a young man in one hand, and a young woman in the other—I did not see any watch hanging out—I did not see any chain—there was a mob collected, a crowd perhaps of fifty persons—they had passed the window, and I paid no further attention.</p>

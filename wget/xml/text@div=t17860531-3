               <p>I am journeyman to Mr. Taylor, I was in the shop; between five and six, the prisoner and another woman came into our shop to buy a pair of leather pumps, I am sure to the prisoner, my master was in the parlour drinking tea, there is a large glass window that looks into the shop, the boots hung on a chair, the prisoner was leaning on the left hand side of the chair where the boots hung, she bid me threepence less than the selling price, after I had fitted her with a pair; my master sent me to tell them they should have them for two shillings and ten-pence, they were two houses off, I did not observe they had any thing particular about them then, and they said they would not have them at all, when I came back my master went into the parlour to drink another cup of tea, and in about three minutes he came out and missed the boots, then he sent me after them, I took both the women in Rosemary-lane, I said nothing to them, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310008"></xptr> were coming towards the street that my master lives in, and the prisoner had the boots under her cloak, I was sure she had them, though her cloak was so very much confined I could perceive the heel under her cloak, I clapped her on the shoulder, says I, where are the boots you stole; she said, I have no boots; then she dropped one, and I picked it up, and brought her into the shop, and we found the other boot under her clothes, which I brought into the shop with her; I am sure this is the woman, those are the boots.</p>
               <p>Have they been in your possession ever since? - Not ever since, I left them upon my master's table last night till this morning, I am sure these are the boots.</p>
               <p>Taylor. I can swear to these boots, my own name is inside.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>There was a woman with me, and that woman gave me the boots.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the prisoner in a situation best calculated to take the boots, or was the other? - I think it was hardly possible the other woman could take them, she had a child on her left arm where the boots hung, and this woman had nothing but a cloak on, and stood as close as possible, and she urged the other woman to go.</p>
               <p>What may be the value of these boots? - I valued them at a guinea, the price is twenty-seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Court to prisoner. Are you married or single? - Single, my Lord.</p>

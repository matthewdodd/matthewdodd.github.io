                  </hi>. I am a scum-hoiler, and live at Jamaica-place, Lime-house, about half a mile from Labour-in<lb></lb>vain-street. I know the house, No. 6, Labour-in<lb></lb>vain-street—my mistress took the house—nobody lived in it but the pri<lb></lb>soner and deceased—there was a private still in the back room down stairs—on Tuesday morning, the 2nd of June, a little after seven o'clock—the prisoner came to my house—I asked him what was the matter—he said his wife was dead, that he sent her home at one o'clock, he came home at three o'clock, and found she had fallen down stairs and broken her neck—I said, "Have you told any one?"—he said, "Only one party"—he did not men-tion who—he said, "I am now going to tell her mother"—as he was going out of the door be turned round and said, "For God's sake bear a hand to get away those things, for I do not wish to do you any harm, nor any one else"—I understood him to mean the still—he said he had left the back door un<lb></lb>astened, that I could get in and get the things out the back way—I and my mis<lb></lb>tress went to No. 6, Labour-in<lb></lb>vain-street—I went through No. 7, and got in at the the lower win<lb></lb>dow of No. 6—there was no fastening to the lower win<lb></lb>dow I am certain, never since we had it—I occupied the two rooms down stairs, and the prisoner had the two upper rooms—we did not live there, but occupied the two lower rooms for the still—that was not his place, but there was no lock upon any of the doors—he could go wherever he liked—the pri<lb></lb>soner or deceased had nothing to do with the still in my absence—I got the things out, and handed them to my mistress—there was a piece of iron used by me in the house—I was there at three o'clock on Monday, and put three iron hoops on a tub in the front room, with the piece of iron which I used instead of a hammer—I left about three o'clock, and left it upon the tub in the front room—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my wife was there until seven o'clock—the still was worked in the daytime—no person was left in charge of the still when I was away—it never worked when I was away, except my mistress was there—I never worked it myself—I am positive I left this iron upon the tub, the bottom of the tub, which was turned upside down—when I got to the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DANIEL</hi> Ross. I am a surgeon, and live in High-street, Shadwell. On Tuesday morning, the 2nd of June, I was sent for to a house in Labour-in<lb></lb>vain-street—I found the deceased lying on the floor, with her head on the mat, which has been produced, and her legs slightly inclined towards the foot of the stairs—the body was not lying so direct across the passage as it is represented in this plan—the head and left shoulder touched the skirting-board, and the feet were slightly inclined towards the stairs—she was some distance from the foot of the stairs—this other sketch is more like the posi<lb></lb>tion—her feet were about a foot from the stairs, taking a direct line across the passage from the stairs—I had her taken up stairs, (before that I had observed marks of violence)—I examined her person, and found on the head, cheek, and nose six marks—they put on the appearance of a dried state of the skin—it resembled very much like when a blister bad been applied to a child just previous to death—it was a very slight scratch on the nose—n the back of the head, rather at the right side, was a wound of a somewhat triangular shape, of a jagged and lacerated appearance—the bone was bare—it was through the scalp to the bone—the scalp was about a quarter of an inch thick—the wound took an upward direction—that wound itself was not the cause of death, but the skull was fractured at the part where the wound was—I have no doubt the rupture of the vessel of the brain was the cause of death—it is called the longitudinal sinus—there was nothing about her person to account for death, except that wound—I examined the staircase and the parts where she was lying, but saw nothing to account for that wound, supposing she had fallen down stairs—there was no hard substance on the mat on which she might have fallen to wound herself—there were no bannisters to the stairs—there were no projections against which the head could have gone while she was tumbling down stairs, except the stairs themselves—they were wooden stairs—there was no carpet on them—I examined them mi<lb></lb>nutely—if the wound had been caused by the head going against the stairs, I shpuld expect to find marks of blood on the stairs.</p>

               <p>necessarily have stunned her, and in the rupture of a vessel so large, death must have been almost instantaneous—that would certainly depend upon the mo<lb></lb>mentum of the body—it is possible that the injury might have been caused by a blow on the stairs, and yet there might be no blood on the stairs, but according to my judgment it is improbable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the blow bad occurred on one of the higher stairs, in your opinion must there have been blood on some of the stairs, if she fell down the rest—How many stairs were there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were thirteen stairs—they were narrow and rather steep—she was a woman of middling height—if she had fallen backwards, I should have expected the wound to have taken a downward direction—had she fallen the other way, it would take an upward direction—the edge of the stairs would cut the back of the skull—supposing she was coming down stairs, and fell forwards, it would have taken an upward direction—if she missed her footing, or fell through intoxication, and struggled to help herself, it is possible she might have fallen so as to receive a wound in an upward or downward direction—I do not think the edge of the stairs would have produced such a wound----there was a minor wound beneath the larger wound—a portion of sound skin intervened, and the covering of the bone being removed as well as the scalps made me arrive at my opinion—the scalp was penetrated by two wounds—, there were two lacerated wounds—a vein was broken—it bled, internally beneath the membranes of the brain—that would press on the brain and destroy life—the vein itself was ruptured—it was a very strong vein—it would require considerable force to break a vein of that kind—examined the skirting-board, by the side of which the body was lying—the head war touching the skirting-board—I discovered no marks there—I examined thei front room up stairs, where the bed was, and perceived signs of vomiting which smelt very strong—I have no doubt it was the vomiting of a drunken; person—there was an impression on the bed, but it did not appear as if any<lb></lb>body had been in it—it was on the floor—it was a dirty foot-mark on it, and the sheet laid smoothly over it—the impression did not appear recent—the sheet was over it smoothly—I discovered some blood on the stocking of deceased's right leg, externally—there was no internal wound to account fdir, that—there was a great deal of blood on the matting, one portion of which; was dry, and the other in a fluid state—it was partly congested and partly dried—where the surface was only slightly covered with blood, it was dry, but where there was a good deal it remained moist—she appeared to have been dead from four to six hours—blood will flow some few days after death—I am not prepared to say How long exactly—there were three or four other mats in the passage, as well as the matting—I examined them, and discovered no appearance of blood on them—I examined the prisoner's jacket,—here are marks of blood about the arm—if my attention had not been called to it I should not have noticed it now, but when I saw it it was quite a bright red—it is on the outer part of the sleeve, particularly in the bend of the arm, and there was some on the left collar—there was some blood just outside the pocket—I do not think there was any inside—I examined his waistcoat, and found blood on the collar, on the left side, the same side as the pocket of the jacket—I examined the prisoner's hand—he had no wound which would have occasioned this blood—if the prisoner had lifted up the deceased's head, the wound in such a state would have occasioned blood marks on his person, if the blood was still flowing from the head; and blood might have been contracted by the blood left on the matting, supposing his hand to have gone on it—blood would flow from the head if it was raised some time after the blow was struck—I was present at thetime Dr. Leathby made experiments on the blood, but am not sufficiently acquainted with the tests to give an</p>

               <p>opinion—I have seen the piece of iron—the wound might have been inflicted by that—the same wound could have been inflicted by the toe of a heavy boot—the toe of this boot, shown me by Sergeant Thurgood, might have produced the wound—in addition to the blood I have described, there were two or thee distinct jets of blood on the sleeve of his jacket—Dr. Leathby made experi<lb></lb>ments upon them—some of them were scraped off by him—I did not observe any artery ruptured—I did not examine the artery—it was a vein—I did not trace any artery—I am aware of the difference between the rupture of an artery and that of a vein—from an artery the blood would spirt out—I did not not observe the rupture of any single artery in the body on examining it—arterial is of a different colour to venous blood, but venous blood becomes heightened in colour when exposed to the air—when arterial blood spirts from an artery it takes a course—none would descend in drops, all would go up in a stream—the blood from an artery puts on an elliptical appearance and co<lb></lb>agulates at the bottom—that is exactly the same as a drop which descends sideways—I am not prepared to say that there is anything particular in the mark one drop would make from another, only the blood from an artery comes in a distinct splash, and the other in a continual stream—I saw the jets of blood on the jacket in Dr. Leathby's presence—I am not prepared to swear whether it is arterial blood or venous—I first saw this instrument in the morning—I did not fit it to the wound—it might produce the wound—any instrument or contusion might have done the same—I went to apply the toe of the boot to the wound, but decomposition had advanced so that it was impossible to have said if the wound was inflicted by that—it might have caused the wound—the sides of the triangular wound were nearly equal, two inches on each side—most contused lacerated wounds of the head put on a triangular shape—a wound from a stick might produce a triangular shape—there is nothing particular in that shape—a wound inflicted by the edge of the stairs, or any blunt instrument, might have been triangular—whether the body comes to the instrument, or the instrument to the body, it would pro<lb></lb>duce the same appearance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you first saw the woman, had she a cap on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I saw a cap up stairs—I saw nothing particular about it—the woman had not a great quantity of hair behind—it was down—it was not long hair—she was a middling-sized woman—I do not think she was so tall as five foot eight—supposing she had fallen down stairs violently from top to bottom, I found nothing to account for it, except the laceration of which I have spoken—I found no other wound—a person descending in that way, and tumbling against a projecting surface, would account for the wound I saw—the edge of the stair is a rounded substance—whether she fell backwards or forwards, it would account for that wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it is probable that all these injuries might have been on the body of the woman, if she fell down stairs and struck against the stairs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is possible all the symptoms might have occurred, but highly improbable.</p>

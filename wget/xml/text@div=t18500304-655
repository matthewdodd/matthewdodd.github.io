On 7th Feb., I was on duty in Mill-lane, Deptford—about half-past six in the morning, I saw a wagon drawn by three horses, driven by Taylor—it came out of Mrs. Shep<lb></lb>pard's premises—Taylor left the wagon and went up Thayer-street—directly he left, I jumped into the wagon, and saw a truss of hay—I had a book in my pocket—I took three leaves out, tore them in halves, and put three of the half leaves in the truss of hay, and the other three in my pocket—Taylor came back, and drove the wagon to the end of the lane; he there met Forster, they went in company together up the Broadway—I saw Carpenter, and told him what I had done—he told me to go to the World-Turned-Upside-Down in the Kent-road—I went, and waited in the yard about an hour and a half, when I saw Acott take a truss of hay and put it in the stables—I came out, and told Carpenter what I had seen—I went with him in the stables and found the truss with the leaves I had put in it—Taylor accompanied Forster up the road.</p>

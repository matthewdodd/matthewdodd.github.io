                  </hi>. I am a private marine. The prisoner Richmond is a marine—I know nothing of Simmons—Richmond slept in the same room with me—I had a pair of regimental boots, which were placed in my knapsack, over my bed—they were new—I had never worn them—I had paid 10<hi rend="italic">S</hi>. to the King for them—I missed them on Saturday morning—on the Friday night Richmond had wanted to purchase them of me, and offered me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—when I missed them, I went over the room with the serjeant—I challenged the prisoner with them, in the room—he said, "Hold your tongue, it is all right"—we went to the guard-room, and reported it—the constable afterwards found the boots—these are them.</p>

On Friday the 12th, at eleven o'clock at night, I heard the cry of "Stop thief," and apprehended the pri<lb></lb>soner Simmons, who was running with another person, and found the boots on his feet—I asked him where he got them, he said, "That is best knows to myself—I took him to the station, and he said he bad them from a marine, for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he paid for a pot of beer—I found the broad arrow on them, and gave information.</p>

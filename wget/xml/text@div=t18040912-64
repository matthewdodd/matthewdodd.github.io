A one pair of stairs room, it was a furnished lodging; I gave her two sheets to use, I saw her take them to the room, I went with her; I let her the room for sixpence a night; she staid there either one night, or two, and she brought the key; I told her to wait for me, to see whether the things were right; in going into the room, I saw the bed made, and the sheet was doubled, so as to resemble a pair of sheets; when I turned it down, there was only one, that I am sure of; I was not gone above three minutes to inspect the room, and when I returned she was gone; I have never seen the sheet again, nor the prisoner till she was taken up; I then told her to give me the duplicate, and I would take it out; she denied that she had took it, and I am sure that she stole it.</p>

            . I live in Great Poultney-street, near the square, and lost the goods mentioned in the indictment, [mentioning them by name] but can't tell the exact time; they were missing last Saturday, and some were found the same day, and the day after. I lost many more things than are in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Griffice. I took the prisoner into my house almost naked, she and her children. She had been with me, I believe, six weeks, and I had reason to suspect her.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutrix, and had the things mentioned in my care. I gave them out at different times for use in the house, and upon looking up the linen last Saturday they were missing. I taxed her with taking them away, but she said she'd swear she never wronged my mistress. She afterwards owned the taking them, and told us where they were; we went to the pawnbroker's and found them.</p>

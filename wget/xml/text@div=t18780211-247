I am a partner in the firm of Devas, Routledge, and Co., 20, Cannon Street—the prisoners were in our employ<lb></lb>ment, Walker as foreman of the cutters, whose duty was to overlook the clothing department; and Smith as a cutter—on Monday, 11th January, in consequence of information I received, Mr. Routledge, in Smith's presence, said to Walker "How do you account for the parcel that was taken out on Friday?"—he said "I bought it myself"—Mr. Routledge said "You had better be careful, as we know all about it; I have got evidence to refute that"—Walker then said "I had the clothes made up in the department and sold them to Smith for 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—a police<lb></lb>man was there and they were given into custody—our employes are allowed to purchase goods for themselves or friends, but not without a permit; if they got a permit they would be entered in due course, and when executed would go through the entering-room, just as in the case of an ordinary customer—they would not be allowed to leave the premises until paid for—there is a workman's door by which the workmen come in—it would be against the rule for parcels to go out at that door.</p>

               <p>January, about 10 minutes to 5, Smith came to me and wanted me to take an order in hand for him for a pair of black trousers and waistcoat—it passed over till Wednesday, and I declined to take it, as I had an order in hand from the firm at the time—it is usual for the workmen to have a permit from the firm if they want clothes made up, and I advised Smith to get a permit in the usual way—Walker afterwards brought me a sheet, and I cut out the things—on Friday, the 11th, as I was going down<lb></lb>stairs, I saw Arenberg going out with a parcel through the workmen's door, which I thought not the right way—I afterwards went to Chap<lb></lb>man's public-house, at the corner of Bow Lane—Smith came in with a parcel under his arm—I said "Have you got the stuff all right?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Have you paid for it?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Did you get a receipt?"—he said "No"—I said I thought he was a fool—we afterwards went to the Poulterers' Arms—I asked him to show me the goods, and he did so; they were the trousers and waistcoat that I had cut out—they are worth 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had made up his mind to give information to Mr. McPherson—he is the buyer and manager—I afterwards spoke to Mr. McPherson.</p>

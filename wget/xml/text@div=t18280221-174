On the 4th of January he was employed in thrashing wheat; I saw him come and open the barn door and let himself in- he had a little basket with a bit of victuals in it, I believe; about five o'clock he was leaving his work; I had been on the look out, and was then behind the door; I saw he had the same basket, and it looked very bulky; I called him back and said "What have you got;" he said "Nothing master, I have not indeed;" I said I would insist upon seeing - he sprung two yards from me - I sprung after him, took his basket, and found in it about a peck and a half of clean wheat; he said "Pray master forgive me - this is the first time;" after I took it, he got away, as I had no one to assist me; he was afterwards taken at Kingston - he lived at a place called Thorp, about two miles from Staines.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I gleaned it in the summer after my labour; I carried it home, and thrashed it out at my leisure; I took this wheat out to a mill to be ground, but there was no one there; I took it to the barn and left it with my clothes; when I went out with it my master said, "What have you got here?" I said, "Nothing of yours" - he took the basket down and said, "This is a pretty thing, is it not - don't shew your face here, I will hinder your working here, or any where else any more." I stopped to speak to a person, and my master went on - the next morning I heard of a job at Kingston, and I went there; my master had no wheat in that barn; I never said,"Master forgive me."</p>

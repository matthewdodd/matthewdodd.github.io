               <p>I am a master carman, I contract with the Victualling Office to carry whatsoever they shall want, and employ my men under me with several carts. I employed the prisoner, as I have done several times before, to carry from Tower Whan night butts to the Victualling Office. I helped to load them up the same day as laid in the indictment; soon after I had an information that he had carried them off; I met him and asked him what was become of those butts; he at the first stoutly denied that he knew any thing of the master; then he burst out a crying, and said, he would tell where they were; he said, they were in a place in Virginia Street, I went with him to this house; I looked through the crevice of the door, the door was partly open, there I saw the butts. I got assistance and forced open the doors and examined them, and saw the broad R, which is the mark upon all the king's stores stamped upon the hoops, and also upon the casks themselves near the bunghole; therefore I had no doubt that these were the same butts that were loaded up by the prisoner.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I am a carman. I saw in Church-Lane, Spitalfields, one of my master's carts with a load of butts upon it, and Ratford driving it: this place is out of the road from Tower Wharf to the Victualling Office. I met some other people, we drank some gin together: after we had finished the conversation the prisoner desired me, for God sake! not to say that I had seen him, for he would tell my master a story that the horses ran away, and so he was going round to the Victualling Office. I went and discovered the whole matter to my master.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>I just overtook the cart as he and this little lad came with the pitch-forks and shovels upon their shoulders; they said don't take notice to my master, I will go round Well-Close Square with them, and then to the office with them. Young Will Lane wrenched the whip out of my hand and drove the cart away, and he paid 6 d. at the bar; the butts were in the cart then.</p>

               <p>[The prisoner called a witness who gave him a good character.]</p>

Davis, Barber and Co. were known to us in business; the prisoner was a stranger. On the 14th of January he came to the shop, and said, "I want a superfine cloth to match a pattern," which he produced - it was brown woollen cloth; he said he wanted two yards and a quarter - he produced a bill of exchange, which was endorsed by Davis, Barber, and Co.; I asked if he came from them - he said he did: he said he wanted the cloth for them - I cut him off two yards and a quarter, which came to 1l. 18s. 3d.; I entered it to Davis, Barber, and Co., and delivered it to him - he was about ten minutes with me, I am certain of him - I saw him in custody about a week after; I have never found the cloth.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Tell us exactly what took place? A. He told me he came from Davis, Barber, and Howse, and I gave him a bill in their names; he said the cloth must be of a good quality, as their customer was particular; I cannot say that he said he wanted it for Davis, Barber, and Howse - he showed me a bill endorsed by them; I said, "Do you come from Davis, Barber, and Howse?" he said, "I do;" I would not have let him have it for himself.</p>

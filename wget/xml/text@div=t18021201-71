               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the girl leave your service? - A. On Wednesday, the 3d of December.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been with you? - A. She came to the house in May last.</p>
               <p> Can you tell, from any circumstance, what time in the morning she left your house? - A. About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you suppose it was about five o'clock? - A.Because our man was up, and saw her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first know she was gone? - A. About seven, when I got up, I found her dirty things lay straggling about in the parlour; I told my wife of it, I went up stairs with her, and we found the girl's bonnet there; we came down stairs again, I observed one of the drawers of the bureau open, my wife opened it, and missed some things out of it; then we went up stairs, and searched a chest of drawers; my wife missed three of her gowns; then we went to a cupboard, and she missed a yellow chip bonnet trimmed with black ribbon; my wife then observed the bottom drawer of the same chest rather open, she opened the drawers, and found one of her silk cloaks gone.</p>
               <p>Q. In short, you found a number of other articles gone? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At seven o'clock, when you got up, and found the prisoner gone, was it light or dark? - A. It was not quite light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, look to see which way she had gone out? - A. No; because the boy had taken down the shop shutters then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was nothing in the house which shewed any marks of violence by which she got out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure she was in your house the overnight? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she go to bed? - A.Between ten and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her between ten and eleven? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw her as if going to bed? - A. Yes; I saw her go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found your house had been fifted, what did you do? - A. She had a sweetheart at Brentford, I thought he might have some connection with this business; there was a Bench of Justices sitting, and I got a search-warrant, to search his premises, but found nothing; he offered his assistance to apprehend her, and on the Thursday we came to London.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your wife go with you? - A. No; I and this young man went together; we could not find her at any of the places she used to be at in town; then I heard she was gone to Hounslow; I did not find her there; on the Friday morning, I went to Brentsord, it struck me, that I would go to the Magpye, where this young man used, thinking she might write to him, to let him know where she was; when I got there, I saw the post-man giving him a letter in the bar, which he said, he would swear was her hand-writing; and I opened it, and found where she was; I then went to Bow-street, and took an officer with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that officer here? - A. No; he could not find her; then we went to the Almonry, Westminster, to look for her, according to the direction; I found her at a very bad house in the Almonry; I found she was there, and told the girl, that her sweetheart wanted to see her; her sweetheart went to her, and told me, he would take care of her; I then went to the office, and got Bly and Jones, two officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or any body in your presence, search the prisoner? - A. Yes, Bly pulled her things off, and I stood by to see what she had got.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found? - A. She had a pair of pockets belonging to my children.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of those pockets? - A. One shilling, perhaps, I cannot say; I then asked her where her mistress's silk cloak was, and she said, it laid in the window, pointing to the corner; Jones immediately went to the corner, and she said, it laid in the window, pointing to the corner; Jones immediately went to the corner, and took the cloak out of the window, and under that cloak laid the tell of the bundle of things; Bly took the things with him, he tied them in a bundle, and has had them ever since.</p>

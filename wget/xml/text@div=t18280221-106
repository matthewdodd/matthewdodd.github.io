I heard in about two or three months that he was married, and I told him that I had heard of it from two or three friends - sometimes he would say he was not married, and sometimes he said he had been, but his wife was dead - he once told me he had a letter, telling of his wife's death; I asked him to let me see it, but he never did.</p>

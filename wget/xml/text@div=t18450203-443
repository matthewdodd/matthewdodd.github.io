                  </hi>. I am a mechanical engineer. At the time of this robbery I lodged at the prisoner's house, No. 24, Charles St. Stepney—I rented one room of him—on Monday, the 6th of Jan., my wife and I were out—I went out about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and returned about a quarter past nine at night—I found my room door burst open, the bolt of the lock was about half an inch out, the bed was tumbled, the drawers broken open, and the lower drawer was on the ground, and things which had been in the drawers were distributed about the room—I missed the articles stated in the indictment—my wife went in next door to get a light, and the landlord and landlady of the Rose and Crown came in—immediately I saw what state the place was in I ran round to the pri<lb></lb>soner's sister's, where his mother resides, and where the prisoner sleeps—he has not slept in the house since I have been there, which is between four and five months—I did not find him at his sister's—I then went to the Thames-police station, and gave information of the robbery—two or three policemen came back with me—the prisoner's mother came in soon after—the prisoner came home about eleven o'clock—he said it was a bad job—I said it was, for I had lost a great many things, I was afraid every thing, but I did not know what at present—I said, "You had better go and see what you have lost"—he said, "Oh, I have nothing of any consequence to lose"—I said, "I think I have lost all I have got"—he did not go into his room that night in my presence—his mother did—he went away without going to his room—next morning he came again, between eight and nine o'clock—I said to him, "Well, have you made out an inventory of anything you have lost"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I have made mine out, and taken it to the police station; what have you lost?"—he said, "Two or three coats"—I had found his room door open as well as mine—he went down stairs, and I went out to my duty—I returned in about two hours, and saw the prisoner in the passage—he opened the door to me, I believe—Mountford,</p>

               <p>the policeman, was with him—Mountford said that Mr. Tofield had told him he had lost sixteen sovereigns—I said it was a bad job then—I went up stairs, and saw Sergeant Graves talking to my wife—we went down, and Graves asked Tofield what he had lost—he said sixteen sovereigns—Graves said he should like to see where he had put the sixteen sovereigns in the room—at first he objected to let the Sergeant go into the room, for the room had been searched two hours before, and he did not think there was any necessity for it—he mumbled something in a low tone, opened the door, and me and my wife, Mountford, and Graves, went in—as soon as I went in I saw a pair of my trowsers part on one chair and part on another—I took hold of them, and said, "My God!" or "Good God! why, these are my trowsers"—I could swear to them—they were part of what I lost—when I left on Monday morning they were on a chair by my bedside—the prisoner was present when I found them, and he said, "Then you or Mrs. Morgan must have put them there"—we could not get into his room, his door was locked—I had not put them there—I never saw them after they were missed till then—Graves said to him, "Have you any objection to go to the station-house to give an account of these trowsers?"—he said, "No, not at all," and he went—Graves said, "Mind, you are not in custody, you go of your own free will"—he was asked about the trowsers, and said he did not put them there—the inquiry dropped that day—I did not give him into custody till the Thursday—I did not know that I was justified in doing so till I saw the officer, who had searched the room two hours before, on the overnight—I have never found the rest of the things.</p>

I forget which, "here are my trowsers"—the prisoner directly said, "Then you must have brought them down," or, "You must have placed them in the room"—before we went in the door was locked—the prisoner had the key, and unlocked the door to let us in.</p>

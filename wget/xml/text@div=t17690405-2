I did not see him before I saw a large horse pistol at my breast in his hand. He said, Give me your money. I said, Do not use me ill, and I will give you my money. I gave him I believe between six and eight shillings in silver. He took my watch out of my pocket himself. It had a seal set in gold, and a black ribban to it. Then he left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Hodgkin. It was moonlight, but there was a lamp just behind me. I am certain the prisoner is the man. I gave several gentlemen the descriptions of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make use of any other words?</p>
               <p>Hodgkin. He said, Make haste. When he went off, he went up an alley by a Romish chapel; I believe it is. I went down Virginia-street, and met some gentlemen in the center of it. I said, Gentlemen, I have been robbed Said one of them, I have been robbed of four shillings and a watch. I was at the taking of the prisoner at New Ragfair on the Sunday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again?</p>
               <p>Hodgkin. I saw it again at the Justice's: the seal and a silver cap were taken off. Mr. Tyrawley sent me word he believed he had my watch. I had before told him I had been robbed of it.</p>

            . On the Saturday morning Mr. Hodgkin came to my house; I not being at home, he came again in the afternoon. He said, He knew I was a man of spirit, and desired I would go with him, and help to take a man that had robbed him of his watch and six or seven shillings, and nine guineas; saying, He had heard where the man was. He described the man, and his clothes he had on when he robbed him. He said he had on a blue surtout coat with a cape on it, a red waistcoat, his own hair, and a black neckcloth about his neck: his face very broad over the upper part, but very thin downwards. I went with him into several houses till ten at night, but could see nothing of him. On the Sunday morning it was my turn to find a minister for Wapping church. When I was in church, a person brought me word they knew where to find the highwayman. I went out to Mr. Hodgkin and asked him if he had any arms. He fetched a pair of pistols. I loaded one, and, I believe he did the other. We had heard the prisoner was a very desperate fellow, and always went with his hand in his pocket armed. We went to a house in a little court in Parrot-Alley; we lifted up the latch, and the door opened. The watchman pointed to me, as much as to say he was in such a room. I set my shoulder to the room door, and forced it open. I had my pistol in my left hand, and this instrument in my right. (Producing an instrument made of lignumvita, something in the nature of a stail, the handle about ten or twelve inches long. The other about eight, loaded with lead on the inside, fastened together with a strong silk cord.) This I made to carry in my pocket to defend myself against the cole-heavers. There was the prisoner sitting by the fire. I went up to him, and said, If you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050004"></xptr> stir, I'll blow your brains out. Mr. Hodgkin came up, and said, This is the man. The watchmen searched him. I saw two silver watches taken from him, but none of them were Mr. Hodgkin's.</p>

               <p>Lacon. I tried it with my hand, and found it fast. I burst it open with my shoulder. We found some pistol-bullets in the house, and a blue surtout coat lying in a chest, which the prosecutor said was the coat the prisoner had on when he robbed him.</p>

            . I live in Wapping. I was headbrough. On the 19th of March, in the morning, the beadle came to me at the church, and told me I must come to take a highwayman. I went with Mr. Hodgkin and others to this house joining to Parrot-Alley, in East Smithfield. I knew the man by the description Mr. Hodgkin had given of him. Mr. Lacon put the pistol to his breast, and said, He was a dead man if he moved. I took hold of one arm, and the beadle searched him for firearms; he found a watch upon him, and I found another in his right hand pocket. The watch that I found is claimed by Mr. Wood, who, upon hearing the man was taken, came to my house with his pocket-book, in which were the marks of his watch. It appeared to be his. We found some bullets in a chest in the room.</p>

            . I am beadle. On the 18th of March, I was informed this man, by the description of him, had robbed Mr. Hodgkin. Mr. Lacon and I went with Mr. Hodgkin to help to take him, but could not find him. The next morning I was told, as I was going to church, that a watchman had seen the thief go into a house where we were informed he lodged. I went and told Mr. Hodgkin; then we went to the house, and found the prisoner and a woman sitting by the fire. Mr. Lacon held a pistol, and ordered him to surrender. Then we searched him. I took a watch out of his pocket ( Produced in court); it belongs to a person in Newgate-street. I found ten leaden bullets in a box in the same room. (Produced in court.)</p>

               <p>Tyrawley. The prisoner was twice in my shop; the first thing he brought was a gold shank of a seal. He asked me whether it was gold, saying, he bought it for fifteen shillings at Portsmouth, and was afraid he had been cheated. I got a light, and took off the impression of the seal. I did not stop it, but told him if he would carry it to a gentleman, he would tell him whether it was gold or not (thinking to direct him to Mr. Hodgkin). He went away, and soon after coming again, he said he had sold the seal, and offered this watch to sale; then I stopped it. He went away. I sent my boy after him, who saw him go into a public house. Then I sent for Mr. Hodgkin, and showed him the impression of the seal; he said it was his, and he described the watch. The next day the prisoner was taken. (The impression of the seal produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is from my seal. It is my family coat of arms.</p>
               <p>Q. to Tyrawley. How was the prisoner dressed when he came to you?</p>
               <p>Tyrawley. He had on a red waistcoat, and a blue surtout coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was the same man?</p>

               <p>Lacon. This is the woman that was with the prisoner when we took him.</p>
               <p>M. Michael. The prisoner had given me a shirt and a pair of stockings to wash, and he came for them, and this gentleman came and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have bullets in your room?</p>
               <p>M. Michael. I saw no bullets in my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner searched?</p>
               <p>M. Michael. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing found upon him?</p>
               <p>M. Michael. There were some watches found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how he came by them watches?</p>
               <p>M. Michael. No, I do not.</p>

On the 6th of November, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop, and had small articles of silk and twist, which came to 3 s. 5 d. - I put them in a parcel. While I was making the bill she asked for six yards of tape, which I gave her. She would not let me put it in the parcel, but said she would do it herself. She said she had not sufficient money, and would leave the parcel - she went out. I missed five ounces of silk and four yards and a half of twist. I applied to Jones, he and I overtook her; she said she knew nothing of me, and had not been to my shop. She took us to Normanton's; he afterwards produced some black silk. The prisoner took some silk out of her pocket which I had lost.</p>

The prosecutrix applied to me, I found the prisoner in New-street, Covent-garden, and told her she had taken some silk from Tassie, she denied it, then said she had left it at Normanton's, and took us there. I asked him if he had bought any silk of her? he said he had not. The prisoner produced some coloured silk from her pocket. I afterwards went to Normanton's again, and recovered some black silk.</p>

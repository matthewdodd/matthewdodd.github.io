            . I am an officer. In consequence of observations which I had made, on the morning of the 9th of April, I went near Mr. Conway's ware house, a little before eight in the morning, and I saw Mansfield come out from the warehouse; he came up <placeName id="t18160529-54-crimeloc297">Garlick-hill</placeName>

Some time after that, I went in myself; when I went in, I found Mansfield just coming out of the house; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290033"></xptr>found Evans in the house, also I found a bag of turkey raisins close by Evans, on the seat by him. I asked him what he had got in that bag; and he said, it was the man's breakfast. He gave it to me, and it was a breakfast bag. I told him I must take him into custody; I had stopped Mansfield, and brought him in; they were both taken before the Lord Mayor. I told Evans he had been receiving stolen property from Mansfield. Mansfield said, he had taken those few raisins to give to Evans, because he was out of work, and very much distressed. Evans said again, that he thought it was Mansfield breakfast bag.</p>

            . I followed Mansfield into the the public-house. I saw him take a bag from underneath his smock-frock, and give it to Evans, who was in the passage. I then saw them talking together, and drinking out of the same pot. Then I went, and gave Mr. Matthews a hint, and called him in. Evans as soon as he saw him, went into the tap-room, and put the bag on the seat in the box, and then they were taken into custody.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to the prosecutors, who are wholesale grocers. The prisoner Mansfield was their porter. On the morning of the 9th of April, Mansfield went out to the bakers to get the rolls, as was usual. In consequence of his being apprehended, and hearing what Matthews has stated, we examined the warehouse, and found a cask of turkey raisins open. There was only one broken, and I missed some raisins from one side; the raisin taken from the side of a cask will have a different appearance from those taken from the middle; and these raisins produced, appear to have been taken from the side of the cask; they are precisely the same sort of raisins that were in the cask in our warehouse which was broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a beer retailer, in Windmill-street, Brixton. The prisoner lodged at my house in Sept., 1851—on Sunday, 7th Sept., 1851, my wife went out about 6 o'clock in the evening—the prisoner was there when my wife went away—he owed me some money for board and lodging—I had spoken to him on the subject of that on the Saturday evening previous, and likewise on the Sunday—I told him I could not afford to keep him any longer unless I saw his mother—I said he might lodge there, but not board—he said he thought I was a very bad man, and before he would sleep in my house he would sleep under a haystack, and for two pins he would smash my brains out—he went home in the evening to his mother's, but before he went away he went up stairs in my house twice during the evening—when he came down the last time he was carrying a small bundle under his arm, and he went away—when he got to the step of the door he said, "Here is my <hi rend="italic">kit</hi>, you may search me if you like"—I said, "George, I do not want to do so;" and he said, "You shall be a loser by me."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He has a vacancy at the back of the house for the accommodation of customers, and there is a fence round it; any one might jump over it, and get in at the back door. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There is a back yard, and a fence five feet high, with tenter hooks—that door was locked that night—when it is open no one can pass by without my seeing them—my passage is only three feet wide, and between the bar and the engine is only two feet wide—the bar is made in the middle of the passage—you just stand to draw the beer—there is not room for any one to pass.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. On Sunday evening, 6th Sept., 1851, I rolled my pockets up, and put them in the corner of the cupboard in my bedroom—there was in my pockets a sovereign, three half sovereigns, and silver, and copper besides—I left home that evening about 6 o'clock—I had seen the prisoner in a bedroom up stairs on the left band side, where he had no business to be—that was in the afternoon, and I met him on the stairs after that—I did not see him after I had put my pockets in the cupboard, because as soon as I had done that I put on my bonnet and went out—when I came home my pockets were gone.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 285). I took the prisoner, on 7th Jan., at Bromley, in Kent—I told him it was on a charge of stealing Mr. Cork's money a long time ago—he said, "It is a good while ago; I thought that was all dropped before now"—I did not recollect the date and I did not state the sum that was stolen.</p>

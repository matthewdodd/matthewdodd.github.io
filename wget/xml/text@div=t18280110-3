On the 31st of October I went out, and did not sleep at home that night; I slept at No. 16, Duke-street, Portland-place. I had left my house about five o'clock in the evening - every thing was perfectly safe when I went out; I went to my house next day, at one o'clock; I called for some cloaks, but did not go into the house - I remained at the gate. I called again at half-past three - I merely went for some clothes of my own and of the lady's with whom I was with in Duke-street; I did not go into the house - Aldridge, my servant, delivered them to me; I dined out. A friend came to me at No. 16, Duke-street, to tell me my house was robbed - I went there a few minutes after five o'clock, and found four or five officers in the dining-room; I found my wardrobe stripped, and the plate out of the dining-room gone; my wardrobe had not been locked - there was nothing left in it but an old pair of stockings; and some white dresses were left in a drawer. I missed a gold watch, worth 15l.; a pair of gold bracelets, worth eighteen guineas, four silk dresses, worth 16l.; a velvet pelisse, worth 21l.; twelve or thirteen shifts and about sixteen pairs of silk stockings; I also missed six silver dinner forks, which cost 21s. each; six desert forks; and eight table-spoons, worth 5l. or 6l. from the sideboard cupboard, in the dining-room; I had left the keys with my servant, and desired her to lock it - it was all my property. Some places had been unlocked, but not forced open. I suppose the property to be worth 130l. or 140l. altogether. but cannot be certain of the exact value. I did not tell the Magistrate that my wardrobe was forced - (looking at her deposition) I signed this - it says so here, but I never said it - it must be a mistake.</p>

             there - she is Mrs. Kelly's servant; I knew her by that name: I went home with her to her mistress' house, and staid there all night, and in the morning went with her to Tottenham Court-road, to buy some gall to clean the parlour carpet - this was on Thursday morning - we both returned to the house, and a person sent to say she wished to speak to Aldridge; she went out, leaving me in the house; and about half-past twelve o'clock I saw the prisoner in the New-road - I was then with Aldridge - she asked him to come into the house, and he went in; Aldridge told him she was going to have a treat, a preserved damson pudding for her dinner - he said he was very fond of that: she told him she was going to meet her mistress in the afternoon, and could not stay to eat any of it, but if he would call in the course of the afternoon he should have some; the prisoner left the house, after eating a herring and a roll. Aldridge then went out, and I was left alone in the house - the prisoner came again in about half an hour; it was then about half-past two o'clock, I think; he knocked at the door, and I let him in; he came down to the kitchen; I told him the pudding was not done; he stood in the kitchen, looked round, and asked me if I could not get him a silver spoon - I asked him what for; he said to pledge for a trifle of money, for he was very much distressed; I asked where he thought I could get a silver spoon from, and said he would get me into disgrace, and the servant too; he then went up stairs: I went up with him, to let him out at the street door; as he went along the passage the parlour door was open - he went into the parlour, looked on the sideboard and about; I begged of him not to touch any thing that was there; the sideboard cupboard door stood a little open, and he took out a basket of plate: I begged of him not to do any thing of the kind; I saw him take the basket out, and saw there was silver in it, but do not know what kind of plate it was; he told me to keep all silent, and it would be all for the best; he told me to remain in the passage, and that if any one came not to open the door, and said he would have a good sweep; he went up stairs, and came down in about five minutes afterwards, with two bundles, and went out of the house. I never saw him any more till he came to the prison; when he went out he told me when the servant came in, to clap my hands together, and say, "Oh! Bella, I am sure there are thieves in the house, for there is such a noise up stairs;" the servant came in in about ten minutes after he went out, and directly after she came in the prisoner came up, and knocked at the door; the servant was very much frightened, and told him her mistress' wardrobe was stripped.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told her what he mentioned when she came in? A. Yes; I said, "Oh! Bella, there is such a noise up stairs - I am sure there are thieves in the house." She went up stairs directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come down before be came to the door? A. No; he knocked at the door directly she came in - she came down directly, and told him her mistress' wardrobe was stripped; he told her to keep all silent, and to go for an officer; she went, and one came - she asked him where to go for an officer - he told her to go to Benson's butter-shop, at the corner of the New-road; she went, and the prisoner went away before the officer came; I never saw him again till he came to Clerkenwell prison, where I was taken on suspicion of being concerned in this. When I saw him there he begged of me to keep my own counsel. I have known the prisoner ten years - he was a shoemaker. I used to go out to work, as I could get it, but have no regular place of service.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner employment at this time? A. Yes- I used to see him every day; I cannot mention the date on which this happened, but I remember Mrs. Kelly coming in a chaise about two o'clock on the Thursday - the prisoner was in the house at that time; Mrs. Kelly did not come in: the prisoner was in the kitchen, and went to hide himself, because she should not see him, and I went with him, as I did not wish to be seen - I do not know what Mrs. Kelly came for - she did not come again till after the robbery, to my knowledge; I do not know of any dress being taken to her.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the prisoner do with the basket of plate? A. He put it into his pockets, I believe; he carried two bundles out, but I did not see what was in them.</p>
               <p>ISABELLA ALDRIDGE. I was servant to Mrs. Kelly in October last; I remember seeing Green at Burchett's lodgings; I think it was on the last day of October - she went home, and slept with me that night; Mrs. Kelly did not sleep at home that night - it was on the Wednesday that she went out. I have known the prisoner about a twelvemonth - I did not see him on the Thursday till two o'clock; I saw him then in the New-road - Green called him, and asked him to come in - he came into Mrs. Kelly's house; he came down stairs; I had got some damsons, and told him I was going to have a damson pudding for dinner- he said it was what he was very fond of, and he should like some; I said if he could stop he might have some - he said he could not stop; I asked if he could come in the afternoon - he said No, he had got some work to do, and could not leave work till about eight o'clock in the evening- he had a herring, and part of a roll which was left at breakfast - he ate that, and then went out; I did not see him again till after the robbery: I had gone out to No. 16, Duke-street, where my mistress was, about half an hour after he left - I was to have taken her a dress and a pair of shoes - I forgot to take the shoes; she sent me home for them, and when I got there Green said she heard a noise in the house, and that I had left the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, but did your mistress come to the house in a gig? A. Yes; she came to the house about one o'clock, and about three; both times were before the robbery; I first heard of the robbery when I came home for the shoes, that was about five o'clock; I opened the door with a key, and called Green; she came up stairs from the kitchen, after I had called three times, and told me she had heard a dreadful noise in the house - that I had left the street door open, and she thought some one was in the house then. I had not left the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up stairs? A. Yes, and found the wardrobe almost stripped of all the clothes; I came down again, and when I came down the prisoner was at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the sideboard? A. No - I did not go into the parlour. I told him the wardrobe was stripped, and asked him what I should do; he told me to go and fetch an officer; I asked him where - he told me to go to the butter-shop at the corner of the New-road; I went, and they told me where to go and get one; Benson keeps the butter-shop - he did not mention Benson's name; I was to ask them where there was an officer. I left the prisoner in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100005"></xptr>house; he told me he would stop till I came back, but he went away while I was gone; he told me to keep all quiet, and not to say that he had been to the house; I said No, I would not - I hoped God would strike me dead if I did, if he would stop till I got back, and he said he would.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to say you would not tell any body? A. Because he did not seem satisfied that I would not say he had been. and I thought if I said that he would stop till I came back, and if I did not say so he might go away; Green was by my side, and told me not to say she had been in the house; I said I wished her to stop with me, and she did stop.</p>

On the Thursday that the robbery was committed I was to have met Green at two o'clock, to give her part of my earnings, to help maintain her; when I got to the bottom of Brook-street she told me to come that way - I was not inclined to go, but the servant beckoned to me to come in; I objected - I was asked to come in several times - I at last went in, and took part of a herring and roll; I then said I must go, as I had been ill for two months, and should lose my work if I did not attend to it; I went to the corner of the New-road. I had a subscription made for me while I was ill, and Smith had subscribed for me; I met him, and asked him to go and take part of a pint of porter - we went to a public-house, and had a pint of beer, and afterwards sixpenny-worth of rum; he asked how the young woman was who nursed me when I was ill- I told him she was at the prosecutrix's house, and I was to have something to eat there, and what money I had I would spend on him, for his kindness - I stopped there with him for half an hour, and in our conversation he said I was to blame if I did not get some property from the house, and could I not do it - I said No, but after awhile he overpowered me; I went in, and brought the property.</p>

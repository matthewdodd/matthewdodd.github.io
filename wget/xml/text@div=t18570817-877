On 16th July two chests came from Horniman and Co., by a porter; they were left in front of the bar, and I signed the book—I saw them there next morning, between 8 and 9 o'clock—the prisoner and two others were then there drinking, and two of them were sitting on the chest; one of them had broken his head, and I lent a pair of scissors to cut the hair off; the prisoner dressed the wound—I went up stairs for an hour, leaving them in</p>

On the morning of 17th July, about a quarter past 9 o'clock, I was on duty in Royal Mint Street, and saw the prisoner with a tea chest on his back—Greathead, another constable, who was with me, walked down the other side—the prisoner was about the length of the Court from me; I could see his face—I followed him, perhaps a hundred yards, to Rachel Court, where he turned down; I went about thirty yards up the court, but could not see him—I sent for Greathead, and we went to No. 31, Rachel Court, and afterwards to No. 3—Great<lb></lb>head, who was then before me, called me to the first floor front room, and I there found a bag of tea, this part of a tea chest, a card, and some labels with Horniman's name—this is the same kind of chest which I had seen the prisoner carry—about 10 o'clock I went with Greathead to the Blue Boar public house, Royal Mint Street, and found the prisoner there, lying asleep on a form—I told him what I wanted him for, he made no answer, and I took him into custody.</p>

               <p>five labels, also this piece of a tea chest—several females live in the house, but it is not a house where anybody goes that likes—Mrs. Rush said that a man brought them there, and I took her to the station house—a lad, of seventeen or eighteen, went with Cressy and I to the Blue Boar public house—we found two or three men there, and the prisoner lying on a settle in front of the bar—I did not recognise him at first, but I lifted him up, saw his face, and then recognised him as the man who had the tea—I knew him before.</p>

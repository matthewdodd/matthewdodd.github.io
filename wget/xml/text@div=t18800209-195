                  </hi>. I Carry on business at 37, Milk Street, Cheapside, as a furrier—at the present time my affairs are in liquidation—I was introduced to the prisoner about two years ago by a traveler of mine—about the 1st or 2nd March last he came to me and introduced to me the business of the woolen trade—I had no knowledge myself of that business—he said "Never mind; if you have got no knowledge you will make a lot of money out of it"—it was to be carried on in my name—this memorandum (<hi rend="italic">marked B</hi>) is on one of my bill-heads—in October I de<lb></lb>livered to the prisoner a number of my blank bill-heads, about 15 or 16 to my recollection—he brought me letters to write, a lot of copies—he copied every letter—he said "You don't know these people; I do, and I will give you all the copies"—he came to me in October, which is the busiest time in our business, and in the middle of the day—he wanted me only to sign these forms, and he was to write the letters, to fill them up with orders—he was not authorized to write anything upon them only orders—the result of my transactions with the prisoner was that in December he became indebted to me about 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—somewhere about 5th December I went to my solicitor, Mr. Lovett, and instructed him to take proceedings on an debtor's summons against the prisoner—after taking that proceeding the prisoner called on me almost every day—he said he had several good bills which he wanted to give me, that I should not go to a solicitor, why throw away a lot of money for nothing at all? that I should arrange with him on the quiet—between 5th and 11th December he called sometimes twice in the day; he continually worried me, always on this matter—on 11th December he called at my office and said "If you come between 3 and 4 to my office everything will be ready for you, and I will satisfy you"—I went there; it was a small place, at 54 Paternoster Row, a broken-down house—he took this document out of his pocket (<hi rend="italic">marked A</hi>)—it was drawn out when I got there.(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "December 11, 1879.

He took those two bills out of his pocket, and said "The first thing to-morrow morning I shall give you the cash"—I had signed the document at that time, and when he said that I took the pen and struck it through, and</p>

               <p>said "I shall first consult my solicitor"—I retained possession of the two bills and the paper, and left—I saw the prisoner again on the 19th at Mr. Lovett's office in the presence of Mr. Lovett—Mr. Lovett, referring to the bills, said "They are of no use; if you cannot increase your cash it is your own solicitor and let him come to me, and we shall arrange the hast thing we can do together"—he said "All right," and we went away to<lb></lb>gether—I think that was on a Saturday—this document of 11th December was before Mr. Lovett and Mr. Robshaw at that interview, and Mr. Lovett said "Kosminski has done very wisely that he did not part with the document"—the prisoner walked downstairs with me, opposite the King William statue, and said "Look here, Kosminski, you will run yourself into great expense for nothing at all; let us, settle the matter the best way we can"—I said "I have got my legal adviser, and I shall not de any thing but what he advises me"—with that we parted—I saw him again on the 17th at Mr. Lovett's office—Mr. Lovett said "I have got nothing further to say to you only what I have referred to before; if you can't make up your mind to give a larger amount of money and give me better bills I shall not do anything of the kind, I shall go on with my case"—that was all that passed, and I went away—a day or two after, I think on the 19th, the prisoner came to my office with Mr. Lovett's clerk—he called me into my private office, and mr. Lovett's clerk said "Have nothing to do with him, as we have the matter in hand let him settle with us, he has nothing to settle with you"—I told him not to come any more into my office, and he went away—I believe the 31st December was the day fixed upon for hearing the debtor's summons before Mr. Register Hazlitt at the Bankruptcy Court—I was present at the hearing—after I told my claim the prisoner was called, and said "I don't own Mr. Kos<lb></lb>minski Anything, I have got a note of settlement"—I can't say who Actually produced the document, I think it was produced by himself (<hi rend="italic">Read, marked C:</hi> "8th December, 1879. Memorandum. Martin Kon<lb></lb>minski, Wholesale Furrier, Milk Street, London, to Mr. G. H. Robshaw 54, Paternoster Row.

               <p>named Bond—I did not mean to have any more to do with him, so I sold the stuff to a certain party—he found it out, and he was continually run<lb></lb>ning after those goods—he said "I shall pay you cash"—this is the ledger—36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.was paid to me on 27th November—that was the only payment I received that day—I did not see him on the 29th November; I ascertained that he was in Huddersfield on the 28th and 29th—I did not say on the 29th that I was hard up, and wanted money to pay my wages—I had a considerable balance at my bankers at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first became acquainted with Mr. Robshaw about two Years ago to the best of my recollection—I recollect the circumstances Under which I became acquainted with him, I wanted a loan of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not go to him for that loan; that I swear; he had nothing to do with Procuring that loan for me; he might procure it, but he did not pay it—I did not ask his assistance to procure it for me; that I swear, I will explain How it was—I obtained a loan of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 1877—a gentleman named Roberts, of Friday Street, lent it me—my traveller, Mr. Alcol, introduced Me to Mr. Roberts—Mr. Robshaw did not to my knowledge negotiate the Loan, he came in to Mr. Roberts—Mr. Roberts paid the cash—I Did not see Mr. Robshaw before, that was the first I saw of him—after that I did not see him for two years, and I wish I had not seen him further—I did not require some money in March, 1879; of course I required money—I will swear I have never applied to anybody for any money; I might require money in business, but I did not apply to any one that should lend me any—I had not five cottages which I represented to belong to me, in the parish of Hackney, in March, 1879, representing a rental of 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that I swear—I sold them two years ago—I will swear that in March, 1879, I did not represent to Robshaw that I had five cottages in Hackney which were of a rental value of 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and which I wanted to sell for 1,850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know a gentleman named Richard Dixon, a furrier, of Dowgate Hill—in March, 1879, I was indebted to him 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in two bills—I did not require the funds for the purpose of meeting those bills; that I swear; those bills were running in March, 1879, and were due in May and June—I did not agree to sell the five cottages to Robshaw, I will tell you the reason; he obtained a writing from me—(<hi rend="italic">letter produced</hi>—this is my signature—I swear positively I did not agree to sell those five cottages to Robshaw—it was merely to blind Mr. Dixon; he wanted to blind him—I want to tell you how he obtained that letter from me—I sold the cottages two years ago to Mr. Webster, a solicitor, of Lincoln's Inn Fields—(<hi rend="italic">Another letter produced</hi>) this is my signature—I will tell you how he obtained all these letters, he is capable of that—Mr. Barnard was my solicitor in March, 1879—a contract was drawn up between me, Mr. Dixon, and Mr. Robshaw, for the sale and purchase of these cottages—That was at the prisoner's request; he instructed the solicitor, he went with me there—it was not done to defraud anybody, it was merely that time should be given—I consented to it—I will explain; on 30th January I ought To have got of Mr. Robshaw 784<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for goods which were sold and delivered to him, I received no money; I said "Look here, I owe a bill, Mr. Dixon has been very kind to me, and I cannot dishonour this bill, you say this money will come in"—he said "You told me once about those cottages; I shall go to Mr. Barnard, your solicitor, and you give me a writing that I will buy the cottages, and before the money will come in I shall pay Mr. Dixon"—I thought there was on further loss—Mr.</p>

               <p>Barnard had the abstract of title of my cottages—I went with the prisoner to Mr. Barnard—he did not know further than that it was a straightforward transaction—he called Mr. Dixon to his office and said "I give you a deposit to buy these cottages, the business will be transacted, and in a fort-night or three weeks you shall have your money"—Mr. Dixon went to the bank and took up the bill on that condition; but it was merely a sham, nobody ever had a loss on it; that was the whole transaction—the date of it was in April, 1879—Mr. Dixon did not at any interview with me and Robshaw tell me that he believed that the cottages I had contracted to sell did not belong to me at all; nothing of the kind—I did not agree to give Robshaw 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in consideration of the fictitious sale of the cottages; I wear that. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just listen to this, this is a letter that you have already admitted is your signature: "June 30, 1879.

I tell you he has done all this to blind Mr. Dixon—this is Mr. Barnard's handwriting—I represented to Mr. Dixon as well as to Mr. Robshaw that this property was absolutely mine; I had to do so—Mr. Dixon did not in consequence of believing that this property belonged to me give his credit for me to customers—Mr. Dixon could be my referee, I have dealt with him to the amount of thousands of pounds; be is my principal creditor, for 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I have always referred to him, because I have dealt with him five years; he has not had to pay a penny for me—some of my creditors to whom Mr. Dixon became referee have been left unpaid, because I had to file my petition unfortunately—Mr. Dixon never suggested that these houses did not belong to me; he did not know anything about the houses at the first interview—he knew I had some houses, he knew I had my own house, 36, New North Road—as soon as he was paid I went to him and said "Look here, Mr. Dixon, it was merely a sham, the man has deceived you, because he has deceived me; because you should have your money and not get cross this story was told you"—but nobody has lost a penny on it—I don't know anything about issuing a writ against Bobshaw in reference to an alleged claim by me on 8th December; I gave Mr. Lovett instructions to act for me, I wanted my money—on 31st December I believe the debtor's summons in bankruptcy was heard before Mr. Registrar Hazlitt—I believe an adjournment was obtained, because there was not time to go into the matter—I went next day to the police-court to get a summons—as soon as I saw that piece of paper I said it was a forgery—it was too late to grant a warrant, the Magistrate said he could not read the deposition, it was half-past 5; he said "I will give you at once a summons, but if you apply to-morrow I will give you a warrant, I must look first at the depositions"—he asked me if there was any fear of Rob<lb></lb>shaw absconding—I said I believed that he would abscond, because he is the biggest scoundrel God created—when I saw this forgery naturally enough my solicitor advised me to give him at once into custody—I did not give the prisoner any notice that I was going to apply for a warrant—the prisoner paid me 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 27th November, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bank-notes and 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—I did not 6ee his clerk on Saturday, 29th November; I did not receive 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him that day—I was asked at the police-court if the prisoner</p>

               <p>had not paid mo 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 29th, and I positively swore no, and I could swear six times over that he never paid me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 29th—he paid me 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 27th, but no further money have I received from that man—he swore before the Registrar that he had a counter claim, which made me in his debt—my solicitor has the two bills; they were dishonoured—I don't believe I told the Magistrate that I could not give any reason for saying the prisoner would abscond—I can't swear I did not—on 27th November I bought a seal-skin jacket from Messrs. Meyers, wholesale furriers—I believe I paid for that with the two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes which the prisoner gave me—an applica<lb></lb>tion was made by Mr. Lee, the defendant's solicitor, to Messrs. Meyers to give the numbers of those notes—I don't know that they refused—no com<lb></lb>munication was made to me by Messrs. Meyers; that I swear—I heard next day that the prisoner was there with a policeman asking if he could have the numbers of the notes, and they said "Yes, if he went to the Bank he could find out"—I did not know the numbers of the notes; I never take notice of the numbers of notes—I know Martin's the banker's—I know Mr. White—the prisoner called on me several times with him—I cannot say whether Mr. White was present at the interview I had with the prisoner and Mr. Lovett's clerk—Mr. White is a friend of the prisoner—I don't know what ho is—I have had dealings with him; he went buying for me at several places—he has not supplied me with 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods—I don't believe he is worth 3,000 farthings—he has not supplied me With any goods; as an agent he has, not 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth or 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth; it might be over 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it might be 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I send him to Dixon when I can't go myself; more like an errand boy; a messenger—he did not ask me whether, if the order was executed, I was in a position to pay—he introduced certain firms to me for the purpose of dealing; I am in debt to those firms at present—I passed my pen through my name on this agreement of the 8th—I think the body of it is in the prisoner's writing; the receipt stamp was already on it, and I signed it—I did not call on the 11th December to get the bills in consideration of this agreement; I had not seen this before; I signed it without ever seeing it; only at the Bankruptcy Court; that I swear—it was very easy for him to do that—I know Mr. Kirby—I don't know that he was the prisoner's clerk—I have seen him about four or five times at his office—I have been there hundreds of times, and never seen him—I did not swear at Bow Street that I had never seen Mr. Kirby until that day—he has never written out anything for me to my knowledge—on 3rd September the prisoner paid me 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash—I can't recollect where that was paid to me—I was not at the prisoner's office on 8th December—he did not come to me on that day; I swear that—I have not got any entry in my book of 8th December—my people were at the office coining in and out—I have a large business—Mr. Walker, my man, was there, and Mr. Knight, one of my travellers—the prisoner has made a claim against me for delivering goods not equal to sample—in one transaction 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—our transactions were from April 5th or 6th, 1879, till October, then I stopped the game—there was 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. indebted to me, and I did not want to deliver any more goods, and so he helped himself—in 1874 I was carrying on business at 36, New North Road, my own private house—I was not dealing with Mr. Dixon then—I was then working for Bevington and Morris, and Meyers and Co.—I took out work from them, and delivered it to them—I never failed before my last failure—there was not an action against me in 1874—Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of the High Court, and have been so 12 years, and before that for many years in the profession—I carry on my profession in King William Street, City—I had acted for Mr. Kosminski previous to the 4th or 5th of December, 1879, for perhaps a month, not more—I received instructions from him to recover a debt from Robshaw—my first step was the letter of 5th December—I was then supplied with the details, upon which I wrote—I think I claimed something like 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think a writ was the next thing—that was dated 8th December—the summons in Bankruptey, I think, was a few days afterwards—I saw Robshaw at my office for the first time, I think, on 13th December—I had previously had placed in my hands by Kosminski the document marked A—at the same time he brought one of the bills; I think the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—that was the day before, on the Friday—at that time the ink erasure of the name was on the face of the white paper—it is not true that I scored it out; it was scored out when first brought to me—it was brought to me on the 12th, and on the 13th I had these papers in my possession—Robshaw came in and said he had come to see if he could settle the differences between himself and Kosminski—I said "I hope we can," and I immediately took up these papers and asked him what the moneys were—he said that he had suggested or arranged with Kosminski to accept two bills of exchange which he had given him, alluding to the bills of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash in settlement of his claim of 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "Are these good bills?"—he said "I suppose so"—I said "I suppose, then, you would have no objection to endorse them?"—he said "Oh, yes, I have a very great objection"—I said "If they are good bills why object to endorse them?"—he said "Well, I do object"—he said "Very well, then, I am afraid you will have to fund some better bills than these, and likewise some more cash"—he said "No, this is all the cash I can spare"—I then advised him to see Kosminski with a view to make better terms, and he left—I don't think I saw Kosminski on that day at all—he may have been in the outer office—I don't remember seeing him—this conversation took place with Robshaw alone—on Wednesday, the 17th, Robshaw came again with Kosminski—the papers were still in my</p>

               <p>possession—I had caused my clerk to make inquiries about the names of the persons on the bills, and the conversation was almost the same as before—it turned on the terms, and I again asked Robshaw if he felt dis<lb></lb>posed to endorse these bills—he said again "No," he would not do so—I told him in my opinion they were worthless pieces of paper—he did not say they were not—I said "Can't you give some more cash?"—he said "No, I cannot; that is all the cash you can have," and he and Kosminski left the office together—I saw nothing more of Robshaw between that day and 31st December in the matter before Registrar hazlitt—I was not present then—I was not present when this paper was produced—I saw this paper at Bow Street for the first time—Robshaw never alluded to it in any way—he never alluded to having paid 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or to leaving him to bring an action against Kosminski for the goods not being according to sample—in the course of the conversation I said to Robshaw "Why, you owe Kosminski something like 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if these bills are met they will only pay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound, and that is a large sum"—he said "That is the best I can do"—that was the first time I had seen him, on Saturday, the 13th—the note in this book produced is in my writing, and was a note made by me of the interview on the 13th—it was made at the time, after he had left, it is in pencil—he did not say a word on that occasion about the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as having been paid on the 27th or 29th November—I have my entry of the 17th (<hi rend="italic">reading it</hi>)—up to the 17th there had been no settlement of account with him—I told him the best thing he could do was to consult his solicitor with a view to his seeing me.</p>

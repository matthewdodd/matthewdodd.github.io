After Mr. Scott had me in custody, they left me in the tap-room, and went into the parlour; I staid, and the constable said, Mr. Scott and I have fettled it, but you must give Mr. Scott half-a-guinea; I said I could not think of doing that, as I was innocent; then Mr. Scott said, if I would not give him the money, he would prosecute me; upon that I was taken before the Magistrate, and committed to Clerkenwell, where I was bailed out; Mr. Scott then wanted to make it up for five pounds, he would not take less than five pounds; and I have a witness here now, that carried all the money that I could raise, and he said that would not do; the Sunday following, there came a man from Mr. Scott to Thomas Frost's, the place appointed to know what I could raise; I told him I could not raise five pounds; Mr. Scott said, give me the money you have got, and I will go to Mr. Scott, and see if I cannot settle it without any further trouble, I think Mr. Scott will take it of me; he said he was obliged to pay the whole money when he stole a pig, and he would not take less than the whole of me.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen him since? - A. Yes, I have accidentally seen him backwards and forwards, no more than that; I know nothing of the business; I was subpoenaed, but I don't know what for.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever present at any conversation between Scott and the prisoner? - A. Yes; they were trying to make it up, and Mr. Scott did offer to make it up for five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? - A. Upon my soul I cannot say, I believe it was at Mr. Scott's own house; I carried him four guineas, and he refused to take it; he said he would take five.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Scott.) You have heard what the prisoner has said, and what this last witness has said? - A. I have; I never did, upon my oath; I have had many attempts made me, but I told them the law should take its course; he brought something in a paper, but what, I don't know; he said there was something for me; I told him I would not meddle with it, that the law should take its course; he said he could not help it, then he would carry it back again.</p>

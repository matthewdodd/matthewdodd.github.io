                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and live at Shadwell. I met the prisoner on the 18th of March—I went home with her to bed—she then went away till the morning—she then came and laid down by my side, and then she took my jacket—I had given her my waistcoat to pawn the night before, for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not find her till half-past ten o'clock in the morning—I asked her for my jacket—she said, "Don't bother me, I don't know you"—I gave charge of her—this is my jacket.</p>

He gave me the waistcoat to pawn—he spent the money in a public-house, and then he gave me the jacket to stop with him—I gave him the duplicate of the waistcoat. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. She gave me the duplicate and the money, but we had but one pint of beer—I gave her the rest of the money, which was half-a-crown and fourpence—she got some gin—she, and I, and the landlady, drank it—she did not ask me for, any thing to sleep with her—I did not have any supper in the house—she said she knew nothing about me nor the jacket.</p>

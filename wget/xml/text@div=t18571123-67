                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant, living at No. 15, London Street.

               <p>got into bad company, I would not allow him to go to business, and from that moment he was not entitled to receive anything from the prisoner—I did not tell him to allow my son 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day, or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; since my son has not come to business I have paid him his money regularly—I am quite sure that the prisoner asked me for a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 6th Nov.—he said, "Give me a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I want 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for petty cash"—I did not fill it up, being in a hurry, and for a long time I had a thorough confidence in the prisoner—I had a long indisposition, and did not come to town for twelve months, and I used to give him cheques, and he did not abuse that con<lb></lb>fidence—I have given him blank cheques when I was ill, and sometimes when I was in a great hurry, and a customer was waiting—I often filled them up myself, for my own expenses—I did not generally give him the business cheques in blank; he used to fill them up, and I used to sign them, for duties, or any large amount—I have given him blank cheques for petty cash, because sometimes he might have to pay 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on this occasion he asked me for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for petty cash, and I gave him the cheque, and told him to fill it up for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was at my office all day on the 7th; I was not there myself—I understand that he made his appearance there on Monday, after business hours; we shut up at 4 o'clock—he came to my attorney's office on the Tuesday, because the police officer was on the look out for him—I believe I said to him, "Now, John, for God's sake, don't let this go forward; pay your debt, and have done with it"—he complained of my going, or sending, to his wife—I said if he did not hand over the money, I would give him into custody; he refused to do so—I did not say to him, after the policeman came, "I will give you a last chance; you shall come back to me, and nothing further shall he said if you will give up the money," nor anything to that effect—he made no claim for the amount that he had filled up the cheque for; there is his own handwriting in the petty cash book, to prove that he could have no claim—in Nov. last a person named Edwards made a claim against me for 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was an unjust claim, and I would not listen to it—I was required to pay 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into Court, but I did not do it, and the bill was not allowed to pass.</p>

I am thirteen years old—I come from the Bridewell at Westminster—I am a convict there—I was convicted last May, at the Middlesex Sessions, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment, for picking a pocket—I had been in prison a dozen times before that for picking pockets—I know the prisoner—I first became acquainted with him about three years</p>

               <p>ago—I knew he was a policeman—I first became acquainted with him in Dean-street, Soho, and I had been in the habit of occasionally seeing him till Christmas, 1853—I recollect the frost about Christmas, 1853—I went up to the Serpentine one day during that frost—I saw the prisoner that day—I met him in a public house in Pulteney-street, Soho—I do not recollect what day of the month it was—I had some conversation with him in that public house—he said he could take us to a place where we could get plenty of money, up at the Serpentine, on the bridge—I met him before 12 o'clock—after that we went with the prisoner up to the Serpentine—we went on the bridge—there was a young man, about twenty-one, with the prisoner when I spoke to him—I knew that young man—his name was Donovan—he went with us to the Serpentine—there was plenty of skating going on on the Serpentine—when we got there we met several other thieves, boys and men—some of the boys I had known before—the prisoner spoke to a man whom we met on the bridge—he was a man that goes about with the boys, picking pockets—I forget his name; I know him; he is in prison now—when we were on the bridge there were persons skating below on the ice, and a great number of persons on the bridge looking at them—the prisoner pointed to a lady, and told me to come over to her—the lady was looking over the bridge at the persons skating—I went over to her, and picked her pocket—the prisoner was standing close behind me at the time I did it—I took from the lady's pocket a purse, and gave it to the prisoner, and then the prisoner, and Donovan, and I walked up towards the park—as we went up higher in the park, the prisoner took the money out of the purse, and showed it to me, and put the purse into a hole in a tree—we went towards the Bayswater-road—the tree is not above thirty yards from the bridge—there is a guard-house close by, where the soldiers are—when the prisoner showed me the money, I saw how much there was—there was a half sovereign, and six shillings, and a sixpence—when we went into the park, we went in at a large gate in Park-lane—we went straight across to the Serpentine, and then turned and went on the bridge—we went on the right hand side of the river—we went from Pulteney-street, and in at the gate nearest to the Statue, and straight across the park to the Serpentine, and then went by the side of the water—we went to the Humane Society's house, and on the bridge.</p>

               <p>and a man fell over his foot—I had known King for some time before that day—I have been to the Zoological Gardens with Donovan and King and Arundel, another young man, that used to pick pockets—I do not know when it was; it was after the frost, it was after this taking the purse—I have been to the Zoological Gardens twice or three times—I had been there once with King, and once with Donovan.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, C</hi> 76). I was in Hyde-park on 31st Dec, 1853, during the frost—I do not know what day of the week it was—I was there by accident—I was in uniform—I passed under the bridge—I heard of a boy being taken into custody for picking pockets under the bridge—he was taken by some man in the first instance—I knew the pri<lb></lb>soner at that time—I saw him there—I dare say he was about two yards from the boy who was taken up—the prisoner spoke to me at the time—he asked me what the boy was taken for; I told him I thought for picking a lady's pocket—I asked him if he knew the boy—he made no reply but walked away—he was in plain clothes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What o'clock was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a quarter past 3—I do not know the boy's name who was taken—I am not sure who the officer was who took him, I think it was <hi rend="italic">A</hi> 186—there is nothing uncommon if an officer sees a person taken, to ask another officer what he is taken for—I have known King about two years, or a little more—I have not been in the force so long as he has—I never heard a whisper against his character up to the time this charge was made against him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, P</hi> 14). The prisoner was in the <hi rend="italic">C</hi> division in 1853—I was a sergeant in that division—the prisoner was frequently employed in plain clothes—it was not always my duty to direct the constables in plain clothes as to what duty they were to perform in the course of the day—if I did not, some one else did, and the constable was to report the same day, or the following morning, what he had done and where he had been—this is the book in which I recorded the proceedings (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—on 31st Dec. I directed him to make inquiries respecting a robbery in Piccadilly, and also a robbery in Gerrard-street, till 6 o'clock in the evening—the next morning the constable would tell me what he had been doing, and I put it in here—I gave him no particular directions, only to make those inquiries—on 1st Jan. I find the entry of the report I made: "Making inquiries respecting robberies in Piccadilly and Gerrard-street, till 6 o'clock, and then patrolling some streets from. 7 till 9.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he had been in the course of that afternoon near the Serpentine-bridge, would it have been his duty to communicate that fact? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not whether he had been there or at any other place respecting a robbery—he may commence in the morning making inquiries, and his inquiries may last across four or five hours—if he had been employed as a police constable in Hyde-park he should have reported it to me, certainly.</p>

Q.</hi> If he had been ordered to go to Hyde-park, or to any particular place, to do duty there, it would have been his duty to report it the next morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but if he had been desired to make inquiries respecting a robbery in Piccadilly, it would not have been his duty to tell every street or place he went to—the report he made, and which I entered, was such a report as I was satisfied with—I was satisfied that he had made inquiries—it was no part of his duty to tell me of whom he made this inquiry, or where he made it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 296). In the spring of last year I was on duty in plain clothes in the Zoological Gardens—it was one day in March, the 16th, 24th, or the 30th; it was either Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday—I saw the prisoner twice that day—I saw him there at the time I went in, and I saw him again, and he had two lads with him; Reeves was one—I should know the other boy if I saw him—the prisoner spoke to them—the boys were giving the monkeys buns in the monkey house—King said did the monkeys like buns, and he said one would eat as much tobacco as the other would buns—the prisoner said he had got two friends with him—I knew the prisoner at that time—I afterwards saw the prisoner in the elephant house, and the same two boys were a short distance before him—in two or three days afterwards, I saw them all three together in Bayham<lb></lb>terrace, Camden-town, near the Mother Red Cap—the prisoner and the same two boys were then going towards London—I did not know Reeves at that time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

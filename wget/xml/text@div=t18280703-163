               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If it meets your approbation, I will now make out my whole defence, as I have no one to plead for me - this morning when at this bar, I should have pleaded guilty, but for one thing; I wished my case might prove a caution to others, and I wished to place before the Judge and Jury the hardships I have undergone; this trial has nevertheless brought me from living in a state of adultery; in which, I am now sensible I have transgressed the laws of God and of my country; and I hope I shall bear with patience and resignation, by the will of God, the sentence you may pass upon me: I trust however, the Court will hear what I have to say, and that it will operate in my favour, when brought up to receive my sentence. In 1807, I entered His Majest'y service: I was then but sixteen years and nine months old - I served as private, corporal and serjeant at most of the battles in the Peninsula at Waterloo and other places, where I received a wound in my head, which has caused a great depression of my intellectual powers; I have not worn a hat for three years, and have undergone four painful operations - I have had two false passages made for my urine and a leader cut under my ham, which had made me a cripple: to these causes I may perhaps attribute my present degraded situation: but I did not know that I was committing this crime till last summer; when at Brighton, I heard that a gentlemen had been imprisoned for having two wives - only this led to an inquiry, which convinced me of my error; if ever pity dwell in your breast towards a poor individual, I trust it dwells there now, for I can truly say "I acknowledge my transgression, and my sin is ever before me."</p>

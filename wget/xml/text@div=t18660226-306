I am the wife of James Heron, a cooper, living at Brentford—on 12th January, I was in a room occupied by the prisoner and his wife, the deceased—I live in the house, and went to get Mrs. Pepper a pint of beer—I was making the bed, and the prisoner was muttering a few words—he was tipsy, and I did not understand him, but he halloaed out as loud as anybody could hear that he would pull her off the chair—she screamed out—I turned round, and she was on the floor—they were both</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of New Brentford—I saw the deceased on 13th January—she was suffering from fracture of both thighs, just above the knees—she died on 21st January—she had been an invalid for a long while, suffering from general infirmity—she was deformed in her back and her collar-bone—a fall from a chair may have caused those fractures—there was a bruise on the outer side of one thigh—I am of opinion that the breaking of her thighs shortened her life—she had disease of the heart, which I attended her for—she died from exhaustion from the injuries that happened to her occurring in an enfeebled subject—her age was between fifty and sixty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the disease of the heart such as she might have died of at any instant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She might, but she did not die suddenly—it was her thighs which were broken, not her legs—I saw her legs and thighs when I set them—that was the day after the fracture—I do not think that would have any influence, looking at the fact that she died from exhaustion—it is the practice of some surgeons to leave fractures unset for a few days—a fall from a chair in such a subject would be likely to produce the fracture I saw—I did not see the chair—I had not visited her for several months, and then I attended her for about a week—I had never seen her walk—I had seen her legs when I attended her some months before—they were so reduced in strength and in size, that they would be more readily broken than the legs of a person in good health, or a younger person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Joseph Walker, of High Holborn—the prisoner was in his service. On the evening of the 16th of July I carried a board to the prisoner's lodging, and asked him what I was to do with it, as the brass was stripped off it—Mr. Walker had dis<lb></lb>charged him previous to that—he then said he had sold the brass, and if I would meet him next evening, he would get it me if he possibly could—I met him next evening—he said he could not get it—he said I should find the rest of the brass in the cellar—I went down into Mr. Walker's cellar directly I returned, and found some brass where he told me I should find it—it was the property of Mr. Walker.</p>

I formerly lived at 4, Upper-street, Whitechapel, and am a doctor of medicine—on Monday night, 17th May last, just past midnight, I was with some friends in Leman-street—I stood for a moment and then walked on—I heard some noise, and was turning round to see, and that moment these three follows rushed on me—one of them struck me in the eye—the third one also struck me in the face—at that time three others came up, and took hold of me; but the first three hearing I was a foreigner, would not allow them to do so—my watch was taken from out of the right waistcoat pocket, cut off this chain—my purse was also stolen—my trousers were ripped open—they could not get it out at once—there was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the purse—I am certain it was safe at the time I was attacked—I had it in my pocket then—a pair of spectacles were also taken from my left hand waistcoat pocket—I afterwards picked the</p>

            . I live at Fulham. I was working in a field near the Bishop's-walk, on the day in question, and saw two men running in a place called Devil's-lane, which leads out of the Bishop's-walk to the Putney-road; I was near enough to see them when they first ran - the prisoner was one of them; I did not know him before - I am quite sure of him; he was about half a mile from the gate of the bishop's palace - it is a lane which comes right into the main road, across Fulham-fields - I am quite sure the prisoner was one - it was exactly at half-past four o'clock; I had seen him twice before that day - he pulled his hat off his head, and put his hand into his hat, and he gave the tall man some money; I was not near enough to see the money, but I heard it - I saw no bag - I saw nothing more of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you in a field? A. Yes; there was nothing between the field and the road - I was near the path; there was a hedge to the field - the Devil's-lane is a good distance from Bishop's-walk, upwards of half a mile - Bishop's-walk leads into Devil's-lane; it is close by.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the hedge so high as to prevent your seeing him? A. I was not on the side the hedge was on.</p>

            . I live in Fulham. On the 6th of September I was at Mr. Steel's, about four o'clock, and saw two men come out of Devil's-alley running, about twenty yards from me - I did not look at their faces - I cannot tell who they were - after they had been running they stopped; the little one pulled off his hat, and gave the big one some money; I did not then look at their faces; I cannot tell who it was - the little one snatched a red purse away from the tall one; I did not see whether any money was taken out of a purse - after the short one snatched the purse, he put his hand into his hat, pulled out some money, and put it into the purse, then put it into his hat and ran on - I had seen them once before in the morning of that day, up by Mr. Steel's - I am sure they were the same men; it was about eleven o'clock in the morning - I cannot say whether the prisoner was one of them or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the last witness your mother? A. No - we were gathering beans together, she stood up and looked at them as we were going along - she was two or three yards from me - I was about twenty yards from the men - their backs were towards me, and she was following me - their backs were towards her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It was quite light? A. Yes.</p>

             (policeman). On the 6th of September, at ten o'clock at night - I took up the prisoner at Brompton - I searched him at the watch-house, and found on his person a piece of green ribbon, which I produced at Queen-square Office, and have here - he had three half-crowns and a sixpence, and five pence in copper - a small box of snuff, and a tailor's thimble - one of our serjeants found a reticule which he gave me - he is sick and unable to attend.</p>

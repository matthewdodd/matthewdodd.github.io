The prisoner Brinkley was in my service—in conse<lb></lb>quence of information I received, on the 31st of October, I went into a neighbour's house, and saw Shepstone lift up the latch of my door and go in—in about two or three minutes he came out with a basket—I followed him till he was just turning the corner, and said, "What are you about? you brought this from my house"—I moved a paper which covered the cocoa-nuts, and said, "How did you come by these? "—he said, "They were given me by Brinkley"—I said, "You must go back with me to the shop; I left Brinkley there; he has been robbing me, and has given you these nuts to carry away"—he said, "Don't take me back, for God's sake, for the sake of my character"—I took him back, and sent for Brinkley—I said to him, "You have been robbing me, and giving these nuts to this man"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "You must go with me before the Lord Mayor, "and he was taken—there are twenty-four cocoa-nuts—I am sure they are mine—I saw them taken out of the house—I had left my wife at home when I went out, and Brinkley sitting in the shop—it was not his business to take care of the shop—I paid him so much a hundred for opening the nuts, and taking the husks off—I left him opening nuts—no one could have taken them without his seeing them—I had left about ten minutes when Shepstone went in—my wife was in the shop then, and when I came back—she is not here—Brinkley was gone when I came back.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you present at the settlement of his accounts in September? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I might have gone into a longer statement, showing that the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not the only sum owed to us—I should think it is very likely that, the amount being 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, one of us gentlemen sug<lb></lb>gested that it should be 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. so as to allow for any outstanding goods-none of that was the result of sales which we considered he ought not to have made—I remember a customer named Charles Patreen, at Paris—it is a fact that he was charged in our account 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for those goods, including duties and so on, and was only credited to the amount of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it would require a great deal of explanation to prove that; but in consequence of his affairs not being straight some time previously, we had those goods delivered to us by the prisoner, nominally 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth; but we only considered than worth 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But as a matter of fact, so far as the prisoner was concerned, that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he was debited with, represented duties and a variety of other things, and you only gave him credit for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I should sy certainly from recollection this account of Patreen's had nothing to do with the settlement—I think I have a note here in the prisoner's writing which would explain that settlement—Patreen's was not included in that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think I can say positively; it was in connexion with another settlement made previously—the balance of that previous settlement was not carried into this 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. account; it was kept perfectly separate.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were any parts of it due in this way, that he had over<lb></lb>valued goods, and that you had credited him for what you considered to be the proper value of the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in this case at all; in Patreen's case perhaps it might be so, but not in the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it not thrown from the door where you were sitting? A. No, I was sitting at a door; he saw me, and came and took it off my finger - I had my head resting on my elbows, and the string of the reticule round my finger; I was alone - I had been with a few friends, and being very tired, sat down and fell asleep; the prisoner taking the reticule off my finger awoke me - I immediately got up, and went after him; it is not a place of resort for Policemen.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Dalston-lane, about three hundred yards from where the prosecutrix was sitting, which was in a brickmaker's shed- she was a stranger to me; I saw the prisoner enter the shed, reach his hand forward, as if to take something, and steal back - I had not then see the prosecutrix; he entered the next field, and in about a minute the prosecutrix came round the field, and hallooed after him - I followed him to Hackney-downs, and took him; I found the purse in his right-hand jacket pocket, with a crown-piece, a half-crown, and 8s. 6d. in it - he said he had picked it up; I kept the purse concealed till I got to the prosecutrix - I then asked her the colour of it; she said red, which it was - he had the reticule in his hand.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been out of employ about four months, and had nothing to eat; I thought I could go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080127"></xptr>down to Lincolnshire - when I got to Delston I was tired, I went into the brick-field, and sat down till one o'clock; I then saw some person, whether it was the prosecutrix I do not know - I fell asleep till nearly three; when I awoke I saw this old sand-house, and thought I would go and lay there - I went, and saw the prosecutrix and another person, who I suspected was the Policeman; they were asleep - I turned to where I had been laying, then got up, and came to this place - I saw something black laying about a foot within the door; I picked it up, and found it was this bag with some biscuits in it - I was very hungry, and did not think of there being money in it; I went on, took a biscuit out to eat, and a halfpenny dropped out - I then felt, and found the purse.</p>
               <p>M. A. WILLIAMS. I had been out the Saturday night with my friends: it was late when I left them, and I sat down in this place, about four o'clock, and dozed - there was nobody there all the time I was; I am sure I did not drop my reticule; there were four biscuits in it.</p>

On Tuesday evening, 29th Jan., about half past 7 o'clock I was in Cleve<lb></lb>land Square—a boy told me something, and I saw the prisoners and a tall man, who had a square box about a foot long, come out of No. 12, which is unoccu<lb></lb>pied—the box was loosely covered with a handkerchief, but I saw one corner of it—the man with the box closed the door behind him—Levy walked first, and I walked up to him, thinking I knew him—I observed him closely; the other man was about three yards behind him, and the other half a yard behind him—I can swear that both the prisoners are the men—they walked on towards Charles Street, towards the Great Western Railway terminus, and got out of my sight—I waited in the square, and Williams returned, and said, "What are those policemen doing there?"—I recognised him again, and said, "There has been a robbery;" he said, "Have they got them?" I said, "I do not know;" he said, "Did they detect the servants, or did the servants detect them?" and then said, "The men must have detected the servants first"—this was about ten minutes afterwards, about a quarter to 8—I was joined by Lucy Fowler—Williams walked towards</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clothier. I have lately been a bankrupt—I carried on business in Jury-street, Aldgate—the prisoner was in my employ as clerk and collector—he left my service at the latter end of April—he did not give me notice of his intention to leave—I missed a great number of articles at different times—I know Mr. Varley, a clothier—he made a com<lb></lb>munication to me, and I got the assistance of an officer—I went with him to watch the place where the prisoner lived, in Queen-square, Eldon-street, Moorfields—the officer was in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner's wife bring out a paper parcel—we followed her to Mr. Sarson's, the vinegar-ground, in the City-road, where the prisoner was employed—his wife went in—she came out, and I followed her back again to Wilson-street—I there saw the prisoner come running down the street after his wife—she gave him the parcel—I desired the officer to take him into custody with it—this is the parcel—it, contains three pairs of trowsers, three waistcoats, and a coat—they are my property—they had not been sold or disposed of by me in any way—they cost about 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had a customer named Milroyd, in Cornhill—I did not desire the prisoner to forward these things to him—two pairs of these trowsers and one waistcoat are marked inside, and have no tickets, but all the goods that were sent to Mr. Milroyd's were marked on tickets outside—I had no occasion to put the private mark on them—these other three articles have no private mark on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. I went with Mr. Newman, and saw the prisoner's wife come out with this parcel—she went to the Vinegar-ground; she was in there ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—she then came out with the same parcel, and came to Wilson-street—her husband came there, and she gave him the parcel—I took him with them—he said he had not stolen them, they were goods that he had, and he spoke of Mr. Milroyd at the station—said he had an account with the prosecutor, and he had paid him part of he the money—I went to the prisoner's lodging, and found a number of dupli<lb></lb>cates, one of which was for this pair of trowsers, which I got from the pawn<lb></lb>broker's in consequence of the duplicate.</p>

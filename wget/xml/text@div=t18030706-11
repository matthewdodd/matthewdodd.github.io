The prisoner lodged in the house before I went to it; I lodged with her three weeks.</p>

               <p>- DARE sworn. - I am a pewterer, at No. 10, Duke-street, Grosvenor-square: On Saturday the 11th of June, the prisoner came into my shop, and asked me if I knew of a situation; I told her, I did not at that time; but if she would call as she was passing by, if I should hear, I would tell her; she had a small bundle in her hand, and begged the favour of me to let her leave it till she came back, she was going a little further; I told her she might; she did not call that day, she called the following day, which was Sunday the 12th of June; I asked her why she did not call for her bundle; I went to give it her, and she said, being sunday, she would not take it till the next day. About eight o'clock in the evening Betts came for the bundle, and told me she was in custody; I cannot swear to the bundle, the handkerchief in which it is, is like it; the same bundle that I received from the prisoner, I delivered to the officer.</p>

               <p>HENRY BETTS sworn. - I belong to Marybone watch-house: On Sunday the 12th of June, the prisoner was in custody on suspicion of stealing a watch; she sent a little boy to the last witness's house; I thought it my duty to follow the boy; the boy first went into the shop, and I followed him; the boy asked for a bundle that Mrs. Preston had left; I told the last witness she was in custody, and he let me have the bundle; I found the watch in the bundle. - (Produces the gown.)</p>

               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my gown.</p>



               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought the gown of her.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Green.) Did you ever sell her this gown? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she ever offer to buy it? - A. No; after I had missed my gown, the prisoner said, she had lost a five-pound note, a ten-pound note, and a petticoat; another person lost a watch, and they said it must be me, and I was taken up; I was examined at Marlborough-street, and acquitted; before the gown was found the mistress of the house lost the watch, and I had seen her with a watch.</p>

               <p>Betts. The watch was delivered back before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Green. I saw her go out with a bundle the day I lost my gown, but I had no suspicion of her; she came back the same evening, and slept there.</p>

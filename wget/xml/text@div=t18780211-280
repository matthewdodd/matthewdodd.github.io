                  </hi>. I keep a beer shop at 129, Devonshire Street, Mile End—about 3 a. m. on 16th January I heard a noise, and waited for a policeman twenty minutes—I opened my window and spoke to a police<lb></lb>man—I then went downstairs—I missed a cruet-stand and a silver thimble—I found my ladder in the Foresters' club-room—it had been taken from the passage and let down into the room, which had been entered in that way—the ladder was locked up, but the place had been broken open—a number of cigars were lying on the counter, and the place was in great disorder—all these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my property.</p>

On the morning of 16th January I was on duty in the neighbourhood of the prosecutor's house—my attention was attracted by Mrs. Stephenson calling out at the window—I saw the prisoners leave the prosecutor's house and come over a side wall by some almshouses next door—a side door leads from the premises into the alms<lb></lb>house grounds—I went into the grounds and said "Halloa! what's your game here?"—they made a full stop—I rushed and caught Palmer—Mole slipped by me into the street—I saw him the next day at the station, when I picked him out from others—I am sure Mole is the other man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I did not mention my going into the grounds at the police-court—I said I met the prisoners coming out of the grounds—I did go into the grounds—I sprang my rattle—I identified Mole on 17th January—I gave my evidence on 16th—I saw Inspector O'Callaghan before identifying Mole—he did not speak to me about Mole; he told me to go into the library—Mole was not there—O'Callaghan said "256, this way; do you see anybody here you have seen before?"—Palmer's name was not mentioned before I saw Mole—Mole was not put among policemen, but among nine or ten men taken from the street—it was about 9 p. m.—Mole was in the charge-room—I passed through the charge-room to go to the library—only policemen were there then.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective H</hi>). I apprehended Mole on 17th January, at 7. 30—he was placed with eight men who had been asked to come and who had been walking in Bethnal Green Road—no constables were among them—they were men of Mole's stature—I saw Mole identified by Turner.</p>

I took Mole in custody in Swan Street—I have seen him there repeatedly—I know Mrs. Palmer now, the wife of the man who has pleaded guilty—I never saw her previous to the 18th at the police-court—I told Mole he was charged with being concerned in the robbery—he said ''Yes, I know all about it," and ''Palmer's wife has just left me, and I suppose she told you I was here," and "If I had been in the robbery I should not have stayed here, because I had plenty of time to get away."</p>

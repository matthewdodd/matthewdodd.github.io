                  </hi>. I was fifteen years old on 17th October—I am the prisoner's wife—we were married on 3d November—my mother and the prisoner were living together for some six months before our marriage—I lived with him in Pleasant—place until Sunday evening, 17th November—my mother lived in the same house—on 17th November, I told the prisoner that I did not want to live with him, I would sooner go to service, as he had used such beastly language to me—he said nothing to that, but about half an hour or an hour afterwards, he called me a filthy dirty word, and threatened to push my head through the wall, but my father prevented it—he was living in the house too—I did not sleep with the prisoner, or go into his room, that night after he said that—he came out, locked the door, and took the key out—next morning, he and my mother went out together early—he came back first, and my mother after<lb></lb>wards at about half—past 11—I was then in my father's room with my little sister, about ten, and my brother, about five years old—the prisoner rushed up stairs, took me by the throat with one hand, and pushed me on the floor—he then got me by both hands round my throat, and kept knocking my bead on to the floor, saying that he would murder me—Frank Fielder came in and took the prisoner off me, and then I managed to get up, and run down stairs—my throat was all black, and there were two lumps on each side.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, who keeps the house 48, Pleasant—place—the prisoner lodged there—he came home on the morning of this occurrence at half—past 11—I opened the door to him, and he went as fast as he possibly could up stairs—his mother came to the door as I was closing it, and asked me to go up stairs—I heard no blows, but I heard the prosecutrix scream—I went up, and found the prisoner on the floor holding the prosecutrix by the throat with both hands—she was black in the face, and her eyes were starting out of her head—I seized him, and dragged him off—he struggled to get to her again, and said that he would murder her—when I let go of him he said that he was much obliged to me, for if I had not taken him off he certainly should have murdered her—she had got out of the room then—he was not so drunk but what he knew what he was about.</p>

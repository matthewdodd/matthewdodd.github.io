On the 26th of December I slept with him, as a friend slept with my wife. I went out in the morning, leaving my brooch sticking in my handkerchief in his room, on the table; I left him, and his son, who is ten years of age, in the room. I returned at two o'clock, and missed it. I saw the prisoner at night, and asked him about it - he denied knowing anything about it. I gave him in charge. Next day I saw my brooch at Cooper's.</p>

I was at my next door neighbour's, who is a watch-maker, the prisoner's son came in, produced the brooch, and asked if it was gold - the prisoner stopped at the door - I came out. He told me that the boy had found it in the street; I offered the boy 5 s. for it; the boy went to the prisoner, and spoke to him, came back, and said his father said I should have it for 7 s., which I gave him - they went away together.</p>

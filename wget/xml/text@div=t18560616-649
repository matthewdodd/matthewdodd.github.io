                  </hi>. I am the daughter of John Brett, a carpenter and broker, of Church-street, St. Pancras. The prisoner lives right opposite—his father keeps a broker's shop—I have had no quarrel with him lately—he has called me names, but I have not called him any—we did not have a quarrel on the night this happened—on 12th June, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was cleaning out the shop and saw the prisoner standing at his own doorway—he stood in the doorway, and threw something over me out of a cup which he had in his hand, which I thought at first was water—it burnt my face and the crown of my head very much—it marked my dress; I have it here—I saw a medical gentleman about half-past 10 o'clock—as soon as it was thrown over me I went up and complained to my father.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at No. 4, Judd-place East, New-road. I saw the prosecutrix at the police station on the evening of 12th June—her cheek was slightly excoriated; not very much—there was a small sore produced by some excoriating substance which I tasted; it had a taste like diluted sulphuric acid—I am of opinion it was diluted acid which is used for domestic purposes—it would be diluted in the proportion of seven parts of water to one of acid—I examined her clothes; she had them on then—they were stained with the drops of the diluted acid—there was one hole through the cloth—the colour was gone, but I could restore it with ammonia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That would show that the colour was not destroyed, but only damaged, would it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would—the hole was in the front of the dress—I am of opinion that it was made by burning, because there was more acid where the hole was burnt—it was about the size of a fourpenny piece.</p>

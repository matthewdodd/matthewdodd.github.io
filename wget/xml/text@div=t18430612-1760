                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Fir-lane, Edmonton. On the 28th of May I left my house about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon-I locked and bolted the doors, and left every thing safe—I returned about eight o'clock or five minutes after—I found my shop door still locked—I opened it, came in, and had occasion to go at once to the wash house—I found the door still locked, but the key which I had left outside was inside—I felt alarmed, and made my way as quick as I could through the room adjoining my shop—I trod on a large nail, which I picked up, and which I am sure was not time when I went out—I proceeded to the stable, which adjoins the house, and found a door wide open which I had left bolted—a wall ten or eleven feet high separates the stable from the washhouse, at the top of which is a wooden partition, thirteen or fourteen feet high—a hole was broken in the partition, which would enable a person to get into the coal-house, and into the house—the broken boards were lying on the coals—the lock of the door which opens from the washhouse into the shop was forced back—I missed from the shop about sixty halfpence, six penny pieces, and some farthings—part of the halfpence were in the till, and part wrapped in paper, on the shelf be<lb></lb>hind a thread and cotton-box, out of which I had paid the prisoner 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the Saturday night, and replaced it there again while he staid in the shop—he worked for me—it was concealed by the box—no one would have thought of looking there—the prisoner had been three times in my service—he looked after the horse and went on errands—I picked up a knife near the washhouse-door, which the prisoner used in cleaning the shoes with, and which was kept in a dark shed behind some blacking bottles—no one used that knife but him and me—the nail that I picked up had been taken out of a tool<lb></lb>box, and to get at that he had to move two baskets of wood, which stood on a tub of sand, and no stranger would have thought of doing that.</p>

                  </hi>. I live next door but one to Mrs. Negus. On the 28th of May, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner against Mrs. Negus's rattling the back door—I Accused him of trying to open it, and told him Mrs. Negus was not at home—he said, "Very well," and went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took the prisoner on the night of the 28th of May—I found him in bed at his father's house—I found 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence sown up in his watch-pocket—I told him he was charged on suspi<lb></lb>cion of robbing the house of Mrs. Negus—he denied all knowledge of it—he afterwards pulled out a farthing, and said, "This is all I have got, I spent the remainder"—I asked how much more he had spent—he said, "A penny"—he afterwards said he had lost the remainder out of his pocket—he said he pushed back the lock with the nail that was picked up in the parlour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a travelling clerk attached to the Missing Letter Department of the Post-office—on the 23rd October, in consequence of instructions I received, I made up two test letters; one containing 211 penny postage stamps, marked so that I might again identify them, addressed to Mr. James McMichael—I posted them at the S. W. District Office, Buckingham Gate, about 7 o'clock the same evening; and the second letter, containing a first half of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, of which I kept a memorandum of the date and number; and I also identify it by my own private mark on each half—the police officer has that—they were dispatched from the S. W. District Office about 7.40—some short time after that I proceeded to Chelsea, where the first letter would be delivered at about 9 o'clock, and the second one about 9.30</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187711190045"></xptr>
               <p>—I went to the address of the letter containing the stamps, namely, 207, King's Road—it is an heraldic office—the shop being shut up, I stayed in the passage, and a letter-carrier knocked at the door and put two letters through the aperture—the test letter I Dad made up containing the stamps was not there—I then went after the prisoner William James, and saw him deliver the letters in Paulton Square—the other letter containing the first half of the note was addressed to Paulton House—I went to Paulton House and saw the prisoner William James delivering letters there—he passed by Paulton House and turned down Bedford Street into Little Camera Street—he was previously accosted by another man, and they went into Little Camera Street together—he had finished his delivery as far as I knew—I thought, at first, the other man was the prisoner Joseph—they then went into Langton Street—I ascertained afterwards that they went into 31, Little Camera Street, which is where Joseph lives—I afterwards saw "William James and another man go into 33, Langton Street—I would not swear whether it was the same man I saw him with in Camera Street—I was not very close—the next morning I made up another test letter with the remaining half of the £5 Bank of England note, which I also posted at the S.W. District Post-office, Buckingham Gate, the same morning—it would go from there to Chelsea at about 11 o'clock, and would be in the prisoner William James's delivery about 12 o'clock—I went to Paulton Square and watched him delivering his letters—he did not deliver any letter at Paulton House, but passed the door—I next saw him about 1 o'clock, when he went into 33, Langton Street, which is his house, and I saw him come out again between 2 and 3 o'clock—he had on then, a private hat and private coat—lie was in uniform when I saw him go in about 1 o'clock—he was then coming from the direction of Little Camera Street, which would be about five minutes' walk from the limit of his delivery—Butler was with me when I saw him in his private clothes—we saw the prisoner come out and go into a house about a dozen doors off—when he came out of the door Butler crossed over and stopped him inside the gate—I came up and said ""We belong to the Post-office, what have you been in the house for?"—he replied "On business"—I said "Who resides there?"—he said "Mr. Turner"—I knocked at the door and went in and made some inquiries—when I came out, from what Butler told me, I gave the prisoner into custody, and he was taken to the police-station in a cab—I there told him that three letters I had posted were missing—I told him where they were addressed to—he said he knew nothing about them—he was searched and nothing was found on him relating to this charge—I afterwards went with Butler to the prisoner's house, 33, Langton Street—we made a search there, and afterwards went to Joseph Delaney's house, 31, Little Camera Street, and met him coming out of the house—Butler spoke to him—I did not hear what he said—he said "Your name is Joseph Delaney," and he said "Yes"—I walked behind them into the house downstairs into the front kitchen, where Butler put some questions to him, and told him he was a police-officer attached to the Post-office, and that his brother William James was in custody for stealing post-letters and bank notes—he appeared surprised, and Butler said we should have to make a search, and had he anything about him—he said "Yes, two letters and a news<lb></lb>paper," producing them from his pocket, "which I was about to post when you stopped me"—Butler said "We shall have to make a search"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187711190046"></xptr>
               <p>—he said "You are quite at liberty"—Butler said "We will commence with you"—" Oh, no, you won't," he said—I saw something in his hand and seized him by the wrist—we fell over the clothes horse, which was broken, and after a severe struggle, his mother and sister coming to his assistance, I succeeded in getting this paper from his hand, which is black from coming in contact with the bars of the grate (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—his hand was almost in the fire when I seized it and got the paper from him, which was the identical bank-note which was in the two test letters, but which had been joined together, and in the struggle had been torn again—it is endorsed "Hy. Thompson, 3, Trinity Square, London, S., Octr. 4, 1877"—that endorsement was not on it when I put it in the letters—it was a perfectly new clean note, except my marks, which were not visible—the letters found on him which he was going to post are in the same handwriting as the endorsement on the note, and the two postage stamps on them I identify as two of the stamps in the letter to Mr. McMichael—they both bear my mark—after I secured the note he was allowed to get up, and Butler searched him and found in his pocket a piece of loose paper with 209 postage stamps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), making, with the two on the letter, 211—they are the same as those enclosed, and bear my private mark—I told him I identified them as mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Langton Street is not in the Chelsea delivery at all—I believe it is in the Brompton district—William James came there from the direction of Little Camera Street—Langton Street is about four or five minutes' walk from his delivery—when I saw him in Langton Street he was with some one who appeared to be the other prisoner Joseph—I could not swear it was, but I almost believe it was—we met him in King's Road—it was dark—I did not get very close to him—Butler can speak more to that than I can—he was closer to him—I did not notice the number of the house that William James was coming out of when he was taken into custody—it was the first house from the direction of Little Camera Street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer attached to the Post-office—on the evening of the 23rd October I was engaged watching the prisoner William with Mr. Stevens—I saw him finish his delivery, and fling his bag across his shoulders and go into Camera Street and meet the prisoner Joseph—I am positive it was Joseph—he did not deliver a letter at Poulton House—I know the addresses of the letters and saw them, viz.: one to Mr. McMichael, Heraldic Office, 207, King's Road, Chelsea, another to Mrs. B. Neville, Paulton House, Paulton Square, Chelsea, and the other to Mrs. Neville also, but not to Paulton House, but Paulton Square—when he met Joseph they went to Little Camera Street—I left them, and after<lb></lb>wards saw William with another man, not the prisoner—on the 24th I saw William come out of his house, 33, Langton Street, at 2 o'clock—I had been in Paulton Square previously—I told him I was an officer from the General Post-office, and I pointed to Mr. Stevens crossing the road, and I said "This gentleman is also from the General Post-office, and wants to speak to you about some missing letters," and we all went on the steps leading to the house—as soon as Mr. Stevens got in the prisoner sud<lb></lb>denly jumped off' the stops and tried to get away—I jumped alter him, and caught him him before ho got out of the gate, and he tore his coat in the struggle Mr. Stevens came out and told me to take him to the police-station, which I did, and I then searched him—we went to Joseph's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187711190047"></xptr>
               <p>house, and I said "A police-officer from the Post-office wants to speak to you"—we went back into the house and I said "Tour brother the letter-carrier is in custody charged with stealing letters; I saw you in his com<lb></lb>pany last night—there is some property missing which he has stolen, and I have reason to believe you know something about it." He said "I did meet my brother last night, but know nothing about the letters." I said "What have you got about you?" He said "Two letters and a news<lb></lb>paper which I am going to post." I took those from him and said "Is that all?" He said "Yes." I said "I shall have to make search." He said "Ton are quite welcome to search, where you like." As I was going to search him he thrust his hand into his pocket and went to the fireplace and burnt his fingers by coming in contact with the bars—the ladies came in and a violent struggle ensued—afterwards in his bedroom I was about to search him again, when he became more calm—I took some stamps from his pocket which he said were his own. I counted them, and there were 209.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The man I saw with William in Langton Street was not Joseph—when I said I was a police-officer and wanted to speak to him, he appeared very willing—when he got up after the struggle he asked me what the charge was against him—Mr. Stevens had previously given me this bank-note—I told him I had reason to believe that he knew some<lb></lb>thing about it, and the the would be charged with receiving these letters from his brother well knowing them to be stolen. He said "I did receive them from my brother, but did not know they were stolen." Some private conversation took place then, and I told him there was half of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I am assistant overseer in the Chelsea branch office in which the prisoner William was employed as letter-carrier—he has been in the service about 10 years—I received instructions from Mr. Stevens, and on the evening of the 23rd Oct, in consequence of those instructions, I searched for two letters addressed to Mr. McMichael and Mrs. Neville, which. I found and placed them with other letters on the prisoner William's seat for him to sort—they were not for his delivery that evening, but he should have treated them as mis-sorts, and thrown them out—he left the office about 8.35—they ought not to have been delivered at their different addresses that night by him, but by different postmen—on the morning of the '24th October I locked out for another letter addressed to Mrs. Neville—the bag arrived from the south-west district office at 11.8—there was an unlabelled bundle amongst them—from instructions I received that letter would be in that bundle, and I placed it on his seat to sort, which it was his duty to sort as mis-sorts—he left the office for his delivery at about 11.20.</p>

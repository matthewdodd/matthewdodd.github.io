               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was conducted to Southampton, from Newgate, by Mr. Owen; he knows we might have made our escape several times, but I was glad to embrace the opportunity of serving his Majesty; and we went with the wrong convoy, and came back again, and went on board the right convoy; there was a galley went, and we were all put down below for forty-nine hours, without any thing to eat or drink; I was very ill sed by the captain and we put back, and they had leave to come on shore, and I did the same as any body would have been glad to have done, after they had been used in that manner.</p>
               <p>Owen. I had a party of light-horse to escort him and forty-three others, to Southampton; I always took particular care of him, that he could not have escaped.</p>

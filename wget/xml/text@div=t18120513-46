On Monday night, the 11th of May, I had occasion to go out to spend the evening among some friends, and the carriage being ordered, the second coachman drove the carriage out about nine o'clock, and the lad and me went to the stable soon afterwards. We met the prisoner a little way from the stable. From thence I proceeded to spend the evening; and when I returned, the second coachman informed me that somebody had attempted to break into the stable. I went up stairs, and opened the door, and found some things missing. This was about half past five in the morning; and from the lad's information I suspected the prisoner. I found the prisoner about half after seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181205130041"></xptr> o'clock, in Barlow Mews. He is a coachman. He was washing his carriage. I questioned him with it, and he denied it. I got Mr. Plank, the constable, to apprehend him. The prisoner then owned to me that he had taken the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the stables a part of the house - A. They belong to the house. I, and the second coachman, and the lad sleep there.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you lost - A. I do not know exactly. I lost three neck handkerchiefs. I cannot say how many stockings I lost.</p>

            . I am thirteen years old. I am a servant to Mr. Buck. I am a helper in the stables. On Monday night the second coachman went out, and I went with Waterman to the stables. On my going from the stables to the house, I met the prisoner. The second coachman went back with me to put the horses in. He left me there; and the prisoner came down stairs. He took the light out of the lanthern, and desired me to go out. I asked him who he was, and how he came there. He told me, I must go up stairs. I told him, I would not. I ran out of doors and called, murder.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get in - A. We left the key in the coach-house door.</p>

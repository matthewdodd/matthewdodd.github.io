            . Q. What are you. - A. I live at Harefield, I am a farmer and wheelwright; the prisoner lived in our neighbourhood. On the 4th of October, about eleven o'clock at night the prisoner was going by my gate with a hive of bees tied up in a cloth I asked him what he had got, he would not speak. I said, I insisted of knowing, it was of no use for him to run away; then he threw the hive of bees down; I did not pursue him. I examined the hive of bees, they were not my property; Mr. Weedon came and looked at them and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner again that night. - A. No, not till Monday morning; then we waited till he came home; and then the constable and me, and two more men, took him. We found another hive upon the premises; after some discourse with him, he said he was brought into it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Barry. You said it would be the better for him to tell the truth - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. What became of the hive. - A. Mr. Weedon took it home; he has had it ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect being fetched by the last witness on the night of the 4th of October. - A. Yes, he shewed me a hive of bees that were mine. It corresponded in all its parts with mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. What is the character of the prisoner. - A. I never before knew nothing against him.</p>
               <p>Court. What was that hive of bees worth. - A. We sell them at a shilling a pound; the bees and hives altogether.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

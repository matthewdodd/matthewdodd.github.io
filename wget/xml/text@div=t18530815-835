                  </hi>. I keep an hotel, in St. Paul's Churchyard. On Friday, 24th June, I remember the prisoner dining at my house—after he had dined, from something I observed, I collared him, and said, "You rascal, you have stolen that spoon"—he resisted a little—I took him by the collar—he followed me into the other room—the waiter searched him, and found this part of a spoon, with the top broken off, in his breast pocket—I cannot say whether the waiter took it from him, or whether he took it out—he resisted a good deal—a number of duplicates were found on him—I gave the spoon and duplicates to the officer.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody on 24th June, at the Cathedral Hotel, in St. Paul's Churchyard—I received this part of a spoon, and nine or ten duplicates—I searched the prisoner, and found on him some more duplicates, twenty-one in all—I have examined them; they relate to watches, handkerchiefs, and other things, pawned in different names—three silk handkerchiefs were found on the prisoner, with no marks on them.</p>

I believe this broken spoon to be the property of me and my partner—I have a great number of others, and a portion of them resemble this one—the shape and form of this spoon are very striking—it is rather old-fashioned—I have brought one with me to compare with it—I have seen the prisoner at our tavern; I cannot say when.</p>

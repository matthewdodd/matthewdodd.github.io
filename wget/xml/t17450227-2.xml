            . On the 28th of January between the hours of nine and ten, the Prisoner picked me up at the corner of Crown Court Soho, and asked me for something to drink: she kept a long side of me, and entreated me to go to her lodging in <placeName id="t17450227-2-crimeloc9">Peter's Street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17450227-2-crimeloc9" type="placeName" value="Peter's Street"></interp>

I called for a quartern of shrub, and paid for it: she asked me to lie with her, which I was weak enough to consent to. I asked her what she must have; she told me a shilling; I gave her the shilling; I had three guineas and a moidore in my pocket before I lay with her; after she got off the bed, she went out of the room under pretence of calling the maid of the house to bring a chamber-pot; I immediately missing my money, went after her, and told her she should not go out of the house, for I had lost so much money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she gone out of the room before you missed your money?</p>
               <p>Puckett. Yes; without the door; she came back into the room, and said I might search her clothes. I searched her; she pulled off her clothes, and I could find no money about her. I told her, if she knew any thing of the money, and would let me have it again, I would not trouble her any further; but she still denied it, and I charged the watch with her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray, Sir, was I out of the room?</p>
               <p>Puckett. Yes; you was out of the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not out of the room.</p>
               <p>Puckett. You was out of the room-door as far as the top of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You searched me, and I pulled all my clothes off: the landlady was present at the same time: I took off my shoes and stockings too.</p>
               <p>Puckett. That is a story, you pulled your shoes off, and you would have pulled your stockings off, but I said it did not signify any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking?</p>
               <p>Puckett. No; nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that this money might not seatter out of your pocket while you was upon the bed?</p>
               <p>Puckett. I took the clothes off the bed, and searched, and there was no money upon the bed - after I had searched her. <rs id="t17450227-2-verdict10" type="verdictDescription">

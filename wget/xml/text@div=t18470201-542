                  </hi>. I am warehouseman and traveler to Messrs. Partridge and Price, who carry on business as warehousemen, in Cheapside. On the 7th of Jan. I sent 603 pieces of mouselin-de-laine to Mr. Matthews, our dresser and hot-presser, to block and board them—on the 9th of Jan., 300 pieces were returned, and on the 12th of Jan. 303 were returned, making 603 pieces—I afterwards found, on measuring them, from five to a dozen pieces were short of their proper quantity—my attention was called to the fact by Cobley, by the production of some pieces apparently detached from the larger ones—I found by comparison that they had been cut from the larger pieces—these are them—here is the original piece which this one has been taken from—this smaller piece makes up the proper quantity with the other, and this small piece has our private mark on it; and here is also the stamp put by Act of Parliament, by which these goods are registered when they are brought out, they are made of wool and cotton—this piece is worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—these pieces are all form our goods—we have no means of swearing to these other pieces—they have no mark—they are the exact patterns of ours—there are several places in the original pieces where these have been torn from—if you take a glass and examine the threads, you will see this one has been torn from this piece—it fits and matches.</p>

PARNELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There are two ends to each piece, one next to the board and the other outside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—these pieces have been cut from the outside end—these two ends match, thread for thread—we have the copyright of every one of these patterns—it would be impossible for them to come from any other warehouse than ours—that is the reason of this stamp on them—it is generally known in the trade that we have a copyright, and that these are registered—Mr. Matthews has been in the habit of pressing for us for some years—he is a presser and blocker—these goods are originally folded all he has to do is to put them on these boards, and to put these papers round them—that was all he had to do in this instance—these goods were dressed at the works—sometimes they come not dressed—if he had to dress them it does not become necessary to cut them or to tear them—the whole of these patterns were sent at the time the 603 pieces were sent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cloth-worker and dresser—I am employed by Partridge and Co., of Cheapside. On Thursday, the 7th of Jan., I received a quantity of mouselin-de-lane from them, to board—we boarded them, and sent some back on Saturday, and some on the Monday—I had the prisoner and about seven more to do the work—I noticed on one of the pieces the name of Partridge and Co.—I think the prisoner would in general have an opportunity in doing that work to detach pieces from them, but not on this occasion—there were seven more helping him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There were a lot of others employed on this work beside the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they were my servants at the time, but are not now, only two of them—the prisoner was at work part of the time these goods were in the house, though not all the time—he worked for me five years—two years at the shop in Noble-street, and three years at No. 46, Basinghall-street—my business is to board and press these goods for Mr. Partridge—I do that for many others—I have these kind of remnants from time to time in my possession—I do a deal for houses, and we buy remnants of this description, and I sell them as well as being a dresser—none of the men in my employ buy them, to my knowledge—there are men in the trade who make a common practice of it—I do not know Petticoat-lane—when I was at journey work I used to know it—I used to work for Dodridge and Lowe, and our cart used to go sown there; and Rosemary-lane I know, but still I am not a dealer there—I believe these could be bought and sold in Petticoat-lane—I never had a more honest lad than the prisoner—till this matter, he had always borne an irreproachable character—I am sorry to have to appear against him—I would employ him again to-morrow.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 65.) On Sunday evening, 10th Jan., I was on duty in Globe-road, Bethnal-green, and I met the prisoner carrying a bundle under his arm—I asked him what he had there, he said, "Cloths"—I desired him to let me see them—he partly opened the bundle and said they were de-laines—I asked him where he got them, he said he had no business to tell me—I asked him where he was going to take them, he said he would not tell me, but I might come and see—I said that would not do for me, he must come with me—I took him to the station, and found in the bundle these 44 pieces of mouselin-de-laine.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

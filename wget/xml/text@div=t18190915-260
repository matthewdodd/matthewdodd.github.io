I was going home, and the prisoner ran after me, and asked me if a boy had not stolen my hat? I said Yes, and you are one of them. He said, No, I am not, I was standing at the other corner. I went home, got assistance, and had him secured. I am sure he was with the others - he did not take it.</p>

Watkins came to me without his hat; I told him to change his clothes, then went out with him and Van, round the different courts; we saw several boys, none of which he said were the right, but directly he saw the prisoner he gave me a signal, and we secured him.

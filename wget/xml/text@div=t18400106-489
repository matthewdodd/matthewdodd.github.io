                  </hi>I am a baker, living in Farthing-street, Spitalfields. The prisoner was in my service some years ago—I have lost sight of him for three yean—on Christmas-day, as I was going to my bake-house, I saw him going out of the bake-house door—he had no right there—I pur<lb></lb>sued and brought him back—a boy brought me this box, which was what we used to put money in, and which was empty then, but I had seen it about half-an-hour before, when it contained two half-crowns, one shilling, thirty pence, and forty halfpence—a policeman was called—the prisoner was searched, and no money found on him—it had been scattered about, and picked up by different people—I did not see the prisoner remove any money—the box was not locked—it was on a dresser in the kitchen—he would not know the box, but he could see it from where he was, and might think there was money in it.</p>

On Saturday, the 20th of August, between the hours of two and three o'clock, the prisoner came into my coffee-room; he called for his dinner; it was given him by the waiter. There were three or four spoons on the table. I had a suspicion of the prisoner. I desired the waiter to look out, as I suspected the prisoner to be the person who stole two spoons on the Wednesday preceeding. According to my order, he looked out, and missed two spoons off the table where the prisoner sat I desired him not to take notice, to go backwards and in his business. As soon as I was satisfied the prisoner had the spoons, I sent for an officer; which I had detained in the bar until he had paid the waiter for his dinner, and half a pint of wine. I desired the waiter to go to the bottom of the court, and to wait there, and the person that I should follow, that was the man that I suspected. The prisoner went out of my premises; I followed, and stopped him. I told him that I had a strong suspicion that he had some of my property about his person; I had sent for a constable, he should search him, and to avoid a noise in the street, we would go back, he should be searched in my house; the officer came and took him up stairs, and searched him. I heard the spoons rattle in his pocket as he went up stairs, and during<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181409140016"></xptr>the officer had his hand in his right hand pocket. The prisoner produced the two silver spoons from his left hand pocket; he said, there is your spoons; I believe it is your intention to give me in custody; I said, most certainly. He was taken to the Compter. The officer has the spoon.</p>
               <p>JAMES HAND. I am an officer. As I was searching the prisoner's right hand pocket, he pulled these spoons out of his left hand pocket, and delivered them to the prosecutor; he said, these are your spoons Them are the spoons; they have never been out of my custody since. The prosecutor delivered them to me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my spoons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have little to say in my defence. I should not have been guilty of this offence had not temptation been thrown in my way. I went to the house to dine. I had no idea of stealing anything although the gentleman has said he had a suspicion of me; he had no ground for that suspicion.</p>

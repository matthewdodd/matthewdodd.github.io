               <p>five o'clock, I went into the passage of the house from the shop, and saw the prisoner King with my stuffed bird and case under his arm—it had been hanging up on the first-floor landing—this was on the ground-floor—the door at the foot of the stairs was a little open—I had come down stairs about five or six minutes before, and closed that door after me—the latch had caught—the bird was then safe—I asked King what he had there—he did not answer me—in a minute or two I looked up the stairs, and saw Cummins—he came down, and begged of me to forgive him, and he would never do it again—I missed a time-piece stand from the mantel-piece on the second floor—I found that behind a box on the first-floor landing—it had been removed from its proper place.</p>

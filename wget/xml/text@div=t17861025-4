               <p>I was returning home a quarter after twelve at night, on the 8th of September last; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250006"></xptr> took a coach, and going along <placeName id="t17861025-4-crimeloc23">Albemarle-street</placeName>

               <p>Can you recollect the particular expression they used? - Stop; upon which he stopped: the first man in the white coat came up on the left hand side of the coach, and the other man went to the other door; they opened both doors, and told me to deliver my money; I saw three men before the doors were open, and when the d oors were open, I only saw two; one kept behind the wheel; they told me to deliver my money, or they would blow my brains out; after I gave them my money, which was about eight guineas, they asked for my watch; I said I had none, upon which they pulled out something very much like a pistol, but whether it was or no, I cannot say; and told me, if I did give my watch, they would blow my brains out, upon which I gave them my watch; it was a small gold watch; they then shut both doors, and told the coachman to go on; he went on very fast; I then perceived a watchman running under the wall after a man in a darkish coat, upon which I told the coachman to let me out and I would pursue them, but he drove on a great deal faster, so that if I had tried to get out, I must have been run over; I said stop, stop, as loud as ever I could, three or four times.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he heard you? - I cannot tell whether he heard me or not.</p>
               <p>Were the glasses up? - Both the side glasses were down.</p>
               <p>Had you any string? - I did not perceive any; I did not let down the window at the back of the coach, nor I did not put out my head, I only called out very loud; he drove fast till I got into Conduit-street, where I lodge; I directed him to No. 31; he did not know the number; he drove into the middle of the street, upon which I told him to let me out; and I told him, I believed from the circumstances of the robbery, that he was privy to it; and I would go and swear against him the next day; I took his number; he said he wondered how I could think he was guilty, he was a very honest man; I took his number, and went to my lodgings, which are about the middle of the street; the coachman followed me, and I paid him his fare, and he went away.</p>
               <p>Have you any knowledge of the persons that committed the robbery? - I could not swear to them, I can swear to the coachman; I have since heard his name is Mills; I gave a description of Wright, as being like the man that I saw in the white coat.</p>
               <p>What do you say about the other man? - The man that took my money, was a taller man than the man that came up to the horses first.</p>
               <p>Was it a dark night, or a light night? - It was rather dark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I think in your examination before the Justice, you said that it was so dark you could not discover what weapon it was that he approached with with? - No, Sir, I did not say so, I said I could not see whether it was a pistol or not; when a man tells another he will blow his brains out, he cannot tell exactly what the weapon is.</p>
               <p>Then from the darkness and the alarm together, you could not distinguish what weapon it was? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>What is he? - A mason by trade.</p>
               <p>Does he happen to buy watches? - Not in particular as I know of.</p>
               <p>Did he buy it? - Yes, for a guinea and a half.</p>
               <p>What became of that watch? - One of Sir Sampson's men has it in his custody; I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with the two prisoners Wright and Lawson? - I have seen them before, but I never spoke to them before that day.</p>

               <p>Where was this that these people came to you? - In Old-street.</p>
               <p>Did they come to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you deal in watches? - I live at a pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>You said you was a cooper? - I am a cooper by trade, but I lodge at a pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>What business do you follow? - A cooper.</p>
               <p>How came they to apply to you? - There was nobody else at home.</p>
               <p>Do you ever serve in the shop? - Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Do you ever work at your trade of a cooper? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where? - Why, with different masters.</p>
               <p>Who did you work with last? - Mr. Kemp.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>As near as you can recollect? - It may be about three months.</p>
               <p>What may be the pawnbroker's name? - Mrs Harris.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you have some interest in the shop? - No interest at all in the shop</p>
               <p>Was you in the shop? - I was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>How came these two people in Mrs. Harris's kitchen? - They came in at the back door which leads into the kitchen, and I was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Is that a door that people use to come to, to pledge their goods? - There is a way at the back door as well as the front to the shop; this back door also leads into the shop; they came into the kitchen; they wanted to sell the watch; they did not ask to pledge it; so I brought Pearce to buy it.</p>
               <p>I suppose it has happened to you before this time, that people have come to this pawnbroker's shop to sell things, and you have got them a purchaser? - Yes.</p>

             the man you usually get? - No; this watch was a small one, and I did not know the value of it, or else I should have bought it myself; he lodged at the same pawnbroker's as I did.</p>
               <p>Where did you find Pearce? - I found him in the Old-Bailey.</p>
               <p>Then perhaps though Pearce bought it, you and he went halves in it? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What did you let Pearce have the benefit of the whole job to himself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So you had not been acquainted with Wright and Lawson before? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>You said something of having seen them before? - Yes, I had seen them before; I had a knowledge of their faces.</p>
               <p>How often might you have seen them before? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Had they ever been at your friend Mrs. Harris's shop? - No, Sir, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Where had you met them before? - I had seen them go along Old-street.</p>
               <p>Do you know what occupations they follow? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know their names? - Not till they were given in at Sir Sampson Wright's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. East, how long have you lived at this house of Mrs. Harris's? - Ever since I first took my lodgings there.</p>
               <p>How long is that, pray Sir? - I cannot justly say to a day or two; I very often lodge there, particularly when I am out of work I go there; Mrs. Harris is my own sister; sometimes I work at one end of the town, and sometimes at the other; when I work near there, I lodge there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250008"></xptr>Are you constantly changing your work that you are changing your lodgings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not live with the people where you work? - No only lodge near them.</p>
               <p>You are often with your sister? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long ago is it your sister was tried for receiving stolen goods? - You must ask the Court that; I do not chuse to answer that; it does not concern this matter.</p>
               <p>In fact your sister has been tried for receiving stolen goods, has not she? - What occasion have you to ask me that.</p>
               <p>Court. If you know it you must give the answer? - It does not concern this fact.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Give the answer, and give it immediately? - I cannot tell to the time.</p>
               <p>Was she tried for receiving stolen goods? - She was tried for a misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>What was that misdemeanor? - You must apply to the record for that.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Pearce? - Ever since I first knew him.</p>
               <p>Court. I will not suffer you to insult the Court in that manner, by giving such impudent answers? - If he asks me impudent questions, I have a right to give him impudent answers.</p>
               <p>Court. You will not go from hence my friend at liberty if you go on so; you was asked a fair question; if there had been any doubt about your character, your answering in this manner fixes it forever; if you dare give such another answer as that I will send you to Newgate instantly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now Sir, how long have you been acquainted with Pearce? - About four years, he lodges in the same house.</p>
               <p>How long has he lived with her? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Upon general knowledge, speaking to a month, or two months, or three months? - I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>How long has he lived of that four years with your sister? - I cannot say; I am not always at home; it is very seldom I am at home.</p>
               <p>Tell me as near as you can guess how long he has lived in the same house with Mrs. Harris? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Do not you call on your sister very frequently? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. I do not see any necessity to enquire into the degree of intimacy between his sister and Pearce.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Have you ever known Pearce tried for any offence? - He might be and I not know it.</p>
               <p>Do you know in point of fact that he has been tried or not? - I do not recollect that ever he was tried for any offence of theft, not since I have known him.</p>
               <p>If such a circumstance had happened should not you have known it? - I am positive sure he never was since I knew him.</p>
               <p>Do not you know in point of fact that this man, Mr. Pearce, has been capitally convicted? - No, Sir, I do not know that.</p>
               <p>What part of the Old Bailey was it that you found Pearce in; was it not in that building there? - It might be.</p>
               <p>Was it not in Newgate? - Yes; he was talking to Mr. Pitt the turnkey when I found him.</p>
               <p>Was not he a prisoner at that time in Newgate? - No.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes, I am, or else he could not have gone home to have bought the watch.</p>
               <p>Was not Mrs. Harris, your sister, in Newgate at that time? - You may ask Mr. Akerman.</p>
               <p>I ask you Sir?</p>

               <p>How came they to apply to you there? - Because there was nobody else present.</p>

               <p>Court. If I took your evidence right, you said you knew their persons and not their names? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How often have you given evidence against prisoners before this time? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Have you never shared a reward with a person who has given evidence against them? - No, Sir.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the London Docks—on 13th De<lb></lb>cember, about 10 minutes to four in the afternoon, I was holding a gentleman's horse at 8, St. Mary-at-Hill, and saw Chance come out of No. 34, a shop where there are barrels and casks, with a large copper can in his hand—he came down the hill with it, and went through Cross-lane. towards Billingsgate, and then through a court into another lane—I did not follow him because I had the horse and cart—I went that evening, about 10 minutes to 9, with two policemen to Saville's house, which is a marine store shop, No. 53, Charles-street, Oakley-street, Lambeth—we found both the prisoners there, and I saw Sergeant Budd take out this copper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from under a table in the back parlour—I said that Chance was the boy who stole the copper—it was then broken up—Chance said "Here, here, put something behind him and struck me on the thigh with a 4 lb. brass weight—he said that Saville had bought the can of him for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and Saville said that he had—the policemen took them in custody—I had not seen Chance between the time he took the can, and his going to Saville's house, but I knew him well, and knew his parents.</p>

On 13th December, about 9 o'clock at night, I was on duty in Oakley-street near Saville's shop—I went there with Hall, and found Chance standing just inside the shop door—Saville was just between the parlour and the shop—there is a door between the two—Hall pointed to Chance and said, "That is the boy that stole the copper"—that was in Saville's hearing. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear him say anything as I remained in the shop—I took this weight out of Chance's hand—the sergeant searched the shop; that was after he had mentioned the copper can in Saville's hearing—I weighed it; it weighed 11 lbs.</p>

He said, "5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." Saville said "5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," and then Chance said, Yes, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."</p>

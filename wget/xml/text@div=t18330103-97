               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You called his attention to their being forged - he said they were genuine, and you might use them with confidence? A. He did; I asked where he got his stamps from, not these particular ones - I should not think he had any stamps but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030066"></xptr>what he produced; he might have said he bought of Letts and other stationers, very likely he did.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL. Q. Repeat the conversation between you and him on the 24th of December, after he gave you the stamps? A. I said, "Shall I be safe in drawing bills on these stamps, for there are so many forgeries about;" he said, "You may depend on it they are all perfectly good" - I then asked if he got his stamps from the head office, Somerset-house; he said he did, and said, "You may rely on it they are genuine;" I never had possession of the stamps which he produced - the officer has them - I believe he kept them separate.</p>

            . I am secretary to the Board of Stamps. About the beginning of November I went to the prisoner's house, in consequence of information received at Mr. Mann's shop, who is a stationer in Cornhill; I did not see the prisoner then - I intimated a desire that he should call at the Stamp-office; he came on the following day, and I told him a forged stamp had come into my possession, which had been purchased from him - (that was a stamp brought to the office by a Mr. Burridge for allowance); I observed to the prisoner, that the stamp was a forgery, and asked him where he got his stamps - he told me from various stationers; he first named Mr. Deacon, of George-yard, Lombard-street - I asked him if any discount was allowed him on the purchase of stamps from Mr. Deacon; he said no discount on bill-stamps - I asked from what other stationers; he said he had purchased some stamps of Mr. Letts, Royal Exchange, who also allowed him no discount, and from Mr. Summers, who had allowed him a discount of 5 per cent. - I observed that there was no doubt the stamps so procured from Mr. Summers were the forged ones, in consequence of the discount- he remarked that he purchased receipts as well as billstamps from Mr. Summers, and therefore 5 per cent. was not an inordinate discount on bills and receipts - I do not exactly recollect his expression; he said "9 per cent. being allowed on receipt-stamps;" I asked what proportion the bills bore to the receipts that he bought of Summers - he said very small; I then told him I had no doubt in my mind it was from that quarter the forged stamps had come into his possession, and that it behoved him immediately to send his stamps to the Stamp-office, in order that the genuine stamps might be pointed out from the forged ones; and I observed to him, that if hereafter he sold a forged stamp, he might be placed in a very unpleasant situation - I pressed on him the necessity of sending them to be examined, and he said he would; nothing further passed that I remember - 30s. per cent. is the discount on bill-stamps if 30l. worth are purchased at one time, and 7 1/2 per cent. on receipts; he mentioned 7 1/2 per cent - it was my mistake when I said 9 per cent.; these is no discount under 30l.: Mr. Sawtell and Twyford were appointed to inspect stamps which might be brought in by different stationers - I saw the prisoner again at the Stamp-office (after the appointment of the inspectors), some time in the middle of November; no conversation then passed between him and me on this subject - he applied to be allowed a spoiled stamp, and was refused; he did not say any thing about having sent his stamps to the office to have them inspected, nor I to him; Mr. Halfhide is the person employed by the Commissioners to engrave the dies - I have the minutes of the Board of the 27th of October, 1830, in which it is recorded, that the engraver delivered to me certain dies, among others is the 3s. 6d. die - I know that they were delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You had a conversation with him on the 6th of November? A. Yes; I then only had one stamp in my possession which had been bought of him: it was a 1s. 6d. one - I then cantioned him that he would be in danger if others were sold; when I saw him again I am sure he did not tell me he had sent his stamps to the office, and they had refused to receive them, because they were too late - I do not know whether he had sent them; I have heard from stationers that they buy more stamps than they want, in order to get the discount: if they want the money to use of course they must sell them to somebody - I cannot say whether they allow a greater discount than the office; that is a mere question of trade - money is never returned for spoiled stamps, but a stamp of the same amount; but deed-stamps of a large amount may be divided into different amounts: if 30l. is laid out in different stamps, a proportionate discount is allowed - the amount of forged stamps found at the prisoner's is under 3l.; he told me had been nine months in business.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the 18d. stamp produced at your conversation? A. Yes, he saw it; I desired him to bring to the office all the stamps he had: I told him the stamps he had sold to Mr. Mann were forgeries (he made no answer), and that Burridge had bought this 1s. 6d. stamp at Mann's.</p>

            . I live with Mr Mann, my uncle, who is a stationer, in Cornhill, and assist in his business. I bought for him some bill-stamps of the prisoner; I did not buy them myself - I sent a lad for them; I saw the prisoner the day after, respecting them - Mr Pressly called on me; it was the beginning of November - this was the first time I saw him after I knew about the stamps; I told him the secretary had been down concerning a stamp bought at our shop, and which we had of him, and I had referred the secretary to him - the stamp had been sold to Mr. Burridge; Mr. Pressly looked out some stamps at our shop - I do not recollect the number; I sent for Mr. Laird, and showed them to him - I had a list of them, and told him Mr. Pressly had been from the Stamp-office, and said the stamps were forged, that he could not expect us to lose them - he gave me the money for them, and took them away with him - I think they amounted to about 1l. 14s.; I think there were about twenty stamps, or not so many - most of them were 18d. stamps; they were bill-stamps.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The transaction between you and him was open, public, and fair? A. Yes - when our boy brought the stamps, I looked at them to see if they were right; they appeared to me to be genuine - the prisoner called on me the day after I had seen the secretary; he was not taken into custody for some time after, and had abundant opportunity to destroy the stamps.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He said he believed the office worked off two for one, and it would be found that was the only fraud? A. They wanted to trace that, not that they were forged, but that they were double impressions, from the same die - he did not tell me he had sent all his stamps to be inspected, and they were returned without being looked at - I was not employed by the Stamp-office.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. When you bought the first stamp, you took it to the office to be allowed for? A. Yes, and that is how they detected me with it, and I wanted to clear it up.</p>

I hold a situation as inspector of stamps, at the Stamp-office - I was appointed with Twyford, to inspect stamps produced by stationers on the 6th of November; I inspected some with him, and others alone - I never refused to inspect any stamps brought for that purpose - the office has been open every day since, from ten till four, for that purpose: I do not know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you have not a perfect recollection of every person who appeared before you? A. No - my first question to them is, from whom they come.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR-GENERAL. Q. Can you say whether any person mentioned the name of Laird? A. I immediately put down in a book the names given to me; I have a copy of that book taken by myself a few days ago - but, independent of that, I can distinctly recollect that name was not mentioned - there were eleven persons in all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you find many forged stamps among those people? A. A considerable number; there have been a great many brought, down to the 2nd of Janu<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030068"></xptr>ary; I was appointed on the 6th of November; nobody applied till the 16th, and from that time to the 2nd of January, I found stationers with forged stamps - I do not think there were above 2l. or 3l. worth brought by those persons - I should say no one person brought stamps exceeding 5l.; I found one person in possession of 2l. or 3l. worth - that person was not taken up.</p>

            . I am a marshal's-man. I attended at the apprehension of the prisoner - his house was searched, and stamps found, which I have; they were taken while the prisoner was there; he produced two books from the counter with the first, then produced a drawer, labelled, "Sealing-wax," with one in it: and some more he took out of a desk and brought to me - I found none, which he did not produce - Forrester brought some out of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not take Forrester himself to the back place? A. Yes - he said he bought stamps of Mr. Letts and other stationers; and I think he named a Mr. Richardson - I did not search for the stamps; he produced them on being asked for them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you search any place yourself? A. No; the gentlemen of the Stamp-office were satisfied, and it was not required.</p>

            . I went with Leadbetter. The prisoner was asked if he had any more stamps - he took some keys out of his pocket; I went into a back warehouse with him - he opened a bureau, and took out a paper with four stamps in it, which I took out of his hand.</p>

            . These are a 2s. 6d. and 3s. 6d. stamp; they are forged, I am satisfied - they very nearly resemble the die employed by the authoritity of the Commissioners, so as to impose on any ordinary person; this one bought by Burridge is a forgery - all those five produced by Wintle are forged: here are one for 1s., two for 1s. 6d., and two for 2s. 6d. - the two 1s. 6d. are from the same die as the one produced by Burridge; this one of 2s. 6d. first produced, and the two are from the same die, (looking at those produced by the officer) here are two of 1s. 6d. forged - and these two of 2s. are forged; and this 3s. 6d. one is forged - these three of 4s. 6d. are all genuine; these two of 5s. are forged - I have examined all in this book; two of 1s. 6d. are forged - two of 2s. forged; one of 3s. 6d., two of 5s., and two of 6s. are forged - three of 4s. 6d., and five of 3s. are genuine; the two 1s. 6d. ones are of the same die as the former ones, and the paper appears to be the same - the 3s. 6d. ones are of the same die; this next parcel are receipt-stamps - two of 1s. are forged; and here are ten of 9d. genuine - two of 6d. genuine; two of 1s. 6d. genuine - seven of 2s. 6d. genuine; eleven of 4s., four of 5s., two of 7s. 6d. and two of 10s. all genuine; the one stamp found in a drawer marked "sealing wax" is a forged bill-stamp for 5s.; it is the same as the other 5s. ones(looking at the four produced from the bureau) here is one 2s. bill-stamp forged, and the other three are 6s. stamps; they are all forged - we have no such die in the office, (looking at those produced from the desk in the shop) these are all receipt-stamps; and all genuine - there are twelve; we have 6s. bill stamps, but no die with the letter C on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are all the stamps so well forged as to impose on any body who did not belong to the office? A. I think they are - I should say decidedly that a tradesman who sold stamps would not discover it; I never knew any person in our office mistaken relative to stamps.</p>
               <p>CHARLES PRESSLY re-examined. The prisoner said he could not tell a genuine stamp from a forged one - I do not recollect his asking me to show him how; I cannot swear he did not - I told him to bring them to the office to be pointed out; no particular day was fixed for his coming.</p>

                  </hi> I live at No. 2, Wheat-sheaf-court, St. Pancras. Two months ago, last Friday, I met the prisoner at the corner of Penton-street—he asked me if I was going home—I said I did not know—he asked me to drink—I went into the Crown and had a glass of ale—the prisoner went home with me, and remained about two hours—he then got up to go away without giving me anything—I asked him whether he intended to leave me so, and what he was going away for; and he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his fist and knocked me down twice—I screamed, "Murder"—a lodger came down, and saw the stats I was in—I said, "For God's sake come in, the man is killing me"—he came in and said, "What are you doing to the woman?"—he said, "Get a light and see!"—he went up stairs—while he was gone, the prisoner went away, and locked the door—before the man came down, I had felt the pri<lb></lb>soner do something to my thigh—I do not know what it was—I perceived</p>

               <p>something the matter with my thigh, and said the prisoner had stabbed me—while the man was gone up stairs, the prisoner took me up, threw me on the bed, took up the contents of the slops, and threw it in my face and eyes—he went away, and locked the door—I fell off the bed, and laid there till the next morning when the person came in—I examined myself—I found a great wound on the left side, on the thick part of my thigh—I bathed it with warm water, but did not go to a surgeon for about a week afterwards—it is dreadfully bad now—I saw the prisoner about a month afterwards, on Wed<lb></lb>nesday night, when I was in the Crown, drinking some ale with a gentleman—he came in with two females—I said, "That is the man that has got the key of my room-door"—he laughed at me, and said, "Yes, I have got it, and I mean to <hi rend="italic">stick to it</hi>"—I said, "That is the man that stabbed me on the thigh"—he said nothing to that—I looked for a policeman to give him in charge.</p>

Turner came to the door—at that time the prisoner had stabbed me—Turner had a light in his hand at that time—he just opened the door, in his shirt, and walked away—I said, "Come in, he is murdering me," and then Turner went up stairs to put on his things—I do not know whether that was because he would not shock me—he knew me pretty well, by living in the house—I do not know whether he came down again—he did not come into my room then; when he came down with the light he did, and said, "What have you been doing to her?"—the prisoner did not tell him he had not been doing anything; if he did, I did not hear him—he told him he had better get a light and see—after the prisoner was gone, and the door locked,</p>

               <p>I do not know whether the lodger came down again; I was so knocked about I cannot tell—I believe he did call out to me, and say, "Can I do anything for you?"—I answered, "Never mind, I will lie where I am"—I did not say to the surgeon, or to anybody, after this, that I was afraid there was some glass in the wound—the lodger shouted out to me to know what I was making that noise about, before he came down—I did not hear him say, "Bl----t her, she is a regular nuisance in the neighbourhood," or anything like it; or say, "It is not only to-night, but every night"—I am certain he did not say it—I had not been making a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> the night before—his woman and I had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> once before—that is the only <hi rend="italic">row</hi> I have had.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon. The prosecutrix came to my surgery about the 14th of Aug.—I found she had received a wound—it was a circular cavity—the circumference was about three-quarters of an inch, and about half an inch deep—it appeared to have been inflicted some time—it was an old wound—it was granulating—I have not treated it since—she came but once—I should suppose it was inflicted with a blunt instrument—it might have been occasioned if she had fallen on a hard substance with a point to it—it would have required considerable violence to have inflicted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> She was a woman of drunken habits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and of course, the wound would not easily heal—it would probably look worse who I saw it then when it was inflicted—if she had tumbled down on the point of a broken jug the wound might have had the same appearance, if it were round.</p>

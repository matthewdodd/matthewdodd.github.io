                  </hi>. I am a carrier from London to Woodford, and live at Woodford. On the 8th of Aug. I saw the prisoner at the back of the Castle there—I had no conversation with him then, but the next evening, the 9th, he brought the horse and chaise up to my place, to put the horse up for a few days, as he said he was going to stop in the country—the chaise was put into the cart-shed—on Saturday, the 10th, he came again, and had the mare and the chaise out—on the 11th he had them out again, with the harness—on the 12th be came in the morning, and told me he was short of cash, and was going to take the harness to pledge—he went to Stratford in my cart, returned in the evening, and told me he had pledged the harness for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—next day he took the chaise out with a different horse, stating he was going to Epping, to see the cricket-match—he returned in the evening with the horse without the chaise, and a harness which he had hired—he told me he had sold the chaise for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; to a Mr. Smith, of Chingford—I said I thought that was a very low price—he said he only gave 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and if I thought proper to buy the horse, I could have it for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I thought it very low, and I dispatched a man to find Mr. Davis, to see if he could ascertain whether it was right—the man returned in the even<lb></lb>ing with Mr. Davis—I did not buy the horse.</p>

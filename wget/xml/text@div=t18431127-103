                  </hi>. I live with Thomas Ager, shoemaker, Crawford-street. Between two and three o'clock in the afternoon of the 31st of Oct., Smith and Brunt came to the shop—Brunt asked to look at a pair of boots—she tried a pair on, and said they were too large—she then said she would not have boots, she would have pattens—Smith had a pair of boots in her apron, and asked if I had any like them at the price—I said we had not—Brunt tried on the pattens, which came to 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the offered me 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—between seven and</p>

               <p>eight in the evening I saw Brunt and Smith again, and Maile was with them—Brunt and Smith asked for a pair of boots that Brunt had tried on before that day—I got them out of the window, and then Maile and Smith had each a pair of shoes in their hand—they saw me, and put them back—I showed the boots I was asked for—Brunt looked at them, and gave them to me back again—I put them down, and turned round again—she asked me to get an<lb></lb>other pair, and when I went to get them, Maile had a pair of shoes in his hand again—a boy came in, and directly Maile saw him he put them down—he appeared to be tipsy—Maile said they should not have them that night, they would next day—Smith told me to tell him we should not open next day, and then he would have them that night—Maile went out first, and the others followed close together—there were some boots just inside the door—I did not see them take any—the boots produced are my master's, and were hang<lb></lb>ing inside the shop, about a yard from the door.</p>

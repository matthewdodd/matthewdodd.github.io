                  </hi>. I am a fringe manufacturer, and live at 191, Holborn—a little before 5 o'clock, on 16th May, I was in Brook Street—I had my great coat on my arm, and some silks—a man laid hold of the top part of the coat; I turned round and struck at him with my umbrella—I was immediately seized, struck on the back of the head, and run along six or seven yards down a gateway—there I was thrown down—I lost my over-coat, handkerchief, parcel of silks, gloves, spectacles, and a knife—there were four men, and the prisoners are two of them—I had an opportunity of seeing their faces—my coat was afterwards given to me by a man named Howard—between 8 and 9 o'clock, the same evening, I was sent for to the station, and there I saw Hurley—he was with five or six others, and I went straight up to him—on the following Saturday I again went to the statice, and immediately picked out Maloney from several others.</p>

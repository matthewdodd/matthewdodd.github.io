                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live in Camden-street, Newington.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a coal-porter. The prisoner used to work as a coal-heaver—on Thursday, the 18th of July, I was with him at the Waterman's Arms, Belvidere-road—my brother was there, but he is now gone into the country—I was with the prisoner there from one o'clock till nearly four—I and he were working that day for Messrs. Cole and Child—I know what day it was, because it was the first day I had worked for them for these two years—I know I was with him till four o'clock, because I had then to go to work—there was a clock in the yard—I cannot tell how far that is from Silver-street, Clerkenwell—I should think it is a mile and a half or two miles—I did not leave the prisoner at the public-house—he went away, and told me he was going home—I am certain I was with him from one o'clock till four.</p>

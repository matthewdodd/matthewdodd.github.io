                  </hi>.I live at the Derby Arms, East Sheen, Mortlake—on 17th May the prisoner came into our bar with a woman—they asked for a glass of beer—I saw two half-crowns in the woman's hands—the prisoner asked' her if she had any money—she said "No, have you?"—he said "No"—she drank off the beer in the glass and went out of doors—I looked at the prisoner and the glass—he said "All right, she will be back directly"—she came back—she gave me a half-crown—I looked at it—I said "It is a bad one"—she said "No"—I passed it to some of my customers, and they said it was a rank bad one—that was all in the prisoner's presence—she asked for it back—I said "No"—I put it on the shelf—I went out and called my son—I said to him in the prisoner's presence "They gave me a bad half-crown; where is the man?"—he went out of doors to look for him—he and a constable afterwards came out of the tap-room with the prisoner—I recognised the prisoner as the man who had been drinking with the woman in the front bar—the constable took them into custody—I gave the half-crown to my son—the next morning, the 18th, I found this half crown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)in a broken spittoon near the fireplace, where the prisoner had sat—I gave it to my son.</p>

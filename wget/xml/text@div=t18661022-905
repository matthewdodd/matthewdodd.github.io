                  </hi>. I assist my father in his business as a printer, and live with him at Beach Street, Barbican, in the parish of Cripplegate Without—on the 23rd September, about ten o'clock, I went into the cellar with a candle to get some beer—I saw two men crouching down behind a brick pillar—the cellar is about eighteen feet long and twelve feet wide—the prisoner is one of them—I could not see his face in the cellar, but I called to my father, and went upstairs—I slipped on the stairs and the candle went out—the men followed close behind me—I endeavoured to shut them in with the door, and the prisoner struck me on the forehead—I was not able to shut the door, and they ran to the private outer door, but could not open it—I kept calling out—my father came down and opened the door, and my sisters called "Police!" from the window—the prisoner looked up the stairs to see how many came down—I saw the glare of the gas on his face, and am certain he is one of the men—they pushed through and got away—the other has not been caught—the prisoner was brought back at about a quarter to three, and I recognised him at once—I examined the cellar, and found the lead wrenched out of the sink and out of the wetting trough, and the water pipe was pulled from the wall, but not cut—the men had entered by wrenching out a grating which leads to the court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the father of the last witness—I heard my daughters shout, went downstairs, and saw the prisoner and another man—we always fasten the door when we go up to supper, and I was obliged to open it to call for assistance—I saw the prisoner by the gas-light as dis<lb></lb>tinctly as I see him now—the lead was laid ready to be taken away.</p>

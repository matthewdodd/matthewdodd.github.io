                  </hi>. I reside at Beresford-street, Woolwich—previous to January I carried on business as an antimony refiner at Commercial-wharf, Kingsland—about October, 1863, Hodson was in my service—I engaged him as the superintendent of my place at 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—that was a verbal agreement, and it was to last for six or seven weeks—that was determined by this written agreement—I told him I should give him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, but it was not to be understood that there was to be any partnership at all—he said, "No, I do not want a partnership"—I said, "If you continue I shall give you an increased salary, or a share in the business—he was not to draw all his salary every week, but 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as he wanted it—that continued for not quite three weeks, and about the middle of the third week I told him that I was not satisfied with the business; it was costing more to manufacture than what he told me—he said, "If you are not satisfied with it, and will allow me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week salary, I will manufacture 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton—I said "I have bought nearly 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, what shall I do with them, if I make the agreement now?"—he said, "I will buy them of you and you can stop so much a week till it is paid, but I shall draw my salary every week"—on 6th December, we came to this agreement in writing—he received 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as his salary, and there was 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. owing to me, which I have here a book to show, which was made up to him every week under the old agreement—I had a settlement with him, and he received the 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in satisfaction of his past services—(<hi rend="italic">The Agreement, dated</hi> 6th <hi rend="italic">December,</hi> 1863, <hi rend="italic">was here read</hi>)—<hi rend="italic">the</hi> agreement was determined on 27th January without notice—I made up the accounts, which Mr. Hudson signed—he accounted for 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and received 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in lieu of notice—I got the bills from his acceptances—up to 27th January I had a sign over the gateway, "A. Gibson and Co. antimony refiners"—it was a pretty large board; it covered the width of the gateway, so that carts could go in—there was no person in the firm besides me, but I intended to have taken in my son—Mr. Pratt succeeded me, and I left next day—I did not go to the works after that—the acceptance, Gibson and Co to this bill is not my writing—I first saw it, I think, on the Friday, and Ross and Wittkower were taken on Wednesday or Thursday—from the time I transferred the business to Mr. Pratt—I had seen nothing of Hodson—I had never given him any authority to sign my name to bills of Exchange—this acceptance is his writing; the acceptance only, I think—(<hi rend="italic">Read; "January 26th,</hi> 1863, <hi rend="italic">four months after date, pay to my order</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l. accepted payable at the London and</hi>

               <p>we went through the same form again; I should not have paid him without—I do not know whether Mr. Warr is here—on this cheque of Bachelor's here is "Hodson and Gibson, or order;" that is very like my writing, and this "A Gibson" underneath is written by me—I wrote that to send to my account kept in the name of Gibson, because I had no other account—the first transaction I had with Mr. Bachelor the invoice was "A. Gibson"—I paid him that by cheque—the next time I had goods from him to the amount of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; Hodson's name was on that invoice, and I scratched it out—I told Hodson that Bachelor had sent an invoice with his name upon it—he said, "He has no right to do so"—I said, "You write to him about it"—I wrote to Bachelor and told him—I have not got Mr. Bachelor's letter with the invoice; all his invoices are different—here is one, "Gibson and Co."—I saw him afterwards and told him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is another cheque of Bachelor's; this is "Gibson and Hodson," but I do not know anything of it—there is no writing of mine on it; I never saw it before to my knowledge—it was not paid to the firm for any goods: he did not owe me any money when that cheque was drawn—this is Hodson's writing, I believe, on the back of it—I never represented Hodson to anybody as a partner, and I told Bachelor personally that he was not a partner—I know Messrs. Jewin, of Miles-lane, City, and I do not know a person named Jacqueray, in their employ; nor did Hodson introduce me as his partner to any person in their employ, nor did we after that all three go across to a public-house together; nor did I say that I had joined Hodson, and I hoped the gentleman with us would do all he could for me—I bought plumbago from Jewin and Son, not from the party you are speaking of; he is only a porter—I do know him, I know the person I have seen here—I do not recollect going with any person in the employ of Jewin and Son, but will not swear I did not—no deposit was paid for the plumbago; what I bought I paid for in full—I do not remember anything being written on the paper when I bought the plumbago—I do not know a person named Brown, in the employ of the metal or metre manufacturers, in Kingsland-road, neither father nor son—I never dealt with the company—I have never said to Mr. Worsam, my land<lb></lb>lord, that the prisoner was my partner—here is the receipt for my rent, made out to me simply—I dealt with Jewin and Co.—I have not told their foreman that Hodson was my partner—their bills were made out to Mr. Gibson—I only had one transaction with them—I have seen Mr. Evans, who keeps the Cheshire Arms; I have not told him that the prisoner was my partner—I know Mr. Mitlett, who applied to me for the situation of agent; the prisoner was present—I did not propose that he should act as traveller for myself and Hodson, but for me only—I have not the prisoner's book previous to 12th December; he had memorandums previous to that, and he complained that he sometimes lost them, so I gave him a book—I have none of the memorandums; he took them.</p>

a month's imprisonment for beating a game-keeper, nor was I charged with it, nor for killing a dog—I left Staffordshire through my sister coming up here—I buried two children, and my wife was ill, and I wanted to get her into a London hospital.</p>

I am a metal-refiner, and have had several dealings with Gibson and Hodson—Mr. Gibson has said that they were jointly together doing business transactions—I have called there, and he has said, "Mr. Hodson, my partner, is not within, and I cannot tell you the price of the metal you want to know"—on another occasion I called with a gentle<lb></lb>man, and Mr. Hodson was not within, but Gibson said, "I am Mr. Hodson's partner"—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my writing; it is not the only one; I have given twenty or thirty—this (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>) was given on 18th December—it was not ready money, it would be some time before, I should imagine—it was for antimony supplied to Gibson and Hodson, or Hodson and Gibson.</p>

LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did Mr. Gibson speak about his partner Hodson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two months before Christmas; somewhere about November when I called—it was when they were just commencing work—I do not know when they commenced, but it was about three months before Christmas—this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine—I saw Hodson on 7th October, and he told me to make it out to Mr. A. Gibson only, as they had not yet commenced partnership—I sent in this invoice to Gibson and Hod<lb></lb>son on 23d October—Mr. Gibson did not tell me to scratch out the word" Hodson, "or write to me to that effect"—the cheques that I was paid went through my bankers—I have no doubt this cheque signed "A. Gibson" is one I received, but it does not bear my endorsement; it does not require endorsing—I paid it through my bankers; it is for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and bears the</p>

               <p>same date as the invoice—here is a cheque for 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 18th December—I cannot say to what amount I was indebted on that day to Messrs. Gibson and Co.—I think this is the balance of what I owed; I should not draw the cheque for more than I owed for—I dealt with the firm only—if I went to deal with Mr. Gibson, and he could not give me the price of the goods, it was necessary to see Mr. Hodson—I have not lately bought iron of Gibson which had no reference to the business with Hodson—I know Mininett; I always understood his name to be—that is him—I have not told him that I knew Hodson was not a partner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Daniel Jutsum and Sons, of Dye Mills, Bermondsey—the firm have done business with Gibson and Co., of Commercial-wharf—when Mr. Gibson came to me he introduced a card to me with "A. Gibson and Co." on it, and said, "We have just commenced business, and shall very likely want a large quantity of your goods; here is the card—I filed it—I have sent a dozen bills to him in the name of "<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Gibson and Co."—I have <hi rend="italic">my</hi> books here to prove it—I never saw Gibson but once; that was the first time he came—I have told you all that took place—I concluded he was a partner.</p>

I am a machinery-broker and metal dealer—I know Mr. Bachelor—I went with him in my cart the round over London—we put in for shelter, and Mr. Bachelor said, "Let us go and see Hodson and his partner"—we saw a gentleman there who was represented as Mr. Gib<lb></lb>son—I believe that is the gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Gibson</hi>)—I dried myself in front of the fire, and Mr. Bachelor said, "Mr. Gibson, Mr. Hodson's partner," and then we all had some conversation about some railway shares—I do not think Gibson made any remark when Bachelor introduced him as Hodson's partner.</p>

I am an iron-merchant, of Bethnal-green—I supplied Commercial-wharf and delivered forty or fifty parcels of goods there, and little papers with each, in the name of Gibson and Hodson; but the "Hod<lb></lb>son" was scratched out; Gibson scratched it out before my face, or I might have scratched it out—he said that it was "Gibson"—these are dated the 26th and 28th, but it does not say of what—these others are October 19th, 23d and 24th—after five or Six weeks the name of Hodson was put on the others; that was while Mr. Gibson was there—I never saw Mr. Gibson, except on Saturdays, when I went for the money, and he sat there and paid it, both before the alteration of the name and afterwards.</p>

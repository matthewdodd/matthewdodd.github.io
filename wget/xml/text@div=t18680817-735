                  </hi>. I live at 31, Carnaby Street, and am a tailor—on Saturday night, 8th August, I was in Carlisle Street, Dean Street—a crowd came up, and began fighting at the corner, then came across the road to where I was standing, and knocked me down—the prisoner caught me in front, and took my chain and run away—I called "Stop thief"—he run round Carlisle Street, into Surrey Square—I ran after him, caught him, and gave him into custody.</p>

Q.</hi> Were you returning from work? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I was leaving a public-house in Queen Street—I had been out a couple of hours, and during that time I had been at the Carlisle Arms, in Queen Street—when my chain was taken the crowd ran across the street—I never saw the prisoner before to my knowledge—I never lost sight of him—I did not see him throw the chain away—the persons all began to run when I called "Stop thief"—the prisoner ran into the arms of a policeman—I then caught hold of him, and he said he would give himself in charge—I asked him for my chain, and he said he had got it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 54, Wardour Street—I was with Harris, in con<lb></lb>versation at the corner of Carlisle Street, when a crowd came round—there were about ten—they were sparring and swearing, but did not strike one another—I heard Harris call out "I have lost my chain"—I saw a man catch something that glittered—I ran after him, but lost sight of him—I saw the prisoner amongst the crowd.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had you been with Harris? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From about 10.45—this was about 12.30 or 1 o'clock—we had been having a drop of beer—I suppose I had a pint and a half—we both noticed the crowd, and I think I said, "This is a get up"—we were about bidding one another good night—we all parted, and I got three or four yards from Harris—I did not see him knocked down—I did not see him after, nor did I see the prisoner taken into custody—I went after another man, and when I came back I found Harris was gone, and I went home.</p>

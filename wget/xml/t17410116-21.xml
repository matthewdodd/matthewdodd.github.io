             , and the two Prisoners, Dennison and Stacey ; they pulled me down on my Back, and the Woman that was executed, by the Assistance of Stacey and another, tore open my Breeches Pocket, and took out my Gold, to the Value of 23 Guineas, in Guineas and Portugal Pieces, and likewise my Watch. After this they brought in Cherry-Brandy in Pint Mugs, and swore if I did not drink, they would stab me or cut my Throat. I was forced to drink till they thought I had lost my Senses, and then they carried me out of that Room into another, and laid me on a Bed. When they found I began to slumber, they jostled me, and made me drink again. I had a Pair of Spurs which appeared like Silver, and Stacey took one of them off, but put it on again. I made a great Noise for my Money and my Watch; upon which Stacey, some how or other, slipped my Watch into my Great Coat Pocket, and bid me search myself, for I had lost nothing; accordingly I put my Hand in my Pocket, and felt some Money, which I hop'd was my Gold, but I dar'd not pull it out, for fear they should get that from me.</p>
               <p>* See Sessions-Book, 1740, No. 8. p. 271.</p>
               <p>Councel. In what Pocket was your Watch, when you went into the House?</p>
               <p>Parish . I am positive it was in my Fob, and he put it into my great Coat Pocket. - There were a great many People in the House, that did not come into the Room where I was.</p>
               <p>Councel. What did they do to you after this?</p>
               <p>Parish . They forced me out of Doors, pretending to carry me to my Inn, and led me into Long-Acre , where Stacey kick'd up my Heels, and Dennison held me, while he rifled me; I could see several People by me at the same Time. He took a pair of Breeches, and a pair of silver Knee-buckles, which were ty'd up in a Bundle, a Holland Shirt, my Watch , with the rest of my Money, and my Hat; I lost my Wig, but I can't charge them with that. After this they left me, and I roll'd into Drury-Lane, where I fell asleep. I am positive the Prisoners are the Men, for I saw them very plain when they forced me out of Doors, and they led me into the Street, one on one Side, the other on the other, and never quitted me till they had robb'd me.</p>
               <p>Dennison . Did you see me in the House before you had drank the Brandy?</p>
               <p>Parish . Yes, he sat facing the Door when I came in, and I saw him afterwards, for the Watch convey'd me to the Cart and Horse in Broad St. Giles's, and he and Stacey came to me there. Dennison talked Irish with the Landlord, and told me, it I sat there a Fortnight it should cost me nothing.</p>
               <p>Councel . How long did you stay there?</p>
               <p>Parish . I staid till Day-light, and the Ostler of my Inn came and took me away. The Prisoners brought a Violin, and we were very merry, for I was in Liquor, and had no Thoughts of my Misfortune. Sometime afterwards, I not knowing how to proceed, a Fellow, one Baker, offer'd me his Assistance as an Attorney, and got a Bill of Indictment drawn according to his own Way of Thinking; I paid him 2 s. for it, and he has dropp'd me, and keeps the Indictment. If I was to see him here I should know him. I have met with just such another Affair, one Lloyd offer'd himself as an Attorney, he would have made Dennison an Evidence, and would not let me see the Justice upon any Account .</p>
               <p>Councel. When had you the first Information of the Parties concern'd in this Street Robbery?</p>
               <p>Parish . I had an Information from the Justice, that one of them had made himself an Evidence; I was in the Country, and was very sorry when I received the Letter, to be taken from my Business.</p>

               <p>Lineham . How often did I come to him?</p>
               <p>Macdonnel. She came to me twice a Day, till she was taken up for another Robbery, and put into Bridewell.</p>

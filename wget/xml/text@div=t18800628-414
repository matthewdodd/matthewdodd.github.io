                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife—I live at 16, Thames Street, Commercial Road—I have not lived with the prisoner for six months previous to the 11th May—on that evening I was coming out of 16, Thames Street—I saw the prisoner knocking at the door three doors off—he came to me and offered his hand—he said "Do you intend to live with me again?"—I said "No"—he said "I will follow you"—I said "If you follow me, I will give you in charge"—he said "You cannot give me in charge, you have nothing to give me charge for"—I said "I can give you in charge if it is only for threatening my life with a knife"—he said "I did not"—I said "You did"—I went on up the street—he said "I will go wherever you go"—I said "When I get to the top of the street I shall see a policeman and will give you in charge"—he said "I will follow you and I will do for you"—on the previous Sunday he had come to me and asked me for a bonnet and shawl, and I gave them to him—he also asked me for two rings and the earrings I am wearing now—I said I would not give them to him—he went away when I ordered him out of the room—I said "You have got all you want, leave the room"—when we got to the top of Thames Street, at the corner of Commercial Road, he caught hold of the back of my hair—he had taken a knife from his breast pocket—I said "Spare my life, do not do that whatever you do"—he ran the knife into my left breast, saying "Die, you"—I fell with the knife in me—I remember its being taken out—I fell with my face on the ground—I was taken to Dr. Cave's, and from there I was removed to the London Hospital, where I remained till the 27th of May.</p>

I am a labourer of 9, Thames Street, Commercial Road—on the 11th of May, about 6.30, I saw the prosecutrix and the prisoner quarrelling—the prosecutrix said "I gave you on Sunday all you wanted, and cannot give you any more"—the prisoner said "Well, I'll follow you about till I do for you"—when they got to the arch in Thames Street the prisoner caught hold of the prosecutrix by the back of her nock and stabbed her in the breast with a knife—I was behind—I saw the knife flash in the air as it was held up in his right hand—I rushed to the woman—I saw the prisoner lying on his wife's chest on the ground—she got up and ran into a butcher's shop—I assisted in taking the woman to a doctor.</p>

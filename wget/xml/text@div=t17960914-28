               <p>I went, in company with Jefferd, in pursuit of two men; we went about 100 yards up the lane before we saw the men, we got sight of them; they were walking then; as soon as they saw us, one said, they are coming, and the soldier, who was dressed in a sailor's jacket, took out three pair of stockings, and threw them down, one took to Withers's, the other down the lane; I pursued him down the lane, just as he came to the gap of the hedge, and he threw the linen down; I never lost sight of him, and two farmers pursued him over the field; I picked up the things, and told the girl to pick up the stockings, they were secured and brought back, (The linen was produced and deposed to); there is no particular mark on them, but on the child's pin-cloth there is marked M J. (they were deposed to by the servant also.)</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. I was in the country to get a little hay-making, we passed the prosecutor's house, and when we had got a little way past, these men pursued us, and said, we had got some property; I said, we had none; they took us back and brought this property out of the house, and said, we had robbed them of it.</p>
               <p>Bowers's defence. We were going by the house to get some hay making, they came after us, and took us, and said, we had some property; they brought us back to the house, and brought the property out of the parlour, and said we stole it; I never saw it till they brought it out of the parlour.</p>

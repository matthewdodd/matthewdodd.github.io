               <p>Q. Is the wash-house inside the house? - A. It is a lean-to, the kitchen door opens into it; my wife was alarmed and waked; with that she called my servant, who sleeps in the next room, desiring her to strike a light, for she was sure there was something the matter in the kitchen among the ducks, by hearing a noise of the ducks; there were milking pails and tin pails, which caused a great<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179611300044"></xptr>the servant went down stairs, and opened the kitchen door; she asked the man what he wanted there -</p>
               <p>Q. You heard this? - A. Every word; she asked the man what he wanted there, or what brought him there; she slammed the door to again, and bolted it; with that she went to the street door, the watchman was coming past; she called, Pitt! Pitt! different times, there is a thief in the house; the watchman's name is Pitt; mind the gate says she; then she came to the kitchen door again, and opened it, and went into the wash-house, and opened the washhouse door, and went into the yard, and called out, he is gone, he is gone up the yard; by that time I got down stairs, the watchman came into the gate, and was standing by him in the yard; he had either got down, or thrown himself down off the house; I found the prisoner lying at the wash-house door; I laid hold of him by the arm, and dragged him into the wash-house, and out of the wash-house into the kitchen, and secured him until the next morning, to go to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your ducks? - A. In the washhouse; after I secured him, I asked the maid to go into the wash-house, and see what damage he had done.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner come in? - A. Through the roof of the house, it was pan-tiled and pointed.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no ceiling? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many tiles did he move? - A. Seven tiles, I think, off the place he stripped, and laid them on one side on the roof.</p>
               <p>Q. It is not a very high building? - A. About ten feather edge boards high in front; it is higher behind where it leans to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many feet high is it in front? - A. Something better than seven feet high; I have a milk-cart in the yard, he got the seat board and set it up an end, and with the support of that, clambered up; I will not be upon my oath, whether the man was sober, whether it was by liquor or not, that he fell from the house, I don't know, but I rather think the man was a good deal in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of him? - A. I do not know the man, he must certainly have watched about the premises, for no stranger could know where they were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. There is no door that opens out of the wash-house into the house? - A. You were not there to see; I can give a better account of it than you can, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. As you think I have asked you an impertinent question, I will not trouble you with any more.</p>
               <p>Witness. I have as much humanity for the man as you have, be who you will.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did I understand you right, that the maid opened the kitchen-door into the washhouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MARGARET BUNN sworn. - Q. Are you servant to Mr. Leslie? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This night, the 7th of November, you were disturbed, called by your mistress, lit a candle, went down into the kitchen, opened the kitchen-door, and went into the wash-house? - A. Yes; I unbolted the kitchen-door, I saw Joseph Malcolm with a duck in his left hand, a white duck.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing with it? - A. It was dead in his hand; I asked him what brought him there, or, how came he there, he made me no answer; I shut to the door, and bolted it, and run to the street door, and called the watchman, and desired him to mind the gate, there was a thief in the house; he said the gate was fast, he could not come out there; I told him to mind the yard, he was gone up there; I opened the kitchen-door, and I heard the prisoner fall; I saw the prisoner lying on the ground by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. He was secured? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go into the wash-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he done there? - A. Killed nine ducks out of ten; he threw four or five out of the wash-house into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all alive the over night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. When you went in, it was light enough to see the colour of the duck, if you had not had a candle? - A. What! at one o'clock in the morning! - the watchman was crying the hour.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PITT sworn. - When the servant of the house called to me, to run to the gate, I went to the gate, and said, nobody is here; she said, he has run up the yard, she held the candle out, I saw the man on the roof; I put the pistol through the gate, and threatened to shoot him, and he dropped down like a stone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he drop from? - A. Off the roof; I opened the gate, and said, here he is; and he came, and we secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. He surrendered very quietly? - A. He never moved or spoke; I asked if any body was there but himself; he said yes, let me go and see for them; I said, no, you must stop here; he said, then, if they are gone, I am here.</p>

            . I was a prisoner for debt in the Compter: on the 27th of last February, soon after eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner sitting on a bench in the tap room; he was brought in for some quarrel in the night or something; I went up stairs, then I came down again with a Mr. Essex a brother debtor; and I saw the prisoner sitting upon the same bench; I observed one of the felons seemingly busy at his coat pocket; and I went throught the tap-room into the back kitchen; I was going to mention it as soon as I got into the kitchen, but a woman there said she thought it was a pity nobody took care of that poor man who seemed to be in liquor, for the felons were busy about his pockets; I went to him, tapped him on the shoulder and said my friend, step this way; he went with me into the kitchen; I said what have you in your coat pocket? have you lost nothing? he put in his hand, and said no; as he stood up I saw there was a piece cut out of his breeches; and his pocket was cut; I said why they have cut your breeches pocket, he looked and said, Lord bless me so they have; I asked him if he had any money; he answered no, nothing but a bit of per; several of us thought it was a shame the felons should use him so bad; so we advised him to go up and complain to Mr.

               <p>Q. What time of day was this?</p>
               <p>Morris. Between nine and ten o'clock I believe; I went up into my own room, when I came to the top of the tap room stairs into the yard; there was a fellow, that had cut the prisoner's pocket, seemed to be making a stir; he was angry that we had been to Mr. Kirby to have him locked up, and said, d - n him, he is a clipper and a coiner, and was shewing something he had; it a little surprized me to think what he had given me; I then called one Mr. Richards a watchmaker, another debtor, and took him into the coffee-room with me; then I pulled out the things the prisoner had given me, and shewed them to him; I had not seen them before; he said something which gave me suspicion; I said I would go and deliver them to Mr.

               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to that?</p>
               <p>Morris. I did not hear him say a word; one thing I have omitted; while I waited for Mr. Baron's coming in after I had found what things they were, the prisoner walked in the yard with me, and begged for God's sake that I would secret those things, and I should never want for a guinea; Mr. Essex and I were walking together; the prisoner signified he had something to say to me; Mr. Essex walked on and then the prisoner said what I have just mentioned. I made him no answer at all.</p>

               <p>Morris. I believe about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Baron before he came into the bar?</p>
               <p>Morris. No, I did not; when he spoke to me to secret these things, he said he hoped that the person that cut his pocket would not offer it for sale, for if he did he would be stopt, for they were clippings; he did not say of what, nor did I ask him; I did not say any thing to it.</p>

               <p>Morris. Yes; I did not go before my Lord till the 30th of March; then I was examined and bound over to appear here.</p>
               <p>He was asked on his cross examination; whether Essex heard the prisoner ask him to conceal the circumstance of his having given him the things; to which he answered he believed not.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Martin present when he delivered the things to you?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner about it?</p>
               <p>Baron. I am not sure whether I did or not; he was carried to the Mansion-house about two hours after on account of what he had been taken up for; I acquainted my Lord Mayor with what had passed about these things and produced them in Martin's presence; Martin saw them and said he found them in the middle of Hatton-garden; he was remanded back to prison touching this matter; my Lord Mayor sealed them up with three seals and I set the initials of my name by the side of the seals, and my Lord Mayor kept them; I received them sealed up from my Lord Mayor last Thursday, when I opened them before the Grand Jury; and I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the prisoner's lodging?</p>
               <p>Baron. Yes; he told us where his lodgings were; one was No. 1 Huggin-alley, Wood-street; I found nothing particular at that place but a piece of a flint and a pot and a piece of stick; it was something of a melting pot, a small round pot with a hand in to it, it had some kind of cement in it, and it appeared to have been on the fire; and a piece of thin stick was in the pot; he had another place at St. Giles's which he gave the key of, in Nottingham-court, at the Red-Lion; I found there small hammer, a piece of file, a piece of box wood the same sort as that exactly, only it appeared to be a little more used in the same way as that is; I delivered these things to

               <p>Baron. Yes; a man who has since turned out to be one Draper; that was a fortnight after the first examination; he said on his first examination, he could produce a person to prove it; it was on the 13th of March; Draper came there and said he saw him pick them up; they disagreed in their accounts of the place, and my Lord Mayor would not let him be sworn.</p>

I know of none but edging of money; this file appears to have been used in filing of gold; this piece of box is what the coin has been run upon for the purpose of edging the money; it is put in this grove, and the box is run over it, which makes the impression upon the edges.

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Brewer's-lane, Hamp<lb></lb>stead. The prisoner is my late husband's own brother—there is a shed adjoining my house, and he frequently slept in that shed—there is a door between the shed and my house, which my husband had nailed up securely. On the 13th of November, I went out between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning—I left nobody at home—I fastened my doors and windows se<lb></lb>curely—I saw the prisoner at the shed door when I went out—he has slept there, but had been away for about three weeks previous to the 13th—he saw me go out—I did not speak to him—I returned at nine o'clock in the evening, and found my door as I had left it, but the inner-door, be<lb></lb>tween my house and the shed, was broken open—the bottom pannel of the door was broken in, large enough for a man to creep through—I went up stairs, and found the lock wrenched off my box—I had left it locked, and left in it a gown, a cape, a shirt, a pair of shoes, a penknife, and a silk handkerchief—I had put them in myself, and locked the box that day—I had not been out for five weeks before—a small frock was taken from under the bed—all these articles were gone, an the bed was turned <hi rend="italic">topsy-turvy</hi>—the prisoner was frequently in the habit of coming into my house, and coming up stairs—the box was kept behind the door.</p>

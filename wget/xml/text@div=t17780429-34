On Sunday the 26th of March my wife and I went out about five o'clock: I locked up the house; we returned soon after nine: when we came near the house I saw a light up stairs; I left my wife and went and alarmed a neighbour; on my return my wife had stopped two gentlemen and told them there were thieves in the house. I desired them to help me, and then went and opened the door, and cried, holloa! who is there; then the people behind me told me the candle was put out. I then heard somebody running down stairs very fast: being afraid they might have some weapon concealed to do me a mischief, I went from the door about the length of my stick to strike at them as they came out. I struck at them, and I believe hit one; they ran off, but were pursued, and the prisoner was taken. I found the locks of my bureau broke open; there were six of my shirts packed up, but not taken away. I lost two spoons that I have never found again.</p>

               <p>I was coming a cross Windmill Hill; the prosecutor's wife stopped me, and told me there were thieves in the house: the prosecutor went and opened the door, and cried out, holloa! who is there.

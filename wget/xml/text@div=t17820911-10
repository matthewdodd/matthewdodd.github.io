               <p>The accomplice Milbourne said. That man at the bar is an innocent man; Stunnell, me and Caddie did the robbery, I had neglected that, tho' I have brought every thing to light only going over the way, this morning to have a pint of beer and a roll and butter, I made enquiry what this robbery was, and the man is innocent, I thought of every thing I could before the magistrate, but I happened to neglect this.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor Can you swear to the prisoner. - I have Sir, and do really believe he was one, there were four, this man says three, but I am sure there were four.</p>

               <p>- MERRICK sworn.</p>
               <p>Confirmed the last evidence, and said, he was positive to the prisoner being one of the men. He said he asked for his watch, but he had none, the prisoner took his pocket book and handkerchief, and shook hands with him, and was going to leave him; another man came behind him and hit him with the back of his cutlass, and said, damn your eyes where is your buckles? he said, they were in his shoes, but they were plated, Cheeke came after him and begged for his buckles.</p>
               <p>Court. You say that the prisoner was the first man that you observed come up to you? - Yes; and he quitted me very soon. I saw the prisoner with a cutlass a-cross Mr. Cheeke first.</p>
               <p>How far was you from Cheeke? - As far as to that door.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to distinguish? - It was as light in comparison as it is now, it was full moon, and we saw them a quarter of a mile off, I could distinguish him, I mentioned his having red hair, and the dress, he had a roundish hat.</p>
               <p>PRISONER.</p>
               <p>My Lord I am really innocent of what I am now standing here charged for, I have nobody but God to witness for me, I am really innocent.</p>
               <p>How came this man to be taken up? - I believe one of Mr. Wilmot's men took him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 365.) About seven o'clock, on the 19th of January, I was passing Haggerstone-lane, in the parish of Shoreditch—I was in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner and two others coming towards town—I stopped the prisoner, and asked him what he had got—(he had a bundle under his arm)—he said, "Nothing"—be made violent resistance, and I called out for assistance—one of the other men then struck me, and they both ran off—one of them had a bundle, which he dropped—a man named Harold came up—I sent him in search of the other two—I went with the prisoner to a public-house, and examined his bundle—it contained two pieces of lead, rolled up as it is now—Harrow picked up the other bundle, which also contained lead—as I was taking the prisoner to the station, I asked him where he got it—he said he met a man in Kingsland-road, who gave it him to carry—I took, the lead to some cottages in Hertford-place, Haggerstone, 200 or 300 yards from where I saw the three men—I examined the gutters of the cottages—the lead was entirely gone from one gutter—I afterwards compared the lead With the gutter—it is a very particular sort of gutter, and at the end is a mark where the lead had been battered down—it agreed in more places than one.</p>

About seven o'clock in the evening of the 5th of January I was standing at my shop—I saw a man on the opposite side of the way, between six and seven, walking backwards and forwards, as if on the watch—he, then went across the road to four empty houses adjoining mine, and gave a whistle—I afterwards saw some one else—I watched them away, and went behind No. 9, and saw the prisoner looking over the wall—he passed by me—on the following day I went on to the not of No. 12—I afterwards went on the roof on the 12th of January, and the lead was there—I went on the 20th, and it was then gone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

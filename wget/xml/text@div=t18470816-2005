                  </hi> I live at Bloomsbury. About one or two o'clock on Friday, the 6th of Aug., the prisoner came with the bag, and called for a cup of coffee—I saw him diving in the bag—he went out without drinking his coffee, which excited my suspicion—he said, "I will be here presently for the bag"—I turned it over, saw a government mark on it, and took it to the station—they told me to detain the boy when he came—he came, and I detained him—he said the soldier gave it him to mind, and he was going to take it to him.</p>

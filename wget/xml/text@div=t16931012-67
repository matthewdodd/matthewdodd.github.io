The Evidence for Their Majesties deposed, That Mr Cook being at Mrs. Merryweathers House, he was seen to melt Wax with a Candle, and to pull a Broad Seal out of his Pocket, which he said was the Lord Nottingham's, and press'd it upon the Wax; and when he had so done, he said to Mrs. Merryweather, Madam, look you, it is fairly done.

Says the Witness again, If I could make such Seals, I would do it for all the Jacobites in Town. Furthermore, the Blank in the Passport was filled up with the name of Thomas Davis. This was positively sworn, as also, that my Lord Nottingham's hand was fairly written under the Warrant. Mr. Cook said, that what he did, was out of a Principle of Conscience.

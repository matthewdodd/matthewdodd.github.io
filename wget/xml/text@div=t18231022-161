            . I knew the prisoner while he was in the service of Whibley. I saw him come out of the yard with two game fowls and a rabbit. The fowls had then gone to roost, and the rabbits were in the hutch. I spoke to him three times; I called him by a nick-name he went by. I never saw the fowls or the rabbits again.</p>

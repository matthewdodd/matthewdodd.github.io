                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I received information on the 10th of February, from Atterton's brother and another boy, who came to me—I went with them to Johnson's and asked him what he had done with the diamond which he had bought—he asked me what diamond—I said the one he bought of Atterton—he said he never bought one at all—I said there was a boy there could prove he had bought it; and the boy said, "You did buy it: you gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a pennyworth of apples for it"—I asked him where it was—he said in pledge—I asked where—he said at Mr. Chap<lb></lb>man's—I asked him where the duplicate was—he said he had given his mother the duplicate to put away with the rest—the mother went and got it—I took him into custody—Johnson said he pawned it for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

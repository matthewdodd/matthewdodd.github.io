                  </hi>. I live at No. 48, Ratcliff-highway, and am a watchmaker. On Wednesday, the 18th of October, the prisoner came to my shop, and purchased a watch, between one and two o'clock—I should say it was half-past one o'clock—he paid for it with a £10 Bank of Eng<lb></lb>land note—I observed, when he gave it to me, that he did not face me, but turned himself round, and took the note out of something—I could not see what he took it from—he took something out of his pocket, turning his back to me—he stood by the shop-door, at the light—he took something out of his pocket, and seemed to between or three minutes taking the note</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183801290014"></xptr>
               <p>from whatever he had in his hand—I did not change the note myself—I did not ask him any thing about it at the time, not till I saw him a se<lb></lb>cond time—he came to the shop twice, to have the watch regulated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you heard, before he came to have it regulated, any thing about the note being stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I had no conversation with him abort the note on those occasions.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first have any conversation with him about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a week after I heard the note had been stolen, which was about fortnight after I had taken it, I saw him on the opposite side of the way, looking at a print shop, and called him over—I sent for Mr. Potter, who had changed the note for me, and I asked the prisoner if he was not the person who had changed the note and bought the watch—he said, "Yes"—I asked where he got the note—he said he had not stolen it—I said I did not say he had, but it had been traced to me, and I wished to know where he got it—he said he changed it for a sailor, who had gone to sea I asked his name and address, and he wrote in my book, "Thomas Eaton, No. 4, Bett-street, Ratdiff-highway"—he wrote that in this book, which I have here—Bett-street is about fifty yards from my house—I di rectly went to Bett-street, to No. 4, and could not find such a persona—it was nearly dark, and I thought I would leave further inquiry till the morning—I inquired <hi rend="italic">at every house</hi> In the street to see if I could find him but nobody knew of any such man—about three weeks after I met him again in Spectacle-alley, Whitechapel, leading from Church-lane, about half a mile from Ratcliff-highway—he passed me, and I turned after him and said to him, "Did you not buy a watch at my shop?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "You gave me a £10 note?"—he said, "Yes"—I said "How was it you gave me a false address f"—he said, "I did not give you a false address, I live there"—I said, "You. do no such thiog"—he said he did live there, but directly he found himself in this hobble he went to his lodgings and told the woman if anybody inquired for him to say he did not live there—be told me he had been into the country, to Bristol, I think, and had only returned the night before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say why he went into the country? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, because he had got himself into such a hobble—I asked him what account he could give me of the note, how he got it—he said he was going down the Strand, and met a man, who said to him, "Jack, I have picked up a book with a £10 note, and if you will get it changed I will give you something for your trouble"—he did not say what the man was to give him for his trouble—he said the man was waiting conveniently by, waiting for the change, after he had bought the watch, he bought the watch for two guineas, and when he went out he gave the man the change, and the man gave him the watch for so doing—I then took him down to the station-house.</p>

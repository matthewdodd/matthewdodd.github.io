On the 13th of June I was awoke about four o'clock - I got up directly, and went down Holborn to look for my clothes, which I missed from a box on the top of a chest of drawers; the key was in the box - I had seen all this property safe in the evening; I missed it all - the prisoner had occasionally slept there; I went to bed about one o'clock - he was not there then; there is a pair of folding doors at the entrance, and at the top there is a flap - whether he got over or opened the gates I cannot tell, but the key was in the lock; I found him at a quarter before one o'clock in the day, on the other side Templebar; he said, "Halloo, Frank!" I said, "Where have you been all night?" he said, "At Covent-garden;" I asked where he was about four o'clock - he said in Covent-garden - I said, "That is wrong, you have taken my things"- he said if I would go home with him he would make it all right at his place; just then the Policeman came up, and I gave charge of him - I had seen him the night before very much intoxicated; I believe when he came to my place it was not his intention to rob me - I never gave him authority to take my things; the seal and waistcoat were found on him at the watch-house - the coat he said he had sold to a Jew; we had the Jew up, and he said he had sold them again - I permitted the prisoner to do almost as he liked at my place.</p>
               <p>EDWARD ASHFORD. I slept with the prosecutor - I was awoke about four o'clock that morning; I saw the prisoner retreating out of the room - he was near the box with his back towards it, as if turning from it; he got out - I then awoke the prosecutor; I had not seen the prisoner the night before, and do not know how he got in.</p>

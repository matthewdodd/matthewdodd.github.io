In the room where the prisoner slept (as he acknowledged, and his waistcoat was there) I found two blanks, and more blanks were in the same cellar where the press was fixed; I took the prisoner into custody, and brought the large press away: they certainly had not been at work that day, that is most clear.</p>
               <p>Court. Were the half-pence that were found round the press, good, or bad money? - They are bad.</p>
               <p>Are they finished for vending? - They are struck, but not coloured.</p>
               <p>Are they made to the similitude of a halfpenny? - Yes my Lord, all Tower halfpence are left bright, and these are not coloured at all, they use brimstone to bad half-pence, to make them look old and black.</p>
               <p>(The blanks and dies produced to the Court and Jury.)</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any instrument for cutting the blanks? - No my Lord, there was not.</p>

               <p>I went to No. 20, in Keppel's-row, I saw the prisoner sitting by the fire writing something, and the woman wiping her hands on a wet towel; I followed Mr. Clarke backwards, by the side of the press I found these half-pence, they are quite coloured.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I know the prisoner, I was a servant at No. 2, by Tottenham-court road; the prisoner was there sometimes, and sometimes not; there was a necessary that this gentleman speaks of, and there was no shutter between the necessary and the door, and he used to go into the necessary, and I saw no more of him; one day when he left the necessary door open, I did peep in, and I saw three in the place beyond the necessary.</p>
               <p>What were these three people about? - I cannot say what the men were about, they were at a distance from me; there was a little girl, and she was putting something in, it dropped out, but I could not swear positively what it was; it was put into a large thing that stood up.</p>
               <p>You have been examined before, and you know what you have sworn before, what did you see this girl do? - I saw the girl put some thing into the thing that stood up; the men were in the same place, at the same time: but I really cannot swear what they were about: they were there, and there was a noise, and there was something rattled, it was a thumping, something of that kind; the men were at a great distance, the part that I looked in at was quite different; I could see this great thing stand up in the middle: I have seen baskets come in at different times, they always had brown paper over them.</p>
               <p>What were they like? - Baskets covered with brown paper, I never saw the brown paper off; they carried them to that place, which we call the back part of the house; the stairs came down there, and I was in the fore kitchen; I told them before the Justice, gentlemen I do not know what it was like.</p>
               <p>Did you never see what it was? - I was a stranger to them, and they to me; they never shewed me, they never were lest under my care.</p>

               <p>Court. Upon your oath, did you ever see what any of these baskets contained? - I have heard mentioned, they never shewed me.</p>
               <p>Did you never see without being shewn? - I cannot say I ever did see, upon my oath, I cannot say that I ever did see; I might imagine what, but I never did see.</p>
               <p>You never did? - I never did to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Young woman, did you never swear that you did see them? - They told me so, and I told them that I made objections to it; they said, they did not stand to particulars.</p>
               <p>Who told you what it was? - I heard the gentlemen at Bow-street say they were blanks, and when they gave me under their hands<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160092"></xptr> I made objections, I said gentlemen, as for these, I never saw, they said they did not stand to such particulars as that.</p>
               <p>Will you say that you made any objections to sign that information that you made? - Yes, I will, I said there is something here that is not as I spoke it, one thing in particular, feeding the dies; I never heard that till I heard it in Bow-street, I cannot tell what the other objection is.</p>
               <p>Did you object to swearing about seeing the baskets? - I said the same then that I say now; that the baskets were carried out and in, I cannot tell what were in these baskets, they were baskets covered.</p>
               <p>Was there any candle in the place where they were at work? - There was a bit of candle, I could not see what they were about, because the candle was very low, and by the side of a great thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Who did you see in that place? - The girl was named Poll, the other man was named Castor, and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>You was a servant? - I was.</p>
               <p>Whose house was it, who occupied it? -</p>
               <p>We were all servants, but it was Mrs. Peake that came to see us, and gave us what necessaries we wanted.</p>
               <p>What had this man to do with the house? - I do not know, he slept in the two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Who slept in the one pair? - I slept in the one pair of stairs, there was no bed in the kitchen; there were three beds, sometimes Mrs. Peake slept in the other bed; Mr. or Mrs. Peake were to pay the rent of the house to be sure.</p>
               <p>Was there any fastening to this place where you saw them at work? - There was a bolt on the necessary, that was there when I went there.</p>
               <p>When there was nobody there, how did it use to be fastened? - There was no fastening but a little door that stood against it, and it was not locked.</p>
               <p>Then you could have gone in at any time? - Yes if I had any curiosity.</p>
               <p>Did you never go? - No Sir, I had no business there.</p>
               <p>What, and when there was nobody there and you was in that place adjoining, did you never go into that vault? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution. What was your master? - I do not know, we were all servants, I was a servant.</p>
               <p>You said you were all servants, what was Michael? - I never saw him hired, he was there sometimes, and sometimes not.</p>
               <p>Who are these all? - This Poll and Costar, and the prisoner, and me.</p>
               <p>What business is your master? - Where master and mistress did live, they carried on cock founding, there was no business carried on at this house, I was a servant, and paid as such; I tell you all the business I know, I heard a noise sometimes; my place was to clean five rooms and make the beds, there were two beds commonly used; there were three beds in the house, the prisoner slept there, and Poll slept with me when she did sleep there.</p>
               <p>What was Poll, was she cook? - We had a young child, but she did not stay a week, but when the rest went backwards, Poll went with them, and the prisoner went backwards with the rest.</p>
               <p>How often? - I cannot tell how often.</p>
               <p>Was it often? - Only once or twice.</p>
               <p>Who went with him when he went backwards? - Sometimes Poll, and sometimes Costar.</p>
               <p>You said you had an objection to sign this information of yours? - There were two or three things in it that was not just as I spoke them, and they said they did not mind particulars.</p>
               <p>In the information you said that you saw these three people frequently at work, did you swear that? - If I swore it, it is more than I know of; I said I saw them go backwards, and making a noise frequently, they might put down what they pleased; I have seen things that they called meggs, it was like a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>So you did not swear that you saw half-pence, but meggs; are these what you call meggs, look at them? - Yes Sir, such as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160093"></xptr> that, I saw a few on the dresser in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>You used to go to call them to dinner? -</p>
               <p>I used to go to the back door to call them to dinner, because the necessary door was fastened, so far as I know, I always supposed it to be, because there was a bolt there, I have found it fastened sometimes.</p>
               <p>Here is another thing that you swore, that you saw Coster and the prisoner bring in blanks, and likewise carry out halfpence? - I have seen them carry out baskets frequently.</p>
               <p>With meggs in them? - There was something in them to be sure.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This woman has got a daughter, which I frequently came after to the house where I was taken from, I only laid there when I was rather late, and I was there last Friday week, I came there and she was not at home; she used to keep a house by Doctor's Commons, and I sat there in the kitchen, and this woman by me, she asked me to write two or three directions for her; I only came into the house after her daughter.</p>
               <p>Court. Where do you live and work? - I served my time to a Hatter, and work there at this time, in St. James's, Duke's Place: I suppose my people will be here, if they know my-trial is on.</p>
               <p>The prisoner produced no witnesses.</p>

            . I live in Stonecutter-street. On Monday, the 25th of April, about half-past eight o'clock, I met a man, named Wicks, in Stonecutter-street with a woman, who afterwards proved to be the prisoner's wife; on the Sunday previous I had lost some lead from two houses, and suspected Wicks, as I had seen him the night before with the prisoner; and in the morning I met him in Fleet-market with the prisoner's wife, with a parcel on his shoulder; I suspected it was my lead, and asked how he came by it - he gave no answer, and the prisoner's wife ran away; I sent for an officer, and Wicks was taken to the Compter - the lead would not fit my house; I stated this before Mr. Alderman Cox.</p>

            . I am clerk to the Magistrates at Guildhall. I have a note of the evidence taken when Wicks was brought there with this lead - the prisoner was afterwards charged with the robbery, and was asked by the Alderman what he had to say - he stated that he bought this lead of a man named Swan, in Grub-street, about 80lbs. weight, for the purpose of making seals for cloths; I read this over to him - he said it was correct - the Alderman discharged Wicks - he gave his address No. 2, Webb-square, Shoreditch, and said he was an umbrella-maker.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. In what way was he brought to the office? A. He came voluntarily, because a man was in custody - he produced a small seal at the time, such as are put on cloth.</p>

            . I am a constable. I have searched for Wicks, and went with a summons for him to No. 2, Webb-square, where he said he lived; I made diligent inquiry, but could not find him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he had bought the lead six months ago, of Swan, and had used 20lbs. of it. When Mr. Montague engaged him, with an understanding that he was to discontinue making leaden seals he sent his wife with Wicks, to sell the rest, in order to lend Wicks 5s., which he wanted to borrow, and when he heard he was in custody he went to Guildhall, and cleared him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

I am in the habit of giving orders for any materials for paving the streets—in the middle of March the parish was paving White Lion-yard—old and new paving-stones were being used—I gave orders for moving about 1000 feet of stones from the public green-yard, which is the depository of the stones, to White Lion-yard—the value of them altogether was about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I afterwards saw them piled up in White Lion-yard—I was present when part of them were removed from the green-yard, but not the whole—I have seen the stones which are the subject of this indictment—I know them—I can speak positively to them from having given orders to our jobbing mason to cope them—I believe them to be the property of the parish—Dick called at my residence on Wednesday, the 24th of March; I was out of town—he repeated his call on Thursday evening—in consequence of his information I proceeded to his house, and went to No. 2, White Lion-yard—a person named Lloyd rents that hours—I went to the back of the house, and in a small covered shed there I saw forty-seven stones closely piled together, and amongst them I saw the eight stones which are the subject of this indictment.</p>

On Saturday, the 20th of March, in the middle of the day, I was present with him in White Lion-yard—he and I had been working there, at No. 8—he had an opportunity of seeing the piles of stones, which were in White Lion-yard, for the purpose of repaving it—about five minutes past twelve o'clock the paviors about there</p>

               <p>had gone to dinner, and the prisoner ordered me to help him carry some stones which he said he had bought of Mr. Giles, and he could have what more he liked—in consequence of that, I helped him with two stones into No. 2—he carried two, and I carried two—we carried them through the house No. 2, and put them into a shed in the yard—when I went into the shed there was a great number of stones piled up in it, as much as a cart-load—all that the pri<lb></lb>soner told me about them was that he bought them of Mr. Giles; that he was going to make a drain, and that they would come in very handy for him—I did not move any other stones into that shed—he said he wanted me to go to No. 8 at four o'clock on Friday morning, the 19th, but I would not—after I had moved the stones on the 20th I did some jobs with him—we laid two hearths—the stones we used was the same sort as that in White Lion-yard—I do not know whether it was any part of the stone I carried—the stone was there when I got there—I gave information to Mr. Giles—I went to his house on the Fast-day, the 24th of March—I did not find him at home—I went the next morning—I left word where the stones were—I have seen the stones which are here—I can undertake to swear these are the same that were re<lb></lb>moved from White Lion-yard to No. 2.</p>

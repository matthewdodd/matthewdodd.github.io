                  </hi>. I am assistant to Thomas Joseph Barrett, jeweller, 94, Edgware Road—on 26th January, the prisoner came into the shop about 12.30 in the day, and asked to be shown some lockets suitable for bridesmaids—I showed him a number of lockets which were in a tray covered with velvet, and a number of hooks in the tray, and on each hook hung a locket—he took six or eight lockets from the tray and selected four, which he at first thought might do to send the lady to look at, but on consideration he thought that two of them being rather larger than the other two, it would create a jealousy amongst the bridesmaids, and he wished to know if I would show him any larger ones—I told him I had some larger lockets, but I was afraid I had not them alike—I crossed the shop and brought four or five lockets from the window, and showed him those, and he weighed them in his hand—the locket that was stolen was one of those I had subsequently, showed him in the tray, which I took from the window—there is a ticket to each locket—I am sure I took the ticket from' the window with the locket that was stolen—I never take one out without the ticket—I saw him take that particular locket in his hand and weigh it, and I saw it on the counter a minute or two after that—he asked about some engraving—he wished to see some specimens of engraving which he would want placed on the pockets—Mr. Barrett came into the shop at the time and asked me if he could assist me, seeing me looking for the specimens, and I told him what I was looking for—he went to the desk and found an envelope with some initials on it—the prisoner did not mention what letters he wanted put on the lockets—he then took his hat off the counter and put it on, saying he had got the whole of the particulars he wanted, and hurriedly left the shop—I had told him before the cost of the engraving—there was a. young lady in the shop at the time, but no other customer except the prisoner—the young lady was sitting down the whole of the time, about six feet from the prisoner—there was a chair between her and the prisoner—I went to the police station on 2nd March and picked the prisoner out from a number of men—I had not the slightest doubt about his identity, and I have not now—I discovered the locket had</p>

               <p>gone about three or four minutes after he left the shop—no other person had been in after he left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It did not come across my mind at the Police Court about the young lady sitting on a chair—I stated there was another customer in the shop—Mr. Barrett gave a description of the man to the police—I did not—sometimes we receive goods in the daytime from manufacturers—the business fluctuates, sometimes as many as fifty people come in the day—I did not search for the locket afterwards, and it was not necessary—we have goods brought in by manufacturers and left for approbation sometimes in the day—we keep a stock-book—we don't compare the actual stock with the stock-book every night—the window is only dressed about once a month, when it is cleaned—the articles are left in the window from night till morning—I don't remember how long before that particular day the window was dressed—we take stock once a year—we enter everything that we sell and compare that book with the stock-book—we have not done that since the 26th January.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw the particular locket in the prisoner's hand—I found the ticket of it after he had gone, lying there without the locket—when I took it out of the window I took it out with the ticket—when we sell articles we remove the ticket and put it on one side, and use it again sometimes—I never knew a ticket get changed by accident.</p>

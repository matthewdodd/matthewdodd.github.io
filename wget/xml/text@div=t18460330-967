                  </hi>. I live in Cole-street, Dover-road, and am a clerk—on Friday, the 20th of Feb., I saw the prisoner running along Napier-street, Dover-road, from Kent-street, towards the Dover-road, running after a woman who was walking on the pavement, and calling to her to stop—he stopped her, and turned her against the wall—the first word I heard was his saying to her, "I will knock your b—eye out," and directly hit her in the face with his right fist apparently—the blow knocked her against the wall—he imme<lb></lb>diately put up his right foot, and kicked her in the lower part of her stomach, in her belly, as she was falling against the wall—he appeared to kick her as hard as he was able—she screamed out, and fell right down on the pave<lb></lb>ment—he then kicked her again in the same place as near as possible—I was about twenty yards from them—he then turned away from her, to come towards me, then turned back again, and lifted his foot, attempting to kick her again—some women came up, and said something to her which I did not hear—he turned from her, and did not kick her the third time—he then came towards Kent-street, towards me, walking as fast as he could—he passed a woman who said, "You brute, how could you serve a woman in that way? you are no man"—he turned round and said, "You old cow, you ought to be served in the same way"—I then said to him, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself to use a woman in that way"—he said, "You had better go and pick her up"—he went towards the George, in Kent-street—I saw no more of him—I have since seen the prisoner in Horsemonger-lane, and I am certain he is the man—he had on a white smock frock.</p>

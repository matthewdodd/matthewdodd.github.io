                  </hi>. I am a porter at the Oxford Arms Inn, in Warwick-lane. On Sunday night, 29th Jan., I was at No. 5, Bermondsey-street, about 11 o'clock at night—my brother was with me—we had had a glass or two of ale together—I was sober—I was going to take a Hackney <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I was standing at the door of it, on the off side, and some one came behind me and <hi rend="italic">bonnetted</hi> my hat over my eyes, and struck me a severe blow, which knocked me down in the middle of the street—I endeavoured to get up, and the prisoner hit me several times in the face with his fist; he cut my lip, and it bled a good deal—I had a watch with me, and I felt a pull at my watch; the prisoner took my watch out of my pocket, and ran away—the watch was hanging down by the guard—he did not get it; I called out—he ran away, and my brother pursued him—he was overtaken</p>

               <p>I had never seen him before; he was never out of my sight—I saw my brother overtake him, and lay hold of him—there was gas light—my brother overtook him, I should say about 100 yards from me, at the corner of Bermondsey-street—I had not had anything to say to him before he <hi rend="italic">bonnetted</hi> me.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with my brother on Sunday evening, 29th Jan,—I came out of the public house in Bermondsey-street, about 11 o'clock at night—after my brother came out I saw the prisoner knock him down—he hit him on the back part of his head, and then on the mouth, and he bled very much—he hit him three or four times—my brother cried out—the prisoner ran away, and I ran after him—I hallooed out, "Stop thief!" and the policeman stopped him—the person he stopped was the person who struck my brother—I did not lose sight of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

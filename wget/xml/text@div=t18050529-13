            's daughter sent for the gown; she said he had taken it out of the drawer, and when she saw him in the room, he had his hands lying upon it. I produce the gown and the bag.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. On Thursday, the 9th of May, I had been drinking very much the whole day; about eleven o'clock at night I went home to my own lodgings; I went up stairs, and instead of going into my own bed-room I went into the servant-maid's; I sat down by the hearth; on the table was a gown belonging to the prosecutor's wife; the daughter came into the room, and not knowing it was me, alarmed the people in the house, supposing I was a stranger; the prosecutor's wife and daughter said I was there with intent to steal something; I was in the dark; I did not know that there was such a thing as a gown on the table; while I lodged in the prosecutor's house, I always paid him justly; there were several articles missing which were laid to my charge, in consequence of my being in the room; there were several other lodgers in the house; I think they had as good right to suspect them as me, as the door was always open.</p>
               <p>Q.What do you say about the bag? - A. It is my own; it is my first wife's bag.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I will swear positively that bag is mine, it is pieced at the top, it was made by my mother.</p>

On the 10th of Sept., about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw a gig safe in the coach-house, with the wheels on it—next morning, about nine, I went to the stable, from information, and found the gate lying down, and the wheels, axle-tree, and springs of the chaise were gone—I gave information, and on the following Tuesday saw them to the station—these produced are them—this wheel has my own paint<lb></lb>ing on it—here is a crack by which I can swear to it.</p>

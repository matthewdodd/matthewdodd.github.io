            . I am in the service of a pawnbroker in High-street, Borough. The prisoner and another woman came and brought this coat; I am certain the prisoner was one - the other woman asked the prisoner how much she was to ask for it; she said 25s. - I gave them 14s. for it - I do not know which took the money.</p>

This is my coat; the prisoner and her husband lodged with me for a fortnight previous to the 25th of July - I took the coat in that evening, and put it into a box near the prisoner's bed; in the morning I got up at seven o'clock, and the prisoner was gone - I looked at the box between eight and nine, and the coat was gone; I made inquiry. and found the prisoner the Wednesday following in the workhouse - I have no other lodger.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I did not know what was in the box; the pawnbroker said I was not the person that took it, and said he would shew him the person - he went with him, and the next day he said I was the woman; I never was in his shop in my life - he knows the person who pawned it, but will not bring her forward.</p>

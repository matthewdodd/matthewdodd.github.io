I was going down to the coal-cellar, and saw the prisoner—she was employed there occasionally, and was employed that morning—I saw her concealing some<lb></lb>thing away—I let her go up-stairs, and I went to the place where I saw her conceal something, and found half a piece of ribbon—I replaced it, and set a person to watch—I was afterwards called, and saw several more half pieces of ribbon, which the prisoner had got in the cheese-cellar—an officer was sent for, who took the prisoner.</p>

I was set to watch—I concealed myself behind some baskets—I saw the prisoner come down with a candle in her hand—she looked about to see if she could see any one, and she went and took half a piece of ribbon from the place where it was placed—she unlocked the cheese-cellar door, and went in—I came from the place where I was, and I said to her, "That is sufficient: I have been watching you"—I went to call the last witness, and when I returned the prisoner had distributed these ribbons about—these ribbons were in her apron—she was taking them from her pocket—I saw her putting something into the dust-hole.</p>

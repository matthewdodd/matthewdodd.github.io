               <p>what time it was that he ceased to reside there with the Lamberts; I think it was about ten days before the 7th, a few days after Christimas—I knew the prisoner by the name of Mr. Burinelli—I do not know whether he followed any occupation; I heard that he was a tailor—on Sunday morning, 7th Jan., I was at the house in Foley-place—at that time Mr. and Mrs. Lambert were living in the house—they occupied the ground floor, the dining room floor—they lived in the front room, and slept in the back room—no one occupied the floor above that; there was a Mrs. Williamson in the house—she occupied the same room as Mr. and Mrs. Lambert in the day, but her bedroom was at the top of the house, the back room—she was in the house on the morning of 7th Jan.—about 9 o'clock on that morning I heard a ring at the bell—I came up from the kitchen to open the door and let in Mr. Burinelli—he asked me where Mr. Lambert was—I said, "Not up"—he then said, "Where is Mrs. Lambert?"—I said, "Not up"—he then said, "Where is Mrs. Williamson?"—I said, "Not up"—he then gave me his great coat and a parcel, and told me to take it down stairs into the kitchen—I took the great coat down stairs—as I was going down the stairs I heard the report of pistols; I heard two reports—I should think there was an interval of not more than a minute or two between the two reports; it was very quick—on hearing the discharge of the first pistol I turned to come up stairs, and the second discharge took place before I got to the top of the kitchen stairs—when I got to the top of the kitchen stairs I saw Mrs. Lambert—I did not see the prisoner at that time—Mrs. Lambert was bleeding from wounds on her arm and neck—she told me that Mr. Burinelli had killed her husband, and had shot her, and desired me to go immediately for a policeman—I went and fetched Sergeant Hayes—I afterwards saw the prisoner carried away from the house on a stretcher by the police—I never slept in the house in Newman-street; I used to do needlework, and <hi rend="italic">go</hi> backwards and forwards—I did not know that any intimacy existed between the prisoner and Mrs. Williamson, either at Newman-street or Foley-place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow. I had been living with Mr. Latham, as his wife, for fourteen years, before this unhappy event occurred; we passed as Mr. and Mrs. Lambert—before we went to live in Foley-place, we lived in Newman-street; we occupied the upper part of the house—the prisoner lived in that house, I think for five or six weeks; he was an acquaintance of Mr. Lambert's for five years—he had been some time in the country, but I should think he had been in London about four or five months altogether, with the time he was in the hospital, and the time he was at our house—I do not know how long he was in the hospital; it was the Middlesex Hospital—when he came from there, he came to live with us in Newman-street; he was an inmate of ours, and associated with us as part of the family—we allowed him to take his meals with us, and he hired a bed room in the house—he continued in Newman-street till we moved to Foley-place, and he moved with us—Mrs. Williamson was lodging in Newman-street, not as part of our family, she had her own apartment—she is a milliner—she also moved to Foley-place when we moved—in Foley-place, Mrs. Williamson slept in the upper back room, and I and Mr. Lambert slept in the back parlour, on the ground floor—the prisoner slept on the second floor—for about a fortnight he slept in the next room to</p>

               <p>Mrs. Williamson, on the third floor; but then he removed down on the second floor—there are four rooms on the upper floor—the prisoner left the house on 28th Dec.—I believe he is by trade a tailor; he had not much to support himself during the time I knew him; but Mr. Lambert allowed him to live there, and gave him what he could afford to give him, which I think was about three shillings a week—he was always an idle, lazy man, I believe; he would never do, any thing—the reason of his moving from the upper room to the lower one was this; as we gave him his room for nothing we did not charge him for it, and the room on the second floor we thought we could not let to any one else, and as we gave him his room we thought he might as well sleep in the room which we could not let to any other person—he ceased to live there on 28th Dec., by the desire of Mrs. Williamson, wishing that he should not continue there—I had not the least idea that any intimacy had arisen between him and Mrs. Wil<lb></lb>liamson, not until after he was gone from the house—it was Mrs. Wil<lb></lb>liamson's desire that he should leave; Mr. Lambert was the one that mentioned it to the prisoner—after he left he did not come to the house for any purpose until the morning in question; but he sent a little boy twice with two letters to Mrs. Williamson—I did not know that little boy—I believe he did not wait for an answer—that was all the com<lb></lb>munication he had with the house after he left, to my knowledge—on Sunday morning, 7th Jan., I was sleeping in my bed room on the ground floor—Mr. Lambert was in bed with me—our bed room door was not fastened inside—I was awake when Burinelli entered the room; I had been awake some time—I heard the ring at the bell, and heard the door open, and heard him speaking to Mrs. De Beaux—I did not hear her go down stairs—I saw him enter our room—the bed was just behind the door; the door opened on the left hand, and the bed was on the left hand side—a person coming into the room, if he walked straight from the door would get to one side of the bed—that was the side on which Mr. Lam<lb></lb>bert slept—when the prisoner opened the door and came into the room I saw that he had a pistol in his hand; I only saw one, be had the other hand behind him—he said, "Mr. Lambert, Mr. Lambert! "and instantly shot him—he was quite asleep—the prisoner was well aware that Mr. Lambert slept very sound, and always laid till late in the morning—he died instantly upon receiving the shot—I at first pulled the clothes over my head, and then I jumped out of bed and ran round to see if I could get hold of the other pistol—I went towards the prisoner—I saw him change the pistol he had discharged into the other hand, and take the loaded one into his right hand—he did not say anything to me as I approached him; when I got quite close, going to take the pistol, he in<lb></lb>stantly fired—he was standing close by the wardrobe, about one or two steps from where he shot Mr. Lambert, and he was coming towards me—he was holding his arm up, with the pistol in his hand; I saw him raise his arm—the ball of the second pistol took effect in my arm and neck, and I am still labouring under the effects of that ball—the prisoner instantly left the room, and went up stairs—I cannot tell whether I fell or not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Lambert and the prisoner, only when he was saying good bye and he was leaving the house—I never heard Mr. Lambert communicate to the prisoner any complaint that Mrs. Williamson had made—Mrs. Williamson and I were in partnership together in business—at the time the prisoner left I was not in the least aware of any improper intimacy between himself and Mrs. Williamson—I cannot tell whether Mr. Lambert was aware of it—he never communicated to me anything that Mrs. Williamson had said—I am not aware whether he knew of the intimacy or not—I was present when the settlement took place about the money, and the balance was given to the prisoner, it was in the evening, when he went away—Mr. Lambert reckoned it up, because Mr. Burinelli wished to pay for a fortnight's board while he was in Foley-place, and a fortnight's lodging for a room, but previous to that, during the time we were in Foley-place, he did not pay anything for his food or his room, only the last fortnight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a milliner by trade—I resided in Newman-street, in the same house with Mr. and Mrs. Lambert—Mrs. Lambert and I were not connected in business, until we left Newman-street—during the time I lived in Newman-street, the prisoner lived there—he and I became intimate as man and wife; that had been the case three weeks, I think, before I left Newman-street—we had been acquainted longer than that,</p>

               <p>from seeing him at Mrs. Lambert's—I think I once or twice went out for a walk with him—I used not to go to the theatre with him before that time—I have been once at the theatre with him; that was when we were in Foley-place—nobody went with us—oh, I went once before that, with Mr. and Mrs. Lambert and the prisoner—when Mr. and Mrs. Lambert moved to Foley-place, I accompanied them—I set up in business with Mrs. Lambert at that time; we took the house together, and I slept in the upper room—the prisoner also moved, and slept for a few nights in the room next to me, and then he went down to the second floor—after a short time he left; I think it was on a Thursday; in Jan., I think—I do not remember whether it was in Jan., or the latter end of Dec.; it was shortly after Christmas—it was my wish that he should leave—I communicated that wish to Mr. Lambert, and the prisoner left a few minutes after—he told him instantly to go; as soon as he could get his carpet bag ready, he went; it was after tea in the evening—Mr. Lambert told the prisoner why he was to leave—I was not in the room when he told him to leave—I did not hear what Mr. Lambert said to him about his leaving—there was no one in the room but themselves at first—they were in the dining room; the ground floor front room—I was called in afterwards, I think by Mr. Lambert—they had been together about five or ten minutes before I was called in—when I went in, Mr. Lambert said to me, "Do you wish Burinelli to leave the house?" I said, "I think it would be better"—he then said, "I will go," and he went up stairs, and got his bag to go—he said he wished to speak to me alone, and Mr. and Mrs. Lambert left the room for a minute or two—I do not remember when Mrs. Lambert came in, but when he expressed a wish to speak to me alone, she was there—after Mr. and Mrs. Lambert left the room, the prisoner asked me to meet him, and I refused—he did not mention any place or time—he had some money, which he offered to give me, but I would not take it, and he then left—when I spoke to Mr. Lambert about the prisoner, I gave him a reason for wishing him to go—I was on the ground floor, and Mr. Lambert called me into the bed room, and asked me what made me so unhappy; that was the beginning of it—he had noticed that I appeared unhappy, and asked me that question—he guessed the cause, and I said, "I think it would be better if Burinelli could leave the house"—I told him I thought I was pregnant by the prisoner—it was directly after that, that the interview between Mr. Lambert and the prisoner took place—Mr. Lambert seemed astonished at receiving this communication from me—the prisoner was in the parlour, on the ground floor, at the time—Mr. Lambert said he would protect me, and he went into the other room, and ordered Mr. Burinelli out of the house—I remained in the bed room, whilst Mr. Lambert went into the parlour, until I was called in—I heard their voices in conversation in the interval, but I could not detect the words—I never saw Burinelli after he left that day, until I saw him after he was shot—I received two letters from him; I showed them to Mr. Lambert; I did not send any answers to them—I gave them to Mr. Lambert—one I threw away, and the other was burnt—I never received but those two letters from him in my life—the first letter was wanting me to go out; I forget the exact words of it—he said that he held my honour in his hands, and it was my duty to go out and see him, and he begged I should do so—I sent no answer to that letter—the first letter came, I think, on the Tuesday, and the second on the following Saturday; that was begging me to meet him at All Souls' church, in Regent-street, that evening, from 8 till 10 o'clock, and stating that he was going to Paris—I</p>

               <p>do not remember whether the second letter alluded to the fact of my not having sent any answer, or taken any notice of the first; I think not—about an hour before that letter came, an apprentice that I had, saw him in Foley-place, and he inquired of her how I was, and said he was going to Paris, but I received no other communication from him than those two letters—they were written in affectionate terms—on the Sunday morning in question, I was asleep in my room, and was awoke by a noise proceeding from the lower part of the house—my apprentice was sleeping with me at the time—my door was fastened inside—I heard some person ascend the stairs, and then try to open the door of my room—I called out, "Who's there? "the answer was, "Open the door; open the door"—I asked, "Who is it?"—I did not recognise the prisoner's voice at all; he seemed so agitated—he answered, "It is Luigi Burinelli"—hearing the noise previously, I thought something was wrong, and I said, "Where is Mr. Lambert?" he said, "Dead," and I think he said that he was his assassin, but I am not sure—he then went into the adjoining room—I heard the window thrown up, and I ran across my room, and looked out of the window, and I immediately heard the discharge of fire arms—my window looks out the same way as the window which was opened—I did not see anybody when I looked out of the window—I did not go into the room—the policeman came up and said, "Open the door; "when I opened my door, I had a view of the room into which Burinelli had gone—I then saw him lying on the floor, and bleeding from a wound in his face.</p>

I was cook to Mr. Crawford—I remember the prisoner being a fellow servant of mine at Mr. Crawford's—his wife died while we were in Scotland—on our return I observed that he was in very great grief—he showed it in different ways; he used to cry very often—he was very kind, and beloved by all his fellow servants—I remember his calling in Grafton-street in Sept. last, to see some of the servants—he then said that he had been very ill, and his wife had died, and he wished he could have got something, and he would have killed himself during his illness—he said his troubles were more than he could bear—he said his troubles generally came on a Friday—he said he had left his child in the country, and allowed the woman who was nursing her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and reside at Penshurst, in Kent, near Tunbridge. The prisoner came to Penshurst about April, 1851—he began to work for me at the latter end of April, 1851—he continued in my employment up to about March or April, 1854—he behaved himself remarkably well during that time; his manners were those of a very quiet, sober, steady, inoffensive person—I believe his associates were all fond of his company—he had married a woman of Penshurst; she died in childbed—that produced a change in him; he appeared to be under great depression of spirits and melancholy—that was in 1854, about the beginning of the year—it was about Jan. or Feb. that his wife died, to the best of my re<lb></lb>collection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did any particular idea seem to haunt him at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing further than seeming so melancholy; he used to say, "Oh, dear! I shall die," and words to that effect—he was so ill then from the fistula that he could not work—I used to say to him, nonsense; not to be labouring under such impressions—that did not produce any particular effect—I do not know exactly how long that state of mind lasted—I believe there are witnesses who do—it began, I should say, soon after his wife died, and he was ill, I believe, till he came to London—I believe that was in the summer of 1854—I did not form any opinion as to the state of his mind at that time, but I thought he was very strange, and he appeared more so after he lost his wife; in fact, I did not see anything before he lost his wife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had he any idea about anything coming from his wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He used to say that his motions passed through it—I never heard him say anything about his bed being wet; it never was wet that I saw—at the time he went away he said, "Oh, Mr. Cook, I will be no more trouble to you;" I said, "Nonsense, Louis"—I did not wish him to go away—he started out at the door; I went with him, and we had not got many yards away, before he said, "Mr. Cook, I am no more trouble to you, I will throw myself in some river," and he continued crying for nearly half a mile where we went—I told him not to put himself out of the way, that if he wished to leave, he might go the next day—I very much wished him to come back that night, but I could not persuade him to come back—he cried loudly, and some persons heard him as we went along.</p>

I am gardener to Mrs. Stratfield, of Penshurst—I have known the prisoner about four years—I remember his marrying and coming to Penshurst—I also remember the death of his wife in childbed—I noticed a very great change in him after that event—before his wife died, he seemed a very respectable man, and a man very much respected in Penshurst by everybody, and after his wife died, he appeared quite an altered man altogether; his mind seemed very much bewildered—he did not appear to be in one state of mind two hours together, and expressed himself in that sort of way that he wished to die, and he did on one occasion ask me to shoot him—I did not hold with him in anything of the sort, but tried to persuade him different, but he never would hear anything that I had got to say—he appeared to listen at the time, but in a short time I saw by what he said that he did not listen to me—he appeared to give attention at the time, but afterwards he would make some speech by which I was certain he did not, which showed that he had not been attending—I remember on one occasion I was reading a book; I cannot recollect now what book it was, but it spoke of a man shooting himself and he said, "I think that is the best way, if anybody wants to die, to shoot himself—when he was under Mr. Valler's hands, he was receiving medicine from him, and he had formed the idea that Mr. Valler wanted to poison him with the physic, and the medicine that he brought him he poured into a saucer, and put a halfpenny into it to test it; it turned the halfpenny bright, and by that he said he proved that the medicine was poison; but still he kept going to Mr. Valler, and brought home I do not know how many bottles afterwards—I do not know whether it was the same sort of medicine, but by its appearance it was—I heard of this event by the newspapers.</p>

               <p>about being operated upon, and had some difficulty in getting him to consent—after the operation, during the time of the healing of this little wound, he became very impatient, and very violent, and very irritable, and really, eventually, unmanageable—I applied dressings and bandages to the wound, and every day or every night I found that he had removed them, and not only had he removed them and torn them away, but he had been pulling himself about, so that he broke any little adhesions that might have taken place, and thus prevented the wound from healing properly—the wound was not likely to produce much pain; some degree of soreness, but not pain—the operation produced pain, but not else—the consequence of his tearing away the bandages, was, that it prevented the wound from healing as well as it would have done otherwise, and also protracted the healing—he still continued very violent and unmanageable after that, and ungovernable—the people in the house were exceedingly kind and attentive to him, remarkably so—I believe they did for a time pacify him and keep him in order, but he would break out again precisely in the same way—he after<lb></lb>wards went away from Penshurst—I should mention that he had a strange delusion with regard to this, that his water passed through this tistulous opening, which was perfectly absurd, because, before he left me, the wound was healed, and under any circumstances it would have been ridiculous—I considered that to be an utter mental delusion, quite so.</p>

I have known the prisoner six years; the last time I saw him he repeated many things; that he had been very ill, and wished to leave London to go away to establish his health—he complained of the fistula,—he was rarely at my house, once in five or six months—the last time I saw him he complained a great deal of his head; at the same time I said, if he desired to go away I would give him some money, if he wanted to go to Paris—I never said anything to him about coming to my house, or keeping away—I said to him, "You are rather mad, and you had better go to Paris."</p>

The prisoner came to my house seven or eight days before this event—he fell upon his misfortunes and his illness—he took refreshment at my house several times, once a day—sometimes he said what he had was good, at other times he said it was not good—one night he said he had some persons who persecuted him, and another night he said a different thing—he asked for a passport, and said he wanted to go to Paris—he said so several times, especially the last time I saw him—I believe that was on the Saturday evening before this event took place—he said before that somebody was ruining him; he never said the name—other Italians frequented the house—I told them he had better go away, and I said the same to him—he stayed at my house till 1 o'clock on the Saturday night—it was an hour before, at 12 o'clock, that he spoke about his passport to a gentleman that was there—it is impossible for me to remember what</p>

The prisoner came to reside at my house, I think it was about 26th Dec., 1854—he took a lodging of me for one week, and at the end of that week he renewed it for the week following—he left my house on the morning of the murder, to commit it—three days before that he was very ill, and two days before he never went out—Thursday, Friday, and Saturday before the murder was committed he laid ill, and two days he laid and never got off the bed—I attended him myself with tea and coffee—he appeared very ill indeed—I asked him where his pain lay, and he put his hand to his head, as he lay outside the bed, and to his side—he appeared in such an agitated state of mind, and seemed so bad, and I asked him where his pain lay, or whether he would like to see a medical gentleman—he said, "No," a medical gentleman would be of no use to him—I took him some tea, some toast, and some eggs, which he partook of, and he thought his head was a little better—on the Friday before the murder, he appeared very much agitated; he was up and down stairs, and in the back yard several times, and I believe it was on Friday night he went out two or three times in the night into the back yard—he was very much disturbed on Friday night; I thought he had several Italian people with him talking—I went up stairs—his door was a little open—he had a very large light, and he was parading backwards and forwards in the room—he had no one with him—he was walking backwards and forwards, waving his hand so, and nothing in the world in his hand—he talked very loud, and very sharp—he did not like to be spoken to the second time about anything, if he did not happen to understand it—he was talking to himself when he was walking up and down, but in the Italian language, and I did not understand it—there was not a soul in the room with him—he was talking very loud and sharp, and walking up and down, as if he was addressing several people, but I saw no one there—I have come voluntarily to give this evidence to-day; I was not subpœnaed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head nurse in Forbes' ward, Middlesex Hos<lb></lb>pital; I have been in the hospital between five and six years. On Thurs<lb></lb>day, 17th Aug., I was in the ward when the prisoner was brought in as a patient by a shorter man—I directed the nurse to get him to bed, which she did—in the afternoon, a lady and the same short man came to visit him, the lady was Mrs. Lambert—she did not bring him anything then—she said to me that she did not know what to do about leaving him, he was so nervous and excited—he was very low spirited and desponding, and seemed very reluctant to be left—I did not ask him any questions—he spoke to me about a doctor on several occasions, but not that day—he said the doctor in the country had killed him, he was sure he had killed him—he seemed to labour under the impression that his wife's friends had treated him very ill—he said, "Oh, them friends of my wife's, they have not treated me well," and observations such as that—I asked the man no questions—he said he had been defrauded out of a great deal of property, it was my impression that he meant, by his wife's friends; that was what I thought and understood as his meaning—he continued very low and desponding—he used frequently to call me and say he was sure he was swimming with water, that he had wetted the bed, but there was no foundation for his saying so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In point of fact was there any wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was a wound, in that region, which required dressing in the hospital—I used to attend to it, but there was no water oozed from it at any time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any operation in the hospital, anything done to him with the knife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my recollection Mr. Shaw once passed a probe, but I cannot be sure—he had a wound in that region, and I had to attend to the dressing of it—the patient could not see the wound.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090074"></xptr>
               <p>he would put his hand to his head, and say, "My head, my head"—in other respects he was a particularly mild and gentle man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the nurses at the Middlesex Hospital; I remember the prisoner being brought there, on Thursday, 17th Aug.—he was in rather an excited nervous state—I got him to bed—he did not appear to be aware of what was going on in the ward; he was not aware of any<lb></lb>thing—he cried bitterly when he came in, and said he should never get well—I told him to make up his mind; he would be very happy and comfort<lb></lb>able with the rest of the patients, and not to give way—he had a fistula—I have many times said to him, "What ails you, Louis?" and he has pointed to his head, and said his head was bad—he frequently spoke to me about his bed being flooded with water—he frequently called my attention to his bed, and said his bed was very wet indeed; and to satisfy him I have taken the sheet from under him and shown it to him—he did not pay any attention to that, he seemed rather unconscious of anything.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he ever say the bed was swamped? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Swamped; that was the word: swamped with water—he frequently went to the window of the ward when he was ordered up; he did nothing when he got there, only looked out into the garden—I frequently noticed him crying at the window—he continued in the same state of melancholy until he left the hospital—he went out to make room for cholera patients—we had a great pressure of cholera patients at that time, and he was one that was ordered out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and am assistant surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital—I remember the prisoner's admission to that institu<lb></lb>tion; I referred to the book, and found that it was on 17th Aug.—I visited him almost immediately after his admission, either the same day or the day after—I found him exceedingly depressed—he had the remains of a small fistula; it was so trifling that it could hardly be said to exist—I asked him to allow me to look at it—he became exceedingly excited when the subject was mentioned, and showed great terror of an examination, or of anything being done that could at all give him pain—I observed great irritability about him when I first saw him, great excitability and extreme depression—I found the remains of a fistula, a very small sore which had not healed—I divided a very little bit of skin that was there—I told him that his complaint was exceedingly trifling, and that he would get well immediately; in fact, that there was no occasion for his having come into the hospital; upon that he put up his hands, in an entreating manner, and exclaimed in broken English, "My fistule, my fistule!"—I think the next time I saw him he stated that his water was in the habit of passing through this fistula—I made a very careful examination on that head, and there was not the least ground for it—I examined him repeatedly, on subsequent days, and reasoned with him, and showed him that it could not possibly be the case; I passed an instrument into his bladder, and showed him in every way that it was an impossibility—what I said did not appear to have any effect upon him; and I saw subsequently, more clearly, that it produced no effect upon him, when he became an out patient—he left the hospital on 2nd Sept., that was when the cholera patients were admitted—he left in consequence of our requiring the beds for cholera patients; he then became an out<lb></lb>patient—whilst he was an out-patient he had no bodily ailment—he was cured of his bodily ailment—whenever he came he stated that his water passed through the fistula—I took a great deal of pains, in consequence of his melancholy condition, and his apparently friendless condition, to show him that it was absurd; but you might as well have talked to a stone wall.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq., M. D. I have devoted myself for a great number of years to the question of insanity—I am afraid for more than thirty years—for the last sixteen years, I may say, I have given my attention exclusively to the subject of insanity, at least, I practice exclusively in that department of medicine—I have been present in Court during the whole of this trial—I have heard the evidence of every one of the witnesses who have been examined—I have formed an opinion with regard to the state of the prisoner's mind—I agree with the last witness, that the prisoner was not of sound mind at the time when these circumstances which have been mentioned occurred, especially the delusion, which is perfectly inconsistent—a man cannot be of sound mind, and have an absolute delusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You agree that the prisoner was not of sound mind in respect of the delusion of his water passing through the place where the fistula had been? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I conceive that was a delusion, utterly inconsistent with soundness of mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there any other grounds upon which you form that opinion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> An apparent change of character, from being a very mild and inoffensive</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090077"></xptr>
               <p>person, to becoming sometimes excited, sometimes melancholy, his thoughts often dwelling upon suicide, and eventually, from inadequate cause, committing a great crime.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M'ENTEER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From all these circumstances, you give your opinion about his state of mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would be my medical opinion, if such a case was laid before me in any shape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you formed in your mind any notion of what is an adequate motive for a great crime? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I speak only of the absence of an adequate motive—I conceive that a stronger mind than that of the prisoner, may be driven to crime by a combination of circumstances, bat they must be much more severe and trying, it appears to me, than those to which the prisoner was subjected—I do not profess to have any measure for the intensity of love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the pain of rejected love, be in proportion to the intensity of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is very difficult to answer questions of that kind—if I might explain myself, I should say that supposing the deceased person, the man who was murdered, had murdered the object of the prisoner's love, or some violent offence of that kind was given.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the object of attack was the person who had prevented the con<lb></lb>tinuance of an attachment, would that be a ground of hostility and revenge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think not at all, in a person whose mind continued sound; it might be a subject of great offence, and continued pain, but not to lead to murder and outrage—no doubt some degree of attachment, and separation from the object of it, might form a motive for revenge, and in different ways in different minds—there is no doubt a tendency to assassination in different people—I believe the Italian temperament is generally considered more swayed to fatal revenge from jealousy than more northern people—the delusion with respect to the water passing through the fistula, I think quite a decided proof of unsoundness of mind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the surgeon of Newgate—the prisoner has been under my notice, during his confinement in the prison, from the day of his admission—I do not at this moment recollect the date of that—I saw him on the day he was brought in; it was about six weeks ago—I found him suffering chiefly in consequence of a wound, which he was said to have inflicted upon himself—after a few days he complained of a bleeding, which I attributed to the existence of piles, and which he allowed existed—I examined him—I found a small pile, which I considered indicative of internal piles, from which the blood proceeded—there was a small external pile, which is indicative of internal piles—generally speaking, when external piles are found, and bleeding has occurred, we presume, without putting the patient to further pain, that internal piles exist—I saw the appearance of an operation having been performed, on that part of the body, for fistula; it was not entirely healed—there was a little watery discharge from a little orifice in the skin, where it was abraded; that was the case when he came in, or within a few days afterwards; he did not tell me of it till then—that was the case when my attention was called to it—there was a little watery discharge, which is common under such circumstances occasionally, a very small quantity—he did not make any representation to me with respect to any discharge from that wound, in the manner which I have heard—he said that he passed blood from behind—he did not represent to me anything about water—he did not represent to me any gushing of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090078"></xptr>
               <p>water; he did afterwards, because I asked him—he represented that he passed blood when he went to stool—I did not see it; I found that he most likely had passed blood—he did not complain to me of the passing of water, until I spoke to him on the subject—I had heard of it—I did not speak to him about it until this morning, nor did I hear of it, to draw my atten<lb></lb>tion particularly to it, until yesterday—I came down to the prison this morning for the purpose of asking that question—I said to him, "Did you ever say anything to me about water having passed from behind?" he then said, "My fistule"—that was all he said in answer at that moment—I said to him, "But did you ever think that you made water from behind?" and he answered, "I don't know that I ever did"—to the best of my recollection, that was all that passed this morning—during his stay in the gaol, I have had conversations with him almost daily—in the course of my attendance upon him, and in the conversations I have had with him, I have never observed any symptoms of aberration of mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would quietness and a regular diet have an improving effect upon that state of mind; would quiet, and regular diet, and bleeding restore his mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is natural that quietness and regularity should improve the condition of a person thus situated.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M'ENTEER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you believe that a regular system in prison in such circumstances as the prisoner was under here, would have a sedative and composing effect upon his mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think anybody committed in an excited state of mind would probably be in a more quiet state of mind after being in prison for some time, and kept quiet and regular—if a person when committed was simply in an excited state of mind from the circumstance of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090079"></xptr>
               <p>his being committed, I believe his mind would become more tranquil, calm, and composed, after being there some time; that is, supposing it was merely the excitement incident to his committal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From seeing the present state of mind, you would not attempt to speak of any previous state? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can only speak of that which I have known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the first day he came in, and before any beneficial effect could have resulted from the diet and treatment of the gaol, did you observe any symptom whatever of aberration of mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—every case must be treated by itself; in the case of a person long depressed and debilitated, bleeding would not have a beneficial effect; on the contrary, it would add to the depression.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">GOURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he was labouring under depression, would that be increased or diminished by committal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If he was labouring under depression, that depression might be increased by the fact of committal—in excitement of the brain, bleeding is not at all a universal remedy—in some cases it might, but in a great many cases, in the majority of cases, I should expect it would not be had recourse to—many people may have recourse to it.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq., M. D. I have paid great attention to what are called diseases of the mind—I have never devoted myself exclusively to that branch of study, but I have paid great attention to it—I have been in practice since 1818; I studied in France for some time, and had the management of an establishment there which would probably turn my attention to it, but I have never been exclusively a physician of that class, not exclusively confined to the subject of insanity—about ten years ago Dr. Southey and I were appointed to investigate Bedlam, in relation to some charges that were made against it by Mr. Serjeant Adams—I have recently delivered a course of lectures before the Royal College of Physi<lb></lb>cians, on the subject of medical evidence and proof in cases of insanity—I was desired by the Government to visit the prisoner in Newgate—I saw him there yesterday, and had a long conversation with him—I had that con<lb></lb>versation with him with a view to form a judgment upon the state of his mind—in that conversation I saw no symptom of aberration whatever—I have also been desired by the same authorities to attend the trial here to-day—I have carefully listened to the evidence—I have heard what has been stated with respect to the prisoner's representation or impression that water came from the wound where he had had a fistula, and an operation performed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you consider that, from all the evidence you have heard respecting it, to be an insane delusion of the mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I conceive that impression was founded, in the patient, upon the slight dribbling of serous fluid from the cellular texture about the wound, which there must have been, even in that small place, exaggerated by his mind, that mind being intensely sensitive and excitable; I could observe that, in the conversation I had yester<lb></lb>day; there is a state of the body or nerves called hypochondriasis—I should conceive, considering the nature of the delusion, which was not in my eye strictly an insane delusion, considering the extreme excitability and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090080"></xptr>
               <p>the sensitive state of his mind, that all his peculiarities might be accounted for, without supposing anything more than hypochondriasis.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Considering the extremely excitable state of his nerves, you think that all the symptoms that have been spoken of, would be accounted for by hypochondriasis? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All the symptoms that looked like insanity might be accounted for by that: hypochondriasis being a form set apart for those who are very nervous about their own health; a peculiar set of per<lb></lb>sons, whom it would be very unjust to call insane, persons who are peculiarly anxious and nervous on the subject of their health.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And frequently imagining diseases which do not exist? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Frequently imagining diseases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you, in the course of your practice, known cases in which per<lb></lb>sons labouring under hypochondriasis have imagined diseases to exist with respect to their own person, which had no foundation whatever in fact? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is more frequently the case that they exaggerate a symptom—I am assuming in this case not a complete imagination, but an exaggeration—that is my opinion in this case—it is more frequently that they exaggerate a symptom, and I imagine that to be the case in this instance—they may be generally traced to some trifling foundation—I certainly do not consider that persons exaggerating in that way, can be at all properly classed with those of unsound mind; you would extend a very dangerous excuse if you did.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. M'ENTEER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">YOU</hi> only saw the prisoner one day I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only once—I have heard all the evidence here to day—I should not consider if a man thought his bed was swamped with water that that would be a delusion—I should use precisely the same method of explaining that as the other form I spoke of—if a patient held language to the effect that his bed was swamped, if it began from the slight ground which this person seems to have had, I conceive it quite natural, quite conformable with the laws of hypochondriasis, that he should go on exaggerating to any extent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> After he arrived at any extent, would you consider it had ever arrived at a delusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, that is the fallacy of division; there is no end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you would consider that a man who said his bed was swamped, although it was repeatedly shown that there was not a drop of water of any kind in his bed, and that delusion being still persevered in, day after day, was not under delusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be a very strong case, I admit, there is no question about it—I do not consider incoherency, an element in making up delusion—inconsecutiveness is nearly the same thing—I should not consider inconsecutiveness and incoherency as tending to create a morbid delusion; there must be something beyond it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will just read a passage from the work of a gentleman whom, I am sure, you must have a very good opinion of (<hi rend="italic">Reading from page 26 of Dr. Mayo's own work</hi>): "In dealing with the two grounds which I have recently considered, for imputing insane delirium, namely, the presence of incon<lb></lb>secutiveness of thought in cases of certain delusions, how does the medical witness conduct his inquiry and arrange his evidence?—he makes, or he ought to make, each of these elements throw light on the other; where incoherency and inconsecutiveness exist there is little difficulty—continual inconsecutiveness, I believe, involves the presence of morbid delusions; that is, is sure to produce them"—do you agree with that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, incon<lb></lb>secutiveness</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090081"></xptr>
               <p>and incoherenoy, when continued, are pretty sure to have delusion with them, and is a most important element in the proof of insane delirium—I do not observe, in the evidence given here, proof of inconsecutiveness of character in the conduct of this man—it may perhaps be an answer to your question, as far as I can give one, to say this, that I saw not that amount of disorder of thought, or any such extent of error in the succession of ideas, which would amount, in any fair reasoning or observation, to insanity; that takes in inconsecutiveness and incoherence too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will just read you, Lord Brougham's definition of a delusion; "A delusion is a belief of facts which no rational man would have believed;" do you consider that definition to be a correct one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly it is much too loose, obviously so; I am sure Lord Brougham himself would declare so—the basis of a delusion is a fake perception—I believe I may say that a delusion is a false perception; that false perception may either be one of the special senses, or it may be one, corresponding with the delusion of the special sense of the understanding—a delusion combining both those would be a perfect delusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If a man fancied that he passed water in enormous quantities, and that his bed was swamped, and it was proved that he did not do it, and he was shown that the sheets were not wet, would not the two specifics for delusion exist? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have already explained that there is a form set apart, called hypochondriasis, which begins with certain grounds; now, a false perception, which is a real delusion, has no ground, but the hypochondriac starts upon perhaps most trivial ground, and the molehill grows into a mountain, and the expression of "swamping" perhaps takes place—that is a totally distinct thing from what I mean by delusion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does not hypochondriasis occasionally merge into insanity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of course there is an immense difficulty in drawing lines, but that would become a matter of fact—unquestionably, there must be in every science which is not a perfect one, a great deal of philosophical empiricism.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think that a man, whose judgment would not allow him to correct a transparent delusion, could exercise a sound judgment in other matters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is often the case—I do not suspect that the person in the dock has exercised a sound judgment in any matter lately, but I allude to wisdom and experience—in such modes of delusion as belong to hypochondriasis, there are many men whose judgment is excellent, but who are exceedingly erroneous in other matters; they are unable to correct the delusion that they have in respect to their own health.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you find a delusion in respect of water, combined with a tendency to suicide, carried out in practice, would that be evidence of insanity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I knew hypochondriasis to be the cause of the delusion, and the suicidal attempt—if a real insane delusion occurred, and the patient was of a plethoric character, and not of that sort of constitution in which bleeding disagrees with the insane, no doubt the loss of blood, by an accidental bleeding, or after an attempt at suicide, might temporarily benefit him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With respect to the effect of bleeding in a plethoric subject, when the vessels of the brain are in a state of congestion, bleeding would be useful? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Moderate bleeding; but in insanity it is not right to take as much blood as the state of the pulse would indicate—moderate bleeding may, be beneficial, if the brain is congested—the prisoner has the constitution not of our clime; he has the Italian pulse, but a very small one, and a nervous constitution; and I should very much doubt whether</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090082"></xptr>
               <p>bleeding would suit him under any circumstances; at least they must be very extraordinary circumstances—I carefully felt his pulse.</p>

I am a doctor of medicine, and have for many years paid marked attention to the diseases of insane persons—I was elected physician of St. Luke's Hospital in 1841, and have had a large practice among insane persons—I was directed by the Government to visit the prisoner, with a view to ascertain the state of his mind—I saw him yesterday, and had a conversation with him—it was before Dr. Mayo saw him—that was the only time I saw him—I was with him an hour and a half, conversing on different subjects—I did not observe any symptom of aberration of mind—I have heard the evidence in this case, and the acts attributed to him, as indicative of the state of his mind, by the witnesses, at different times—assuming them to be true, I should not, in my judgment, refer them to unsoundness of mind; I cannot consider them to have been the result of motiveless impulse; I mean the acts of violence—I have heard the history of the prisoner, and of his asking a man to shoot him—assuming those circumstances to be true, I should not refer them to unsoundness of mind—I should consider his impression that water came from his person in quantities in the bed, and that on one occasion he said that he swamped the bed, to be an illusion, the result of hypochondriasis, and not a delusion, the result of insanity—it is very common for persons suffering under hypochondriasis to take false views of the ailments of their own bodies—I find them frequently persist obstinately in those impressions—I do not consider it necessary to order such persons under restraint, or to treat them as insane persons.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LE BRETON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> May I ask you if the belief that the prisoner's bed was swamped with water, although it was not the case, was not a delusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, an illusion, the effect of hypochondriasis—the seat of hypochondriasis is generally in the nervous system; it is the effect of the nerves conveying false notices generally through the system to the brain—hypochondriasis may proceed to mental disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you find, in combination with hypochondriasis, suicidal notions and tendencies, and general depression and melancholy, would you not consider that evidence of a mind not sound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not taken in the way you put it, without considering the whole circumstances of the case—it would go some way to constitute mental unsoundness—it would require delusion—the bed being swamped with water is an illusion, not a delusion—the difference between an illusion and a delusion, is that an illusion is objective—a delusion may be subjective, but the judgment must be involved—an illusion acts upon the brain—when a man is argued with, and shown to demonstration that no such illusion existed, the judgment would come into play, and be called upon to decide—if after that the illusion was persisted in I should conceive the judgment to be in fault—if the judgment is at fault there is not something wrong in the mind; not on a transparent fact like that, without hypochondriasis; not in the sense of unsound mind—a mind might be perfectly sound that would come to such a judgment—if a man believed that his legs were made of glass, and it was shown that they were not, that man would not have a sound mind—the distinction between the bed swamped with water and the glass legs, is, that the one is so palpably absurd on the face of it that it is a delusion—it is not palpably absurd that the bed was swamped with water when it was shown to be untrue; I should inquire if there were any reasonable grounds for the supposition; but where it is demonstrated that there is no water in the bed, it would be—where there is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090083"></xptr>
               <p>no reasonable ground for the supposition, then I call it a delusion—I do not say that the prisoner was under a delusion in this case; if I found that there was reasonable ground I should not consider it a delusion—the reason<lb></lb>able ground might be this; he told me that Mr. Henry had tried to per<lb></lb>suade him that he did not pass the water behind, and he said that he showed Mr. Henry the lint, and it was wet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you consider that the exuding of a small portion of moisture would be sufficient ground for the illusion, if the bed was dry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should consider it a great exaggeration of the fact—there is a progress in mental disease called the incubation—hypochondriasis is a very frequent cause of mental disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although a man may be hypochondriacal without being insane, is not hypochondriasis one of the conditions of insanity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It may be, but there is something superadded—if great mental depression were superadded, hypo<lb></lb>chondriasis would not be a symptom of unsoundness of mind, it would be a symptom leading out of it—a suicidal tendency is very frequently one of the symptoms of mania—there are cases in my experience, mentioned in books, where a man, after brooding over some fancied wrong, and the commission of a crime, has suddenly recovered his mental faculties—the quiet and isolation in which the prisoner has been lately, may have had a beneficial tendency on mental disease, assuming it to have existed—it does not follow at all be<lb></lb>cause I found him without mental disease yesterday, that he may not have been maniacal on 7th Jan,—it may be so—taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration, I do not like to give an opinion as to whether the prisoner was of sane mind last Jan.; I think that is for the jury to give an opinion of not for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not see him in Jan.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I see in this case clear proof of his having been suffering from hypochondriasis—the tendency of hypochondriac patients is to exaggerate an ailment of the body, that is a marked feature of the ailment—this impression of the prisoner about his bed, had reference to a supposed exudation from his body, which he exaggerated—that is not a circumstance that I should consider at all unusual in a person suffering under hypochondriasis—it is one of the most usual features of the complaint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having heard the evidence respecting this prisoner, would you refer any act of his, of which evidence has been given to day, to the influence of an unsound mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I answered that before, in saying that the acts which I have heard of, I do not consider to be motiveless, and therefore the result of insanity; that is, assuming the facts are true, that he was dis<lb></lb>missed from the house in the way that has been proved, and so on.</p>

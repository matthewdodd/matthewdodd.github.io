                  </hi>. I am wife of Benjamin Mills, of 14, Lombard Street—I have separated from him—I have only known the prisoner about a month before this charge—he had been coming backwards and forwards to see me—I went in a public-house the day this happened, the 27th, with two young girls, and met the prisoner there, and spoke to him—on leaving we both said good-night, and I went home—he came to me an hour after, and knocked at the door three times—I asked what he wanted; he did not answer me—the door was open—he knocked again, and immediately came upstairs and said something to the two girls in the next room, and I went in and shut my door—he pushed the door open, and said "I have got you," and threw me on my little girl's bed and stabbed me in my right breast with a penknife, and said "Will you speak?" and I said "Yes," and got up and went to the door and he followed me—on the landing he said "You can get a policeman and lock me up;" and when I was outside the door he said "You can fetch a policeman, you have got more than you will get over; if I had a bigger knife I'd do for you right out"—I went up the Bridge Road and told a constable, and was taken to the hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I was not taken to the hospital before you came down stairs, but while you were standing at the door—there were plenty of larger knives in the room, and you could have got one—on the first day you promised to take me to the Surrey Theatre, and we went into a public-house and had some drink, and when you come down to my house I said, "Wait outside for me," and there was a soldier standing at the door, and he made a hit at me, and you said, "That's your chap," and walked away, and I said he was nothing to do with me—lie was not absent on leave from the barracks that night. Clara Brown. I live at 13, Lombard Street, and know the prisoner and Mills—I was with Mills in her room on Sunday night, the 27th, when the prisoner came—Mills looked out at the front-room window and asked what he wanted, and he would not answer—she said, "If you don't like to answer me you can do the other thing," and came back into her room—he then came up stairs—he looked first in the front room and then dashed her room door open and said, "Now I have got you"—he had a knife in his hand, and I saw him stab her with it twice—I went for a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at Guy's Hospital—Margaret Mills was brought there on Sunday at 9.15—she had three stabs in her right breast and three on the left side of her chest—the one in the right breast penetrated the cavity of the thorax, but whether it injured the lung I cannot say—there were also two small cuts on her right thumb—the wounds were caused probably by a small knife, and the one penetrat<lb></lb>ing the thorax was dangerous.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 261). At 9.40 on 27th I was in South<lb></lb>ward Bridge Road, and heard screams of "Murder" and "Police" at the bottom of Lombard Street, and on going to the spot I saw a woman bleeding, and asked her what was the matter; she said she was stabbed—I arrested the prisoner; he said, "I stabbed Moggy Mills with a small penknife; if I had a larger knife I would have killed her."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner in hie defence stated that he had been living with Mills five-or six weeks, who told him she was not married; he saw her with a soldier, who asked him to go to a public-house with him, where there were other soldiers, and the first soldier took off his belt and struck him on the ear, and he thought Margaret Mills had put him up for a hiding, which put him out of temper, and he went home and stabbed her.</hi>

            . I am servant to a stationer, and live in Chapel-court, Swallow-street. On the 21st of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner near Exeter Change, Strand, in company with two other lads, following a gentleman; one of the three took hold of a gentleman's pocket and felt it; they left that gentleman, and went on, through Charing-cross, into Cockspur-street, then all three followed a lady and gentleman to the <placeName id="t18200517-135-crimeloc788">Colonade</placeName>

He put it into his pocket, and went on. I secured him, but nobody would assist me to find the gentleman. A gentleman on horse-back told me where he was gone. I came up to him in Waterloo-place - he felt, missed his handkerchief, and asked me to give it him. I refused. I had found it in the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HONE. Q. Are you sure he is man - A. I am. I did not ask the gentleman his name, and do not know it.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I was employed to go in search of the prisoner - I went to Mr. Needham, of Liverpool, and apprehended the prisoner at No. 5, Union-street; I searched him, and found about him a green purse, containing five sovereigns, three half-sovereigns, and 31s., and in a carpet bag I found 7l. 12s. 6d. in silver, and on his wife, who was with him, 2l. 18s.; I was surprised to find so little, and said, "Where is the rest?" Mr. Davies told me there was 1200l.; he said, "I assure you I had no more than what you have found, and what Mr. Needham has got - I have been squandering the remainder away for the last two years;" Needham had a bag of money, which I did not see found.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. On the 2d of July I was working in Fenchurch-street; I saw the prisoner and two others walking along, and one of his companions leaned into the prosecutor's shop; the prisoner stood close to him with a bag, which was doubled up, and they all stood looking about; I went over to the prisoner, and asked him what he had got in the bag; he said Nothing; I said "If you have got nothing the better for you, for you must go back with me to that gentleman's shop," and then I believe he said, some person gave them to him; I saw the bag opened, and the trousers taken from it.</p>

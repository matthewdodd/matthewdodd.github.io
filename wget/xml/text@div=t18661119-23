                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, of No. 55, Queen Street, Edgware Road—on Saturday evening, 27th October, about a quarter to nine o'clock I was at the White Lion public-house, and saw Berry there, who I had seen about four years ago, but not since, as he robbed me then—I was quite sober—I did not speak to him, but he caught hold of my arm and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> me round—I asked him what he did that for; he made no answer, but struck me on my breast, and struck my watch-guard up, saying, "You are not everybody, if you have got a guard on"—he struck me two or three times—I buttoned my coat up, and turned to go outside to get away from him, but he rushed at me, unbuttoned my coat, and struck me a violent blow on my eye—we struggled together and both fell on the floor inside, and I felt a tug at my watch, and then missed it—I immediately got up, and said, "He has stolen my watch"—he got up immediately, and I found my chain was gone, but my watch was still in my pocket—I said, "You have stolen my watch," and then I saw him pass something to Murphy, who I then saw for the first time—I said, "Stick to the door, and let no one go out till we get the police in"—Murphy rushed at me and struck me three times to get to the door, but I kept him in—he made a rush at another door and got out there—Berry stood in a fighting attitude till Murphy was gone—the police came in and I gave him in charge—my chain was worth about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many persons were in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There might be twenty, and most of them were prostitutes—I know that, because they are always walking about the streets—I did not speak to any of them—the landlord was there, not the potman—Berry did not say that he would go, he did not speak, he only struck me.</p>

               <p>Berry. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was I not standing in the bar when you came in? A. Yes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, of No. 58, Camden Street, Notting Hill—I was standing in the White Lion, and saw both the prisoners strike the prosecutor—Murphy's hat was off on the ground—Berry said, "Run to the door"—they could not get out, and he said to me, "You b—, let me go"—I had not the presence of mind to stop him, but let him pass, and ran after him—he ran up the Edgware Road, and afterwards came back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you run? A. Yes, and had him in sight a good part of the way, but he was out of my sight three or four minutes—he was about twenty yards before me as he ran.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GOUGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure Berry is the man who ran. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Berry's Defence</hi>. I quarrelled with Taylor in the public-house about his bad work, and he caught me by the neck and knocked me against the door, when thirty or forty people came between us and stopped the fight. I never touched his watch-guard. I did not say that I threw the watch and chain over the bar. If so, how could he have his watch? I never saw Murphy in my life, and did not know he was in the house. Taylor and the bricklayer were the worse for drink. I did not say that I did it for a lark. I defy any person to say that I ever committed felony, or was at any police-court in the kingdom. Taylor says that I robbed him four years ago. If so, why was I not brought before a Magistrate the same as now? I am a working man, and no thief.</p>

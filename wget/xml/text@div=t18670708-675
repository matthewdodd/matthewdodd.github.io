Beales, Monkwell Street"—that looks very like the same writing as the 24 5/8 of stair carpeting—Beales's entry is more like Edwards's writing than anything I have seen—it looks very like Batterham's writing, and it also looks like Edwards's—Edwards left about March, for irregularities; he was an assistant in the carpet department—everything from every department goes into this book—between January and March Thompson was in the handkerchief depart<lb></lb>ment; he had an assistant, his name is Scott I think, he is not here—Scott makes entries or authorises anybody to do it.</p>

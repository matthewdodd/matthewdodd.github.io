               <p>On the 26th of December I lost the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) out of the parlour; the prisoner had lodged with me eleven or twelve days; I let her the back parlour at half-a-crown a week at first, afterwards she agreed to go down into the kitchen: on the 26th of December she helped me set the room to rights, she put the watch into a cannister in the tea-chest; that afternoon I was going out; she wanted to persuade me to go on the Wednesday, but I went that day; she said, as I would go, she would go, and went out a little before me; she asked me, where she should meet me to help me bring home my child at night, and I told her; and she came about half after five, at the place appointed, to help me bring the child: we went home about half after six, or near seven; when we came in, the tea-chest was on the floor.</p>
               <p>Who lived in the house? - There was a lodger on the first floor; my apartment was locked; I found it as I left it, when we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178104250035"></xptr> came in, and the tea-chest was on the floor; she said, Where is the watch? I am afraid you have been robbed; I looked, and the watch was gone: she bid me not be flurried; she dared say that was not all I had lost, and desired me to go and look in my drawers: I went and looked in the drawer where my gown that I lost was, under my husband's clothes; I saw my husband's clothes safe; I did not miss any thing: she said, I was flurried, and bid me look again, I should find I had lost more; I looked again, and missed my gown; the next day I missed three aprons out of the clothes-bag; I told my husband I was robbed; he said, it must be somebody in the house, and said he would have them searched; the prisoner seemed very confused; the next day she ran away: there is a door from each parlour into the passage, but they were both locked.</p>
               <p>Can you form a judgement whether they were taken before you went out? - They were all there when I went out; I have not found any thing but one apron; I am almost positive it was in the room when I went out.</p>

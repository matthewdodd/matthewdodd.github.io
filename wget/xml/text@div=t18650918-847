                  </hi>. I am a Baker, of 108, Brick-lane, Bethnal-green—on Monday night, 8tb August, I shut up my house and remained up after all had gone to bed—the windows were shut and the house safe—before I went to bed I called up my men to work—I went to bed about 12 o'clock—about 5 o'clock in the morning I was called by my men—I went directly into the bake-house—from what I heard, I went into the parlour, and saw my till on the floor, quite empty—the previous night it had been on the table, and had in it from 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and amongst it was sixpennyworth of farthings, separate in the till—the prisoner had been in my service for about five months, and left about five months ago.</p>

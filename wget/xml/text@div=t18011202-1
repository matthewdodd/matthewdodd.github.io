            , Hammet, and Esdaile, to change.(Produces the bill.) I took it to Mr. Lee, a currier, and the prisoner remained in the shop; I got change there, and gave the prisoner the difference; I think it was twelve pounds odd shillings; I asked him where I should send the shoes; he said, he would send word by the gentleman who was with him, of the name of John Nabbs, whom I knew to be a Manchester gentleman, a friend of mine having empowered me to settle a debt of three hundred pounds with him, and seeing the prisoner with him, I did not inquire about him; when I had given the change, they went away; the shoes lay in my shop for some days, when he sent a written direction by this gentleman to send the shoes to the Angel Inn, Angel-street, St. Martin's-le-Grand, to be left at the bar for Mr. John-Webb Elkington. I did not send them for two days after, and, in the mean time, he sent a porter for them, who took them away, but brought them back on Saturday, and said, he had taken the shoes to the Black-Dog, Mile-End-turnpike, but the landlord would not pay him; I thanked him, and paid him; the prisoner, in about two days after, called; and said, he was very sorry I had the trouble, but he would pay all the expence of carriage, which he did, and took the shoes; this was about seven days after his first purchasing them. On the 10th of September, he came to me a second time to purchase the same quantity of shoes for one Captain 
               <persName id="t18011202-1-person52">Williams</persName>
            , a relation of his, who was going to America; they were to be at the Dundee Arms by twelve o'clock; he presented a bill for fifteen pounds; I said, I had no change; he said, he was going to an acquaintance where he could get cash for the note, and he would call and pay me in cash; he went away, and came again about four or five o'clock in the afternoon; he said, he was disappointed, as his friend was out, and had I not got so much change in the house; I said, I had not; he went away, and called a third time, about seven o'clock; I told him, if he would leave the bill, I would get the cash, but I could not do it sooner than the morning. O surely, says he, you are very welcome, and he indorsed it immediately in his own name; he called upon me about eight o'clock the next morning; I said, I had not got the change, but to call a little after nine; he called at ten, when I was out; I went into the City to inquire about the bill, and found it was a bad one; he called again at eleven, and I asked him how he could be so cruel as to come to me a second time with a bad bill; he said, a bad bill! that cannot be, I am not afraid of it, I am certain it is good, and I will make it good to you; I told him, I hoped he would do so; the second parcel of shoes were in the shop; he wrote a note to some friend of his in Rosemary-lane, a Mr. Postlethwaite, at Mr. Beaumont's, but he never came; the prisoner was taken into custody on the 11th, and on the 18th he was fully committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When this man first came to your shop, he came with Mr. Nabbs, whom you knew? - A. Yes, or I should not have given him credit.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon all the inquiry you made afterwards, did you not discover the account he gave of himself was true? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020004"></xptr>Q. Did he not tell you he had the bill from a person of the name of Carter? - A. He said, a man owed him near fifty pounds, but I cannot recollect the name; I did not see any body but the prisoner and Mr. Nabbs.</p>
               <p>Mr. JOHN HORNIDGE sworn. - I am clerk to Esdaile and Co. (Looks at the bill.) This is not the acceptance of Esdaile and Co. I accept alone for that house; the partners accept, but no clerk but myself; I write only John Hornidge; the partners accept for Esdaile and Co. This is not their hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know whether the partners have or not given authority to some other person to accept as well as yourself? - A. I never understood they had; none of the partners are here.</p>
               <p>Q. The bill is indorsed in his own name? - A. Yes.(The bill read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I received those bills at Birmingham of one Carter, who is a carpenter and joiner; I don't know his Christian name; he owed me a little money when I was with my father, in October last, but I cannot say justly the sum; he gave me those bills for that money, and I advanced eight guineas on them; when I came to London, I took one of them to Mr. Williams. who is a distant relation of mine, and he wanted three dozen of shoes to take to Africa with him; that he said he should not received any money till he got into the Downs, and could not pay for them; I told him I would advance it till them, which I did; he wanted some stop things, which I also ordered for him but, when I found the bills were not good, I ordered the shoes back again; the stop things I never had.</p>

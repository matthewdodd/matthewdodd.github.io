               <p>Q. What coloured mare is she? - A. A duncoloured mare: On the 18th of April, she was missed, and I heard of it about the 26th.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her again? - A. On the 23d of July, to the best of my knowledge, I saw her in possession of the younger Manby, in Sharp's-alley, Cow-cross; he was up stairs, and the officers desired to see a mare he had got, and he came down, and shewed it him; as soon as I saw it, I said, it was my mare; I am sure it was the same mare.</p>
               <p>Q. What were her marks? - A. A mark that she had in foaling; she was hurt in foaling; a twist upon the off leg, a star upon her forehead, a mark down the back, and a mark over the off knee; she had been thrown down, being rusty, and a mark over the off eye, which she got at the same time.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The young man came before the Magistrate, upon being desired by the officer, without being taken into custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, he there told you his father had bought the mare in Smithfield? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. The Magistrate thought it was only a case of misdemcanor, and they were both bailed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When did he say he bought it? - A. On the 10th of October, 1800.</p>
               <p>RICHARD EVANS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I have had the mare ever since she was before the Magistrate; she is over the way.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known it? - A. I bred her, and broke her into harness.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any accidental marks about her? - A.She rather treads outward her off leg, and a star in her forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any mark of having received any injury about her body? - A. None particular; there was a mark where she had had the stranguary, but that was hardly visible.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that the mare you got from the Magistrate's, was the same mare? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you do any farriery to her? - A. On the 15th of October, 1800.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you saw her? - A. The latter end of October.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You spoke to her by the natural marks, and by the twist in the hind leg? - A. No, she got that in foaling.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How are her knees? - A. You can hardly discern it now.</p>
               <p>Q.Discern what? - A. They have been broke, or a little scratched over the off knee, and there was a little bit of a cut over her eye, but very triftling; it is pretty well grown out now.</p>

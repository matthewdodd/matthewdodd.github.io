On the 28th of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner ran from the door - I followed him about two hundred yards, and he was taken by the officer; he had nothing then - I had not seen him part with any thing, but as he was running I saw the umbrella in front of him; there was one missing from the door - I had put four there in the morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You said there was none missing? A. Yes - Mrs. Jupp said to me."Are you sure there is one gone," and I said perhaps not, but I went to the door and took down the loop to which it had hung; it had been pulled down, and the loop was left - I did not say it would not do to detain him, as there was no umbrella missing.</p>

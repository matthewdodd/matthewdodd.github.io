                  </hi>. I am assistant to my father and brother; their names are William and Samuel; they are woollen-drapers, outfitters, and tailors, at 23, Westminster-bridge-road. On 25th April, at eight o'clock, the prisoner came to our shop—I was engaged at the time—my father called me forward, and the prisoner went outside the shop—I went after him and asked him what he wanted—he said, "Some cloth"—I told I was disen<lb></lb>gaged, I could serve him, and went back towards the shop—I supposed he was following me, turned back, and he had walked off twenty yards from me down the road—I thought there was something suspicious about it, went after him, put my hand round his waist, and found these four yards of cloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)under his coat, worth about 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was William and Samuel Colston's property—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine-merchant, of York-street, St. James's, and am the prisoner's brother; he is fifty-three years of age—he was tried here in Nov., 1849, for two acts of pilfering—a nominal sentence of three days was passed by the late Common Serjeant, and he was given up to the care of his relatives, on the ground that he was not in a state to distinguish right from wrong—when this last act was committed, he lived at Walnut-tree-walk, Lambeth; I and his friends supplied him with the means of living—he has been asked whether he wanted more money, and if he had said he did, he would have had it immediately—I did everything except restraining his liberty, which I was afraid would aggravate his malady—he was in business as a linen-draper at Southampton, and failed seven or eight years ago—his mind was always affected, from his youth, and that made it much worse—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185005060108"></xptr>
               <p>was not capable of carrying on his business—frequently he has thought he has lost all chance of salvation, and I have seen him weeping and wringing his hands, and refusing to be comforted—my father was always considered insane, and a paternal uncle in the army would have been shot for striking his superior officer, but was acquitted on the ground of insanity—three brothers, distant relatives on my father's side, were confirmed lunatics, and restrained throughout their lives—I have been led by this, in some degree, to make the mind a subject of study, and have published on it—I consider the prisoner's mind is sometimes in that state, that he does not know right from wrong.</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am surgeon of the Gaol of Newgate. I have examined the prisoner this morning—I am of opinion that he is of weak imbecile mind—I have heard the last witness's statement—a large failure in business, in many cases, weakens persons' minds—insanity is also trans<lb></lb>mitted—I have heard that his father and other relatives were insane—the larger the number of relatives that have been insane would increase the like<lb></lb>lihood of his being so—it is probable that his mind is in such a state, that he sometimes does not know right from wrong.</p>

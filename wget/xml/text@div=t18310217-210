            . I am servant to Mr. Lane. On the 27th of November, at nearer eight then seven o'clock, there was a knock at the door; I opened it, and saw a tall man, who asked if Mr. Lane was at home; I said he was not, and asked if he would leave his name, or any message, and I would deliver it as soon as he came in - he said there was no occasion for that, if I would allow him to write a letter in the office; I said Certainly - he went into the office; the clock then stood on the mantel-piece; I gave him half a sheet of paper, which he asked for; he then asked if I would allow him to bring a friend in; I said Certainly - he went and let his friend in, and left him on the mat in the passage; the tall man walked into the passage, and I also - I asked his friend to walk into the office, but he made no answer; I asked him again; he walked in - I shut the office door too, and went to acquaint mistress that such persons were there - my mistress had just come down stairs, and was in the back office; I merely told her; she said "Very well" - I shut mistress' door, went into the back hall, and was going down stairs, when mistress told me the gentlemen were gone; I then went into the passage, found the street door open, and looked into the office - they were gone, and the clock also - I saw Ellis at the office on the 7th of this month; he is the man; he is a very tall man - I saw him at the office, and know him to be one of them; I cannot be mistaken about him - I do not recollect the person of the other man who was with him, but am positive it was not Gast; it was a shorter, stouter man, dressed like a baker - I was as certain of Ellis at the office as I am now; I saw the clock there, and was sure of it; I went into the office in a short time in the course of that evening, and found master's hat was taken off the table -I have not seen that since; Ellis had left his own hat behind; I am sure it was his, because the other man's was all over flour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many times were you before the Justice on this business? A. Three times - Ellis was present on the first occasion; I did not state then that I did not know Ellis - I was asked three times, once by a person near, whether I could identify both the prisoners; I said only the tall one - the person said, "I think you can, look at them again;" I said; "No, only the tall one;" it was my master's clerk who said this - I did not hesitate at identifying Ellis.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Gast's house, after Ellis was taken, with Ballard and Goddard - I went into the first floor room on the left-hand; it is a bed-room - I saw the clock; I did not see Gast in that room - when Gast was in custody (after Ballard had left the house) he came to me in a side room, where I was waiting to prevent his going out; I then said it was a bad job, he having so respectable a business - I named several things which had been removed from his bed-room by Goddard; I named the clock slightly, but we had not removed that - he merely stated that he knew nothing that was brought into the house, it was all his wife's friends, and his wife's sister had brought the property in; I had not particularly noticed the clock to him then, as I then believed it was his own - after the examination I saw him in the passage of the office, and asked how he accounted for the clock being in his bed-room; I made no threat or promise to him at any time - there was only one clock there; he said that was his wife's, and that she had it before he married her.</p>

            . I am a hatter, and live in Tottenham-court-road. I was at the office when Moore was examined at Marlborough-street - I attended all the three examinations; I heard her at the first examination asked if she could identify Ellis - she could not; she said so - she was asked by the Magistrate if she could identify any of the prisoners; Ellis was in front of the bar - she looked at them, and had full time to do so; she said she could not identify any of the prisoners - all she know was, that one of the men who came to the house was a dark man, a very dark man; Ellis did not try to screen himself from view, far from it - I was at the second examination; she identified him then - the first examination was on Tuesday; I rather think about the 8th - the second was on Thursday or Friday; she identified him then - he was dressed precisely the same as before; I am a house-keeper.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you been acquainted with Ellis? A. I was not acquainted with him further than his living at his father-in-law's; I have seen him pass and repass my house, that is all - I went there on Gast's account: a friend of Gast's called on me on Tuesday morning, and I went.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear Gast was under examination on the 8th? A. Gast was among the prisoners at the bar then; I heard this brought forward about the clock, and attended the next examination; the examination on the 8th was about the clock - on Tuesday Mr. Lane came forward, he said he had lost a clock, and the servant identified it: she swore particularly to Ellis at the second examination, which she did not do on the first - I thought it something peculiar; the second examination was in the Magistrate's private room; I was sitting behind Mr. Harmer, the solicitor, and he was astonished to hear her turn round and say, "That is the man that came to the door, and asked me if Mr. Lane was at home;" Hr. Harmer immediately stood up, and said to Mr. Conant, "That woman before denied knowing any of the prisoners," and she said she did not - I said to Mr. Harmer, "Why, I was present, the Court was cleared for her to look at the prisoners, and she went forward to them and said, 'I cannot identify any of the prisoners, all I know is one was a very dark man.'"</p>

               <p>Q. Then she never mentioned a tall man? A. She did not - I am quite sure she never described the man as a tall man at the first examination; she did at the second, and swore positively to Ellis - she said positively at the first examination that she could not identify either of the men; there were fourteen persons at the bar then, and there were two short men who appeared to creep behind the rest, that they might not be observed; but Ellis and Gast remained in front - I have not heard what she has said here; I was not subpoenaed here - I am a hatter: I came at the request of Gast's and Ellis' friends - I told Mr. Harmer I had heard her say that she could not identify either of the prisoners, and he said he hoped I would attend at the Old Bailey; he was by at the time she said this.</p>

             re-examined. I was at the office three times; Ellis was there the first time - that was on Monday, the 7th: I saw him again on Tuesday - on the first examination I was asked to stand on the steps to see them closely; I said I could only see the tall man, and could identify no other but the tall man (the prisoner Ellis) -I was not asked by the Magistrate the first day (Monday), if I could identify them; I saw them again on the second examination (Tuesday) - I said I knew Ellis was the man I let in; I did not express a doubt about him - what I said was not taken down the first day, it was on the second; I am quite sure I spoke positively to him, and at the second examination again I said, "That is the man" - Ellis was present, and saw me.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the bar cleared that you might attend to the prisoners? A. It was not cleared, to my knowledge; I went to look at the prisoners - I was asked by one of the officers; the Magistrate did not ask me - Mr. Harmer said I had not identified him at the first examination, but it was very wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Harmer say something to this effect,"That woman could not, on the first examination, identify the man, and now she has done it?" A. To my knowledge he did not say those words - he said something of the kind, and I contradicted him at the time; I swear that I did identify him on the first occasion - the reason I was asked about him at the second examination was, because I was not asked by any Magistrate on the first day - the Magistrate was sitting, but, I believe, at the time there was something else going on - they were talking about other things; I do no not think the Magistrate could hear it - it was not loud enough for him to hear; the prisoners were before him at the time, but they were talking about other things which were stolen, such as medicine-chests - it was Ballard who asked if I could identify the prisoners - I do not remember Plank asking me; I believe master's clerk asked me first - he asked me three different times over; he said, "There is a short man getting behind, was it not him?" I could identify no one but the tall one - he did not ask me three times to identify the tall one; I identified him at once - I remember where Mr. Harmer stood at the first examination, and my cold was so bad he could not hear me; I am sure I contradicted Mr. Harmer when he said I could not identify him at the first examination - I did it openly - I had seen none of them before, to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170122"></xptr>knowledge; the man had a coloured handkerchief on - a dark looking one; it was not white - he had a common coat on; I might have seen him for about ten minutes - he took his hat off in the office.</p>

            . I was formerly in business as a shoe-maker, in Tottenham-court-road - I now live in St. John-street, Clerkenwell, and am out of business. I was examined yesterday to Gast's character - I was not at Marlborough-street on the Monday, but on the Tuesday, and heard Moore asked if she could identify any of the prisoners - the prosecutor's clerk brought the clock up to my righthand, and he was requested to take Moore into the passage that she might see the prisoners brought in, to identify them - they stood at my right-hand, and the answer made was, "No, they warnt them," at the time she went out to see the prisoners walk, I believe Ellis was one - I saw him at the bar; the girl returned and said, "They arn't them that I have seen;" it was then said, "We will have the place cleared; they shall be put to the front, and then you shall go and look;" it was cleared, and the prisoners put to the bar - Ellis and Gast were quite in front, and several women behind; the men were all in front; I think there were five, if not six men - there was nothing to screen Ellis: the officer cleared all the front; she walked up, then walked back, and said, "No, they are not the men;" this was on Tuesday; I was there again on the Friday, at the second examination, when she was asked if she could identify either of them, and she identified the tall one (Ellis) - Mr. Harmer told her she had before said they were not the party; he said so openly - the Magistrate then wanted to mend the evidence, and Mr. Harmer said he had no right so to do.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did the girl say to the observation of Mr. Harmer? A. She said she might be mistaken; she did not say she had not mistaken the man, and had said he was the man - she said she might be mistaken; she said three times at the first examination they were not the men, and the clerk stood at her side.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How did you happen to go to the examination? A. Having heard of the circumstance, and Gast being a friend who I highly respected, I went to the examination, as I was going to dine that day in Westbourn-place - I dropped in to render him assistance if he wanted it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. On your oath, did not the girl, when Mr. Harmer suggested she had not spoken to the man, say that was not true for she had identified him? A. She said, "I might be mistaken" - I positively swear she did not say she had spoken to him - she did not contradict Mr. Harmer- Mr. Harmer rose up, and spoke to her, but I did not hear what she said, more than that she might be mistaken; I will not swear she did not say she had spoken to him, I am sure what I describe took place on Tuesday - I was only there Tuesday and Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Magistrate put the question to her "Did you speak to the man positively the first time?" A. I do not know that I heard a word of that - I was on a chair; the officer said I should break it, and at that moment I got down.</p>

            . I am solicitor for Gast. I attended at Marlborough-street on two occasions - I do not know when it was; I have only come into Court this moment- I was there at what I understood to be the first examination; Moore was taken by the officer in front of the bar, near to where the prisoner stood - she gave a description as to one being a tall young man; she was asked if she could identify either of the prisoners at the bar - she then came close to the Magistrate's table, and gave a short description of the way the clock was stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she able, on being shewn the prisoners, personally, to identify any of them? A. Certainly not - Ellis was at the bar and brought prominently forward; I have heard part of the last witness's examination - I was at the second examination; Moore was examined, but I saw her deposition had been previously reduced to writing - it was put into my hands to read, and seeing it stated her to have identified the prisoner (she had not been sworn to the depositions, and I was surprised to find it reduced to writing - Ballard was giving his testimony as to something Gast had said;) on finding this statement in the deposition, I cannot exactly recollect what I said, but I expressed my astonishment that she should have sworn to the prisoner after she had been shewn him at the bar previously, and could not; Ballard gave an explanation how it occurred.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she contradict you flatly at the time, and say she had identified him on the former occasion? A. She said she had spoken to him on a former occasion, but did not say it was in the office; it was after the prisoners had been removed from the office by the officers on their way to the lock-up room, she again had an opportunity of seeing them, and spoke to him - I only heard this from the officers themselves.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the girl in your presence ever say she could not identify the prisoner at the bar? A. Certainly - she said she could not speak to any of the prisoners at the bar, at her first examination.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At that time Ellis was standing in a prominent situation? A. Yes, and I believe the place was cleared for her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you told the Magistrate she could not identify him on a former occasion, did she contradict you and say she had? A. What passed was from the officer, and not from her - I think the Magistrate was not present when I made the remark; she admitted that she had not spoken to him in the Justice room, but the officer in her presence said, "When we were going out of the office she had a better opportunity, and pointed him out;" this passed at the second examination - the examination was not going on before the Magistrate when I observed to her that she had not spoken to him; I had seen her deposition reduced to writing.</p>
               <p>MR. LANE re-examined. When Mr. Harmer observed that Moore had not identified Ellis, Moore, in the most vicious manner, denied the assertion of Mr. Harmer - it is no doubt a mistake of Mr. Harmer's, that he made the observation certainly is true, and she in a quick, galarious way, denied it; I was obliged to say, "Matilda, don't speak so quick."</p>

            . I asked Moore, at the bar, if she could identify the prisoners - she said she was not certain, but she thought she knew one; I said, "Which one?" and she pointed to Ellis - I said, "Go back again to where I told you to stand before, and make yourself certain; I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170123"></xptr>not go out with her, but I saw her afterwards, and she said she was certain.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was this at the examination? A. No - there had not been an examination; they were before the Magistrate, but no depositions were taken - there were fourteen prisoners, and there were several charges made against them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hatter, and live at Williams-place, Union-street, St. Saviour's, Surrey—on Monday, the 6th of Oct., I and my friend Rosewarne went into a public-house and had some beer—the prisoner came in afterwards, and sat at another table—I know her by sight but not by name—after sitting there some time she left and came to the table where we sat, and wanted to direct her discourse to us—I put up my hand to her and told her she had better keep her own company—she began talking to us—we would not listen to her—all I said to her was to keep her own company—there was a knife lying on the table—my left hand was resting on the table, and so was Rosewarne's right hand—she caught up the knife and cut both my hand and Rosewarne's—my little finger was cut, and the next finger very slightly—she was sitting in front of us—she had had a little to drink—I did not consider her drunk—Rosewarne was not able to work—his right hand was cut—we were both cut by one movement of the knife—I looked at my finger and said, "Good heaven, she has nearly cut my finger off," and I went to the doctor—the prisoner came after me to the doctor's and said she would pay the doctor's expences—I said I did not want anything of that—I did not see her afterwards till she was taken by the policeman on the 14th of Oct.—it was on the Tuesday—I was before the Magistrate when she was examined—she said we had both offended her very much, that we gave her some gin, and took liberties with her, one of the liberties was so gross she was afraid to mention it—I do not know what she meant—I did not hear her say we had nearly got her clothes over her head—she might have said so—I was there all the time—I did not hear her say I had nearly got her clothes over her head—I am not the quickest person at hearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> They used me shockingly; they both took liberties with me; one used me very bad indeed; I had a knife in my hand cutting an apple for my little girl; I do not know how it happened; I said I would pay the doctor. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> What she says is quite false—there was no little girl with her—she had a little girl at first, four or five years old, but not then—I applied for a warrant next day.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 6th Oct. I went with Reseigh into the George public-house, Gravel-lane, Southwark, and sat inside the table—the prisoner was at another table, she came over and wanted to introduce her company on us—my friend said, "My good woman, we want to have nothing to do with</p>

               <p>you, keep your own company"—that knife laid on the table—she caught it up directly and cut both our hands, as they rested on the table—the fore finger of my right hand was cut—there was no wound on any other part of my hand—she did not make more than one cut—our hands were resting on the table, as we were in conversation together—I believe the prosecutor's hand was cut first—nothing was done or said to her more than I have stated—I think she was a little in liquor, not much—there were several people in the room, four or five I suppose—I did not know any of them—we went out to get our wounds dressed—I made no complaint till next day—I spoke to nobody in the room, nor did I complain to the landlord—I had never seen the prisoner before to my knowledge—next day we found out who she was—we applied to the landlord—he did not tell us—we found it out by inquiring of other persons—we went together next day to complain—Reseigh went to a surgeon to get his wound dressed, but I got some strapping and did mine up myself, having no money for a surgeon—he went to a surgeon and I went home—I made no inquiry about the pri<lb></lb>soner that night—this happened about the middle of the day—I was not in the house above an hour or so—we had two pints of beer and a quartern of gin—the gin was between three of us—the third was a person that Re<lb></lb>seigh knew—she was not there when this happened—she had gone—it was a woman, a stranger to me—she did not go in with us—she came in, it being a wet day, for shelter, to have half-a-pint of beer, and Reseigh gave her a drop of gin out of the quartern—she did not sit down—the prisoner had no gin to my knowledge—she had no drink to herself in that room.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I took the prisoner in charge on the 14th. of Oct. on a warrant—she said she knew what I wanted her for, it was for cutting two men in the hand—she said she had offered 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to make it up—I found her in Norfolk-street, Southwark-bridge-road, at her mother's—I have seen her several times before—I believe she is married.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she say anything to you about the men behaving ill to her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at the time I took her—I forgot to name that—I did not state it before the Magistrate—I was not asked the question—she said the men had behaved ill to her in taming her clothes up, or something of that—she said so as I was taking her to the station-house—I neglected to state that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why state what made against her, and suppress what made in her favour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not recollect it at the moment—she made the same statement before the Magistrate.</p>

I had an apple in my hand for my little girl; the eldest man put his hand down on the ground to pick something up, and took very indecent liberties with me; and his comrade hugged me round the neck; my little girl hallooed; they immediately got up, and their hands were both cut and bleeding; I followed them outside the door, and said I would pay the doctor for dressing their hands; they made use of some very bad expression to me.</p>

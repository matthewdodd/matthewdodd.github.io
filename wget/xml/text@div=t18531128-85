                  </hi>. I am single. I was living last month as cook to Jabez Jackson, of No. 5, Compton-terrace, Islington—on Monday, 14th Nov., I was the last person up; I secured the kitchen window with an iron bar, and the window fastening—I slept at the top of the house, there were two stories between—about three o'clock in the morning I was disturbed by a noise; I laid awake, listened, and heard some one trying to get from the back kitchen (there is a door on the staircase, which was fastened over night)—I called my master, who threw the window up, and sprung a rattle—I looked out and saw three men running out of our house up the area steps into the back yard; it was then, I think, about a quarter to 4 o'clock—they got over the wall, went down two or three gardens, and I could see them running over the walls—my master came down with me directly, and we found the kitchen window forced open, the wood work cut away, and they had got the bar out, so that anybody could get in—I have lived there four years—the house is in the parish of St. Mary, Islington.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 99). On the night between the 14th and 15th Nov., I was on duty in Compton-mews; and about 20 minutes before 4 o'clock, heard a noise in Mr. Jackson's garden, No. 5; I got over the wall, but did not see anybody—I heard somebody in the adjoining garden, rushing away from No. 5—I sprung my rattle, and went over the wall into the mews, and saw the prisoner Hawkins on the wall, three or four houses from Mr. Jackson's—he jumped over into the next garden; I followed him through several gardens, and he was taken by some one else—in the course of the pursuit I caught Foster in a garden behind the chapel, standing against the wall, about 130 yards from the premises—I took him into custody, and as I brought him away I saw Hawkins on the wall by my side, going back towards Mr. Jackson's—I took Foster into the mews,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185311280080"></xptr>
               <p>and then found Hawkins in the custody of another constable—I went back to Mr. Jackson's house, and saw a file picked up in the garden, I saw it fitted to the timber work where it seemed to have been used, and it fitted very well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not you find Foster in an open place, attached to the chapel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in an open place—there are no means of getting in without getting over a high wall—the door is kept locked and bolted—I got over several walls—the soil was not very soft, it is grass chiefly, and some gravel—there may be a few flower-beds—it was a light night—I heard a noise in the garden first, and immediately afterwards I heard a rattle spring—I was in the garden of No. 5 when I heard the rattle spring, and I saw nothing—I did not stop to look at Mr. Jackson springing his rattle—I got over from the mews into the gardens—the wall is about seven feet high—I did not get out into the mews again till I had caught Foster—the rattle continued sounding for some time—there were people looking out of their windows—the chapel is about twenty yards from the public way—I do not know that I ever saw Hawkins before.</p>

I was on duty—I heard a rattle spring when I was 700 or 800 yards from Compton-terrace—I came along from the New North-road, and saw Hawkins about fifty yards from Compton-terrace, running from Hyde's-place—I stopped him, he resisted, and I struck him with my truncheon, and secured him—he said, "I give myself up quietly, do not strike me again"—I took him to the back of the terrace, where he was identified—I examined Mr. Jackson's house—part of the woodwork of the kitchen window was cut away, the marks on which corresponded with this chisel and file—I found this candle in the back area, and this chisel in the back kitchen—I also found marks on the door leading from the kitchen to the staircase, as if it had been attempted to be forced—the back kitchen door and window were both open—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bar of the kitchen window—I found it on the kitchen floor, broken in two—it had been wrenched off.</p>

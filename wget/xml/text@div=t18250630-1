On the night of the 21st of March I went to bed about eleven o'clock, and was the last person up. Next morning, about half-past seven o'clock, I got up, and found the hinges broken off the small door of the hen house, which was fastened the night before - it is in the garden, at a little distance from the house, but is enclosed with it; the garden is surrounded by a wall on two sides, and a fence on the other. I missed twelve fowls and three ducks. On the morning of the 23d I found two of my fowls, dead, at Norris's, at Hoxton - I knew them directly; White had them: I have no doubt of their being mine. One was an old blue and white hen; the other a very dark cock. I am very positive of them.</p>

            . I am servant to Norris. On the 22d of March, about five o'clock in the morning, I came to my master's premises, to work, and saw Hill laying on some straw in the cart-shed - he told me he had been there since three o'clock, as his mother had locked him out; I told him to be off about his business: I then went and milked my cows, and in about an hour I went to put up the straw which he had pulled down, where he had been laying, and found two fowls - I carried them into the stable, to the carters, and while we were looking at them the prisoner came back, and said,</p>
               <p>"Those two fowls belong to me;" he saw them in my hand: I gave them into his hand; he said,</p>
               <p>"No, you may keep them, for I have twelve or fourteen more in my mother's privy." I took them into my master's house, and about ten o'clock at night I heard of this robbery - Sergeant came to me next morning, and owned them; the hen was dark, and the other a very light one; he left them with me to see if I could find the prisoner - I had known him for six months; he was not found for two months: I went to his mother's about an hour after he went away - I got over a wall, and saw several fowls and three ducks in his mother's privy - there might be twelve or thirteen; I do not know what became of them.</p>

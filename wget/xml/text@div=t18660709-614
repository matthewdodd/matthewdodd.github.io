                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Dorling, of 422, Euston Road—my husband has lived there for sixteen years and I thirteen years—we keep an oyster shop—early in November last the prisoner Mitchell called, and asked if I would be kind enough to oblige him by taking in a few letters for his father-in-law, Mr. Crofts, who had come up from the country—I said, "Yes"—he said he would pay me half-a-crown a week for my trouble—after that some letters came addressed, "T. W. Crofts, 422, Euston Road"—next day Ambrose came and asked for letters for Mr. Crofts—I gave them to him—letters arrived nearly every day for three weeks or a month, sometimes two a day, and sometimes three—Ambrose gene<lb></lb>rally came for them—I knew him by the name of Lisson—Mitchell used to be with him, but waited outside—Mitchell never came alone to fetch letters—my husband gave the letters sometimes—Ambrose used to wear a moustache—we keep the whole of the premises—they are very small—there is no London Imperial Advance Company carrying on business there, or any office, or anything of the kind—I never heard of such A company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Mitchell. Q.</hi> I believe you saw Mr. Crofts and made arrangements with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but you brought him with you, and said he was your father-in-law—I never saw his two sons—they did not call.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say Mitchell came first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and the next time he brought Crofts—the first time that the letters came Mitchell came and brought Ambrose, and asked me to be kind enough and give them to Ambrose—I had seen Mitchell before—he may have come into my shop before for years on and off as a customer—I have seen Mitchell outside on several occasions when Ambrose has called for letters, but have not seen Ambrose deliver them to Mitchell—Ambrose did not open them inside—he went out as if to deliver them to Mitchell—he used to come every morning—I referred him to my husband when the arrange<lb></lb>ment was made, but he did not see my husband till after the letters came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the husband of the last witness—I know the prisoners—I saw them both about November and December, and my wife told me of the arrangement she had made—Mitchell or Ambrose came next morning for letters addressed, "T. W. Crofts"—he called for about a month or three weeks almost every morning—Mitchell did not come with him except once, when he said I was to give the letters to <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, that they were for his father-in-law, and that it was all right—Dick paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for taking in the letters—I know him by no other name—I do not know Mr. Crofts—after I had been taking in these letters for some time I received a communication from the police, in consequence of which I spoke to <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, and said that a policeman named Mason from Albany Street had been there, and that I should not receive any more letters—Ambrose said, "It is all right; I will fetch Mr. Crofts"—he said it was merely an advertise<lb></lb>ment—he also said, "Will you allow me to continue a little longer, as we cannot alter our advertisement for a few days?"—I agreed to take the letters in for a few days longer—I saw Ambrose after that, and said, "The police have come, and your game is up"—he said, "Oh! no; it is quite right; I will go and fetch Mr. Crofts"—that was the last time I saw him—there is no "London Imperial Loan, Credit, and Advance Company" carried on at my house.</p>

Crofts</hi>, 422, <hi rend="italic">Euston Road, London</hi>)—Being in want of money, I wrote an answer to that advertisement at the latter end of November (<hi rend="italic">W. T. Kirby here deposed to serving a notice to produce this letter on both the prisoner and on Ambrose's solicitor</hi>)—I wrote, "Sir,—I want you to be so good as to send me word how much interest you require me to pay, and let me know what you mean by a reference"—I addressed it, "T. W. Crofts, 422, Euston Road, London," and received this answer, "December 7, 1865. Yours is to hand, with enclosure, and immediately I hear from your reference the same shall have attention and the matter as speedily arranged as pos<lb></lb>sible. T. W. Crofts."—after that I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">This was dated December</hi> 9, 1865, 422, <hi rend="italic">Euston Road, from T. W. Crofts to W. T.

            's regiment. I have been lately discharged on coming home from America. We landed at Portsmouth. I came home in the Hallifax. I think I came to London on the 25th of March. I was robbed on the 26th. It was late on Thursday night when we came in; we enquired where we could have quarters; we were directed to a Mr. Kennedy's, the sign of the Angel, in Chapel-street, Westminster. We laid down our knapsacks, and drank pretty heartily.</p>
               <p>How many comrades had you with you? - Six or seven. We found the prisoner at Kennedy's; he offered us his bed for that night; he lodged in Kennedy's house. I said we were obliged to him, and three of us slept in his bed that night. The next day we went to the War-Office to get our billets to go to Chelsea, and then returned to Mr. Kennedy's for our package. I took the prisoner to be a friend; he pretended to be a countryman of mine; he is a soldier; he went with me, and some of my comrades, to Chelsea. The day was pretty well on when we left Mr. Kennedy's. When we came to Chelsea, and I had got my billet, he asked me to take a walk to pass away the time; we went to the sign of the Square and Compass, and had four pots of beer; we staid there two hours or more; he had had no dinner. I paid for a dinner for him. I then took my pocket out, and changed a dollar. I had ten dollars and an half, four pisteroons, and four pieces of money they call 7 d 1/2 pieces, and some small money; it was all in my pocket-book in my breast pocket. I changed a dollar with him at that house; then we walked to another house; he asked me to have a bottle of beer, and took me into a house that I thought not good; it was then, I think, between four and five o'clock. I asked him then to go with me to Mr. Kennedy's; I wanted to spend two pots of beer at his house, as he had been kind to me, and to return him thanks, because he had charged nothing for my eating. I desired him to come out of the house where we were; he would not; upon which I left him, and went to Mr. Kennedy's by myself, and he came in afterwards; we drank two pots of beer together, and then Mr. Kennedy desired him to see me home, and he went with me.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - I cannot say, I was pretty much in liquor; he went out with me, and as we were going along, he took me out of the road, near the <placeName id="t17790404-9-crimeloc53">Queen's gardens</placeName>

I went to the serjeant of the queen's guard, and asked the favour of a man to go home with me.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the serjeant of the guard that you had been robbed? - I said not a word of it till I got home.</p>
               <p>When did you miss the book? - Immediately as he took it. As he turned away, I desired him to give me the pocket-book; he made me no answer. I knew I was not in a condition to follow him; and thought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040015"></xptr> if I did, he might use me worse. I kept it as still as I could, as I knew him, left he should get away from the place. I went to Mr. Kennedy's, in the morning, and found him there; I told Mr. Kennedy of it, and he charged him with it; he went up into his lodging and brought down the pocket-book.</p>

They had some beer and victuals after their march. The prisoner was in the house; he got into their company. Ward and he pretended to be countrymen, and were very intimate.

I went up and told him they were below, and said he had taken some money and a pocketbook from Ward; he said he had not; I bid him come down and speak to them; he did, and while they were in the passage talking together, it was noised among the people in the house, and some of them said they had seen Close with a pocket-book that m orning, and if I searched, I might perhaps find it; I went up and found a pocketbook in the closet; I showed it to Ward, and he said it was his book.

               <p>Q. Do you know in whose apartments you found it? - A. The prisoners; they cohabited together two or three years; they were in the room at the time I went to execute the search-warrant; I came to a box, and asked whose it was, the prisoner Whittick said, it is mine; I asked whose cloaths they were in the box, he said, they are mine; I asked whose shirt it was, he said, it is mine; there was a coat, waistcoat and breeches, his wearing apparel, in the box, this shirt was along with them; I took the shirt out and shewed the prosecutrix; she said, it was her property; I asked Bennet where the duplicate of the gown was, and she told me it was under the leas of the cardtable, between the green baize, which I took, (produces it;) there were three or four more duplicates with it; I went there and found it; I kept the duplicate, I have it now.</p>

             sworn. - I keep the Coal-hole in the Strand: Mary Southall lodged at my house; the prisoner Whittick was at my house on the 25th, of January, in the evening, at the club; the clubroom has a small room detached off, where there is a large chest; he was there sometime among the rest of his acquaintance and companions.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all members of a club at your house? - A. Yes; he stopped there about an hour and a half; they went away two or three at a time: On Wednesday morning, the prosecutrix, who kept her things unlocked in that chest, went to the chest, and missed them; on the lid of this large chest I put a bedstead, and a mahogany side-board upon that, for the purpose of securing the property, because I had no lock on the chest; it must be a strong arm to list the lid up, and take away the things; after the company was gone, the prosecutrix slept in that small room that night: On Tuesday morning, the door was locked, and kept locked the whole of that day; on Tuesday night she slept there; on Wednesday morning she missed these things, and made enquiry of the pawnbrokers; I was present when she found it at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the pawnbroker's man here? - A. Yes; Bennet told the Magistrate at Bow-street she had the gown and shirt given to her by a man at the top of Fountain-court; the shirt Whittick claimed as his, at their lodgings in Marygold-court, I was present.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe you invited this man to come to your club that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not give him some tickets to distribute? - A. I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not give him tickets to distribute, and bring persons to your club? - A. I am not certain; I think I did not for that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not frequently? - A. No; I have never seen him above three or four times at furthest.</p>
               <p>Q. You had given him tickets to distribute? - A. Yes; I did it when I was a little acquainted with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear you did not give him tickets that night? - A. I did not that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it? - A. I don't think I did; I cannot be positive.</p>

               <p>Q. Relate what you heard? - A. she was washing some small things for her family; you are d-d busy you bl-d b-h, were the first words I heard; she said, there are two nice cauliflowers, my dear, shall I boil them for dinner; he made answer, what do you think, you bl-d whore; upon which a violent noise ensued of blows, I heard no one scream out but the eldest daughter, who cried out you have killed her, you have killed her; I thought she meant the second daughter, because he has vowed he would take her life; I was frightened, went down stairs, and found it was his wife, when I saw the blood on her face, and that it had flew as far as the step outside the door; the prisoner was in the house, and said he would have dinner dressed by twelve o'clock, he repeated it I don't know how many times; and she said I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after the blow? - A. Yes; he then went away, and came back exactly at twelve o'clock; I durst not go in while he was gone fearing he should come, but I talked to her through the window; when he returned, he swore he would cut her bl-y liver and tongue out, and would not rest till he had murdered her and the children. I met her father, and told him not to go in, for that the prisoner would kill him, as he had often threatened. I saw the deceased afterwards brought out like a dead woman, immediately as her father and others went in; she could not speak or do any thing, her face was so dreadfully cut; she was held up in a chair, and some time after she came to herself, and said she had got her death blow from her husband: her nose was driven on one side upon her face by a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. From all that you had an opportunity of observing, and from what she said, did she consider herself in a dying state? - A. Yes; from the 31st of July, she always said she should die, for that she had received her death blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her often? - A. Every day, and many times in the day: this was the way she stood,(putting her hands on the left side and stomach), she said, I am so hurt, and crushed inside, that I cannot live, he kicked me for with his shoe; that he stamped on her stomach in the passage, on the 31st of July, and knocked her down on this candlestick,(producing a flat japanned candlestick), which broke under her body in the fall, and run up her private parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether she said any thing else? - A. No; she always said she should not live; that is all I particularly recollect.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are the father of this unfortunate woman? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her on the 2d of August? - A. Yes; I had been to market, and was going to call on my daughter to leave her what little portion I could afford, and when I got within ten yards of the door, somebody said, run, run, for the villain is murdering your daughter; I went in, in a great hurry, and saw her on the floor, and he laying down on her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the house beside? - A. There was one of the children, the other run out for a constable; Mary-Ann was in the room, who is near twelve years of age. I cannot tell whether the prisoner knelt on the floor or on his wife, but I pulled him up with all my strength.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she able to stir, or call out? - A. I cannot tell for my confusion; I pulled her up in a hurry into the passage, some men pulled him from her; I took her in my arms, and she dropped down on the floor like a log of wood.</p>
               <p>Q. After you got him from her, did you see him do any thing to her? - A. He punched at her with his foot and knee, as they dragged him from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see what part of her body he punched? - A. No, I was in too much confusion; in about ten or fifteen minutes she came to herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him about it? - A. I said he had finished the job he had often promised to do; and he said, I'll finish your job too; I have heard him say many times, he never would rest satisfied till he had murdered her and me too.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that what you meant, when you said, now you have finished the job you have often promised to do? - A. Yes; and he said he would finish me too.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the fight of your daughter that he said it? - A. Yes; but she was insensible. They had him out at the door, and it was all confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see your daughter from time to time after this? - A. Yes; every day till the day she died.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe she thought herself a dying woman? - A. Most certainly she did; when they took her out of the room into the street, there was a mob of about fifty people; she was like a corpse for some time. The prisoner came back again (for they had let him go), he came back again in half an hour; and when the alarm was made that he was coming, I was ready to lay hold of him; he came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140065"></xptr>in, and said, he would have my heart's blood, in the hearing of Mrs. Myers, upon which I collared him, and threw him down.</p>

               <p>Q. Did your daughter say any thing respecting what she imagined would be the consequence of the blows she had received? - A. She said all along she was killed; but she wished me to get him liberated to save my life, which I did. She died on the 17th of August; on the 15th I went to see her, when she said - Oh father, why did you not come yesterday, for I have got my death blow, the villain has been and executed his work; I have prayed for death many times under my calamities, and should have died in peace then, but I can never die in peace now, since I have prevailed on you to liberate that villain. - She then put her hand on her stomach, and said, he had been on Saturday night, and finished the job. The night before he was liberated he swore he would not go near her, but he went on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. After I was liberated, did I not send home a pound note, and some oysters, to my wife? - A. You promised, if you were liberated, to send a two pound note; you wrote her a letter, saying, if she would endeavour to liberate you, you would send her a two pound note, and would not come near her; and if she did not chuse to consent to that, you had plenty of people to bail you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sent my daughter back to know if my wife would have a glass of wine, she said she should like a glass of Lisbon; I sent for a bottle, and went home and kissed my wife, and took leave of her, as I was going away.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he send her wine, and call upon her afterwards and kiss her? - A. He sent a twenty shilling note, and promised not to come there at all.</p>

             sworn. - I live at the corner of Hull's-place: On the 2d of August I heard a great noise, between one and two o'clock; I went down the place, and saw the deceased sitting in a chair opposite her house, and a vast number of people round about; she was leaning on her eldest daughter's shoulder, not being able to support herself; her daughter said to her, here is Mrs. Graham; upon which she looked upon me with a very deadly look, took me by the hand, and said, - Oh Mrs. Graham, Mrs. Graham, fourteen years, more or less, I have borne this usage, but he has now given me my death blow; could you see from my anklebone to my private parts, your heart would bleed for me. - I bid her cheer up, and said she would get better; she said, no, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing about her nose? - A. I saw the bridge of her nose flatted to her face, and a woeful black eye on the right-side. I asked her if she would take any kind of refreshment; she said, her inside was so bad with his kicks and bruises that she could not; she said, he had kicked her so much about the kidnies, that she rather thought they had departed from their places, by the feel she had; she said he had many times threatened, but now he had finished the job, and given her a death blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her from day to day afterwards? - A. No, not till the day she died; about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her body? - A. Yes; I was the only person who proposed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the surgeon there? - A. No; I went to see her, and seeing the black eye still remain it hurt me; I returned home, and after weeping a little, I went back, and pulled the sheet down that covered the body: the first thing I saw was the black eye, and the nose in the same fituation I saw it the first day; and her body was just as she described it, for from her ankle-bone to her privates, was as black as my cloak; and the right-side of her privates was very much swelled, just as she had described.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to judge from whence it arose? - A. Apparently by a kick; On the right-side of her bottom was the mark of another kick apparently; there were little marks about her stomach, chest, and sides, but they were small marks.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long had you know her? - A. Ever since she had lived in the neighbourhood; about twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in the habit of seeing them together? - A. No, never; she was a very close woman, and very careful of being at home with her family.</p>

I took hold of him, and the old gentleman and others assisting, we forced him out of the place.</p>

My father went away but returned again, and took hold of my grand-father, saying, I'll have your heart's blood before I sleep; when the neighbours came in a second time, and took him off, as my grand-father had collared him to prevent his getting a knife; and the neighbours went to get a warrant for him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see how the state of the body was from the ankle to the groin? - A. I did not examine the lower extremities at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open and examine the chest? - A. Yes; the intestines appeared to be perfectly found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the kidnies? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Or the spleen? - A. The spleen was found.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the inside of the chest? - A. In a very diseased state.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the membrane that lines the inside of the chest? - A. In a very inflamed state, and the lungs adhering to it.</p>
               <p>Q. To what might the inflammation of the membrane of the chest be attributed? - A. It might be attributed to external violence, or cold will bring it on.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the lungs diseased? - A. They were very much ulcerated.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a disorder, perhaps, independent of violence? - A. Yes; and had existed for some time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the state of the heart? - A. Very diseased, both in its external appearance, and internal structure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it enlarged? - A. Yes, very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Would external violence produce that effect? - A. The appearance might, but the size would not be encreased to the extent that was.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it have been aggravated by external violence and alarm, in consequence of that violance? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the alarm a person might undergo, on being attacked by a person stronger than themselves, occasion an aggravation of those symptoms? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. To what do you attribute the death of the de<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140067"></xptr>ceased? - A. The immediate cause of her death, I attribute to the disease of the lungs; but I think it was accelerated by the ill usage, I hear, her husband had given her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe the deceased would have met her death so early, were it not from the violence used, attributed to her husband? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you know the deceased? - A. I saw her once before, as I was accidentally passing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she had any ailment of any kind? - A. Only from what I heard, that she had an asthma, and I could see that was the immediate cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Would an asthma give that appearance to the lungs in the state you found them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Would an asthma have any effect on the enlargement of the heart? - A. No, I don't apprehend it would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see, from your inspection of the body, any particular blow that you suppose accelerated the death? - A. No; what bruises there were, appeared to be dying away.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot six on any particular blow, or bruise, that you apprehend was the cause of her death? - A. No, I cannot.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you practice physic and surgery on your own account? - A. Yes, and have for near eight years.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the description of the appearance of the unfortunate woman's lungs, and the injuries she received? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the appearance of the lungs, which has been described, might be produced by external violence? - A. Yes; the time the blows stated to be given, being the 2d of August, and the death of the woman happening fifteen days afterwards, is about the period that the termination of inflammation would happen, arising from external bruises, and would be supposed to produce death. When a person does not die during the inflammatory state, there happens, what is called, suppuration, which, by producing so great an injury to the lungs incompatible with life, of course terminates fatally. When inflammation does not produce death during the inflammatory state, the disease will go on to suppuration, and the state of the lungs then can hardly be distinguished from the state of the lunges of a person who died of an asthma; with regard to the enlargement of the heart, I have opened the bodies of persons who have died of other diseases, and have found some very much enlarged, and some diminished, where persons have never complained of desection in the part.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the lungs had been in a reduced state previous to external violence, would not that external violence expedite the death? - A. Most assuredly; but admitting the person to labour under an asthma, the very alarm would accelerate the death; and I don't know whether without any external violence at all, it might not accelerate the death.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. From what you have heard, can it be distinctly said, the state of the lungs did not proceed from the symptoms of the disease, or that it necessarily proceeded from the violence? - A. I cannot say that; I can only say, whatever might be the state of the lungs, death must have been accelerated.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased? - A. Yes; I don't remember the day, but I think it was the day after she received the ill-usage; my house is about a quarter of a mile from her's; she came in with her father, and desired to be let blood; she complained of a pain in the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine her person at all? - A. I did not; I felt her pulse, and told her she seemed low and week, and desired my man to take away a small quantity of blood; I saw her once after, and my man saw her twice, but he is not here; when I saw her the second time, she was sitting upon a sofa, or chair, and appeared weak; she said her husband had ill-treated her, and that he had frequently done the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any medical man attend her? - A. Her father came down to us the day before she died, and my young man went to her; he said that she was very bad, and frequently expectorated that day, but next day it stopped, and she died.</p>
               <p>A written defence was put in by the prisoner, and read as follows:</p>
               <p>"To the Right Honourable the Lord-Mayor, and the Honourable Judges of the Sessions.</p>
               <p>"The petition of Micheal Carney, the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>"Most humbly sheweth - That your petitioner standing indicted for the wilful murder of his wife, and being deprived of the means of seeing Counsel, by the prosecutor (petitioner's father-in-law) having purloined and embezzled his property fince his confinement, has thus ventured to submit his case for your Lordship's consideration, with a full hope of justice being done him. That petitioner is a journeyman soap-maker, and upon his return home from employment in the country in August last, to pay his rent, a trifling dispute had arisen between him and his wife, respecting her not having his dinner ready in due time, to meet his master by appointment, which had brought on some blows on both sides; and the affray having come to the prosecutor's knowledge, he, with three or four men, came to petitioner's house, and demanded entrance, which being granted, petitioner was struck down, his cloaths rent, and he was carried to prison for an assault on his wife, where, after remaining sometime, the prosecutor and petitioner's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140068"></xptr>daughter came to him, and caused the warrant to be discharged, on giving them seven shillings, whereupon the petitioner went to his family, and reconciled all differences, after giving them some pecumary assistance. That soon after petitioner set off for his employment in the country, in friendship with them. That soon after he arrived there, the Excise caused a feizure to be made on his master's effects; and least the offence attached to petitioner, he abandoned the premises, and retired to a public-house in the neighbourhood, and was apprehended soon after, and brought to the public-office, Worship street, for the offence with which he is now charged. That a body of witnesses appeared against him:

             deposed that petitioner knocked his wife down; she heard the fall, but did not see the blow; she saw a flat candlestick in or near the deceased's body. On her second examination said, she deceased told her she had fallen on it. Mrs. Turnbull heard a noise only. The prosecutor (deceased's father) saw the abuse, but said, she had a consumption for twenty years. Dr. Smith's assistant, who attended the deceased, said, she spit no blood, but spit phlegm and corruption; heard nothing said of the candlestick, or disrespectful of petitioner by his wife. A number of low prejudiced witnesses will appear. Surgeon

            , who opened the body, saw no marks of violence to cause death; her lungs were quite decayed and ulcerated, and appeared to have been of long standing. Dr. Smith deposed, that no violence caused her immediate death; it might perhaps, in some manner, hasten her death; her heart was a little drawn, occasioned by a disturbed mind; blows could not have caused ulcers on the lungs, without a force on her lungs; a small black spot, skin deep, appeared on her side; she died of a natural consumption, of many years standing.</p>
               <p>"Such were the examinations before the Magistrate. Your petitioner further states to your Lordships, that the prosecutor gave out that petitioner absconded from justice in the country, and abused his wife after the warrant had been discharged: petitioner had no opportunity to abuse her, and his elopement was from a fear of being taken by the Excise, and he heard nothing of his wife's death till he was apprehended. That he was married to his wife fourteen years, by whom he had several children, five of whom are now living under the age of twelve years, whose dependence for support and maintenance rests on your petitioner, who always paid due attention to his family, and whose utter destruction he could not premeditate. The unhappy affair originated in a mere trisle, without any wicked intent, whatever may be given in evidence, before your Lordships, against their</p>

            . I live at No. 10, Tottenham-mews, Middlesex Hospital. On the 26th of January I was fetched to assist the prisoner's mother, who lives in the mews - I went to her room - she said the prisoner was concealed in the house, with intent to rob her, and she could not get rid of him - she wanted an officer, and he wanted one also. I went to Manning, who came, and his mother gave him in charge, for ill-usage, and threatening to murder her. I did not go up stairs with Manning.</p>

            . I went to the mother's house, by Lewis's desire - I found the mother in the mews; she took me up to her room - the prisoner stood in one corner of the room, armed with a knife, which I produce, (a small table knife) and a poker - his mother said, "I am afraid of that lad; I wish to have him removed;" I said, "My lad, what are you going to ill-use your mother in this kind of way for?" he said, "Are you an officer?" I said, "I am;" - he immediately up with the poker, and said, "D - n your eyes, stand away," and struck at my head - I held my arm up, which caught the blow, and it almost broke the bone. I then left the room, and sent Lewis to the watch-house for assistance. Sheppard came, and Richardson, another street-keeper. I waited down stairs till they came, then went up with them, and found him still in the room, armed with the poker and knife. Richardson said, "My lad, why do you ill-use a person in this way? do you know the consequence of it? you will be transported if you go on in this kind of way;" "That is what I want," said he - "Oh! you poor foolish boy," said Richardson, "take the advice of a father of children - you don't know the hardships of it" - he made no answer. Richardson pressed him to give up the weapons, and he gave up the poker at last to his sister, but still kept the knife in his hand. Richardson asked him for the knife - he made no answer that I heard - he held it in his right hand; Richardson came very near, made a spring upon him, and caught him by the left hand - then Sheppard ran to his assistance, and as he came to his left side the prisoner made a dart back wards with his hand, and stabbed Sheppard in the side. He had told me before I went for assistance that he would be hung for somebody that day. He did not appear at all in liquor. I know nothing of him myself.</p>

            . I am house-surgeon at Middlesex Hospital. On the 26th of January I saw the prosecutor; he had a wound on the left side of the chest: it appeared a clean cut wound, as if done with a sharp instrument - it was about 1-12th of an inch deep; it struck on a rib, which prevented its going further. I should not call it a grevious bodily wound. If it had not been stopped by the rib, it would, most likely, have penetrated the lungs. I cannot say whether it was done with a pointed instrument. The prosecutor was ill about a fortnight, but never very bad, and in no danger. There is very little flesh about that part of the body.</p>
               <p>MR. WONTNER, (keeper of Newgate.) I have had some little conversation with the prisoner since he has been in my custody, which is since the 6th of January - I have seen him several times, and consider him weak in his intellect.</p>

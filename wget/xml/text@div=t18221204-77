            . I live at Attfield, Broadoak. On the 29th of November I came to town, and about half-past five o'clock in the morning, my cart stood in <placeName id="t18221204-77-crimeloc418">Bell-yard, Warwick-lane</placeName>

I saw it safe five minutes before it was taken, and the prisoner in the yard; he was employed to carry meat about the market. I was unpacking my goods in the yard, and missed it; and on Wednesday last I went with the officer and took the prisoner in his master's yard, in Chick-lane, and told him it was for stealing a coat, he said he had nothing on his arm but a cloth.</p>

            . I am salesman to Messrs. Challis and Company, Newgate Market, and have known the prisoner some time. Yesterday week, between five and six o'clock, I met him in Stationer's-court with a rough great-coat on his arm; I spoke to him and went on. I am sure he had a coat. As soon as I went to work, I met Mr. Mumford enquiring after his coat, I told him I had met a person with one, and afterwards told him who it was, and described the coat to him. I saw it after the prisoner was taken; it appeared like the one I saw him with; he is a slaughterman, and was in his working dress at the time.</p>

            . I am collector of the City tolls. On Friday morning, the 29th of November, between five and six o'clock, I stood at the bottom of Paternoster-row, and saw a man with a coat on his arm coming from the market. I looked at him, and suspected him; he stood still looking about in Warwick-lane, near Amen-corner. I had seen him two or three times before, and am certain he is the man. I left him, and went on Ludgate-hill. Jackson afterwards asked me about it, and at first I denied having seen him, not wishing to be in trouble about it, but afterwards said he was the man.</p>

            . I am a beadle. I went down Chick-lane, with Mumford, and apprehended the prisoner, and afterwards found the coat at a house in Black Boy-alley, Chick-lane. A young woman who is not here gave it me. I believe the prisoner did not live there.</p>

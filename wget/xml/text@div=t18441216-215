                  </hi>. I live as porter at No. 34, Abchurch-lane. It is a house of business, in which several gentlemen have offices—on Saturday evening, the 14th of Dec., about a quarter to five o'clock, I was going up­ stairs from the bottom of the house, and heard a noise proceeding from the third floor back-room, and upwards to the attic—I proceeded up to the third floor, and looked into the bedroom, which is occupied by myself, my wife, and family—(we live in the kitchen, on the second floor)—I then heard a rustling noise, as if some one was making a quick retreat into the attic, and' on opening the attic door I found the prisoner there—before I spoke, she said, "It is me, sir"—I had never seen her before—I asked how she came there, or what brought her there—she said she came a few, or three miles west—I interrogated her a long time, but could get no in<lb></lb>formation formation from her—I found in the attic three linen sheets, one pillow<lb></lb>case, a table-cloth, three gowns, and a child's diaper pinafore, which were my property, bundled up together in a wrapper belonging to the prisoner—they had been taken from my bedroom—the house belongs to Mr. James Bruce, Buxton, and Co.—there are three or four partners—they transact business there—one other gentleman occupies one room on the first floor—all the upper part is private, and is occupied by myself—a clerk sleeps in the house—I am there as the servant of Mr. Bruce—he pays me—Mr. Buxton, one of the firm, put me into the house—I am keeping the house for them—the room in which this property was found is occupied by me as a bedroom—the door of my bedroom is gene<lb></lb>rally left on the latch.</p>

I was fetched by Reis, who said there was a female in his house—I proceeded there with him, and found the prisoner in the attic with this bundle of clothes—I took her into custody—I found a quantity of duplicates about her, all relating to wearing apparel.</p>

On the 21st of May, the prisoner came in; this spoon was on the kitchen table, in the vegetable dish; between one and two o'clock he came into the kitchen to light his pipe;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030038"></xptr>he stood there for ten minutes. I missed the spoon about half an hour after - he was then gone. One Dudley had come into the kitchen at the same time, but he did not leave the house. I immediately went to the prisoner's house; he was not at home; he came in about an hour and a half, and asked what I wanted him for. I said it was about the spoon; he made no answer, but went to the bar to my mistress's sister, and afterwards brought the spoon back to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LAW. Q. He was constantly at the house - A. Yes. I do not know what he said to my mistress's sister when he brought it back, but before he said he knew nothing of it. He was apprehended next morning when he came to the house. I had urged him to return it, if he had it, and said if he had pawned it I would redeem it; he said he had made enquiry about it, and in about twenty minutes he came and said,</p>

               <p>"Mary, will you stand my friend?" - he said it was pawned for 7 s., and I advanced him 7 s. 6 d. to get it.</p>

I went out, about eight o'clock in the evening, of the 11th of August, to take my work home - I left no person in my house. As I went out I saw the prisoner standing near my door, and told her, if she saw my husband come home, to tell him I was gone home with my work. I returned in about half an hour; the prisoner was still standing at the same place - I found my door had been opened with a false key, but did not miss any thing that night; next morning I missed a pair of trousers, which I had left in my room, when I went out the night before, and a cap. I saw her that morning, about nine o'clock, and asked her what she had done with the trousers and cap, which she took from my room. She at first said, she had not seen them; and then said, she had sold them. I said, if she would tell me where she sold them, I would not hurt her; she then said she had pawned them. I went with her to one pawnbroker's - but she said they were not there, they were over Westminster-bridge.</p>

On 8th Oct., about half past 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I went to the prisoner's house, at No. 52, Mor<lb></lb>tmer<lb></lb>stree, Marylebone—I saw him—I said to him, "Your name is Faulk<lb></lb>ner"—he nodded, and I then said I wished to speak with him in private—(he keeps a jeweller's shop)—I passed round the counter, and handed him my card, and at the same time I handed him a bill with the particulars of the property stolen from Mr. Willis's, of Clerkenwell-green—this is the bill—I said, "I must have this property"—he said, "I have no prpperty"—I said, a I have the best information that you have got it"—he hesitate, and trembled very much; and said, "I have got it I hope I shan't get into trouble"—he then produced a drawer, there were some stones in it, and he said, "That is all I have"—Mr. Willis then came in, and he said, "They are not half"—I do not remember that the prisoner said anything in answer to that—I said to him, "You must consider yourself in my custody"—wife went up stairs immediately, and he followed her, and I followed also—when up stairs, he said to his wife, "Give me that brown paper parcel that I gave you lust night"—she took a paper parcel from the cupboard, and handed it to him—I took it—this is It—it contains coral—I took him to the station—he asked me to shut up his shop before I left, and I did so—I saw him at the station—I went to the cell to him—I told him I had closed his shop, as he wished me—he then made a statement to me, which I took down in writing—I did not make him any promise or threat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, in Bed Lion-yard, Clerkenwell.

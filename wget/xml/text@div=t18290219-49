            . I am a patrol. On the night of the 17th of January, I and Stringer met Cooper with a bag under him arm; I asked what he had got - he said some feathers which he had got from Mrs. Wilson's, at Stamford-hill; he was about three-quarters of a mile from her house - he said his wife lived cook there, and she gave him the feathers to take to his lodgings; I took him back - I found Dotkin there and Mrs. Wilson; Dotkin said the bag was her mistress', but the feathers her mother had given her - she then left the house, and went, as I understood, to her father's; the next day I and Stringer went and found her there - a bed had been cut open, and sewed up again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe Mrs. Wilson said she did not wish her to be taken, but she herself would be answerable for her appearance? A. She did not positively say that, but she said she had no doubt of her appearance; Dotkin at once said the bolster was her mistress'.</p>
               <p>MRS. WILSON. I told the officer I did not wish the young woman to be taken, but would be answerable for her appearance - I told him to that full extent.</p>

            . I am in the service of the prosecutrix. Cooper used to come to see Dotkin - she told me her mistress had said that Cooper ought not to come; it was two or three weeks before this happened: on the night of the 17th of January, a bed had been opened, but I do not know how long, or whether any feathers had been taken from it - I had seen it before, but I do not know whether it was as full as it had been; it had been sewn up again - we used always to sleep on it, but on the Friday night we slept in another room; it was the under bed - I saw Dotkin's motherat my mistress' several times; she was there that Friday night, and they were talking about gowns and things, and had a parcel under her cloak, which appeared to me like a gown; I should not have missed any feathers from the bed, if the officers had not - Dotkin came to me in the kitchen, and I told her I was frightened to see the officers come in; she did not say any thing to me that night about what I was to say or was not to say - I mean to swear that; I am still in Mrs. Wilson's service.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the bed ever searched for feathers, while you were there? A. No. I had been there three months; I heard Dotkin ask her mother to send her some feathers two or three weeks before, and she promised to send her some to make a pillow; I am on good terms with my mistress; if I had seen this bed after the charge, I could not have perceived that any feathers had been taken out of it.</p>
               <p>MRS. WILSON re-examined. Q. What sort of a bed was this? A. It was a common feather bed. I have not a doubt but that feathers had been taken out of it - I think it was quite obvious to any body; I do not know what quantity had been taken out - Dotkin said she intended to return the bolster-case; it being vacation time, we had changed the beds about, to keep them aired - I do not think Piggott slept on that bed again till the young ladies returned, but she had slept on it the night before; I do not know that the feathers are mine.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS called -- DOTKIN. I am the prisoner Dotkin's mother; I had seen her about three weeks before this robbery, and taken tea with her; Piggott heard her ask me for some feathers; I told her I had made use of the feathers that were her's, but I would give her some others, and I took her some in a large coarse apron - I took the apron home and washed it; I could not say that these are the same feathers, but they look a great deal like those I took out of my bolster. <rs id="t18290219-49-verdict265" type="verdictDescription">

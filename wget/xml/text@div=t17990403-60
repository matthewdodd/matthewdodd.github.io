               <p>Q. Where was Messrs. Alder and Ellis's house? - A. In Abchurch-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Mind and tell us the truth - do you know any thing about any indigo? - A. The Monday after the 5th of November was the first that I took; I took three pounds, two pounds of East-India, and one pound of Manilla.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not take it with the consent of your masters? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You stole it? - A. Yes; I took it home to my house, and Hughes sent his little boy to me; I had seen old Hughes before, and he saw something blue about me, and asked me if I did not deal in indigo; I told him, yes; he asked if it was not a very valuable article; I told him it was of different prices; I was about buying a dog of him for half-a-guinea; he told me, if it was not convenient for me to pay for the dog, he would take three pounds of indigo.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him where you worked? - A. He knew I worked at the indigo warehouses; I am sure his son knew it; Hughes sent his son for the indigo before I had time to bring it to him.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not mean the son who is the defendant? - A. A little boy about fourteen. The next day the youngest defendant came, and told me, if I could get some more indigo, he could dispose of it; I told him I would, and the next day I got ten pounds from my master's warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did young Hughes at that time know in whose warehouse you worked? - A. Afterwards he did; he gave me three shillings a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it worth? - A. Some of it was worth twelve shillings a pound, and the rest five shillings. I took it to him that night, and was to call the next day for the money; I saw the father and the son both in the shop; the son put the indigo into a cupboard on the left side facing the door; I went the next night and got thirty shillings for the ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I submit to your Lordship, they must confine themselves to one of the two transactions.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030044"></xptr>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you remember any thing about any being carried away in a box? - A. They were in paper parcels; the father paid me for them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with the prisoners during the last Session, or since the last Sessions? - A. The son spoke to me in the yard, and begged I would be as favourable as possible; he said nothing more, and I turned away.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were apprehended, did you ever write to the Hughes's? - A. Yes; I told them I was accused with it; the son took me down into the hall, and told me never to confess it, as no person knew it but my wife, and she could be no evidence against me in any Court. and then I met the old man in the passage; I told old

             I had been accused, and asked him how I should act upon it; he told me there was no danger, if I did not confess myself, and told me, if I had any in my house, to clear it away; he said, he had none in his house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you write a letter to the Hughes's? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. At any subsequent time did the Hughes's acknowledge they had received a letter from you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You went into the service of Messrs. Alder and Ellis in October last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you began to rob them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up, were not you? - A. Mr. Alder wanted me to confess, and he gave me till twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You accused a person of the name of Reeves, did not you? - A. Yes, he had part of the money; I told Mr. Alder he was concerned in taking indigo.</p>
               <p>Q. And Reeves was taken up upon your accusation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went before the Grand Jury to find a bill against him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he been tried? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why? - A. The Grand Jury threw the bill out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your wife? - A. She has lived with her father; she has not lived with me since the last day of the last year.</p>

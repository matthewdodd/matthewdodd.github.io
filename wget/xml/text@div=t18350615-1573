                  </hi>. I am married. I lodge in Wallis's house, in the next room to where the prisoner slept—I was in the house the day his boxes were brought down stairs—I saw Mr. Wallis in the boy's room that day—he did not remain there more than a minute or two—the door was open—it is not two yards from my room—I saw him settling something is the box—his hands were in the box, and he seemed settling something—it was only a momentary glance—the lid of the box was open—I did not see the boxes down stairs—it seemed a small dirty white box—I am positive it was open—I saw Wallis with his hands in it, at the side of the bedstead—the room is large enough to hold a bedstead, and no more—the box was on the side of the bedstead—in a few minutes afterwards, I saw the boy and Mr. Wallis running up stairs—the boy said, somebody had been at his box—I think Wallis was in the room when he said that, because I heard his voice—I went out on the stairs, and said to the boy, "Why, Mr. Wallis has;" thinking that the boy might think it was an impertinence of ours, our room being so near—I said this in Wallis's presence, for fear the pri<lb></lb>soner should think that any of my family had taken the liberty of going into his room—there had been no quarrel between Mr. Wallis and me, till that day—I worked for him, and my husband worked for him—we have been very good friends till that day—and that day Wallis came up and asked me what business I had to tell the boy he had been to his box, and he denied it; but I stuck to it ever since that he was at the box.</p>

                  </hi> I am a butcher, of Tower Street, Waterloo Road, but I work in Leadenhall Market—on 16th June, between six and seven in the evening, I was in Snow's Fields in the middle of the road; the prisoner came behind me and throttled me, so that I could not breathe—my cap got over my eyes, by his arm coming over it, his knee was put into my back, and I was pulled backwards and fell—he held me on the ground, and some more men, I believe there were three, rifled my pockets—I managed to save my watch, though they made two snatches at it, I clung to it, and here are the remains of the chain—they took my purse, contain<lb></lb>ing twopence, and a handkerchief, and tobacco box—I had a good view of the prisoner, the others ran away, and I had a good view of him; he got up and ran behind two women—my cheek was very much swollen, and I had great pain in my hip—I put my finger up, and said, "Mind, if it is a month, or two months to come, I shall know you, "look<lb></lb>ing at the prisoner—I have no doubt whatever he is the man—it was quite daylight.</p>

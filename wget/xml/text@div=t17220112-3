They went to the Blue Boar in New street, and after they had drank one Pint, the prisoner Jackson said, since you have been so kind as to give me one Pint, I'll give you another, and so call'd for it in. When they had emptied that, Jackson desired him to carry the Chair up stairs into her Room, which he did, and she followed him. They being both sat down, she said, now if you will but give me one pint of Wine, I shall be easy; he consented, she call'd up Sharp, and sent her for the Wine. When the Wine was brought, he drank one Glass, and fell fast asleep, and slept about 4 hours; and when he awaked, the Prisoner, and his Cloaths, and Money were missing; but finding Jackson about 11 the same Night, she gave him the Hat and Wig from under her Ridinghood, saying, she did not design to rob him. The Constable depos'd, that he saw Jackson deliver the Hat and Wig, which were produc'd, and sworn to in Court by the Prosecutor; and that afterwards going to Jackson in the Compter, one of the Prisoners there told him, that the 2 Rings were pawned at the Bar. Jackson in her Defence, own'd the Circumstances of the Prosecutor's meeting her with a Chair, and of their going to drink together; but she said, he was drunk, and would needs carry the Chair up Stairs, and then vomited in her Room. That he gave her a piece of Gold to be rude with her, but she refus'd it, and desir'd him to go home. He said he would not, for he'd lie there all Night, and with that he stript himself, lay down on the Table, and fell fast asleep, and there she left him. An Evidence for Jackson depos'd, that she had been Lunatick, us'd to run about the Streets with her Hair loose; that she had been <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172201120002"></xptr> three times confin'd in Bedlam, and once broke out from thence, and came to his House with her Chain about her Legs, and told him, she was now got rid of `em all.

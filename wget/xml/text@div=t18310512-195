On the night of the 22nd of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I heard footsteps going down the gateway, into the garden - my master's potato-warehouse is in the cellar - when I got up, at six, I went into the cellar, and saw the potatoes, which were not in the same state in which they were the night before - they had then been up to the cill of the door; about two bushels were then gone - the prisoner was in my master's regular employ; he used to dig the ground, and do any thing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYLAND. Q. You had seen the potatoes the day before? A. Yes, in the evening - I did not know what quantity there were precisely - I thought there looked to be less than there was the night before.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Was the way in which you heard footsteps, leading to the prisoner's house? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE FIELDER. I live at Teddington - my back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120104"></xptr>yard joins Mr. Dell's garden. On the evening of the 21st of March, at twenty minutes to twelve o'clock, my dog barked; I looked out to see what was the matter; I saw the prisoner getting over Mr. Dell's wall with a sack, which appeared to be potatoes; the night was very light - I had a good opportunity of seeing him, and am quite certain he was the man; I saw him go into his own house - he then came out, spoke to the dog, and the dog was quiet; the dog was acquainted with him, though he might not know his footsteps.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How near is that wall to the pales? A. The length of the garden is perhaps a hundred yards - I am quite sure it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you married? A. Yes, my husband lives with me, but he was from home that night; I have three children - the barking of the dog disturbed them; two of them were ill, and had only been put into bed a few minutes before, out of a warm-bath; Mr. Nash had not been passing the evening with me - I do not know his motive for coming; he came, and staid some few minutes; I had been insulted by him before - I told him to walk out, and he went out directly after the robbery was committed; he had not seen all that I did - he saw him go into his own back door, but he was very much in liquor at the time; I saw the prisoner get over the wall with the sack - it had all the appearance of having potatoes in it; I could certainly see that the sack was not smooth - the prisoner had to pass me at my door; he might be about five yards from me - it is a half-sash door, and was a little ajar; the door is frequently open - I have frequent business out in my yard, and at my pump; Nash remained some few minutes after I had seen the prisoner, till I prevailed on him to go out: the prisoner lived next door to me for four or five months - I do not know whether there was any search made on his premises; I had no hand in this proceeding against the prisoner - I only told Mr. Dell what I had seen.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DELL. I am a <rs id="t18310512-195-viclabel1138" type="occupation">market-gardener</rs>

I received information, and had him taken into custody in three or four days or a week afterwards; he continued in my service for one day afterwards, and he came on the Monday and asked for work - I told him I would not employ a man who got into my place at such unseasonable hours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When did you take out a warrant for the articles? A. It might be a week or a fortnight afterwards; I do not think it was longer - I had not stated publicly that I had any accusation against him; when I refused to employ him he said directly, "Is it me?" and three or four more said, "Is it me?" then he went to Mr. Gye's, and sent me a lawyer's letter - he threatened to bring an action against me for slander, arising from this very charge - I did not attempt to get the warrant till he had given me notice of bringing the action.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I wish to ask Mrs. Fielder whether she was at the window or in the room? A. I was at the back door.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND called -</p>
               <p>EDWARD NASH. I know the prosecutor, also his premises, and Mrs. Fielder's. I happened to be at Mrs. Fielder's on the night of the 21st of March, but I cannot say what I went for; there is a path that runs down between Mrs. Fielder's and Rose's garden - I was in the ground floor room; there is a window, which looks into the road - it is a very small one; it is about up to my breast - a person could see about halfway down Rose's garden from there - I do not think it is possible to see the wall of Mr. Dell's garden; I do not think you could see a man getting over that wall, and I do not think it is possible for a man to get over with a sack- there is a door that goes out of the shop, and a door that goes into the bake-house; there is one door that goes in the same direction with the window - I cannot say whether it was open; there is no door which, if it was open, a person could see more of the garden than they could from the window - I should think I was there between eleven and twelve o'clock; I cannot say whether Mrs. Fielder left the room while I was there - she was in the same room, but she might have left it; I might be there half an hour - I know Rose; I lodged with him very nearly two years; I saw him that night go with a sack - that was before I left Mrs. Fielder's - he came from up his garden, I thought from his pigsty; Mr. Dell's wall is at the back of the pig-sty - I saw him within a yard or a yard and a half of his own back door, and he went into his own house - this was while I was in the room with Mrs. Fielder; I cannot exactly say whether it was moon-light or not - the sack did not seem to have any thing heavy in it - it did not seem like potatoes - it was too light for potatoes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time was this? A.Between eleven and twelve o'clock - I cannot tell whether it was a three or four bushel sack, but it seemed nearly full; I should think it contained between three and four bushels - I do not know that it was not potatoes; I have no reason to think about it, but, by the way he carried it, I think it is impossible it could contain potatoes or coals, he seemed to carry it so easily; I have not mistaken the hour - he was about five yards from Mrs. Fielder's promises; she was in the room - she tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "Do you see any thing, Nash?" then I looked and saw him within a yard and a half of his own back door - he was about twenty yards from the wall; Rose is a retail publican, and keeps good hours.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Were you lodging with him at this time? A. No - I have left him some months; there is a little gate which goes from Mrs. Fielder's back yard into her garden.</p>
               <p>JOHN TILLEY. I know the prisoner. On Monday evening, the 21st of March, I was at his house pretty late, and asked if he could accommodate me to sleep; he said he had no spare bed, but he would make me a bed in his beer-shop with a sack of chaff - this was about twelve o'clock; he went out at his back door, which led down to his garden - there is a pig-sty at the bottom of his garden, and there is a wall as high as a good tall man; he went that way, brought in a sack of chaff, and made my bed - he had been gone about three minutes; then he went to his bed, and I to mine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What sort of chaff was it? A. Oat chaff - I will not swear there was no clover, or any common hay; the sack was full - I did not empty any out; it was tied pretty tight - I slept on the top of it; I did not take off my clothes - I slept very soundly, and got up at six o'clock in the morning; I had no night-cap - my back was not sore; I had a good night's real, what little time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120105"></xptr>I did lay - I slept the next night in the same house on the same sack; I had no blankets.</p>
               <p>JOHN COOPER. I am a working man. I live near the prisoner - I heard of this robbery, but I do not know the day it happened; it was in March, and I think about the 21st; shortly before that he had applied to me for a sack of chaff to make him a mattress, and I sold him one; that was in February - I delivered it to him in a sack, which was full; a young man carried it to his premises - I did not go to his premises to see where it was deposited; I went and took the money for it, the same night that it went - I did not see where it was put; I know the wall between his garden and the next - I should think it is six feet high.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What night was it? A. It was on a Saturday - I asked my master if I might get this man a sack of chaff; it was a whole sack - it was between six and seven o'clock when I took it in; I am no scholar, but it was in February - I cannot give any account how it was tied round; a man could sleep on it very nicely.</p>

               <p>Q. Where in fact did you go. - A. I went as far as Shoreditch bar, I waited there full three quarters of an hour, I turned my cart about to come to the wharf again; coming back I met him, he said he told me to go to Hounsditch; he told me to turn about, I went up Camomile street, that is the lady I saw there, (Mrs. Bullock) I delivered one cask there, I did not go inside of the house; then he ordered me to drive up Hounsditch into Whitechapel, accordingly I did, I stopped at the Seven Stars, as he told me, he said stop here, I shall be back in twelve minutes; presently he came back, and said I shall go no further with them, we struck them at the Seven Stars on the pavement, he went and got change of a pound note, he asked me what the money was, I told him seven shillings; as I was going home, there were one or two men there, they said will you take them up again, I said where are you going to, he said to Mile End turnpike; I took them up again, I was to have four shillings, and they were to pay the toll, I took them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030011"></xptr> through Mile End turnpike, and struck them on the ground, as they ordered me; they gave me four shillings, and I saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your lordship, at this time I was out of employ, I called at the Seven Stars, some gentlemen there employed me to go to Kennett's wharf, to enquire if these casks were there, I went down to the wharf, the gentleman delivered them, they were put in the cart, we went on to Hounsditch, there I met with one of the gentlemen that employed me, he told me to go to the Coachmaker's Arms, and to treat the carman, and to ask the landlord to buy a cask for one pound, which was a great deal less than it cost.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Nelson) Does your wharf adjoin the river. - A. Yes, we land goods from the craft as they lay along side upon our wharf, from the river Thames.</p>

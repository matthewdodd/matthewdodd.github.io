                  </hi>. I am a gentleman's servant, out of employment, and live in Crown-court. The prisoner is my brother—he came out of confinement the latter end of March—he had neither victuals nor money, and I made him welcome to my lodging—he came backwards and forwards several days—and about the 1st of April, he said if he could find a friend, where he could sleep, he thought he might get something to do—I took him in out of charity—I lost a coat and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I have not found my coat since—he was apprehended fourteen or fifteen days afterwards—no<lb></lb>body could take it from my room but him—my doors was fastened—he left his own coat on the table, and mine was gone—I left my money in my trowsers pocket—it was taken between four and five o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing—he got in the morning and went away.</p>

The prisoner slept in our room—I was ill—he was up and down several times in the course of the night—I saw him take my husband's coat off the nail and hand it on chair—I dozed, and awoke afterwards, and saw him sweeping the room I awoke again soon after, and called to him—he made no answer—I got</p>

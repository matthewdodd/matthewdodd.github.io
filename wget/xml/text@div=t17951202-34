               <p>I lost a hand saw, a plane, a square, and a cloth jacket, from a building near the Foundling-hospital that is uninhabited: On the 23d of October I went home to dinner, between twelve and one o'clock; when I returned I missed the things; I was at work in the building in the course of a week after; I went to several pawnbrokers to endeavour to find my tools; at last I went to one in Leather-lane, and found the plane and square.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the pawnbroker's name? - A. Notley. When the man was searched, the saw was mentioned in a duplicate found upon him; it was pawned at Clerkenwell-green; the justice sent for the pawnbroker, and the saw was produced at the office in Hatton-garden. The prisoner owned to me, that he had sold the jacket to a Jew, on Clerkenwell-green. The magistrate committed him to Clerkenwell-bridewell.</p>

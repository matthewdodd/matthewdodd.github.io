The prisoner was three weeks in our service. - On Saturday night, the 21st of May, I went with my husband to Cooke's-circus; we returned about a quarter-past twelve o'clock, and about two the next day the prisoner came up to me in the bed-room, and said dinner was ready- I asked her to fasten my dress, which she could not, and after she was gone down I stooped down, and observed something shining on the bed-room floor; I picked it up, and found it was a ruby - I then found several more: I went down stairs to my husband, asked if he had been to his drawer that morning, and told him what I had found; I found the keys of the drawers in a drawer which I had placed them in the evening before - my husband opened the drawer with the key, in my presence; the prisoner had seen me place some rubies in that drawer about a fortnight before - when my husband examined the drawer there were still some rubies and emeralds there; I could not tell how many were missing - we searched all over the floor of the room, and found a few more rubies: I asked the prisoner if she had been to the drawer - she said she had not; she said Mr. Meredith, a lodger, had asked her a great many questions, and she should not be surprised if it was him; the constable was sent for Mr. Meredith, and his room was searched, but nothing was found either on him or in his room - this was at half-past three o'clock that afternoon: I afterwards went to my father's, and returned about halfpast eight o'clock - I saw the prisoner in the back parlour- the constable was searching her boxes: she asked him to allow her to speak to me - I said nothing to induce her to confess: I did not either threaten or promise her, nor did my husband or the constable - she said she had been to the drawer out of curiosity, to look at the stones, and if I searched the room farther I should still find the remainder of the stones that were missing; I told her she knew to the countrary of that, as we had searched before there - she then said she had taken them, and thrown them away down the water-closet, and into the dust-hole; she begged I would plead for her - I told her I would as far as prudence would allow me: that was after she made this statement; that was all she said to me about it - I afterwards had the dust-hole and water-closet examined, but none of them were found in either place; she did not tell me how the drawer was opened.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You told me you had been robbed twice before I came, and you did not think I should do it, became I did not know a ruby from glass. Witness, I said we had been robbed twice before she came - we had lost a writing-desk out of the front parlour, and a table-clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. All the lodgers had access to your bed-room, and you were very careless in letting property lay about - there were things in the kitchen and in my bed-room, which I could have taken. Witness. There are many things laying about at a jeweller's house which it is impossible to lock up - a gentleman left a gold chain in the kitchen for a week; there might have been rings in the prisoner's bed-room at times - I never knew her to go to my drawer; I am sure she saw me put some rabies into my drawer about a fortnight before, and saw the stones in the drawer - I had her character from Mr. Payne, a butcher, of Lamb's Conduit-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Your brother was at work in the house till eight o'clock, and complained to me that Mackie had gone out, and there were seven lodgers besides. Witness. A brother of mine was at work there - we have a lady lodging on our first floor; we had only one lady in the house at the time of the robbery, but we have four ladies lodge in the house - they are respectable; all the lodgers have access to the room; the drawer is in the second floor front room, which is my bed-room; Mr. Meredith lodged in the back room second floor - we found nothing in her boxes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. McCree lodged there, and was going away the day before - master told me to look sharp after him. Witness. Mr. McCree left on the Saturday night,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300008"></xptr>about half-past eleven o'clock - he was a medical student; he boarded with us, and slept on the third floor - he is a youth sixteen years old.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you know of your husband telling her to look sharp after him? A. No - I knew him to be a very respectable young man; the keys were kept in a drawer in the bed-room; she must have occasionally seen me put the keys in the drawer.</p>
               <p>JAMES MACKIE. I am the prosecutor. I kept my loose stones in a drawer in the bed room - they were polished; in consequence of what my wife said I went up about two o'clock and looked at the drawer - I had slept in that room the night before, and got up about half-past eleven; on examining the drawer I found it locked - I opened it with the key, and found nothing the matter with the lock; when I unscrewed the ruby-box, which was kept in that drawer, I found full half of them were gone - there had been about seventy carats in the box; there now remains forty-one - I had not seen the box for four or five days; I opened the ruby-box in the prisoner's presence - I took the drawer out, and set it on a chair by the window, and on opening the emerald-box, I said, "Why, half of these are gone;" she immediately said, "Oh Jesus Christ! it was not me, as God is my judge it was not me!" I examined the emerald-box in her presence - there were fourteen carats left out of thirty; I had not seen that box for four or five days - I never go to it unless some of the workmen want them; I cannot say when I had seen them last, in fact Mrs. Mackie put the rubies and emeralds there the last time - I had weighed them about a week before; the box was so full that the lid would hardly go down on it - the ruby-box was particularly full; I put twenty carats in one evening, and I think two more - it was so full I could scarcely get the lid down, and I thought to put them into another box; some of the rubies cost me three guineas a carat, some 40s., and some 25s. - I had seventy or eighty carats of the emeralds at one time; I had worked them down to the worst, and I would not have given above 20s. a carat for them.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner used the expressions you mentioned had you charged her with stealing them? A. I had not, and I said, "Why, Ann, what is the use of your using those expressions, have I charged you with it, but your conduct appears very strange, I must confess.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention any other person whom she charged? A. Mr. Meredith - she mentioned his name; I sent for a constable, and searched Meredith's person and his room, but found nothing - I afterwards had a conversation with a Mr. Burgess; I have three rooms on a floor, and the conversation was in the middle parlour - I do not know that it was in the prisoner's hearing; Burgess had come about half-past eight o'clock that evening - I told him what had happened, asked him to walk up stairs, and I would show him where the things were taken from; I called to the prisoner to bring up a candle - I went up with him into the bed-room, and showed him our drawer; the prisoner did not go up with us, not to my knowledge - I went into Meredith's room; I got the candle, looked on the top of his bed, and when I came out of his room the prisoner walked into the room, and said to me, "Sir, what colour is a ruby, is it red or green?" I said, "Ann, you know the colour as well as I do, you saw me open the boxes to-day;" she then said, without stooping, "There lays a ruby on the floor," and there was one - I had said to Burgess before she came into the room, that if I was to find a ruby in the room. I should certainly suspect, but as it was I could not - I am not certain whether the prisoner heard this; I had not seen her from the time she gave me the candle, but she followed me up stairs though she was not required there - when she said there was a ruby on the floor we were in Meredith's middle room, the sitting-room; she picked it up herself, and put it into my hand - it was a ruby of the same description as I had lost; I had searched that room before for three or four hours - I searched it with the officers, and after they went away I searched it myself; I searched the place where she picked up the ruby, but I had found none - I had searched it down on my knees with my fingers all over the ground, with accuracy, and I am certain there was nothing there - when she picked it up she said, "Are you now satisfied who stole them?" I said, "I am satisfied now;" I immediately sent for a constable, and had her taken - the ruby found in the room might be worth 8s. or 9s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Directly you went up to the drawer to search, did you not say, "I know who has done this, it is Mr. McCree has been and spilled this about out of spite to me?" A. I did not - McCree had lodged with me six months; I had a dispute with him, and I believe I struck him - I said to Mrs. Mackie, "Surely Mr. McCree could not have gone to my drawer and spilled these about out of spite;" I did not say I would have him searched - I did not say, "I don't suspect you, Ann, you don't know a ruby from glass;" I said the best of the stones were gone - I did not say McCree had gone away in such a sly way I was determined to find him out, nor that I would find out Meredith's connexions - I said nothing, except that I was sorry the gentleman had been searched - I did not search the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. I think you say Mr. McCree was highly respectable? A. Yes - he lodged six months with me; he was a very passionate young man - he did not leave London for a fortnight or three weeks after the robbery; I found nothing in the prisoner's possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What portion of the rubies and emeralds were actually found? A. Those about the room were about two and a half carats, which, put to what were in the box, made forty-one carats - none of the emeralds were found- I had no reason to believe Mr. McCree had done this out of spite; I merely said at the moment, "Surely McCree could not have scattered them out of spite;" no money was found in the prisoner's box.</p>

               <p>MRS. MACKIE. I cannot say to a few days when I had last seen the property - the prisoner saw me place them in the drawer about a fortnight before; I had been to the drawer about a week before - I did not unscrew either of the boxes; I had not seen the rubies or emeralds for some time - it was rather more than a fortnight before that I had placed them there in her presence; I placed them there in her presence for a particular purpose - she came to me on the Saturday night, and on the following Tuesday I let Meredith the apartment, and two or three days after she came down and said, "Dear me, ma'am, it is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300009"></xptr>very strange gentleman we have taken in, he is always asking me how many rooms there are in the house, and how many lodgers;" I said, "You could very well tell him that;" she said, "Then he asked me how many workmen ther were, and how much gold there was in the shop;" I said, "There is not much gold;" I said so, thinking to deceive each party - I was rather alarmed at it, and said, "Ann bring the candle, I will go up into the shop and lock up what things I think are portable;" and as we were leaving the room my husband said, "Charlotte, I have left my ruby and emerald box by the side of my place; there are a great many rubies in the box; 20l. worth might be taken out, and I might not miss them;" this was in the prisoner's presence - I then brought the ruby and emerald boxes from the shop and locked them in this drawer; she asked me at the time the value of some stones there, particularly a yellow crystal - I told her they were of no value.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not bring a large stone to the bed and show me, then take me to the closet where the silver spoons and things were, and show me some pieces of gold in the shop, and say you should not like them to be lost? A. I might have said I should not like it to be lost - she held the candle while I locked the things up- we have left the key of the shop on the back parlour mantel-piece when we have gone out; there has been valuable things in the shop at the time - I did not make the prisoner any promise; I asked her in the morning if she had been to the drawer out of curiosity, and in the evening she made use of my words and said she had been out of curiosity.</p>
               <p>MR. MACKIE. I never used any threat or promise to her in the morning when she was stating she was innocent - I said, "Ann, if you have been to the drawer from curiosity, and spilt the stones on the floor, and I find them all, I will say no more about it."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not come into the parlour and fall on my knees, crying? A. You never fell on your knees till you were taken into custody at eleven o'clock at night; you then tell on your knees and begged for mercy, and I said I would have nothing to say to you - I did not hear her make any statement that night.</p>

            . I went to lodge at Mr. Mackie's on the 3rd of May, a little more than a fortnight before the robbery - I had not the slightest knowledge where he kept his rubies or emeralds; I had none in my room on the Sunday, nor did I ever drop any on the carpet - I did not take these rubies or emeralds; I recollect asking the prisoner how many lodgers there were in the house, but never asked her about gold or jewels, or put any question to her bearing any resemblance to it - I went home on Saturday evening, about seven o'clock I think; I did not leave my room that night, nor on the following morning, till after this investigation took place - I went to bed between eight and nine o'clock on the Saturday night, and about twelve I was awoke by a great noise in my outer room, my sitting room, and immediately after the prisoner opened the bed-room door, and seeing me in bed she seemed much alarmed, and was going out; I told her not to be alarmed, but to hold me the candle that I might see the time - I saw it wanted twenty minutes to twelve - my sitting room is between my bed-room and Mr. Mackie's bed-room; they are all on the same floor - mine is the back room, and his bed-room is in front; I said nothing more to the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Mackie's house on the Sunday night, about twelve o'clock - I went up to the sitting room on the second floor, and asked the prisoner how she came to place that ruby on the floor; she said, "To make it appear as if Mr. Meredith put it there;" those were her words to me - she said, "As he might be apprehended;" I took her into custody, and took her down to the kitchen to get her bonnet - she resisted being taken, and said I will tell my mistress all about it; I did not make her any threat or promise; as she was shutting the kitchen door, I heard her say, "I did go to the drawer;" that was all I heard then - I pulled her up stairs to get her away; she then went into the parlour where Mrs. Mackie was sitting - she threw herself on her knees, and begged for mercy - Mrs. Mackie expressed herself very angry with her, and desired me to take her away; she then took hold of Mrs. Mackie, and took her into the front parlour - I overheard her say in a loud tone,"I threw them into the dust-hole;" and I think she mentioned the privy at the same time - I then went into the room and took her away, and on the way to the watch-house, she said, "I know I told my mistress I took them, and threw them down the dust-hole and the privy, but she said it was Mr. Meredith that had stolen them;" I afterwards had occassion to ask her what man she had had in the house on the Saturday night; she said it was a man who I saw she had a letter from in Green-street, a sweetheart - I said, "I understand you had him there late on Saturday night, and that he was seen to go in there early on Sunday morning" - she said he was there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said, "If you have not done the robbery, Meredith has;" Witness. I did not; I knew nothing about Meredith till the next day - I searched the prisoner and found nothing on her.</p>
               <p>MR. MACKIE. The last time I saw the rubies and emeralds was the evening my wife brought them down to put them into the drawer, which was about eight or nine days before the robbery - I saw the rubies in particular, and the emerald box also - it was then I found a difficulty to screw the ruby box up; I saw the emeralds about a day before- that box was half full; (looking at a ruby produced by Schofield) that is the ruby she picked up on the floor.</p>
               <p>BURGESS. I called on the Sunday evening, about hald-past eight o'clock, at Mr. Mackie's - the prisoner let me in; I asked her if Mr. or Mrs. Mackie were at home - she said Mr. Mackie was, but Mrs. Mackie was gone out; she immediately began to tell me that Mr. Mackie's drawer had been forced open over night, and a quantity of stones taken from it, and that suspicion fell on Mr. Meredith - I told her I did not wish to know further about it; I wished to see Mr. Mackie as she seemed to wish to press the subject very much; I afterwards saw Mr. Mackie, and had some conversation with him; he asked me to go up stairs to see the confused state in which the lodger's apartments were, and said if he could find one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300010"></xptr>stone in the lodger's apartment he should be satisfied - the prisoner was standing close by at the time; she asked Mr. Mackie what colour the stones were - he said she knew very well, and about a minute afterwards she said, "Here is a stone on the floor;" and picked it up - what Mr. Mackie has said upon that subject is quite correct.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had you heard of Mr. Mackie's loss before you called at the house? A. No - the prisoner told me without my asking any questions.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When the prisoner apparently picked up the ruby, did you say any thing? A. I asked if she picked up the ruby, or whether she had placed it there - she swore by G - d she had found it there; I afterwards saw her in Schofield's custody - she said, in my hearing, that she had taken the ruby from Mr. Mackie's room, and put it into Mr. Meredith's room, in order to have him taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not come up after master with a light? A. Yes, but he had got one already, and had not called for one - you came into the room after us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said I had found a ruby in Mr. Mackie's room - you said, "Where is it?" I said, "I have let it drop on the carpet, and there it is;" you said, "Are you sure you picked it up?" I said, "Yes, I picked it up in mistress' room, and put it there;" Witness. Yes, that is true - she said she had put it into Meredith's room, in order to have him taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - I am here, unfortunately, charged with robbing my master of rubies and stones, which I am innocent of: I unfortunately went to live with Mr. Mackie, with a good character, on the 30th of April last - I had not been in the house three days before my mistress took in a gentleman-lodger, without any reference; there were six lodgers in the house besides him - he came about one o'clock in the day after the lodging, and at six o'clock the same evening - he came to stay; he had not been in the house four days before he questioned me several times how many lodgers there were in the house, and if there was not plenty of gold up in the shop - I told him I did not know any thing about it, as I had not been long in the house myself; I instantly went and told my mistress of it, and she thought it a very strange question to ask me; she then went up stairs, and looked over all her things - the lodgers had all access to her bed-room, except Mr. Meredith; my mistress was very careless with her property- her keys and jewellery used to lay over all parts of the house; I often told her that she was very careless in letting her things lay about - my mistress told me that she had been rubbed twice within three months before I went there, and how is it possible that I can be answerable for her property? I had plenty of opportunities if I was that way inclined - my mistress has been out plenty of times, and left the keys about, and never any thing lost before; I solemnly declare that I am innocent of the crime that I am charged with on the fatal night that I suppose the robbery was committed, as it could not be done on the Sunday morning, as my master was in bed all the morning previous to my mistress finding it out: my master and mistress went to the play on Saturday night - they returned about a quarter-past ten o'clock; Mr. Meredith came in about seven o'clock with a latchkey, and it so happened that a gentleman-lodger went away the night the place was robbed; my master gave particular orders to watch the gentleman that went away, which I did not take any heed of, as I knew he was embittered against him concerning some words which occurred the night before - when my master and mistress came, it was about a quarter-past ten, and my master asked me if Mr. Meredith was in; I said No, as I did not know that he was in at the time, not having been up stairs; my mistress said, "You must get him a rushlight," which I forgot, and they went out again - in the meantime I was ironing; a thought came into my head, that I had not turned down her bed - I ran up stairs to do it - I was not two minutes in the room, nor I never saw her keys, nor never such a thought came into my head; I also went into Mr. Meredith's room, and to my great surprize I found him in bed, which frightened me very much, and I screamed out - he appeared very much confused- he told me not to be alarmed, but to bring the light, for he wanted to see what o'clock it was; he held the watch in his hand - I went down stairs, and my master knocked at the door; I told him that I had been very much frightened, and likewise told them how frightened Mr. Meredith was, which they laughed very much at; we all went to bed - on the next day my mistress was dressing herself - she came down to my master, and told him how she saw the little stones lay about the carpet; they both went up stairs, and I went up to see what was the mattermy master took the drawer out in my presence, and said that he knew very well who had done this - he said, "Mr. McCree has been to the drawer, and spilt them out of spite;" my mistress said, "Is there any lost?" he said, "No, I do not think there is any gone;" my mistress said she did not think that Mr. McCree would do such a thing - they then had suspictor of Mr. Meredith; my master then recollected what Mr. Meredith asked me about the gold - I was called up to face him before my mistress, that he did say so; he denied it, but I could take an oath he said it - my master said, "If any one else has got my property I will go on my knees, and beg your pardon;" they then had him searched, and my master said, "I cannot give him into custody, or else he will bring an action against me for false imprisonment;" about six o'clock he took his leave to go away - my master and all of them said, that he behaved very strange in going away as he did; my master said to me, in the kitchen, "Your mistress has done a very wrong thing, for she told him that she had been robbed;" after an hour had elapsed she sent for an officer, and him and me were searched, but they found nothing on either of us; my master said, "Whoever has robbed me is a judge of those things, for they have picked out the most valuable stones;" he said, "I do not suspect you, as you would not know rubies from glass;" it all passed on until nine o'clock - I went up stairs to turn down the bed, and I was looking about the carpet; I found a small stone, and on my oath I never had one in my hand before, nor saw one; my master suspected I had more about me, and he sent for an officer, and gave me into custody - they searched me again, but found nothing about me, nor at any of my friends; my mistress said that she would forgive me if I would say I was guilty, but if not she would send me to Newgate, which so frightened me that I did not know what I said - she asked me if I had put them down the water-closet, or the dust-bin, or if I had them any where - I told them they had better go and look, which she immediately did, but found none; the officer was sent for to take me into custody - I fell upon my knees, and begged her not to send me, as I knew I was innocent: I solemnly declare, Gentlemen of the Jury, as I shall have to answer before that awful Judge, when all hearts will be open, that I am quite innocent of the crime alleged to me, and must, therefore, throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>

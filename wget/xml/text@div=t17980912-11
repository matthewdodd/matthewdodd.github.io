               <p>Q. How do you know the place was called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120008"></xptr>Maze-pond? - A. Because there was a gentlewoman brought me home, and she said, it was Maze-pond.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she do with your frock? - A. I do not know, I am sure; she said, she would bring me a new one, a new skirt, and a new pair of shoes; I said, I should not like to be without a frock; then she put an old handkerchief round me.</p>

               <p>Q. What did she do when she had taken the frock and skirt off? - A. She left me at a door, in Maze-pond.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Dawson). Have any of the things been found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the child). Are you sure that is the woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. SAUNDERS sworn. - I live at No. 14, Little Maze-pond; my husband is a baker; I work needle-work; I was sitting at my own door at work: On the 2d of August, about half past three o'clock, the child came to me, she had been crying very much; she asked me if I would shew her the way to the Fleet; I told her, she was a great way off from the Fleet; oh dear ma'am, says she, my daddy lives in the Fleet, will you take me home to him; she had a silk handkerchief crossed over her arms, and the four corners tied behind; I asked her, if she was lame; she said, no, a woman had brought her, and took her frock and skirt off, and tied that about her, and told her, she would buy her a new one, and give her a new pair of green shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the prisoner? - A. No, not till I saw her in custody. I took her home, and about a week after, she came with her mother, and shewed us the door where the woman had taken her things off.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Dawson). What day was it you lost the child? - A. The 2d of August, about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see this woman after? - A. On the 7th of August, the child came to tell me, she was in Fleet-lane, at an old clothes shop.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had her taken up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the 1st of August, I went to Lower-road, Deptford, and did not return till eleven o'clock at night, the 2d of August; I know no more of it than the baby unborn; my little boy is at nurse at Deptford; and Mr. Pettitt is here, I believe, who will swear that I was there all that time.</p>

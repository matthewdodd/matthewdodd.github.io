On the Wednesday following she was alone, and I asked her to bring her work and sit with me, which she did, and drank tea with me. We were talking about dress. I took out my scarf and shewed it her; I folded it up in my handkerchief and put it into my box with my bonnet over it, and put my box under the bed, covered over with a handkerchief; and on Sunday morning I went to the box, and saw the handkerchief the scarf was in lying by the side, folded up in a different manner, and the scarf gone. I knocked at the prisoner's door, and she came into my my room; I said I had lost my scarf. She said,</p>

The prisoner went out, and never came back all night. In the course of the evening, I went to my drawers, and missed two of my husband's shirts. I suspected her, and in the morning, in consequence of information, we went to Oxford-street, and found her there, in the street, by the Pantheon. Evans, who was with me, kept her eye on her, while I fetched the patrol, and just by the Pantheon I met her and said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, Esther, you wicked girl." She said," I know I have robbed you." I asked what she had done with my husband's shirts; she said she took them also and pawned them, but had destroyed the duplicates.</p>

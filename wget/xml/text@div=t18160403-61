On Saturday evening last, I was in the back part of the shop, and the prisoner came to a sister-in-law of mine, to ask for a sixpence; she gave him one, and he returned back into the shop, and gave it to the customer that he was serving. I did not see him put any money into the till; but on the contrary, I observed him putting something in his left hand waistcoat pocket; he gave my sister-in-law nothing in return for the sixpence. As soon as the customers were a little clear, I called him to the back shop, and asked him what money he had about him; he said, he had none of his own, and what he had belonged to a cousin of his, who was a performer at the Sans Pareil Theatre, in the Strand, and for whom he had sold some tickets. I asked him to produce what money he had, and he produced four three-shilling pieces, and two shillings. On his producing that, I asked him if he had any more money about him; he said he had not. I asked him how many tickets he had from his cousin, and what they were; he told me he had had twenty pit tickets and fourteen box tickets. I asked him how many he had so; he said, he had sold three pit tickets to a Mr. Hoare, an uncle of his, a box ticket to his father, and another to his mother, and he gave a servant of mine and a young man one each. Out of the whole of the sales, it appeared by his own accout, that he had only received four shillings, I then sent for an officer, who searched him up stairs in my presence, and he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and on its being examined, he had a three shilling piece in it just at the corner of his silk handkerchief.</p>

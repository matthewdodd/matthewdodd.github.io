I am a surgeon; the deceased came to my house the 25th of March last, he said he was in very great pain from a fall he had received over-night; I blooded him, and asked him how he went to stool and voided his urine; he lived till the 28th day of the same month; he said he had been in company at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175504090009"></xptr> Feathers at <placeName id="t17550409-12-crimeloc68">Ealing</placeName>

At last I was obliged to use an instrument to discharge his Urine; I took at times six quarts of water from him with the instrument; after he was dead I found his bladder was burst, and there was a great deal of urine extravased in his body.</p>

               <p>Q. To whom did he speak?</p>
               <p>J. Twining. To all of them. I saw the deceased go forwards to him, and I went to fetch a pint of beer, and when I returned the deceased was getting up from off the ground; then he put his hand on his breast and complained as I mentioned before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of a labouring man, and lodged in the prisoner's house for eight years—the prisoner is married, and has a boy named John James, and a girl named Elizabeth, who was two years old on the 19th of July last—the boy is older—the prisoner kept a shop in the general line—be<lb></lb>fore this occurred, he was repeatedly saying that he was coming to great poverty and distress—I should say for six months before, continually, from time to time—on the morning of the 19th of June I was up stairs, in my own room, and heard screams of murder from the prisoner's bed-room—it was the prisoner's wife—I hastened to the door—the cries continued as I went, and while I was at the door—when I got to the door I heard a scuffling, like some person pulling, as if they were scuffling with each other—the door was locked—I waited till the prisoner's wife opened it—I then saw the prisoner scuffling with his wife—I saw the prisoner holding up a large chopper or axe, trying to cut his own forehead—he had cut it before I entered the room—he was bleeding from the forehead—he said nothing, nor did his wife say anything to him—I saw the little boy lying in the crib by the father's bedside, and the girl Elizabeth was sitting up in the bed, with a wound in her forehead, bleeding very much—I did not say anything—I took the axe from the prisoner's hand, and we fell in the scuffle, me, his wife, and himself, in scuffling to take the axe—we did not say anything—we screamed very much for assistance to come in—the boy had three cuts on the side of the head—his wife called out for a doctor to be sent for—she was hurt in the fall, but was not cut at all—the prisoner did not say a word—he laid apparently lifeless on the ground after the fall—that was from the cut that he had given himself with the axe, from loss of blood—the wife was quite exhausted from struggling with the pri<lb></lb>soner—she did not say anything—I knew what had occasioned the mischief to the children, from the prisoner having the axe in his hand; and his wife said that he had done it—that was when he lay apparently lifeless on the ground—he could not understand what was said at that time—she had not said anything before that, further than "Oh dear," and was in great trouble about the children—she did not say anything when I came in first—she was then trying to get the axe from his hand—he used to behave very kind to his children generally—I never saw anything to the contrary—on the 10th of March, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I had seen him in the water<lb></lb>butt in the yard, with his head down and his feet up—there was sufficient water in it to have drowned him; but I gave an alarm, and several of the neighbours came to his assistance, and pulled him out—I discovered him ac<lb></lb>cidentally, as I came out of my own room and went into the yard—I sup<lb></lb>pose he had been in about three minutes—he was quite sensible when the neighbours got him out—after that, his manner was different to what it used to be—he was always pleading poverty, and saying that he would come to distress—that was his general tone.</p>

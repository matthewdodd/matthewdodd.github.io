                  </hi>. On the 6th of March I was at my own door about half-past nine o'clock—I had occasion to go out for twenty minutes, and on my return saw a woman looking round the corner—I thought something was going on wrong—I went and found the prisoner inside my door, on the second step—there are three steps going down from the door into the passage—I asked what brought him there—he said he had brought home my wife—I asked him where she was, and how he came to bring her home, as he did not know us—he made no answer—I thought he had something concealed under his jacket, and said I would not let him go till I saw what he had concealed on his person—I caught hold of him by the arm, pulled him out of my house, and gave him a twist to knock him down—he rose up and showed fight—I knocked him down again with my fist—he rose up and went away—I went to my own house—he returned after going ten or twelve yards, and stabbed me with a knife, and ran away—I called to my wife—I got a towel and put it inside my trowsers, to prevent the blood flowing down my legs, and went to Dr. Garrett—I am not quite recovered yet.</p>

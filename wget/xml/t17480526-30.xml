            . I am father of the deceased.</p>
               <p>Pros. Coun. What time was he brought home?</p>
               <p>White. About nine o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he die?</p>
               <p>White . About twelve, as near as I can tell, for I have no clock in the house. My son said, the Prisoner had forgiven him for fishing; and said I, did you catch ever a fish? and he said, no, father, I catched never a one.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does this pond lie?</p>
               <p>White. It lies for three or four neighbours to come and water at .</p>
               <p>Q. And is there any fish in it?</p>
               <p>White. Sometimes there may be fish in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a common pond to water in?</p>
               <p>White. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bleed much?</p>
               <p>White. Very little.</p>
               <p>Pris. Coun. Does not this belong to Sir John Rushout?</p>
               <p>White. Yes.</p>

               <p>Pros. Coun. What are you?</p>
               <p>Parr. I am a surgeon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Parr. At Harrow. I was sent for to go to Pinner, but I could not go that night, and I sent word I would come the next morning, and the next morning the boy was dead; I waited upon the Coroner and the Jury, and examined the body, and there was a confusion just by the ear , and another near that; upon scalping, I could not find any other wound, but there was a vast quantity of extravasated blood between the skull and the dura mater .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that wound was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Parr . Yes, indeed I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was a bruising weapon, or a sharp weapon, that it was done with?</p>
               <p>Parr. It was a bruising weapon, else it would have cut .</p>

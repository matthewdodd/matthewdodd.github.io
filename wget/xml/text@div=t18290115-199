               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You went up to the drawing-room? A. Yes - that is on the first-floor; I went into the room, and left my bonnet and muff on the table; I was going to the bed-room, but hearing the knock went into the drawing-room; I saw the prisoner coming out of the parlour as I was on the last stair - I had heard the door open, and the servant came to the foot of the stairs, and called me down to the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long did you keep the house after this? A. Only two days, and as soon as I left I sent the servant home to Ireland - I am quite sure the prisoner is the man; the week before last Mr. Hoskins, the Magistrate sent for me - I found the prisoner in charge; I now live in the country - it was a gold watch, and worth 5l.; it was a present - it cost more than 5l.; I have had it, I believe, seven years.</p>

            . I am the wife of the prosecutor; I believe the house is in the parish of St. James, Clerknwell. On Friday, the 26th of December, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at our house; he knocked at the door, and said he wanted apartments - I went up and shewed him the first-floor; I was up stairs with him a few minutes - he came down with me, and said he supposed I should like a reference; I said I would take nobody without: he wrote his direction down - I have it here; this is it: he wrote it in my presence, "Mr. Martin, No. 4, Chadwell-street:" he asked when I could call for his character - I said, "This evening or to-morrow;" he asked if I could not come then with him, and as he was a stranger, and recollecting I had a French gold repeater on my mantel-piece, I asked him to step up into the second-floor, where my husband was, and where there was a fire, if he would wait there he would be more comfortable - I begged of him to follow me up stairs, saying there was no fire in the parlour; we were in the parlour when he wrote the direction - he wrote it on the table in the middle of the room: as I left the parlour I said, "If you please to follow me," he was then out of my sight - I had got to the foot of the stairs, and when I got to the first-floor he said, "Must I follow you?" I said Yes, and when he got up stairs he said, "I am thinking it is putting you a great deal out of your way, and if you will call on Sunday the landlady and I shall be at home; I agreed to do so - he took leave of my husband; I followed him to the street-door, and opened the door for him myself; at the door he told me he had forgotten one of his gloves, which he had left up stairs - I went into the parlour, thinking he might have left it there, and not thinking of my repeater I did not miss it at the moment; I came out of the parlour, not finding the glove - he then said, "Never mind;" I said, "Oh, Yes, I will go up stairs," and went up to the first-floor, but did not find his glove; I came down, and he was off - the milkman stood at the door: I went into the parlour, and missed my French gold repeater, which I am sure was there when he gave me his direction; there was a gold key to it, and a black string - it was worth between 9l. and 10l.; it was not our own - my husband is a watchmaker.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was your proposal to go up and look for the glove? A. Yes; I did not go into the parlour to look for it at his request - I went in, thinking it might be there, and was then going up stairs; he said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind" - if I had not gone up he could not have gone into the parlour again; he was in the house a quarter of an hour: he spoke very good French to my husband - I was in the room all the time; I saw the watch in the parlour when he was giving me the direction - we had had it about three weeks; if it had been English it would have been worth more - it has not been found.</p>
               <p>AMI AUGUSTE GANEVAL. The lowest value of the watch is 10l. - I speak as a tradesman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it old or now? A. It was not new, I suppose five or six years old - it was French work, and a single case.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What would it cost when new? A. Fifteen pounds; the lowest value of it is 10l. - I suppose the maker would have a trifling profit at 15l.</p>

            . I am a milkman. I went up to the prosecutor's door to serve him with milk on the 26th of December; I saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's door and run away; Mrs. Ganeval did not come to the door till he got out of sight. I believe him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not mean to say you are<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150090"></xptr>sure of the man? A. No, but I believe him to be the man.</p>
               <p>MRS. GANEVAL. This is the milkman I spoke to.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, I certainly went to take lodgings at the prosecutor's house, and asked the person if it would be convenient to come for my character at that time; she said it was not exactly convenient, but if I wished it she would go, and would I walk up stairs while she got ready- I went up, and afterwards thought it would be troubling her, and said,</p>
               <p>"Never mind, I will give you my address, and you can call" - in fact, the apartments were too dear, but I did not know how to make an excuse, after the trouble I had given her; as I came out I missed my gloveshe said she would go up stairs; I said, "Never mind, it is an old kid glove."</p>
               <p>Prisoner to MRS. GANEVAL. Q. Where did I stand when you went up stairs? A. At the door-he had time to go and take the watch then; when I went up stairs he stood at the door-he could have gone to the mantel-piece and taken the watch before he followed me up stairs.</p>

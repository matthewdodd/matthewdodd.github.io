I reside at Maidenhead—on 20th July, about one o'clock in the morning, I was near Shoreditch Railway Station—some one struck me from behind—I turned round and saw some one but not suffi<lb></lb>ciently to swear to either of the prisoners.—I was stunned and fell down—my throat was very sore afterwards—I was picked up by a cabman—I missed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my right-hand troupers' pocket—a policeman came up and we went to the station.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi>, 112). On the morning of 20th July, I was on duty in Shoreditch—I heard faint cries of "Police" on the other side of the street—a cab-rank divides the street—I went across and found the prosecutor on his back—the two prisoners were there and another man and woman, and directly they saw we they called out "<hi rend="italic">Rouse</hi>"—Pinkney was close to the prosecutor—they all ran away—I followed and caught Pinkney at the bottom of New Street, Commercial Street—I can swear that both the prisoners were near the prosecutor when I first went—on the way to the station the prosecutor said he had lost 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was quite sober—Haines came to the station afterwards, and I took him in custody.</p>

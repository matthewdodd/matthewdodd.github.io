               <p>I am in partnership with my father; I went the 20th of April with the constable, I went to a public house in the neighbourhood of Covent-garden, Russell-street; I believe the constable found the key of his box in his pocket, he found these nails there; the papers of the chair nails have our private mark; the coffin nails have no mark on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sell these? - No, we never sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that? - From his own confession.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say so independent of that? - No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I generally went out for orders; I was ordered by Mr. Bent to call on the customers, I called on a customer who gave me an order for these things, and Mr. Bent and I we did not settle sometimes for some weeks, and there was a balance remaining frequently between him and I for three weeks, and I took these to my lodgings with a view of taking them to the man, I had an order besides to go very near to the place where this man lived; when the night he called on me to settle with him I was behind hand, I had not cash to make up; he said that if I expected any mercy of him I must send for somebody to make up the cash; he seemed to express a concern for the present unhappy situation in which I am involved in; says he, I will do every thing in the world if you will tell me how matters stand with you, but if I would not the utmost of the law should be exercised; I told him I would tell the truth, and he went out and got a constable, and when the constable came I gave him the key, and he found the things in my box.</p>

I saw him about five weeks after, at another sale; he ran away, and I did did not see again till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suspect you have been listening to the last trial? A. Not particularly - I did not tell him to sell them - I gave the things into his hands, and afterwards saw him sitting on them, smoking a pipe; he was taken at a sale in Baker-street, Portman-square - I did not see him take the things away - I did not hang them on the rails, or tell him to sell them. I believe he said something about selling them - I told him not.</p>

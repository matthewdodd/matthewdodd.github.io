The prisoner came to lodge with us on Tuesday night, the 31st of August and left on Saturday morning, the 2nd of September about seven o'clock. My husband had gone out about a quarter to six o'clock. Before the prisoner went out, I heard a noise in the room where he lodged, like a box being broken open. I got up, and went into the front parlour, and waited there until the prisoner came down stairs. I saw him at the foor of the stairs, with a large bundle in his hand, and asked him what it was; he said it was a bundle which he had brought with him the night before. I said he had brought none on the night before, for I had met him in the passage, and gave him a light and he had none. I took the bundle out of his hand, and on his turning to go out, I saw my lodger's waistcoat in his pocket; his name is Cartwright; he slept in the same room. I bolted the street door to prevent his going out. He went up into his own room, and I saw him take out of his pocket, Cartwright's handkerchief, waistcoat, and a pair of blue stockings; and he had Cartwright's trowsers on over his own; I saw him take them off. I went next door and got two young men to my assistance. There was two coats and a shirt in the bundle. One coat belonged to my husband, and all the other things to Cartwright, who had lodged nearly five years with us. I know his things; he had slept there, and gone out at half past six o'clock. I looked at his box, and found the lock broken open. I went for an officer, and gave the prisoner in charge with the property. My husband's coat had been in Cartwright's box. I had washed his linen several times and knew it well, and the coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When I took the lodging did I not refer you to persons who knew me? - A. He referred me to his uncle, but we did not enquire till the day of the robbery. The property was in a box, which has a moulding round the edge of the lid; I believe it is called a lipping, which came about half an inch over. He made no particular resistance; he ran up stairs when I bolted the door. I saw the waistcoat hanging out of his pocket, and saw him take it out; also the handkerchief and stockings.</p>

On the morning of the 2nd of September, I went out about half past six, and left the prisoner in bed; he slept in my room. I had a box there, it was locked on the Tuesday night; I did not try it afterwards. I had left a coat, trowsers, shirt, waistcoat, handkerchief, and stockings in it; and a coat of Richards's, which I had made for him: he did not want it, and so it was left in my box.</p>

On Sunday, 9th May, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for a pennyworth of pills; he paid me with a shilling—I found it was bad, bent it, and asked him how many pieces he had passed to us previously, having several times seen him in the shop before—he said he had not passed any that he was aware of; an officer was called in, and I gave him the shilling.</p>

                  </hi>. On Friday, 14th May, I was assisting at the Princess of Wales—the prisoner came in for half a pint of porter—he gave me a shilling—I thought it was not. good, and put it down by the side of the till—after he was gone I tried it, and it was bad—I called Mr. Callingham and showed it him—he was looking at it when another man came in and put down a shilling for half a pint of porter—I took up that shilling and found it was bad—I had that other man detained, and I went to the door and looked down the lane; I saw the prisoner standing in the middle of the footpath—I went and took hold of him and brought him back—I said he had been in about 10 minutes before, and given a bad shilling—he said he had not been in the house before—I am quite certain be is the man—I marked the shilling and gave it to the policeman; and also the shilling I took from the other man—the prisoner had a smockfrock on over his great coat, and when I took him he had his great coat over his smockfrock.</p>

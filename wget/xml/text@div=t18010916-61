               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. In the course of three-quarters of an hour, Kent might have got away? - A.Most certainly he might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Myers tell you, when you found him, that he had been at work all night upon the river, and had laid down to take his rest? - A. No, he did not.</p>

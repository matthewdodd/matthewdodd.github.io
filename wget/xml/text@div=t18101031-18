             is my partner. I lost eight yards of Hollands jean and a piece of wrapper, on the evening of the 8th of October, about a quarter before seven o'clock, I received information by some of our men. I went into the warehouse where the porter cleaned shoes, I saw this wrapper and jean.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner any thing to you - A. He was <rs id="t18101031-18-deflabel107" type="occupation">porter</rs>

The prisoner was then out delivering goods. I came into the accompting house after that, the prisoner came in half past seven, he was in the shop a little while, and after that he went down into this warehouse and stopped there two or three minutes; he then went into the cutting-room, which is another part of the warehouse, four story high. While he was gone there I went down into this warehouse, and saw the jean and wrapper was removed, in consequence of that I was sure he was the thief. I then went for an officer, and had them in the accompting house, waiting till our men went at eight o'clock; the prisoner was going, he had got the door in his hand. I called him into the accompting-house, I told him I thought he had part of our property upon him; he denied it. When the officer was coming to search him he put his hand into his inside jacket pocket, he took the jean and wrapper out, he said he only wanted an apron. I asked him what he did with the jean, he made no answer. He had lived with me eleven days.</p>

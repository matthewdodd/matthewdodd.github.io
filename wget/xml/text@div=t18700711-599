I live at 15, Park Villas—on the night of 7th June, a few minutes before 6 o'clock, I was going into my house, and noticed smoke coming out of the back of the house—I thonght it was a chimney on fire, and took no further notice—about three-quarters of an hour afterwards I saw smoke issuing from several of the windows—the front door was open, and I went straight into the house, went up stairs to the first floor, and saw through a hole in the wall that the room immediately facing me was in flames, and that it was unsafe to open the door, so I passed on to the other three rooms, and found fires burning under the beds in all the rooms—I afterwards saw a fire in the wardrobe in one of those rooms, and another fire in a chest of drawers in another room—I then went down stairs and saw the prisoner—there were no firemen or police—I asked her where her master and mistress were—she said her mistress had gone to the horse show, and her master was to meet her there—I asked her when the fire broke out—she said about half an hour after her mistress left—I inquired what time that was—I think she said something like 2 o'clock—I said I thought that very improbable, as there was so small an amount of smoke at 6 o'clock—"he said "It must have been 3.30"—while holding the conversation I noticed five issuing from the crevices round the door of the front sitting room—I opened the door, and the room was densely black with smoke, which almost knocked me back; but I could see a fire burning in the centre of the room—I got one or two neighbours, and we threw some pails of water on it—I asked the prisoner if she knew where the fire broke out, but she gave no precise answer, except as to the time—a short time after I was able to get into the room, and found that the heap that was burning was composed of newspapers and leaves torn out of a novel—in the back drawing-room a hole was bored through the table—I went into the garden and saw some</p>

On the 9th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in my shop; the prisoner and three others came in together - the other three bought 1d. worth of tobacco each; the prisoner asked for nothing - these snuff-boxes were on the counter within their reach, but there was a wire guard before them - they paid for the tobacco, and all went away together: a lad came, and gave me information almost immediately; I then pursued, and found them all together about one hundred yards off - I laid hold of the prisoner, and charged him with having stolen a snuff-box; he denied it - the other three went on; they returned after I had taken him to the watch-house - he was searched, but no box found; I perceived a vacancy on the tray, which was not so when they came in, I am certain - there was one or two other customers in the shop, who remained there after I received the information; one of them went with me to assist - the prisoner was close to the guard; the others were at the bottom of the counter, and could not have taken it - I saw the box before the Magistrate, and knew it; immediately I laid hold of the prisoner I observed his arm move, and the box was thrown into the middle of the street.</p>

            . I am warehouse boy to Mr. Morris, a parchment manufacturer. I was outside the prosecutor's window, looking through, and saw the prisoner take the box; directly he came out, I informed Edwards, and ran after him; I saw him taken, and saw him throw the box across the road - I took it up, and gave it to Goodhew.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How could you distinguish me from the rest of the men? A. By seeing him take it, and he was nearest the guard.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in Cannon-street, and saw the prisoner and three more go by; I saw the prosecutor seize him; I went up, and received him in charge - Brown picked up the box, which I had heard full.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On returning from work, with the other three men, one of them proposed going to this shop to buy tobacco; they lodge in the same house with me, and I went with them; when we came out this gentleman seized me, and said I had taken a snuff-box - the boy said he could swear to me because I wore a smock-frock.</p>

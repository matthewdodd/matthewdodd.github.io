               <p>Had you any conversation with her? - No, not in the least, I left the house in three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>How much gin had you there? - I do not know, I paid nine-pence.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk or sober at that time? - I was not drunk.</p>

               <p>Was you quite sober? - I had been spending my evening at Cow-cross with a waggoner; I was sober enough.</p>
               <p>What became of you after? - I went out to go home to bed.</p>
               <p>Are you a married man or a single man? - A single man; I had got about forty yards from the place, and the two prisoners came one on each side; it was a bright night; I had seen the prisoner Green before; they asked me if I would go and drink any more any where, I said, I was going home to bed, I would not go any where; in a minute's time I thought I felt my coat slip on one side, and I was looking first on one side, and then on the other, and I found my purse was gone; they ran away, and then I suspected them; I took out my purse at the Red-lion to pay, it was seen there.</p>
               <p>What was in your purse? - Twenty-eight pounds, as near as I can guess, there were some half guineas, and twenty-two guineas, and thirty shillings in silver.</p>
               <p>There was no violence used to you? - No, nobody else was near me; it was done in a minute; the prisoners were off before I perceived I had lost my purse; but I felt my pocket lightened of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. Did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178605310057"></xptr> you know Charlotte Green before? - I knew nothing of her before, but I might have seen her before.</p>
               <p>Had you seen her before that evening? - I had seen her before that evening.</p>
               <p>Do you know where she lodged? - No.</p>
               <p>You immediately made a hue and cry about this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The woman went down Featherstone-buildings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had been supping with the waggoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might you have been drinking with the waggoner before you got to the Red-lion? - 'Till about ten.</p>
               <p>What liquor might you have had? - About two or three pints of beer and ale.</p>
               <p>Had you any spirits? - No.</p>
               <p>How many glasses of gin at the Red-lion? - I did not keep any particular account, not above three glasses.</p>
               <p>Was not you very beastly drunk? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Did not Mrs. Sparrow see you? - Yes, she keeps a publick house.</p>
               <p>Was you or was you not very drunk, that is my question? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Do you know a young lady of the name of Horne? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not there such a body in custody for taking your purse? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Was not such a person taken up? - She did not come to me; I did not take her up.</p>
               <p>How many times were the prisoners examined? - Three times.</p>
               <p>Was you always positive to Green? - Yes.</p>

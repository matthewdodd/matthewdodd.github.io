                  </hi>. I am a plumber and paper-hanger, and live in Cannon-street-road. I heard a noise in my shop, which induced me to go into it—I saw the prisoner there, and asked him what he wanted—he pretended to be drunk, and asked the price of some pieces of paper—I told him the price<lb></lb>—he said he would call again—I kept looking out, and on Saturday, the 20th, at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, I heard the same noise again, I looked through a hole, and saw him in the shop, I saw him take a bundle of paper, put it on his shoulder, and walk off with it—I went out, followed him, saw a policeman, and let him follow him—he said I had better go back, and I gave it into his hands.</p>

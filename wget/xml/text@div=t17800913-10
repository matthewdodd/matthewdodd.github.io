               <p>I was frightened with the riots, and hid my money under a flag in my cellar on the 8th of June, twelve guineas and two shillings, and I put a half crown more there on the 30th of June, at night, because the mob had threatened to burn my house. I saw my money there on the 30th of June when I put the half crown in. I went to work the next morning. My wife did not know that the money was there. The plumber came and she gave him the key. I knew nothing of it till the next morning, when my wife told me the <rs id="t17800913-10-deflabel60" type="occupation">plumber</rs>

I went down to look for the money, it was gone; the flag was for a step. I put it under it in a rag. The plumber took that flag up to lay the pipe down. I did not hear for a month who the plumber was, till my landlord came to town from Blackheath and informed me. Then the prisoner was taken up on suspicion, but denied the fact.</p>

               <p>I am a master plumber in Red-lion-street, Whitechapel. I went on the 1st of July, to charge the pipe in the cellar, where this man lives. I gave directions to the prisoner to open the ground to change the pipe. There was nobody employed but him and I. I ordered him to take the stone up; I was in the cellar all the time, but a little way from him when he took it up; when he had taken it up, I saw something in his hand; I do not know what it was, it looked like a rag, and I thought I heard something chink. I said, What have you got there? He said nothing, master, and thrust it into his breeches pocket. He said he was made for ever. I asked him what it was he had got once or twice after, he waved it, and would not let me know what it was. I intended to have told his master the circumstance, but it slipped my memory; he is the paviour's man. I thought no more of the affair till a month after, when the prosecutor came, and then he was taken up upon my information.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. What did you put the money in? - In a little silk purse, and wrapped a bit of woollen rag about the purse.</p>
               <p>Is this cellar a part of the house? - Yes, it is immediately under the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I dug up the ground by the direction of the plumber; there was nothing that I saw in the cellar but brick rubbish, so help me God. Four weeks after, this gentleman came to accuse me.</p>
               <p>To Clavering. Why did not you mention it to the woman of the house that you had seen the prisoner take something? - I did not know that it was money.</p>
               <p>Jury. You said the prisoner said he was made for ever; did not you from that circumstance think it was money? - I spoke to him about it once or twice after.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a case maker, of No. 106, Wardour-street. I know Kelsey—on 21st Aug. he had been in my employ about ten days, or a fortnight—he worked on my premises—I do not know Ford—I have a stable is Newman's-mews, Oxford-street, between 200 and 300 yards from my premises—on 31st Aug., about 9 o'clock in the evening, I had a mare safe in the stable—the stable door was locked, but the wicket gate of the coach house was not locked—it could be opened by anybody acquainted with the premises, by putting a small instrument through it could be unlatched—there is a communication between the coach house and the stable—Kelsey worked in my workshop, which was over the stable—one of my men made a communication to me next morning, and about a quarter of an hour after that a policeman came; I went with him to the Green Yard, nearly opposite Drury-lane Theatre, where I was shown my mare—there was no marks on the stable or coach house door—I found the stable door shut and locked—the man who came to me is not here.</p>

On Tuesday night, 31st Aug., about 12 o'clock, I was on duty in Smithfield, and saw Ford leading a mare, and Kelsey about twenty yards behind him, both going towards Long-lane—Ford said, pointing to Kelsey, and in his hearing, "I give that man in charge for horse stealing"—Kelsey said he knew nothing of the horse, and he had not seen Ford before that night—Ford said that they had changed Clothes, and had been both together and stolen the horse—Kelsey said he did not know anything of the horse, and had not seen it before—I took it to the Green Yard, and afterwards showed it to Mr. Mellish—I took the prisoners into custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I am a stable man. I have known Kelsey about a month or six weeks—I knew him here last Session—I did not know him to be in the service of Mr. Mellish—on 30th or 31st Aug. I saw him at the bottom of Holborn-hill, by the Anchor public-house, Farringdon-street; I was going there, and so was he—we had some conversation in the house, and then went outside—he said he could get a horse if he knew where to dispose of it—I said he could dispose of it in Whitecross-street—he asked me if I would go with him, and I said I would—he did not say where—we went into another public-house, and he asked me if I had a knife—I said, No"—he said he must have a knife or a chisel, as anything of that kind would</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Kelsey's Defence.</hi> What Ford states is quite false; I met him, and he asked me to buy some pawn tickets of stolen property; I said, "No;" he afterwards said, "I have nothing to do; is there any chance of getting a horse?" I told him where the horse was, and he went away and brought it—I saw it, and said I would have nothing to do with it; he had my hat and coat on; I said, "Give me my hat and coat, and I will go;" he said, If you do not take care I will turn round upon you in a moment."</p>

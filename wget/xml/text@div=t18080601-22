               <p>Q. How many people lodged in the house besides yourself - A. Six or seven; I slept with my father only.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time that you missed these notes - A. I missed the whole on the 19th of April, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; I put my hand in my pocket for some silver, I missed my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been any where that day, that you might have supposed your pocket might be picked - A. No; I had been in no company at all that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. No, no more than a person let me know after I advertised it, that she had got it; I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it you advertised it - A. I put the advertisement in the next day, it came out on the 21st; then I got information from Sedgely where the money was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no drawers in your father's room that you might have put it in - A. Yes; but I meaned to go with it to my brother on the Sunday following.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, I live in Downe street, Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, many years; she is a chair woman. On the 19th of April, between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner came to me and her sister along with her, she told me she had a good find; she said if I would let her sit down she would shew me; she pulled out a black leather purse and desired me to look at what was in the inside; she said she had changed a one pound note; I looked in the purse. I found three one pound notes, a two pound, and a forty pound bank note; she said she found it in Oxford street; I told her it was a good find, it was of consequence, as it was such a sum of money there was do doubt it would be advertised; they agreed to leave it my hands; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010019"></xptr>did leave it in my hands I told them after they left it in my hands that if there was an advertisement for it, I would wish them to give it up; I said I dare say there would be a ten pound reward for it, and that would do her more good than if she had kept the whole; I told her I would look after the newspapers, and when it was so I would go with her and see that she had the bounty; the next morning as soon as I came to my business her sister came up to me at six o'clock, I had not been with her two minutes before I saw the prisoner and another person with her, that I did not approve of; they both came to me, and the prisoner asked me for her property; I told her that as she made a demand of it I should give it her; I was very sorry she had altered her disposition, I would have no more to do with it; I fetched the money from my home; they came to me at my stall, there I left them. On my return I met Saunders and his wife; Saunders asked me to let him look at the notes; I had a better opinion of him than them drunken brutes; I delivered to Saunders the leather purse, containing the three one pound notes, one two, and a forty pound note; this was Wednesday morning I delivered it up; on the Thursday it was advertised; I led such an abuseful life by the woman after I delivered it up, that I could not do my business; then I went and found the young man that belonged to it; from thence I went to Marlborough street and related the matter to a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Walford. You told us you knew the prisoner - I believe you know the prisoner can neither read nor write - A. I believe she is a stranger to both.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her in distinct terms, what the notes were - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her a pound - A. No; she told me she had changed one of the one pound notes.</p>

I met him on Wednesday morning close to his stall; he gave me the purse, which he said he received from my sister in law; I never took the purse out of his hand, nor opened it, till I saw my sister in law; she asked me for it, and I gave it her.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Walford. Can you read and write - A. Yes, both.</p>

               <p>Court to Sedgely. Did you tell Saunders what value was in the purse - A. I did, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was advertised the next day, which was Thursday - did you give any information to the prisoner that it was advertised - A. I did; her brother in law was with me at the time that I saw the advertisement; it was in the mouths of every body almost; I told Nixon the same day; I told her the same day, upon her saying that she had not got the money, that if she did not content herself about it, I would go and settle the business at once; when I found she was not satisfied, I went and let the prosecutor know.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if it had not been for that you would not have discovered it - A. Yes, I would, because it was advertised in a pitiful manner, that it was lost front a poor man, if he did not get it, it would be his total ruin.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. You tell me your money was safe at between four or five o'clock on Tuesday afternoon - you went from Glocester place where you lodge to Green street, Glovesnor square; in going to Green street did you go near Oxford road - A. Yes, I went across Oxford street.</p>
               <p>Q.You do not recollect meeting any crowd of people - A. No, nor any person coming near me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find you had lost it at Green street, or when you returned to Glocester place - A. I found I had lost it just after I came out of Green street.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNEDY. I went from Marlborough street to apprehend the prisoner, on the 22nd of April, about ten o'clock in the morning; the prisoner was rather worse for liquor; I searched her pockets, I found nothing but a few halfpence, I asked her what she had done with the young man's forty odd pounds; she said she had spent it; I asked her which way she could spend so much money in so few days; she said she paid ten pounds to an undertaker for burying her husband; I asked her where the undertaker lived; she could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You found none of the money on her - A. No; the purse was never recovered.</p>

On the evening of the 30th of October Couche, my shopman, spoke to me; the prisoner was then in my shop, looking at some striped twilled cotton - I observed her; she made a purchase, and paid for it: she was then going towards the door; I stopped her, and stated that I suspected she had more about her person than belonged to her - she remonstrated, and said her name was Polland or Pollock; I stated more particularly then what I suspected, and offered to search her - she did not appear at all inclined to submit to it: she said it was impossible she could have done such a thing; I then sent for my housekeeper to search her; I talked of sending for an officer - she said, "You need not do that - I will give you what you want;" she then put her hand under her dress, and drew out this piece of cotton; she put her hand through what I suppose was her pocket-hole, but I cannot say whether she put her hand into her pocket - she drew out this cotton - it was rather loose; she had a shawl on: it is an article of the same description and colour as what she bought, but it is finer; she had the piece she had bought in a paper in her hand - she had got about six feet from the counter before I spoke to her. I saw a number of pieces of calico on the counter while she was bargaining, but I cannot say I saw this piece in particular - I am sure I had seen it a few days before; here is our shop mark on it, made by Price, my partner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Where is what she bought? A. Here it is. She has been bailed before Sir John Bailey; the piece she bought is of more value than this; there were twelve or fourteen people in the shop - none of them are here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not tell you that if she had it, it must be quite a mistake - she was incapable of such an act? A. She said she was incapable of such an act; I do not know that she said it was a mistake; she said she had bought things of me before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she not the week before laid out 13l. or 14l. at your shop, and your porter taken the goods home? A. I cannot speak to that; I am out of the shop half my time - a Mrs. Poland laid out as much.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When she said she was incapable of such an act, did you know she had this cotton about her? A. No.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutors'. - The prisoner came and asked me for red twilled cotton; I showed her a wrapper, containing a great many pieces - she was a considerable time at the counter, and I noticed her unpin her shawl, which was pinned high up, and pin it down low; she then asked the price of another piece, which was at a distance, and I noticed something drawn off, and the heap shrunk; she then paid me 4s. 4 1/2d. for the piece she bought. I told Mr. Petherbridge what I saw - he spoke to her; she had then arisen to go, and had got about six yards from the counter. Mr. Petherbridge took her into the back warehouse; I heard him before that say he had reason to suspect she had got more than she had paid for; she said, "Oh! I am incapable of such an act - I am Mrs. Polland (or) Pollock," or some such a name; Mr. Petherbridge said he would have her searched by a female, and send for an officer - she then put her hand into her pocket-hole, drew out this piece of cotton, and said, "Do not send for an officer - I will make you any recompense you please."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you know her? A. No; I have not been there more than two months - I cannot say whether she has bought things before: she gave the name of Poland at the office. She did not say our porter had carried goods home. She produced the cotton from her pocket-hole: the cotton is worth 2s. 11d. - it is much finer than what she bought.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was she sitting or standing when she altered her shawl? A. Sitting close to the counter.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and took the prisoner - the property was then on the counter; she sent a boy with a note to her husband.</p>
               <p>MR. PETHERBRIDGE re-examined. I have thirteen or fourteen shopmen. I recollect the transaction of the 13l. - it was my own transaction - I think the goods were sent to No. 13, Alie-street.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Is this the bill of the goods? A. Yes - it is 13l. 6s.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no defence, but five witnesses gave her an excellent character, and stated her to have seven children, and to be in respectable circumstances.</p>

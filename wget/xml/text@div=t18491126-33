                  </hi>. I am the son of Moses Lazarus, a grocer, of White<lb></lb>chapel; the prisoner was in his service about seven months. On 10th Nov. I marked some shillings, in the presence of Henry Joel—I gave them to Joel, and he took them away with him—I came the next morning, looked in the till, and found the marked money was not there—I sent for Joel, and he said he had paid the prisoner the money—I sent for a policeman, called the prisoner in, and accused him of having the money—he begged my mercy, and said, "Don't go hard against me"—three shillings were found on him—two</p>

               <p>of them were what I had marked and given to Joel—he asked again for mercy, and said, "You may have a brother of your own in the same situation" I—no one but the prisoner was allowed to serve; the other man was only warehouseman.</p>

                  </hi>. I received the marked shillings, and went home—I next morning I put myself in a position to see the prosecutor's shop—I sent I three persons in to buy things—I gave each of them a marked shilling—I saw them when they went in, and when they came out with the butter and change for a shilling—I came past the shop, and saw the prisoner behind the butter-counter—there was a man sweeping the door—the other man could not have served in the shop, because I stood outside all the time.</p>

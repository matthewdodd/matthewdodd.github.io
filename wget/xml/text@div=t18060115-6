             sworn. On Saturday evening, in the early part of December, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, returning home from Lamb's-conduit street, with three of my neighbours, I heard a woman call out Stop thief; I was in the beginning of Guildford Place.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Guildford Place a square or a street? A. It joins Lamb's-conduit-street; it is a street, there is about two houses on each side, I believe. When I heard the woman cry out Stop thief, I saw a man running towards me and my neighbours, but seeing of us he took another course, he ran strait down Guildford-street till he came to Carolina Place, then he turned up there; I immediately ran after him, he dropped a bundle.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you pick it up or how? - A. I stepped over it and pursued the man; when I came to the end of Carolina Place, there was a man had got the prisoner at the bar in custody. I heard the prisoner ask the person that is here a witness, what he had hold of him for, he had done nothing; he was taken to the watchouse.</p>
               <p>Q. When you set about pursuing him after you heard the woman cry out Stop thief, had you your eye upon him the whole time? - A. I had till he came to the corner of Carolina Place, then I was obstructed by the corner of the Foundling wall.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might that interruption continue? - A. I suppose about five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had turned the corner, and by that means could see, what did you observe? A. Before I got to the corner he was taken into custody; he was then at the other end of Carolina Place when I got up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of observing his dress? - A. No, not till he was taken; it was rather a cloudy night, the moon was shining, but not bright.</p>

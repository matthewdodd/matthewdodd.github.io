I am manager of the Bank of London, in Threadneedle-street—on 7th April, in consequence of a communication made to me by the last witness, I went to the front of the counter and spoke to Major, and beckoned him into my private room—I then said, "Where did you get the cheque?"—he said he had been requested to present it by a friend of his, of the name of Godfrey—I said, "Who and what is Mr. Godfrey?"—he said, "He is a ganger on the railway"—I said, "Why did not Mr. Godfrey pre<lb></lb>sent it himself?"—he said that he had been drinking, and did not like to come into the bank—I said, "There is considerable difference between the writing on this cheque and our customer's signature," and there was evi<lb></lb>dently some irregularity about the affair, and if Mr. Godfrey would not</p>

               <p>come in we had better go out and see him in the street, and hear what he had to say—I also asked him to describe Mr. Godfrey's appearance, which he did very accurately—I then accompanied Major to the door of the bank, and I saw the other prisoner on the opposite side of the way, and observed that they recognized each other—Hawkins appeared to be about to walk off, but I went with Major across the road quickly, and said to him, "I want to speak to you about the cheque on the bank, which you have asked your friend to cash for you?"—he said he knew nothing about the bank, or about any cheque—I said, "Nonsense, you do, a cheque on the Bank of London"—he said no, he did not know anything about any cheque, and had never been in the bank in his life—I then said to Major, "This is Mr. Godfrey," and Major said, "Yes, it is"—we were all standing close together—Hawkins said, "My name is not Godfrey, and I know nothing about the man"—while I was hesitating what to do, and trying to catch the eye of a porter on the back steps, I heard Hawkins say to Major, "You managed that job very badly"—it was said in an undertone, but I heard it very distinctly—while they were denying knowledge of each other, I said to Hawkins, "You have seen the man Major, where did you see him?" and he said, "I saw him at Caunt's public-house this morning, and that is all I know of him"—I insisted upon their going into the bank, which they were not willing to do at first, and I sent for officers, and they were taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Artichoke public-house, in White Hart-court, Drury-lane. The prisoner received no wages from me, but he lived and lodged in my house—he had no other support than what he had from me—he had victuals and lodgings, but no wages—I gave him clothes occasionally—about four o'clock in the afternoon of the 9th of September, I gave the prisoner a watch-chain, two seals, and a mourning ring, to go and pawn, to get 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them—I wanted to oblige a friend—he went, and I saw no more of him till the officer had him, on the Tuesday night following—this is the watch and chain—I employed him as a servant to do this; and when he did any thing for me, of course, I paid him—I was to give him nothing for this—he is a tailor by trade—he has been in my house for two years—I gave him money to set his dinner not ten minutes before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I should wish to know what board and lodging he gave me—he did not give me victuals—if I did any work for him he let me have bread and cheese and beer, and then deducted it from my wages for making clothes for him—I made his clothes and his family's for years, and never received a farthing from him.</p>

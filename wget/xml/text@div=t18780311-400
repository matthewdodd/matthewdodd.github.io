A policeman then came to the cell door, and I asked the warder to let me put on my coat. She stood there with the warder, and then they brought me out and stood three more men with me. She did not say I was the man, but walked away with the warder. I was locked up for five weeks and did not know the dates till I came up here last Session, and I have two letters here to prove where I was (<hi rend="italic">Handing them in to Court</hi>). I own to giving one of the florins, but I did not know it was bad. Those letters will show that I could not have been there, and that I was working hard throwing up ballast. I could have proved it at the time, but after being locked up Ave weeks the man I was working with might forget the date. I did wear earrings. I am perfectly innocent.</p>

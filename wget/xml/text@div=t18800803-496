                  </hi>. I live at 45, Bread Street, Mile End, and am a dry<lb></lb>salter—I lived with the prisoner for about 12 years—about 8.15 on the 19th July I got home and found in the kitchen two straw beds which had been brought down from an upper room with a newspaper between them—one-twelfth part was burnt, and the ticking was partly burnt—my impres<lb></lb>sion is the fire had been put out—the prisoner was in the pawage—I asked her what she had done that for, and she said she intended to burn the stock and wished she had done so—the stock consisted of sauces and Seidlitz powders and various goods which I had manufactured—she had been drinking—I sent for a constable—there was no one else in the house, I believe.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I was at home several times in the course of the day—the newspaper had burnt, as the straw had burnt.</p>

There had been continual altercations for years, and she threatened to take my life, and said she would put a knife through my b—<hi rend="italic">guts</hi>—I have eight children by her; she attends to them what she is sober, and is a good mother—the drinking has been going on five or sir years; during that time I have lived at 13 or 14 different places, and have had ejectment after ejectment in consequence of her drinking—I allow her a certain amount of money to keep the house, and when that is expended if she chooses to drink she pawns things—it is true that she was a week without money, and had to go into the workhouse and take her dead baby—before it died I was laid up with bronchitis, and the child had taken bronchitis at the same time, and was lying in the same room as myself—I dare not trust her with money—I had a cheque sent to me which I went with to a public-house to get changed, and when I came back I found she had removed the child from her cot from the warm room, and was lying in a cold room—she resisted me, and would not allow the child to be taken back into the warm room—I went for the police, and they said they could not interfere—I was almost in a dying state at the time, but I managed to crawlas far as the relieving officer's—it was then about 11 o'clock atnight—he said "I cannot do anything now, I will come down to your place to-morrow</p>

               <p>morning at 9 o'clock"—she expressed herself in gross language to me—it is not true that anybody left my house <hi rend="italic">enceinte</hi> by me—I did not give the prisoner in custody so that I should get rid of her; I did not want to get rid of her if she went on well—it was my immediate object to get rid of her—I had this agreement drawn out for a separation, but she begged and entreated of me not to separate from me—when I first made her acquaintance I believe she had an allowance from her father-in-law—she was a widow—her hus<lb></lb>band, I believe, was a clerk at a stone merchant's.</p>

The prisoner got up early on the morning in question and got the children off to a school-treat—after they were gone she asked me for some money, and I think I said I had not got any to give her—I did not go out and come back in the middle of the day and ask what there was for dinner; I came in about 4.30, and said, "I have had no dinner, will you get the tea ready; I shall be back Again presently"—I did not say I could not eat what was left from the Sunday—she said that I had no right to leave her night after night—I did not say to her, "Ah, young lady, I will put you somewhere, where you will not be able to annoy me or any<lb></lb>body else"—I have said I would put an end to her watching me—I spend my evening in a public-house because I cannot spend them at home—she was always jealous—I did not give her cause—she had a room and furniture in it when I first lived with her—she did not provide for me—there was a seizure of goods, but I believe none of hers were taken.</p>

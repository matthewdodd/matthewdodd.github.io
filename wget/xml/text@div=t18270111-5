            . I am shepherd to Mr. Trimmer. On Thursday afternoon, the 21st of December, between three and four o'clock, I had seven score and fourteen of his sheep safe in an enclosed meadow, belonging to Mr. Tinder, and on the next morning, between nine and ten o'clock, one was missing - I searched all round the ditches and about the meadow, but could not find it - it has not been found; it could not have strayed.</p>

            's sheep were there; it was a dark sheep, like the rest: when he passed me, I said, Halloo; and he said, Halloo, in a very gruff manner - he had hold of the two fore-feet, the head hung before and the legs behind; I stood in the gap-way, and saw him go into his grandmother's with it; he lives just above my mother, but he took it into his grandmother's - I was so near him, that the sheep's head brushed against me - I have known him for three years; it was not quite light.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How could you tell whether it was a sheep or not, when I had it on my shoulder in a sack? A. It was not in a sack, but naked on his shoulder.</p>

            . I am an ostler at the King's Arms. The prisoner brought the great coat up the yard, up to the tap-room, and not finding any body up at the tap-room he brought the coat to me, I was at the stable-door; he asked me to take care of the coat till he called for it, I took the coat and he went. In about ten minutes the prosecutor came up the yard with the cart, and told me that he had lost his coat; I shewed him the coat, he said, it was his coat, he told me not to let the man have the coat. In about a quarter of an hour afterwards the prisoner came back, he asked me for the coat, I told him a man had been up the yard and owned the coat, and he must go along with me to Leadenhall-market, to the man; I asked him how he came by the coat; he told me it was his coat, he had had it a twelve-month; he went with me to Leadenhall-market to the prosecutor's; and going down Lime-street, I said, you are sure that is your coat; he said, no, I am not sure, the man down here gave me the coat to bring to the King's Arms tap; he said there is the man, he wanted to go down Fenchurch-street, and pointed to a man, I told him he should not go down there, if he saw the man he should call to the man, or send for him; I took him into the Poultry-market to Mr. Wasket.</p>

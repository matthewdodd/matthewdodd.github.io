                  </hi>. I superintend the business of my brother, Moses Hart, who is a linendraper, in Hounsditch. The prisoner had been fourteen days in his employ as shopman—he left on the 14th of May, about a quarter to nine o'clock in the evening, not in his usual way—he seemed agitated and anxious to go—he did not return—he had given no notice of leaving—I missed a great deal of silk next day—this fifteen yards was afterwards found—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>—it is my brother's—one length was cut off a large roll.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Can you swear to the silk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—this piece has been three years in the house—there is nothing more peculiar about it than other silk, but I am perfectly sure it is my brother's—he referred me to Deptford for his character—I did not go there till after this was found out, and then found he had robbed them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Crown-street, Finsbury. The prisoner came to our house on the evening of the 14th of May, to pledge this silk—I asked him who it belonged to—he said, to his mother—that she had bought them for her own wear, and that she was a widow—I thought it odd a widow should wear coloured silks—and from the evasive answers he gave me I suspected he had stolen them, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-house at Poplar—on Wednesday, 17th September, McGivan opened the door about 4 p.m., and two other men came in with two boxes—he took them from them, put them down in the shop, and said to me, "Missus, lend me a shilling"—he had formerly lodged with me, and was coming back; I thought it was his luggage, and lent him 1s—I have never seen the other men before or since—between 4 and 5 o'clock Brock came and said, "You have some boxes here"—I said, "Yes, they belong to an old lodger of mine"—he said, "That is all you know about it"—I said, "Well, no one will have them until he comes for them"—he went</p>

On the evening of September 17th I went to 23, Athol Street, Bromley, where I saw Lee, and said, "You Will be charged with being concerned with others and stealing two boxes from the Liverpool Street Rail way-station"—she said, "I met the prosecutrix yesterday in the Hay market, and took her home with me to sleep with me. I had a ticket relating to the two boxes, which I gave to Mr. McGivan; I got the ticket from a purse which was given to me by the prosecutrix"—I took her in custody—I saw Brock shortly before 7 the same evening—he asked if any report was made with reference to the boxes lost—I said "Yes.—he said, "I can tell you where they are; they are at No. 6, St. Leonards Road"—he gave the wrong number; it was No. 4, a coffee-house—I went there with him and found them there—it was through him that I knew they were there—one was broken open—I did not take Brock then, but I received some information, and took him the same evening at Bishopsgate Police-station.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 29th of December I lost my two window bars; I lost them from under the window about a foot from the front, they were the bars that fastened my windows; I went to the watchman on Sunday evening, and gave information to the watchman, and the man at the turnpike; and in the next morning the man was stopped with them.</p>

               <p>I stopped the man with the bars, on the 31st of December about half after six Monday morning, the prisoner was the man I stopped; the bars were broke in thirteen pieces. (Produced. There were two fish women going along and he was walking behind them with the bars tied up in a little flannel waistcoat. (Deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Pray Mr. Richards have you very attentively looked at these bars? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were the different joints before they were broke in pieces? - I never made a particular examination; I believe the front of my shop is one eight foot and the other six.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you pretend to know these bars from your long acquaintance with them? - From the acquaintance I have had with them, I should do violence to my conscience was I to say they were not mine; I know them from the general appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think there is more or less than your bars would make? - I cannot particularly say.</p>

               <p>I live in Hertfordshire; I was going home in a phaeton between six and seven o'clock in the evening of the 16th of September; it rained very hard and I stopped at Kilburn-wells for a quarter of an hour, then I went into my phaeton and went on; when I had got about half a mile from <placeName id="t17801206-12-crimeloc64">Kilburn-wells</placeName>

               <p>Had you any man servant attending you? - No man servant; they took from me a guinea and an half, and a gold watch; I begged for my watch, but the other man tucked it into his pocket; then they robbed my servant and rode off.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observations upon the horses? - I did; I think the prisoner rode a good looking bay horse, white in his face, rather a low horse; the next morning I came to Sir John Fielding's office; there I described the men and the circumstances attending the robbery; in about a fortnight after I received a letter from Mr. Bond, in consequence of which I came up to town; I saw the prisoner who was in custody; I said I believed him to be the man; I was shewn another man first, but I knew nothing of him.</p>
               <p>What was the ground of your suspicion? - His person and his voice.</p>
               <p>How long time was the robbery in committing? - I believe between five and ten minutes, they were pretty quick; they swore at me and bid me make haste.</p>
               <p>Was there much conversation passed? - yes; I said "there is my money, but my watch</p>
               <p>"I don't like to part with it for it is a family</p>
               <p>"watch," I had been drinking a bottle of wine and was rather in spirits and I talked to them pretty boldly; the other man refused to return my watch.</p>
               <p>Then the conversation was not so much with this man as the other? - The conversation was first with this man, with the other after; I never saw the other man's face; he kept his head at the side of the phaeton; the head of the carriage was up.</p>
               <p>What was the conversation you had with the prisoner? - To give me time and I would give my money; they said come, come, make haste, don't prate; they talked in that stile; I have advertised my watch, but have never heard any thing of it since.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Johnson; I was in the phaeton with him going to his house in Hertfordshire; the prisoner robbed me.</p>
               <p>Are you certain he is the man? - I am positive; I saw him reach his hand over me and rob my master; the prisoner came to my side, the near side, and presented a pistol.</p>
               <p>How long was the robbery in being committed? - Between five and ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Did not an attack of that kind put you into confusion? - No; I was not so frightened at that time as I was afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did you possess yourself so much as to be certain to the person of the prisoner when you only saw him for so small a space of time? - I had seen him on horseback in company with another at Kilburn-wells; we staid at Kilburn-wells between a quarter and half an hour; I got out of the carriage and went into the house; the prisoner was on horseback with another in company; they stood under the trees on account of the weather, as I thought, and I took particular notice of them: I was in a front room which looked towards those trees.</p>
               <p>How came you to make particular observations of these people? - It rained prodigious hard, and I wondered they did not come into the house.</p>
               <p>What was the colour of their horses? - Both of them were bay horses.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any person besides the prisoner come up to the phaeton? - I only saw the prisoner, the other I did not see; the prisoner d - 'd me and told me not to hesitate, but deliver my money immediately. The purse belonged to a friend of mine; I begged of him not to take the purse; he d - 'd me and said don't ask; don't hesitate.</p>
               <p>Did he hold any conversation with Mr. Johnson? - He desired him not to hesitate.</p>
               <p>Are you very positive to the person of the prisoner? - I am; I saw both the pistol; the prisoner held his to my breast; the other pistol was held to my master's neck; I desired the prisoner to withdraw his pistol but he would not; he demanded my watch; I told him I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060015"></xptr> was but a servant and had not got a watch; he felt about me but I had not one.</p>
               <p>Have you any thing further to relate respecting the robbing of your master? - They demanded my master's watch; my master desiring to save his watch, said "he had not got one." The prisoner repied I know you have a watch. My master had pulled his watch out at Kilburn-Wells. They insisted upon having it.</p>

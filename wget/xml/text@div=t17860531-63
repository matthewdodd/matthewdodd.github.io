               <p>I was going up Dean-street, and there is a little court that goes from Wardour-court to Dean-street, called Milk-alley, and I saw the three prisoners coming up the alley, and I observed the prisoner Hurley opening his breeches, and looking into them as he came up the court; there was nobody with me, and I hid myself under some harness till I jumped out upon them all three; I searched the other two first, and searching Hurley, I found this pocket book in his breeches, and he had that blue apron that is on the other lad over it; when I brought him to the office, it wanted a quarter of one; he said, he found it at the Prince of Wales's scaffolding; I found a letter in it directed to Sir Edward, and I went there; the other prisoners said nothing.</p>

               <p>Court to Sir Edward. Had you been in Pall-Mall that morning? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Is that your pocket book? - Yes, I am certain of it; I had it in my right hand pocket; I paid some attention to that side and walked with my stick by my pocket for fear of losing it.</p>

I found my box open, and missed all the things mentioned in the indictment. I went and took the prisoner, at the Black-boy, on Saltpetre-bank. He was asleep, and my father's neck-cloth lay under his head. He took it and put it in his pocket. I asked him to go home with me. Then I took him into the house of a publican where Mr. Carney the constable was.</p>

               <p>He wanted me and three more to go on board an Indiaman. I would not go. He took the other three men on board the Indiaman, and because I would not go, he charged me with stealing these things. I was coming out of the house with a comrade, and picked up a bit of cloth. I said to him, that would do to put about my leg, and put it in my pocket. For two days nobody owned it. When he took me, I told him I found it. I believe he has sent the man out of the way that was with me, that he might not appear.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not ordered something for dinner, and she had been longer than you thought necessary, and you ordered her out of your house, and said she should not sleep another night there? A. I inquired the cause of her absence, and she became very violent - I desired her to produce her key, which she did; I told her to pack up her things and leave the house - I did not settle her wages, as I was not certain of the extent of her misconduct; she did not say she had made use of part of the plate, and begged me, as I had money due to her, to take it out; I think I have paid her 35s. since she has been in custody; I had engaged her at eighteen guineas a year - when she came I told her to keep a book, and put down what she bought; I paid the butcher's bills myself; I believe, for the first ten days she was there I dined at home but once, and on that day I had company; I did not hear her say she had pawned part of my plate to pay for the meat - I missed the plate before she said she had pawned it; I think a porter belonging to Gray's Inn was present before the plate was missed; this altercation took place in the kitchen, which I presume was the place where the plate was kept - I gave it into her care, and had confidence that she would keep it in a proper place.</p>

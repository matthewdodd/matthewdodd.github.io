I live at 10, Marigold Street, Bermondsey—the prisoner's wife is my sister—on 9th March, I came out of a beer-shop and saw the prisoner pulling my sister about in a brutal manner—I asked him to leave off, but he would not—he pulled her across the street, and I went across and stooped to pick her up—he struck me on my forehead with a knife, and twice on my face, and twice on my coat—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my coat—I was in Guy's Hospital three days, and thirteen days at home—I am still under the doctor.</p>

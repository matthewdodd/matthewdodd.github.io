The mark on the silk handkerchiefs was W. W. no part of the property has been recovered, but one waistcoat, which was made; and my sister's handkerchief, which is unmarked; I left my trunks safe at five o'clock; and saw all the clothes; because I had the waistcoat in my hand; the reason I searched the trunk, was, my sister and I were going out, and she wanted her gown; we went up in the garret to get my sister's gown, which had been laying in the trunk, under the waistcoat; we took out the gown, and put the other things in; I saw the waistcoat in the custody of Mr. Armstrong the officer; I missed all the articles to the value of thirty pounds.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Council. Then this policat was brought to you by Armstrong, before you went to the justice's office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then before he came to you, you had no intimation of the property? - No.</p>
               <p>I take it, in looking into this trunk, you were more attentive to find your own clothes, than to observe any other? - When I went to the trunk, I went to take out this gown; I was not looking for the waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was in consequence of the hand bills, that the things were brought to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you give the information to the officers? - The very night it happened.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you recollect the hour at which you fastened your door? - I do not know to the minute, but it was nigh that time.</p>
               <p>What is your reason for recollecting it was about the hour of seven? - Because I know it was but seven; when I was at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220059"></xptr>house it wanted but a few minutes of seven; I took notice of it from a clock in the house; we came down from the place where we was, just as the eight o'clock bell began to ring eight; the bell at St. George's; I heard the eight o'clock bell ring before I left the house.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>When had you received this information respecting Mrs. Hall's burglary? - On Thursday, the 8th of October, I was going down Spital-square, between ten and eleven, in the forenoon, in company with Harper and Shakeshaft; I stopped the prisoner, and searched him; and in his coat-pocket, I found this handkerchief and waistcoat; he was in company with another person, who separated; the waistcoat was wrapped up in the handkerchief; I asked him whole the waistcoat was; he said, it was his own, and he was going to pawn it; he said, he had had it two months; I then told him, we should take him to the justice's; and in company with the other officers; and on my returning, I received this hand-bill, which led me to Mrs. Hall.</p>
               <p>Does that hand-bill describe any such waistcoat? - It says here; one green sattin waistcoat, spotted.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they describe the waistcoat before they saw it? - Mrs. Hall, and her sister, and another, were in the room; they said, they should know the things; the little lady, on seeing it, said; oh, my God, that is my handkerchief! I know it; I hemmed it; that waistcoat has been in my possession ever since; I am sure it is the same that was taken from me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner told you the waistcoat was his own, and always persevered in that story? - Yes, he was taken immediately; when the things were found upon him; and he said, it was his own; he said so when I apprehended him, and also when I took him before the justice.</p>
               <p>(The waistcoat shewn to Mrs. Isabella Hall.)</p>
               <p>This is quite new; it was never worn; when the taylor brought it home, I looked at it, and said, I was happy they had put such buttons upon it, which were the same as the waistcoat; because it was genteeler than metal buttons; I knew the pattern, which me and my sister chose out of three; Mr. Wilson at that time was at my house; he is not in England now.</p>
               <p>Were there strings at the back of it? - Yes, there were three strings on each side.</p>
               <p>Have you any sort of doubt, that was the one you saw at five o'clock? - No.</p>
               <p>Look at the policat handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. This is the same.</p>
               <p>To Hall. Was it such a sort of policat handkerchief, as was lost? - Yes, I cannot speak to the hemming, I could if it was to my own; there was one in the trunk, one of that sort unmarked, and new; this is unmarked and new; upon looking at it now, I am sure it was never washed from the hemming.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The policat handkerchiefs are not at all uncommon? - No.</p>
               <p>To Margaret Hall. Look at that policat handkerchief, do you know your own work? - This is my work.</p>
               <p>Are you able to swear positively? - I am able to swear it is my own hand work, I hemmed it myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you distinguish your hemming from another persons? - I can, by the way that I hem in general, I could not distinguish it after it had been washed, but while new, and before wetted, I could.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know your own hemming? - Because I always fasten the end of my hemming at the bottom, instead of the top.</p>
               <p>Court. Now look at this waistcoat? - This waistcoat is a sort of sattin, like that of Mr. Wilson's, that was lost; and he has another, exactly the same, unmade; the buttons were covered with the same silk; I observed these strings behind, I think it is the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Other sempstresses may fasten down at the bottom, as well as you? - They may.</p>

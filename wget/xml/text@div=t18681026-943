I have also taken hampers to the Great Eastern cloak room—there was writing on the labels, which I could not read—I was in the habit of carrying these hampers to Carr up to the time Bishop was taken—they were not empty hampers, by the weight of them—Bishop was taken on 11th September—I had taken a hamper that evening to the cloak-room, by his direction—I do not know the Patricks.</p>

               <p>minute, and then he said, "I never was at the Ship in my life"—I took him in custody; the charge was read over to him, and he made no reply—between 2 and 3 on the same afternoon, I saw John Patrick coming out of Worship Street Police Court, I said "Halloa, Patrick,"—he stopped, as if startled—I knew him well by sight, and by name, and he knew me—I said, "I want you for being concerned with a man named Bishop, and another, in stealing a very large quantity of drugs; you must consider yourself in my custody, and go with me to the police station"—he said, "I never had any dealings with Bishop in my life"—on the way to the station, he said, "You have got my son"—I said, "Yes, I have"—he said, "What he <hi rend="italic">done</hi> was by my instructions"—on the way to Guildhall, he asked me what I had done with his son—I told him he was remanded till Thursday next—he said "What did you take him for, poor little fellow; what he <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, he was obliged to do; he knew nothing at all about it"—I showed him the letter—he said that he left it in the letter box last night for me—that would be Monday night—it is in pencil—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Mr. Russell Sir. When I came to-night, I am imformed you have been to see me respecting Mr. Bishop coming to my house on Friday night. I can explain what he came for, and will be home to morrow morning at 10 o'clock, or will call. Yours respectfully, J. Patrick. It was respecting, I believe, a horse I had for sale; anything else I know nothing about")—I afterwards got this empty hamper from the Ship—this brown paper was wrapped round the cases of quinine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Hearon, Squire &amp; Co., wholesale druggists—Bishop has been in our service about fourteen years, and had our entire confidence until this occurred; we had not the slightest suspicion of him—I knew he was living at the Lea Bridge Station, Great Eastern Railway—the boys were under his orders—I never saw the Patricks—I was not aware that Bishop was sending away hampers once or twice a week from our premises, to public-houses or to the railway cloak room, to be called for—I have examined the hampers taken from Bishop by Russell—they contain two cases of quinine, which are worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is one of our hampers, which are made for us—I cannot swear to this bottle, but it is a drug bottle, and is exactly similar to ours—the bag found at Patrick's is exactly similar to ours—I have no doubt of it—the empty hamper left at the Ship is one of ours—I know it because it has been used before, and here is the place where it has been lifted up, and a paper placed underneath for the direction, which has since been torn off, and here is a little piece of the paper left; besides that, the hamper is similar in every respect to ours—since the prisoners were taken in custody, we have taken stock, and miss between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of drugs, and that is only since June—we miss quinine, opium, saffron, and other things.</p>

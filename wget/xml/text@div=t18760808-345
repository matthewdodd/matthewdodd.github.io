I am an accountant and live at Lewis-ham—I carry on business as Hudswell <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> Co., at 23, Martin's Lane, Cannon Street—I have been an accountant nine or ten years—I became acquainted with the defendant in March or April, 1874—I had then a client, Lomas, Webster &amp; Co., at East India Chambers, Leadenhall Street, and the de<lb></lb>fendant had a seat at a table in their office, but I did not know then what his business was—I had not then heard of the Co-operative Bank—I first heard of it about August or September, 1874, from Mr. Lomas, I believe—the defendant first spoke to me about the Co-operative Credit Bank about December, 1874, at Lomas, Webster &amp; Co.'s office—these are the notes of my evidence at the Mansion House (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the defendant told me that he was about forming a bank, and that he had some bills of Dr. Good's and General. Gascoigne's to be discounted—he gave me the names of several parties to call on, but I cannot remember their names—I called on those</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187608080066"></xptr>
               <p>parties and asked them at Mr. Oakley's request whether they would be prepared to discount the bills—I saw Mr. Oakley again and told him what the various parties had said when the bills were handed to them—I think the parties communicated with Mr. Oakley; I had no more to do with them—one of them was named Callisher; he was mentioned to me by the defendant; he lived in Sackville Street, Piccadilly, and carried on the business of a money lender—Dr. Good sent for me in 1875 to 12, Queen Victoria Street, and asked me in Mr. Oakley's presence if I had any objection to become the accountant of the Co-operative Bank—I said that I should have no objection to do so, and he said that I must be very particular in all matters connected with the bank—I was then and there appointed to the office of accountant—my salary for the first three months was at the rate of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, or 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum; I was only to give a small portion of my time—my salary was afterwards raised to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and later to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and about four months before the bank stopped it was raised to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—offices were allotted to me at the bank, and I engaged clerks who were employed there, and paid by me with money which I drew from the bank to pay them—the defendant also employed separate clerks to carry on the banking business—current accounts were opened and some deposits and acceptances were received.—I did not take part in any bill discounting business; the different clerks kept books of the business done,. and I made up my books partly from their books and partly from the vouchers—tellers, or cashiers' books, were also made up by the bank clerks—my books were made up from the paying in slips and the cheques—it was the practice for my books to be compared with the teller's books at the end of each day—the accountant's and the cash department were kept quite distinct—the defendant occupied a room on the same floor as my office, the ground floor—the name outside was "The Co-operative Credit Bank"—the defendant was also proprietor and editor of a journal called "The Co-operative and Financial Review," the expenses connected with which passed through my hands, and I had a separate clerk told off to keep the accounts relating to it—the issues of that paper were circulated throughout the country—a staff of young women clerks was also kept for the purpose of folding the numbers of the "Review," and for issuing the prospectuses of the 'bank and the balance-sheets—I occasionally saw the articles in the "Review," and had conversations with the defendant relative to some of them—he never told me that any of them were his own composition—I prepared this balance-sheet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in March, 1875, partly from the books and partly from the vouchers, and partly from information received from the defendant—I submitted the manuscript to him before it was pub<lb></lb>lished—it was published with hissanction and approval—I see here the amount, by commission, from the Imperial Life Association, Limited, is 6,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is placed here as a realisable asset—I placed it so by Mr. Oakley's directions, he said that he was entitled to that amount from the Imperial Life Association as a commission—I made no further enquiries about it, I took his word for it—I did not learn from him at that time that it was a disputed amount—I got this other item, "Commission 861<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," from Mr. Oakley; I believe it was made up of three entries, but I have not the par<lb></lb>ticulars here—I have a draft here made out at the time I was making out the balance sheet—800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for the patent safety lamp assignment; I know nothing about that, and there are two others—those amounts were given to me by Mr. Oakley, who said that they were amounts due to</p>

               <p>the bank—I did not ask him any questions on the subject; he gave me the particulars which I put into the balance-sheet—I said "Can those amounts be realised in case <hi rend="italic">of</hi> emergency? are they available securities?"—he said that they were—deducting the figures 6,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the account, a loss would be shown instead of a profit—the balance-sheet with this foot note was circulated among the subscribers by Mr. Oakley's directions. (<hi rend="italic">The foot note stated:</hi> "The amount of the profit must depend upon the realization of the claim of the bank from the British Life Association, Limited.") I also prepared this balance-sheet for the quarter ending June, 1875—I see on the side of assets "Securities 8,611<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" those securities consisted of the Keokuk and Kansas Railway 7,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the Patent Safety Lamp as<lb></lb>signment deed as before 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Alfred George commission 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Tennant 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the Keokuk and" Kansas 7,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. does not, I believe, appear in the books; they were to be inserted on my return from my journey—I obtained the particulars from Mr. Oakley—I asked him whether the Keokuk and Kansas securities were available, and he said they were; he said, to the best of my recollection, that they were given him for the purpose of pro<lb></lb>moting the Keokuk and Kansas Railway—I made no inquiry at the office of the railway—the defendant said that he had advanced money from time to time for the purpose of advertising, printing, and so on—I also brought forward again as a separate item, by the defendant's direction, the 6,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as due from the British Imperial Life Insurance Company, Limited—that balance-sheet was submited to the defendant before publication and approved by him—in treating those assets as realisable, I make the profit and loss account for that quarter, inclusive of the previous balance of March 31, a profit of 10,821<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if I had struck them out from the aasets there would have been a loss shown of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,; that balance-sheet was printed and circulated by the defendant's direction—no reference is made to the suspense account in that balance-sheet—it is customary for auditors to have the value of shares certified by stockbrokers, but I did not do so in auditing and issuing these balance-sheets; I took Mr. Oakley's word for it—I had every confidence in him, and believed that what he stated was true—I also prepared this balance-sheet for the quarter ending September 30, 1875, under Mr. Oakley's direction; it was submitted to and approved by him, and I obtained from him this figure "Securities 21,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." among the assets, with the items of which it is made up: there are the Gilbert and Chaudiere preferential shares 2,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Gilbert and Chaudiere ordinary shares 7,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Warrington Bottling Company 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Oxford Building Society 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Credit Fongier 5 Debentures, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Australian Tin Mines 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Woollen Trade Association 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Keokuk and Kansas Railway 8,550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a foreign bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 21,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got these particulars and and values from the defendant—I observed that the item for the Keokuk and Kansas Railway, which at the time of the previous balance-sheet was 7,750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was taken at 8,550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I believe the defendant told me that the value of the shares had increased, but I cannot possibly say—he told me that the 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due from the Warrington Bottling Company was the money paid to the company for shares in that company—I cannot tell whether the amount has since been paid—I have no further information what the 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Oxford Building Society was for, but I believe it alluded to shares in the society—the defendant showed me the five Credit Fongier debentures, and said that the value of them was them 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know how they came into his possession—those securities making up the 21,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>do not all appear in the company's books; I stated before that my absence at various branches occupied several weeks, and I desired that they might be left till my return—the shares in the Oxford Building Society and the Credit Fongier were never in my possession, and I made no inquiries, except of the prisoner, of their value—I saw documents relating to the Australian tin bonds in Mr. Oakley's hands, but I do not know now what has become of them; I made no inquiry of their value except from Mr. Oakley—the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Woollen Trade Association was, I believe, an advance, but I have not the means of saying whether it was for commission; I cannot say whether that claim was ever paid—I see a foreign bill for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I cannot say whether it was subsequently met—the item "Co operative and Financial Register "5850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. represents the expense of printing and carrying on the "Register"—this item, "Reserve fund 2,016<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." on the debtor side is represented by securities; I learned nothing from the defendant respecting them—those were handed to me for safe custody by Dr. Good in a sealed packet—the defendant said that the 2,016<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be carried forward to the reserve fund, and he should hand securities for that amount into the hands of the trustees, but he did not say what securities—I received them from Dr. Good a month or more after 'the balance-sheet <hi rend="italic">was</hi> issued—at the time the balance-sheet was being prepared the defendant told me he should portion off part of the Keokuk and Kansas bonds to represent that sum—the 2,016<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. consisted of profits in one shape or other; the gross profits for the quarter are put down at 8,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the 2,016<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is part of the gross profits which are put down at 10,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in that balance-sheet the claim on the British Imperial Association is not. brought forward as an asset, but it was placed in the suspense account because the defendant said that in consequence of the dispute with the British Imperial we must take that amount out and put it with the suspense account—I had not heard of a dispute previous to the March and June account—assuming that the securities were struck out amounting to 21,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there would be a very large loss instead of a profit—this balance-sheet was issued and circulated in the same way as the previous ones, and the defendant again said that the securities could be realised on an emergency—it was part of my duty to go down to the country to audit the bank agencies; I had done it before September, 1875—there were, I think, just over sixty agencies established over the country—he also employed lecturers to go about the country lecturing about the bank—I did not go down to the country in December, 1875, to audit the agencies, on account of the finances, of the bank being so very low, and I proposed that we should take the weekly returns from the branches as granted, and audit them afterwards—there were not sufficient funds in the bank which could have been spared for the purpose of my going down—I called Mr. Oakley's attention to the state of the bank, cheques, promissory notes, and acceptances being dishonoured as early as Christmas, 1875, and also sent off money to the various agencies—I told the defendant about the beginning of January that he was not justified in receiving money from the public, that the bank was hopelessly insolvent, and he had better call his creditors together and make a statement—there was at that time an execution in the bank for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a man was in possession; the defendant replied that there would be plenty of funds coming in and we should tide over the pressure—I asked him what the execution was for, he said that it was on account of an acceptance he had given for shares in the</p>

               <p>Gilbert Gold Fields Company; there were no funds in the bank to pay that, but he said that he had money coining in and everything wouly be quite right in a day or so—I told him he was not justified in receivnd any more money from the public, he would render himself criminally liable if he did so; he said "Oh, no such thing, we have plenty of money coming in, and we shall be all right again"—I said "We are using all possible dispatch in getting the balance-sheet out, but you had better call your depositors together and mention the state of the bank to them"—he said that the depositors would increase their subscriptions—on the day we had that conversation there was no money in the bank to pay the clerks their salaries, and I told Mr. Oakley so, he said "We shall be able, possibly, to pay their salaries in a day or two"—the execution remained in the bank till Tuesday. 18th January—on loth January I had a conversation with Mr. Snelgrove a depositor and one of the trustees, and again on the Thursday before the defendant was arrested—the defendant sent for me and, said that he had received a letter from Mr. Snelgrove's solicitor, and asked me why Mr. Snelgrove did not come to see him, I said that he declined to do so; he said "I hope you have not opened your mouth too wide"—I said that if the depositors asked me any questions relative to the state of the bank I was bound to reply to them—he said that it was no business of mine, my business was to attend to the books—I said "I shall certainly reply to them, I have always done so, and shall always do so as I am their accountant"—he then told me he would have none of my insolence—while we were conversing, his assistant, Mr. Kemp, who is now deceased, brought him a cheque for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mr. Oakley said that it would be paid presently—Mr. Beddy was the secretary and head cashier—Mr. Oakley's private clerk, Mr. Spooner, succeeded Mr. Beddy—they were engaged by Mr. Oakley and under his orders—supposing I had made up the December balance-sheet there would have been a considerable loss, but I am not able to say what would be the amount of the deposit and current account at the closing of the bank, the receiver has done that, it is entirely out of my hands.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. I have been in business as an accountant eight or nine years; before that I was with the Millwall Iron Works ten years, and I was on casually in the office of Mr. Lewis, an accountant in a large way in London; he is also a trustee in the bankruptcy—I have had considerable experience in accounts; I carried on business at 23, Martin's Lane, Cannon Street, as an accountant for about four and a half years before I superintended the books of the bank; I had no partner—I was asked to take the appointment by Dr. Good on behalf of the depositors—I was, in fact, appointed as a check on the manager, and to give a full account of the business, separate and distinct from the manager's department—I had a distinct appointment and engaged my own clerks, they were under my sole control, I paying them and drawing the money from the bank—I made out the March balance-sheet from the books and vouchers, and if I had not been satisfied that different amounts had been paid and received I should not have placed them in the balance-sheet—the vouchers for all the amounts appear in the balance-sheet—putting aside the sum due from the Life Association, the whole of the items in that balance-sheet were true and correct, to the best of my knowledge, from the books and vouchers—I cannot say whether Mr. Tennant, a mining agent, paid 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in March, it could not have been paid at the time, but it stood in the books as a debit balance against Mr. Tenuant, he may have paid it subsequently—it is a matter of public</p>

               <p>notoriety that on 21st March we were sueing the British Imperial Life As<lb></lb>sociation for this commission at the very time I placed it in the balance-sheet—Mr. Borlase was the solictor to the bank at that time, and I heard him explain to the defendant and to the depositors that Mr. Oakley had a claim to that 6,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the foot note to the March balance-sheet was sug<lb></lb>gested by Mr. Oakley himself, and he told me at the time that that foot note was to prevent people thinking that it was actually cash in hand—I know that the amount expended by the Co-operative in endeavouring to float the Imperial was as much as 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Oakley told me that some person had been sent out to America to make inquiries about the Keokuk and Kansas Railway, and he showed me an agreement with the directors with regard to floating the railway—I cannot give you the amount Mr. Oakley spent in advertisements and other expenses in endeavouring to float the railway, but it was considerable—with the exception of the valuation put upon the secu<lb></lb>rities, every item in the June balance-sheet was correct, to the best of my knowledge; I made it up, and I and my staff compared it with the vouchers, except the securities—I kept four clerks—I superintended it, but a great portion of my time was occupied at the branches—the defendant told me I might see the engineer of the Keokuk and Kansas Railway with regard to the valuation, but I did not see him—there were several branches between March and June, and very considerable expenses were incurred in establishing them—Mr. Oakley showed me the assignment of 861 shares in the Helm Signal Company, and perhaps the amount of them is referred to in the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the March balance-sheet; he showed me the assignment of the 861 shares—The Patent Lamp and the Helm Signals are the same thing—before the amounts were placed in the balance-sheet the securities were either handed to me or shown to me, they were brought to my knowledge and I could have examined them if I had chosen—I imagine that Mr. Oakley advanced con<lb></lb>siderable sums in bringing out the Canadian Gold Company, but I cannot tell you the amount; he informed me that he gave four acceptances of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I was told that the five debentures of the Credit Foncier, valued at 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., were sold for 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I do not know—I believe the amount remitted to Australia in regard to the Australian Tin Mining Company was 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say whether a sum was actually paid for the Woollen Trading Com<lb></lb>pany's securities, but I paid 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, and it is put down as an asset of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I submitted the balance-sheets to Mr. Oakley, and he gave a general approval of the form in which they were drawn up; the items of the expenditure were left to me, they were taken from the books—large sums were expended in advertising—he said that he believed he should receive large sums in January which would tide over his difficulties—the papers had been attacking the Keokuk and Kansas Railway and the Co<lb></lb>operative Bank, owing to which the subscriptions had fallen off very considerably—as late as 31st December I was of opinion that although the funds were very low, I was able to report a better state of things, and trusted that with a little forbearance on the part of the depositors all would be well—the well-known principle of the bank was that there was no capital to start with, and I told everybody so who asked me—I put out the prospectus.</p>

               <p>from new depositors I should say—I should treat as my own knowledge, information received from my staff—I cannot say whether the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the Woollen Trade Association was paid by cash or by bills—I had nothing to do with the financial department—I cannot say that those shares were treated as profits, I was given to understand by Mr. Oakley that they were realisable—that is how I was an independent accountant between Mr. Oakley and the shareholders—I got the amount expended, from the various vouchers scattered through the books—I might or might not see the four bills of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, they were passed through the office—when I assert that that is true which is on the balance-sheet I mean that the bills should appear in the bill-books, and I have every reason to believe they did—I ascertained how much money had been paid into the branches from time to time by subscribers, and the expenditure was entered in the balance-sheets—all the money that was paid into the bank was passed through the books in the usual form,. and the money was handed to Mr. Beddy for Mr. Oakley, it never passed through my hands—enquiries I believe were made as to what had become of the money, part went for Mr. Oakley's private account, and part for the use of the bank, the books will show a portion of that—the amounts were passed through the books and handed over to the secretary who acted as cashier—if you deposited 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would be in the books, and it would be handed over to Mr. Oak<lb></lb>ley—the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would remain in Mr. Beddy's hands, and he might pay any body, either Mr. Oakley's private account or not—the March balance-sheet says "Balance" so much, and they all run in the same way—I do not include among the expenses and disbursements all the money that has gone into Mr. Oakley's pocket for any purpose whatever; he drew money for his private purposes—that does not appear in the balance-sheet—it is a charge in Mr. Oakley's accounts—it was kept open for explanation by Mr. Oakley; he drew cheques for various purposes for his private use and it went through the books—I know that the statement in the prospectus is that he received nothing for his private services—this balance-sheet would disclose that he was receiving nothing, but he acknowledged that he was entitled to a certain sum for conducting the "Co-operative Review"—he has not been credited with that—he was to be credited with it in the December balance-sheet; he suggested that he should have 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for that, and that is not included—the balance-sheet ought to disclose to the shareholders what had been received and paid, and I believe that amount is shown in the balance-sheet as "Loans outstanding 1,077<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I cannot say whether Mr. Oakley's receipts are. included in that—we account for the cash in hand at the head office and branches—it is not under the heading "Cash in hand," that was the actual cash in the hands of Mr. Beddy, and also at the branches—I assume that that cash was in the till in Mr. Beddy's possession because I saw the money counted; I cannot say that I counted it, but I had every reason to believe that it was correct—in auditing the branches I assumed the amount of balance—I cannot say that Mr. Oakley's account appears in the balance-sheet, it was to run over to December, and therefore the receiver will be able to account for those items—I cannot remember if Mr. Oakley's account was included in these items or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in holy orders and rector of Stratford St. Andrew, Suffolk—I was trustee of the reserve fund of the Co-operative Credit Bank, but not a trustee of the bank—I first heard of the bank by means of an advertisement, and I wrote this letter to the defendant on 25th December, 1873—(<hi rend="italic">This requested to know or what purpose guarantors were required, as advertised for in the Daily News</hi>). I got an answer, but I have destroyed all the letters—the answer was an account, of the scheme which he intended to carry out, and I wrote to him for a reference,. as I knew nothing about him—he referred me to the town-clerk of the City of London—I have not got the letter—about 19th March, 1874, I gave him a guarantee for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which has been returned to me and destroyed—it stated that I would guarantee to any person to whom that was given, the amount of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think I had seen the defendant before that, at a meeting at the London tavern, at which he explained the scheme—I gave another guarantee in April for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think, and that has been returned and destroyed—I then deposited 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—I got the defendant to sell for me twenty-five shares in the Credit Fon<lb></lb>cier, which realised 181<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and let him have the amount—in June, 1874, all the guarantees I gave him were returned to me, and I accepted bills to the amount of 188<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on the same date I paid him 211<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash—on 19th July, 1874, I deposited 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 19th August, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 8th October, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 19th October, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 19th November, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 1st November I gave him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of acceptances, as he was very much pressed for money because he was getting out the stock of the British Imperial Life Insurance—I gave him those acceptances most relunctantly, he could not have gone on if I had not; he could not have advertised, and it was with the understanding from me that they should be taken up and returned to me in a fornight's time—there was no arrangement about the renewal of that 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I understood that if they were not taken up they would be returned; that was the understanding with all the acceptances I gave him—three or four bills of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each did come back to me, nearly the whole amount, and I had to meet them—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in five 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills at three months, drawn by Mr. Oakley and accepted by myself; I think they were payable at my bankers at Newton, but I am not quite sure—on 30th April, 1875, I deposited with the</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read—From the witness to the defendant, dated March</hi> 15, 1875. "My dear sir,—What is the use of your writing and bothering me about money. I have told you over and over again that I have not any, and that you have been keeping me for weeks past with scarcely a shilling in the house, and my Christmas bills unpaid. I must tell you plainly that, unless you shortly remit me some money, or if you allow any more bills to come back to me for payment, you will compel me, however reluctantly, to give you notice to withdraw from the concern altogether," &amp;c, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">The letter afterwards stated:</hi> "I enclose a letter I received' this morning from a brother clergyman. What can I say to him after the manner in which I have been treated? If, however, you will promise me faithfully to employ one-half of any investment that he may make with the bank, in taking my bills off the market and returning them to me, I will write as favourably as I possibly can. Let me know whether you agree to this, because if not I must leave his letter unanswered, as I could not recommend him to join it" <hi rend="italic">The enclosure was:</hi> "Rev. C. H. Robertson presents his compliments to Rev. Mr. Good, and begs to have some information as to the working, &amp;c, of the Co-operative Credit Bank, of which he is a trustee. Smeeth Rectory, Ashford, March 12, 1875." <hi rend="italic">A notice from the witness to the defendant was here put in, stating that at the expiration of thirty days he should demand the payment of all money and interest of any kind, and the return of all bills not retired or withdrawn. Dated March</hi> 13, 1875. <hi rend="italic">This was enclosed in a letter from the witness to the defendant, demanding</hi> 102<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">for which amount he had been served with a writ.</hi>) It was true that he had been bothering me for money for weeks past—he wanted me to sell other things to meet these bills, which I did not choose to do—it was an understood thing that if I gave Mr. Oakley the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. acceptances he was to take them up with the first money he received—I think this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter I wrote to my brother clergyman who wrote to me for information, but I have not got my spectacles; I wrote what I felt—I was annoyed at the bills coming back, because Ooakley promised to take them up in a fortnight, or with the first money he received.</p>

During the year 1874, I provided a number of acceptances for carrying on the business of the bank in the terms of the prospectus, altogether to the amount of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those acceptances were ultimately taken up—there was a good deal of difficulty in taking them up from time to time they were renewed—I wrote to and received a great many letters from the defendant in relation to them. (<hi rend="italic">Letters from the witness dated 17th April and</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st April were put in and read referring to to these acceptances, and expressing annoyance at the manner in which they had been presented.</hi>) At the time I wrote that last letter I do not think I had received the balance-sheet of 31st March—I do not think that balance-sheet was published till May or June—I received this letter from the</p>

I afterwards received the balance-sheet for the quarter ending 30th June, 1875, in due course, I read it, and afterwards wrote this letter of 6th August, to Mr. Oakley. (<hi rend="italic">This alluded to some anonymous letters containing unfavourable remarks about the bank.</hi>) I received the balance-sheet for 30th September, 1875, and read it—on 29th October, 1875, I wrote this letter to the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">This also alluded to the persistent attach on the. bank both anonymously and by the public press, but expressing confidence in the undertaking</hi>). During the year 1875 I received regularly the "Co-operative and Financial Review," I subscribed to it six months in advance, according to the terms printed on it—the balance-sheet was never published till about five weeks after the date—I had further correspondence with the defendant about the attacks made upon him in the newspapers—I was asked by him to guarantee a sum of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the prosecution of "The World "on the part of the Keoknk and Kansas Railway Company, and on 10th December, 1875, I wrote to him this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This agreed to the request for the</hi> 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">guarantee.</hi>) I received this little pamphlet from the defendant, I can't say when, I presume when it was published—my first interview with the defendant was on 29th January, 1875; I then asked him about the bank, how it was progressing, and he spoke of it most favourably in every way—I might have had two or three more internews with him after that, I think one was in May, 1875, and one on 1st December, 1875; there might have been one between May and December, but I don't remember the date, and I am not sure that there was one—at those interviews I always spoke to him in reference to the bank; he always assured me that everything was satisfactory and in a most flourishing state and that it was sure to prosper; he inspired me with full confidence at every interview—the interview on the 1st December was at the bank, I spoke to him then about the condition of the bank, and he assured me that it was most prosperous and everything was well in spite of the attacks in the different papers—I had at that time seen the balance-sheets for March, June, and September—I paid in 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the name of one of my daughters as an investment at that time, and just as I was coming away, he said to me "By-the-bye, General, I have no acceptance of yours now, it will be of use to me," and I had such confidence in him that I gave it immediately, dated 1st December, for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at three months, that acceptance ought to have been renewable by the bank, but the bank was closed, and of course I had to pay it when due—I never received any part of the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the bank—at the time I invested that money and gave the acceptance I had no idea of what I have since learnt as to the real state of the bank; I had confidence in the state of the bank, not only from the assurances of the defendant, but from the balance-sheets; I trusted entirely to the balance-sheets being certified and signed by public accountants.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw Mr. Hudswell's note at the foot of the balance-sheet: "We hereby certify that we have examined the books and find it correct"—my first interview with the defendant was on 29th January, 1875—there were continual attacks made on him by the press, more so towards the autumn of last year; they were very violent then—Mr. Oakley informed we in the first instance that he had been a bankrupt, but I did not under<lb></lb>stand</p>

               <p>the different degrees of bankruptcy; he said it was upon Stock Exchange transactions; I have not seen anything of the bankruptcy pro<lb></lb>ceedings, I was satisfied with Mr. Oakley's explanation that it was some Stuck Exchange affair, and I did not think so much of it—from time to time anonymous attacks were made upon him and sent to me, and on one occasion I replied to those attacks in the local papers—on one occasion I required 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the bank advanced it to me, as a matter of business; a portion of it is still due, a portion is paid, the rest will be paid when due; it was to be repaid at intervals of six months, I pay it as it falls due—the 100 guineas I was to receive as trustee of the reserve fund was placed to my deposit account, I suppose 18 per cent, interest was given upon that—I must have received it, I think, for six months; and the other 12 percent, on the bills—I gave a guarantee, in the first instance, in the terms of the prospectus for the purposes of the bank; I did not inquire what it was for; it was to provide capital for the bank—I was not consulted as to the investment in the Keokuk and Kansas bonds, I was told after it was made that that was the reserve fund, I think that must have been in September or October last—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced to me in August, 1875—there was no pressure put upon me by the Naval Bank, they asked me for the money and I settled it; the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced upon terms for that purpose, as it would have been by any other bank—in July and August I did not, that I am aware of, offer to subscribe another 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was always applied to, I did not offer—I am not sure whether the defendant declined and said he did not want it, I think there was something of the sort—my offer must have been in writing; in April I reduced my acceptances from 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there was some correspondence about it, I had confidence in the bank and I think I offered it, and it was refused; it was not required, the funds of the. bank were so good—this was about July or August.

               <p>Mr. Oakley's answers with me, I have simply brought such letters as I thought of importance—they explained exactly as was done at the general meeting, as to what the nature of the claim was, that it was not yet realised, but that he was sure to get it in point of law—I was present at the general meeting, and that was what Mr. Oakley himself said—there was a report of the meeting published in the "Co-operative Review;" it was to the effect that the company wished to issue some new shares, and he undertook to issue them at a certain percentage, and that before he had been able to issue them a mistake was found in the prospectus of the company, which led to the shares not being able to be issued; but as the fault was due to the company, he said he had still a claim for his commission, and that his lawyer said he was sure to get it—he said that the company had issued names of directors without the sanction of the persons whose names were there, and this was discovered and exposed—I have here a copy of the report. (<hi rend="italic">This was put in and read.</hi>) I made a speech myself, it is sub<lb></lb>stantially reported <hi rend="italic">there—</hi>—he told me the British Imperial claim was disputed; I did not know that it had got into litigation before the bank was started—I was not aware that a bankruptcy would have intervened and prevented his transferring to the bank any money that was receivable upon it—on 9th June I wrote a notice of withdrawal of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was from no doubt of the solvency of the bank, I simply wanted the money, I may say that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> was not' carried out. (<hi rend="italic">The letter and notice of withdrawal were read.</hi>) On the 10th I wrote to him this letter explaining my notice of withdrawal (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I received an answer to that from the defendant on 11th June, 1875, I have not got it; it pointed out that it was necessary to give six months' notice, I. had—forgotten that, so I managed otherwise and left the money in the bauk—I think the letter was from Mr. Hudswell on the part of the bank; I think he said that in spite of that he would arrange it if I wished, but I declined—on 17th June I wrote again (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had received from the Archbishop of Canterbury and others representations against the bank, to which he felt it difficult to reply unless furnished with information for the purpose.</hi>) I got an answer to that; I have not got it. (<hi rend="italic">The reply was read from the defendant's press letter book, it was dated</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">and stated that these attacks were parts of an organised raid against the bank, which, in spite of all, was certain to succeed. Two other letters from 'the witness, dated June</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">rd and July</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">rd</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">were read, calling attention to injurious reports as to the state of the bank and the character of the defendant; a letter from the witness of December</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th, gave notice of the withdrawal of</hi> 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">to which the defendant replied on</hi> 28<hi rend="italic">th December, staling it was out of his power to accede to the demand, as nearly all the available cash had been drawn out, and if, instead of withdrawing, he could pay in a few thousands it would be of material assistance; another letter from the defendant of</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st January</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">suggested that the witness should receive the</hi> 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in Gilbert and Chaudiere shares, which were of a most satisfactory character.

"Financial Review"—I relied most entirely on Mr. Hudswell in his reports and in all the transactions of the bank; he was the accountant appointed by the depositors, of whom I was one.</p>

                  </hi>. I formerly lived at Exeter—I first heard of the Co-operative Credit Bank by advertisement, and applied to the defendant for a prospectus—I received a letter in reply and a prospectus—I cannot say whether I also received a copy of the "Review "then or subsequently—I made an application to Dr. Good, and received this answer—I then wrote this letter to the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 29<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">and enclosing a crossed cheque for</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) I cannot say for certain whether 1 had received the balance-sheet when I sent the cheque for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I after<lb></lb>wards received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th December</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">from the defendant to the witness requesting him to combine the office of trustee, with that of agent at Exeter, which he could do if he invested</hi> 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) There was some little difficulty about my combining the offices of trustee and agent, but I was ultimately appointed both trustee and agent for the. Exeter branch, and I carried on the Exeter branch until the collapse of the bank in January last—I afterwards wished to resign the trusteeship and received this letter from the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that it would be very unadvisable to change the trusteeship at that time.</hi>) On 1st October, I</p>

               <p>received a letter from the defendant enclosing a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank-note for the branch—the book will show what other sums I received—I wrote this letter to the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated October</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">referring to an article on the bank in the</hi>" World" <hi rend="italic">newspaper, and requesting permission to horsewhip the author of it.</hi>) At that time I had the most implicit belief in the defendant and in the bank—I applied early in January for more money for my branch, and after several applications received a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated January</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1876.) I acknowledged that cheque on January 11th, by this letter, and on the following day I wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This requested the defendant to inspect the general balance-sheet of 1st January, and he would see the reason why the</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and the</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">had failed to put the bank in comfortable circumstances.</hi>) On 14th January, I wrote this letter to the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">This requested the fullest particulars about a returned cheque of the day before,. and asked for notes instead of cheqes in future.</hi>) That returned cheque was one which I had given him, which when handed in for collection was returned—I paid the cheque into my bank and they returned it, and Mr. Oakley sent me some post-office orders to pick up the cheque—it was not paid on presentation and I then wrote the letter of 14th January—I then got this letter from the defendant (<hi rend="italic">This was dated January</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th, and stated.</hi> "The reason why your cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was returned was that at the moment we had no money to meet it, we therefore did the next best thing, which was to send the money to pick I it up.") In consequence of the alarm I felt at the position of the bank, I came up to London on Monday night, 17th January—I did not see Mr. Hudswell till the Wednesday—previous to my coming up, I think it was on the 13th, I had written to Mr. Oakley resigning my position as agent. and trustee, and this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his letter acknowledging the receipt of mine—I saw Mr. Hudswell on the Wednesday, and after that put myself into the hands of my lawyers, Messrs. Trauley and Crauford, who applied at the Mansion House for an information—I have not had my 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. returned to me—I am sure that I wrote the letter resigning my trusteeship before I saw those gentlemen, it is dated from Exeter—the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was written subsequently to the other—the reason I gave for resigning was that I was in business as a surgeon at Exeter, and I found I was likely to suffer a great deal through my connection with the bank, I could not carry the two on consistently with public opinion—I offered to write a letter saying that I was resigning simply on account of that—that was on Saturday 15th—I also proposed to appoint my clerk, Bloxam, in my place—my lawyer told me that if I did not lay an information I was open to an information being laid against me—he said "You are under a very great difficulty if you let the business go on, and you must lay an information or take pro<lb></lb>ceediugs, or you will be proceeded against"—I probably received 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for' carrying on the bank at Exeter in January, but the book will show that.</p>

I am a wire worker at 475, Mile End Road—in the early part of last year I saw the prospectus of the Co-operative Credit Bank, and called at the office and saw the defendant; I told him I had received a prospectus and the treatise respecting the scheme of the bank, and if it was what it represented I had occasionally a little money which I should be very pleased to deposit—he said "I have no doubt, whatever business you feel disposed to do with the bauk, it will be quite satisfactory to you," and I said that I would leave a deposit of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on current account; that was in April, 1875—on several occasions when I called for my book he said that the bank was a <hi rend="italic">bond-fide</hi> affair, and he always represented that it was doing a most excellent business, and that nothing could prevent it being a very large concern—on the last occasion he said, respecting the bank and the safety of it, "It is a <hi rend="italic">bond-fide</hi> affair, for the occasion that other parties are speaking so much against us, is that we are doing a larger business, and they are only cross and vexed to. think that they are not with us"—besides, the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

Taylor, of Chancery Lane, cut out of a newspaper; I do not know whether it was a statement that somebody had been made bankrupt—I know it was something about Mr. oakley which was put into the letter in which that was enclosed—I showed the letter and the newspaper paragraph both to Mr. oakley—they must have made a statement about him, I cannot recollect what it was, it was something to warn me—I was to send it back by return of post and that was the reason I went down with it—I do not recollect whether it also stated something about a Mr. Patterson—the letter I signed was not written by me—I did not approve of employing a lawyer—Mr. oakley dictated it, but it is not his writing—I think Mr. Edmunds was present—I had a conversation with the defendant relating <hi rend="italic">to selling</hi> some Union Bank shares, I told him I would not sell them till Christmas, because I wanted the Christmas dividend to make a present which I promised to one of my nephews—after Christmas Mr. oakley wrote this letter at the Co-operative Bank and I signed it.

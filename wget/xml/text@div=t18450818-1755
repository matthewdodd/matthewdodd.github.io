                  </hi>. On Saturday afternoon, the 9th of Aug., I was enter<lb></lb>ing the church-yard at Woolwich—I felt something take me on the left-hand side—it was a hook, but whether an umbrella or a stick I could not tell, but so violent was it, that the coat was torn off my back—I iras turned round, and at the same time a tremendous rush was made on my right-hand side—I drew back, and immediately seized the prisoner by thi wrist—I held him till we got through the gate, and the instant we got there, I said, "You rascal, you have attempted to rob me"—he said, "Sir, I am a gentleman, you are mistaken; I will give you my card"—I said, "I am a little accustomed to such gentlemen as you"—I collared him a second time, and looked for an officer, but did not see one—he made a dart from me, and rushed out of the gate—I lost sight of him—I re-mained with my friend, who examined my side to see where the wound was—in about a quarter of an hour I saw the prisoner going by in custody of two persons—I have not the least douht that he was the person—I had a watch on my right side as it is now—I ran and took him, turned him round, looked into his face, and said, "You villain, they have got you at last"—the officer told me to go to the station.</p>

I was on duty at the Dock-gates, Woolwich—the Queen was expected—the prisoner came to me about five o'clock, and said, "Will you have anything to drink?"—I said, "No, certainly not, you had better be off"—(I knew him)—I saw him go and stand by the dock-yard gate and put his hand in front of a gentleman—I afterwards saw him, in the church-yard, go by the side of a lady, and from what I saw I was induced to take him for attempt-ing to pick pockets—he said, "You are mistaken"—I said, "No, I am not"—he said, "Let me go and I will give you half a <hi rend="italic">couter</hi>," meaning a half-sovereign—I said, "No, certainly not, you have got the wrong person"—he was very violent—I was forced to knock at a door and take him into a house, where he broke several chairs and things—I took him to the sta-tion—I found on him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, an umbrella with a hook to it, and some other things—as I was taking him to the station the prosecutor iden<lb></lb>tified him.</p>

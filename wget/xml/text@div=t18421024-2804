                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of a cab. Between eleven and twelve o'clock on Friday the 21st of October, I was with one of my own cabs on the rank in Oxford-street, near Argyle-street—the pri<lb></lb>soner came up and asked me to take him to Smith field—he had a large writing-desk and a Russia leather case with him—he got into the cab and I drove him to Smithfield—he stopped at the top of West-street and got out, took the writing-desk and case, and went down West-street—I saw another young man who told me to drive to the bottom of West-street, and the prisoner returned part of the way, beckoned me down West-street, and desired me to drive to a house, which I did—he was assisted by somebody into the passage of the house with the desk and case—he then came out again with them, got into the cab again, and told me to take him to Ar<lb></lb>tillery-place or lane—as we were going up Worship-street, having suspi<lb></lb>cions, I desired an officer to see whether all was right, and the prisoner was taken into custody—I went to the police court with him and the officer.</p>

On the 21st of October, about twelve o'clock in the day, I was at the door of Worship-street police court, and saw Saunders drive up with his cab—in consequence of what be said I opened the window of the cab and asked the prisoner where he brought the property from—he had this case and desk with him in the cab—he said he brought them from Oxford-street—I asked him where he was going to take them to—he said to Artillery-lane—Roland then came up and the prisoner was taken into custody—Roland asked him where he brought them from—he said from Oxford-street, that they were given to him by a man whom he did not know.</p>

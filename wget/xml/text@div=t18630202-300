                  </hi>. I am a fruit broker, residing in Pudding-lane—I employed the prisoner during the day, and he was coachman to another Mr. Adam, whose brougham was kept at Mr. Soulter's—he drove Mr. Adam when he required him, in the morning and afternoon—he was employed in my ware-house as a porter—he had no right to take any goods out of my warehouse—I never gave him leave, at any time, to take these oranges, apples, for<lb></lb>bidden fruit, or lemons—they were shown me by the policeman—there is a portion of them here—the others would not keep sound—the prisoner had a locker in my warehouse—he had no right to have anything of this kind in his locker—some were found on him by the officer, some in the brougham, and some in the locker—they are the same kind of things as I dealt in—we always have a quantity of these in our warehouse.</p>

About ten minutes past 12, on 17th January, I saw the prisoner coming from Pudding-lane—I followed him to Mr. Soulter's livery stables, in Hertford-street West—I saw him go up to Mr. Adam's brougham and empty his pockets—he was there about three or four minutes, and then returned to Mr. Adam's warehouse, in Pudding-lane—about ten minutes past 1, he returned from Pudding-lane to the livery-stables again—I followed him—I saw his pockets were very full—he went up to the brougham, and just as he had got his hands to put under the seat of the brougham, I touched his pocket, and said, "What have you got here?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "You have got some<lb></lb>thing"—he said, "Well, it is a few nuts"—I said, "Do you know who I am?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I am a police-officer, and I must take you into custody for bringing those from Mr. Adam's warehouse"—he said, "Well, let us go up to Mr. Adam"—I said, "You must go into Pudding-lane"—he said, "No; the other Mr. Adam"—I then searched the brougham, and under the seat I found fifteen oranges, and under the mat, where the coachman's feet go, I found about three quarts of nuts—the warehouse is about 150 or 200 yards from where the brougham stood—I then took the prisoner back to the warehouse—he turned out his pockets there, and he had got about three quarts of Brazils and chesnuts, and five oranges—I said, "You have got a locker here, have you not?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Will you allow me the key of it?"—he said, "Yes," and gave it to me—I went there, and found seventy-six oranges, ten apples, one lemon, and two shaddocks, commonly called forbidden fruit—there was a carpet-bag there, but the fruit was loose in the locker.</p>

On the Friday morning she came down stairs, and asked my wife to lend her her cloak; I think it was the 25th of February; she said, she was going to her uncle's to work, at a coffee-house, near St. Paul's; my wife told her not to detain herself long, because she wanted the cloak to go to market; she said, she should be back in a few hours; she did not return that night.

Before she came home I had a mistrust of some of the things being gone; I got a ladder, and set it up against the window; I shoved up the sash, and looked through, and I saw the bed-clothes absent; I missed a pair of sheets, a blanket, frying-pan, candlestick, and other articles; I saw them at Queen's-square before the Justice; I know them to be my property.

            . I am an apprentice on board the brig. On Sunday the 14th of October, I went ashore with the prisoner, and left him in the dock - he said he was going out of the dock; I went on board another vessel, returned directly, and met him coming from the vessel, we went to the Three Crowns, public-house, and had a pot of beer - nobody but him was on board. I found two chests removed, which rose my suspicion.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 15th of October, I found the prisoner at the Scotch Arms, public-house, close to the dock, drinking - I told him, I took him for breaking open the carpenter's chest on board the ship, and taking four sovereigns and a guinea, and asked what he had done with the money - he said, he knew nothing of it. As I took him to the office, I asked if he had left a sovereign and guinea in the hands of any body, he said he had not - I asked if he had changed them any where, he said he had not; then I asked if he had left some sovereigns in the hands of the landlady of the St. Andrew tavern - he said he had not, and that he had none to leave with any one - I found 4 s. 6 d., on him. The landlady of the St. Andrew tavern gave me two sovereigns and two shillings. A friend said in his presence, that he would refund the money for him, if he could have his liberty, he said nothing to it; I said I could not take it, he then advised him to say nothing about it.</p>

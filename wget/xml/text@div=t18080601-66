               <p>Q. On the 2nd of April in the evening did this boy come over to you - A. Yes; I had stepped over the way from one shop to the other to speak to my father; the boy came from over the way and said I was wanted; when I came to the door I saw a man run out of the opposite shop from which the boy had come; I immediately ran after the man I had seen come out of the shop; he turned down Grays' Inn lane; I stopped him at last in Bell court, I never lost sight of him, he was returning to face me, the court is a thoroughfare, I suppose he did not know it; I threw him down; when he was falling he let one of the boots fall to save himself, the other he held; I brought him back to the shop; the boy said that was the man that came in for the boot tops; the prisoner desired me to let him go, it was the first offence that ever he committed; I sent for my father, I said if he was agreeable it made no difference to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the goods did you know them to be your father's manufactory - A. Yes; there is my writing in them, they are two odd boots; I found the fellows to them in the shop.</p>

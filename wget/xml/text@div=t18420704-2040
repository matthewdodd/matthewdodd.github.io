                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker, in Change-alley, Cornhill. On the afternoon of the 23rd of June, the prisoner came into my shop; he showed me a brown paper of razors, I took up one to examine, and he made signs with his hands, pretending to be dumb; he intimated he wished to dispose of them at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-piece—I took one, and saw the name of Lowcock on it—I suspected they were stolen—I wrote on a piece of paper, "Leave them with me ten minutes,. and I will choose one"—I called for a man to go and get change; the prisoner immediately took up the razors and ran off, leaving one—I kept it and went to Mr. Lowcock—I gave information to the police.</p>

I reside with my son George, who is in business in Cornhill—I was attending his shop on the 23rd of June, and the prisoner came in for a knife with a corkscrew—I asked what price—he signified 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or half-a-crown—I said I had not one—a person came in to ask for a knife—I then put my head into the window, and took one out—the prisoner was still in the shop, but while my head was in the window, I could not see what he was about—when the gentleman was gone, he made signs that he wanted table-knives—he then went to the counter where the razors were—I asked at what price he wanted them—he took a pen, and wrote down 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said we had nothing of the sort—he then muttered something, and went away—shortly after Mr. Frodsham came in with a razor—I went directly to where a dozen had lain when the prisoner came in, and they were missing—this razor was one of them—between seven and eight o'clock the same evening, the prisoner was bought in—I recognized him, and said, "You are a pretty fellow to take a dozen razors from this counter"—he said he had not been in Cornhill since four o'clock that afternoon—I have no doubt of his being the person.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 415). On the morning of 1st Feb., I was on duty in Mile End Road, about a quarter before 6 o'clock—I saw the prisoner and three other men standing at the doors of Mr. Avila, a pawn<lb></lb>broker, in Park-place—the prisoner was at the door of No. 16, there was a man at the door of No. 17, a man at the door of No. 18, and a man at the shutters of No. 16, where the prisoner was at the door—I was then about fifty yards from him—I went within ten or twelve yards of him, and I law him moving his arm as if boring something into the door; and to my belief the other men were doing the same as he was—the prisoner turned round, and came towards me—I went up to the door to see what he had been doing, and I saw this gimlet made fast into the door, and, to the best of my belief, the prisoner had been working with it—I took hold of him by the collar and sprung my rattle for assistance—as soon as I did that, the other three men ran down the Mile End Road, towards Bow—the prisoner said, "You need not make that noise"—assistance came, and we took him to the station, and found this gimlet and knife on him.</p>

               <p>to me—I do not know what the other men had been doing—the prisoner keeps a beer shop—I found nothing on him but a gimlet and a common knife—I had looked at my watch at 5 o'clock—we searched the prisoner in the road as soon as my brother constable came up, in six or seven minutes.</p>

On the morning of 1st Feb., I was on duty at a quarter before 6 o'clock, in Whitechapel—road, near the premises of Mr. Avila, Nos. 16, 17, and 18, Park-place—I was there about 10 minutes before 6 o'clock as near as I can guess, and saw the last witness with the prisoner in his custody—I heard the clock strike after I had seen the prisoner in custody; it might be seven, or eight, or ten minutes after—I cannot say to a minute—the prisoner did not say anything in my presence—I examined the premises—I found, at No. 17, a gimlet near the keyhole and at No. 18, one gimlet bored near the key hole, and another near the door post; and from what I was told in the prisoner's presence—I went near to Mr. A Vila's shop, and there found a fourth gimlet.</p>

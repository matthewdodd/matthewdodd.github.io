On the 11th of June, about seven o'clock, the prisoner came to redeem some goods for herself, and when she had redeemed them she offered a watch to pledge for a man, she said, that lived in her house; he wanted to make up some money. I lent her four guineas upon the watch. The watch is worth ten pounds.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The person for whom I pledged the watch I had a slight knowledge of about two years; he has asked me at different times to pledge things for him, which I did. He expressed a great dislike to pledging anything himself. I met him on the 4th of June, in Covent Garden market. I had then in market, to the her shop, for some herbs I had been afficted for some months. I was extremely in when I met him. He asked me how I was; I told him my husband had left me; I was ill in health. He asked me to pledge him a watch; I told him I would. I told him I was going to Mr. Cameron, who is my pawnbroker. He gave me the watch, and told me to ask four guineas upon it. I pledged it; the gentleman lent me four guineas upon it; he gave four one-pound notes, three shillings, a sixpence, and some copper.</p>

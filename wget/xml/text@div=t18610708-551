               <p>was in an omnibus; it was unable to proceed, and I alighted—when I got out there was a considerable crowd—I got out in Cheapside, close to Mr. Bennett's shop—the crowd was caused by the funeral of Mr. Braidwood—I went in the direction of Lombard-street, intending to go there, and endeavoured to turn round Queen-street to avoid the crowd—an omnibus which was coming by, caused a rush of people against me—the people went past me, and immediately I felt a pressure on my left-hand side, a slight motion at my waistcoat pocket, upon which I placed my hand there, and found my watch was gone, and the chain hanging, broken—I instantly turned and observed a man pressing against me, whose hand was being removed from my side—I should have seized him but that I noticed his hand moving rapidly round in this direction, towards the left, towards the prisoner who was in front of him with his back towards us—I saw the prisoner appear to receive it with his right hand; he put his hand round to meet the other man's hand, and some words passed between them which I could not hear—I immediately laid hold of the prisoner—he received what I believed to be my watch—I have no doubt he received something—a policeman did not come up for some time—I called, "Police," and removed the prisoner, as far as I could, from anybody but myself—I kept hold of him till a policeman came.</p>

I was on duty in Cheapside, on Saturday afternoon, 29th June—I did not hear the cry—I saw the prisoner and prosecutor struggling with each other, the prisoner trying to get away from the prosecutor—I crossed over and caught hold of the prisoner immediately—the prosecutor said, "He has got my watch, policeman"—I asked him if he saw him take the watch from his pocket—he said, "No; but I saw the hand of the one that had taken it, pass it to the prisoner—the prisoner said, "I have not taken it"—I took the prisoner in custody—a person in the crowd said, so that the prisoner could hoar it, "It is all</p>

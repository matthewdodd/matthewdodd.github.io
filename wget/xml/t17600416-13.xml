The three prisoners came into my house on the 10th of March, about one in the day, called for a pint of beer and sat down all together in a box in the publick room. Elizabeth Parker went out into the yard, where she staid about two or three minute, and then came in and sat down again. In about a minute or two after that Gates gave me a shilling to change. I changed it, and took for the pint of beer. Then they went away, and I said they were welcome. In my back room were some crack'd pewter pots that ran, and I had put them by there A the three prisoners were all very well dressed, I did not mistrust any thing, neither had I missed any thing. After this, the same day, I was sent for by justice Welch, to know whether I had lost any I said I did not know that I had lost any He desired I would look among some were there, which I did, and found two pint, one half pint, one pewter dish, and one pewter plate, my property; these were out of the back room.

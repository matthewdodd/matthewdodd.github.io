About half-past three on the morning of 15th March I was on duty in Clifton Road, Now Cross—Mr. Smith's public-house is at the corner of Clifton Road and Angus Street—I saw a light in the house and heard footsteps—some one ran to the side door in Augus Street, pushed it, gave a whistle, and said, "Jack, come on"—directly afterwards I saw the prisoner come out of the front door and run round the corner into Augus Street—I ran after him and caught him about 150 yards off—I never lost sight of him—I asked him what he had run away for—he said, "Nothing"—I then asked him where he dame from—he said, "From the New Cut"—I called Mr. Smith up and he looked over the place and missed several things.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Dewdrop public-house, in the parish of St. Paul, Deptford—about half-past three on the morning of 18th March I was knocked up by the constable—I came down and found the bar-parlour window open—I also found that the drawers in the bar had been turned out—I had closed the sliding shutters outside about six o'clock the previous evening—there were marks of violence on the door between the bar and the parlour, but it had not been oponed—I went outside and found a box of cigars, a box containing screws, of tobacco, and a rifle, which were safe in my house when I closed it at twelve o'clock—I missed about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the till—the front door had marks on it as if it had been prised open by a crowbar—it had given way, and I think that is the way they got in.</p>

                  </hi>. I was twenty-two years in business in Mortimer-street, and have now retired on my means—six years ago I purchased the leasehold interest in five houses in Bolsover-street, and, about a year and a quarter ago, I purchased the house in question, 63, Bolsover-street—I let the houses out in apartments, and placed a deputy in the parlours of each to let it out for me—in No. 63 I entrusted that duty to a man named Simmonds and his wife from the end of September—the prisoner became the tenant of the front room, second floor in July, 1865; under my previous deputy, Mrs. Walter—he remained there till 23d January—I gave his wife notice to quit on 4th September, but they did not do so—I summoned him before a Magistrate for running after me furiously out of his room, and saying, "Now I have got you I will do for you"—he ran after me to the third floor—the Magistrate bound him over to keep the peace towards me—on 17th January I went there and saw a board five or six feet long and a frame at the end of it about eight inches deep and two or three feet long, out at the second floor front room window, on which was a paper with the words, "Bawdy House" written very conspicuously in the form of printing letters—this is the frame (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I got a broker to go and look at it—there were people in groups in the street looking at it, and there was great excitement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On 1st January, this year—Mrs. Simmonds, my deputy, came to me at the end of September, with her husband, apparently, and said that they wanted to take the apartments, and that she was a dressmaker and her husband a carpenter—they went to the house together, I believe, but I cannot be sure of anything I have not seen—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my writing—on the day after Christmas day I let John Simmonds, the apparent husband, the room I had let to the prisoner, but Simmonds had been in the house from September—I firmly believed she was the wife of Mr. Simmonds—she was my deputy at the time this happened, and had had the letting of the various rooms from September to January—I did not try to find out for my solicitor where she had gone to—I never saw her since I found she had deceived me, which was at the police-court, when she swore she was not married to Simmonds, having told me the day previous that she would take her oath that there was no truth in the report that she was not married—she was my witness at the police-court—she said there that she had let men into the house to prostitutes; but the very day before she had told me she would take her oath that not a gentleman had been in the house since she had been there—I sent them all off because my confidence was gone, and I should have sent her off before if I had known it—I had a complaint about No. 63 in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186602260017"></xptr>
               <p>October—Mr. Atchison wrote to me to say that Mrs. Walter, my deputy, was an improper character, and next morning I called on him, and told him that Mrs. Walter had been gone out of the house for two or three weeks—he said, "If she is gone, I have nothing more to say"—I gave him the numbers of my other houses, and said that if he knew anything wrong of them I should be obliged to him to let me know—I have not found out to this day that Mrs. Walter was an improper character—Mr. Atchison is a solicitor, of, I believe, No. 78, Bolsover-street—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his second letter—Mrs. Walter was withdrawn before the first letter was written—Nose. 62 and 63 are my houses—I never had anything to do with No. 65—(<hi rend="italic">A letter from the Vestry of All Souls' Parish was here produced</hi>)—I do not know whether "the abandoned woman" spoken of here is Mrs. Walter—Mrs. Simmonds said she would take her oath that Mrs. Walter had not been there, but that her daughter had come for letters—if I may believe Mrs. Simmonds, prostitutes were living in the house and receiving men up to the time the board was put up—but I cleared out every woman, guilty or not guilty—this letter is dated 29th December.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let us go on: "As these women very frequently return home in open day, followed by paramours, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c</hi>., I am directed to require that the house be cleared forthwith, and to intimate that any similar complaint will be submitted to the solicitor of the Duke of Portland." Is the Duke of Portland the ground landlord? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Mrs. Simmonds was my deputy at that time—I cleared out all the women, and cleared out Mrs. Simmonds as soon as I could—she remained up to the time the board was exhibited—I will explain that; on 1st January I went there to serve the notice to quit, I opened Moran's door, and he rushed after me, and kept me nearly two hours like a prisoner in the house—the law does not allow you to take these women and turn them out—the wife of a police-constable did not complain that there were prostitutes in the house, but when I gave Mrs. Robinson, at No 58, notice, she said that Mrs. Powell, my deputy there, ought to be turned out; but I had known Mr. Powell as a respectable man holding a responsible situation for twelve years—Mrs. Robinson is a police<lb></lb>man's wife—she is quiet enough—they lived in the front kitchen at 58—she never said that prostitutes had been living in that house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will read your statement at the police-court: "His wife made a complaint about the prostitutes living in the house." Is that true, or is it not, did she complain about prostitutes lodging in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not, but in her fury, she is such a virago that she really said to me that I was an improper character—I told Mr. Robinson that I would have him for a tenant for years, but as to his wife, it was impossible—I have no distinct recollection of her complaining that there were prostitutes in the house—I never advised my deputies in different houses that no policeman should be taken in to lodge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I have again your statement at the police-court, "I have advised that no policeman should be taken into the house." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was about Mrs. Powell, that was confined to No. 58—amongst other ladies to whom these rooms were let, there were some French artificial flower makers—Mrs. Simmonds let the rooms to them—I did not go after the references—either I or my wife collected the rents—persons are sometimes out and leave the rent with the deputy—I waited on these French ladies at 63 and collected their rent, one had the second floor, and the other the Second floor back—they dressed very plain and simple, as you see them dressed in the streets of Paris—they were mother and daughter, and one of them could not speak</p>

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many houses have you got altogether? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ninety—I have been spending money on the repairs of these houses ever since I have had them—No. 63 is in thorough good repair—Mrs. Simmonds is about thirty or thirty-five—I cannot tell whether a woman is married by looking at her; she assured me that she was married, and her husband too—one of the French ladies is sixty or seventy, and her daughter thirty or thirty five—they seemed to be dressmaking when I went there—until I received this letter, I had not the slightest idea that there was anything wrong, and I know nothing about it now but what I have been told—there is a grandmother, mother, and daughter at the top, but I never heard anything against them—all my houses in that street are let in that way—I have had no complaints against the others—I know the character of Bolsover-street when it went by the name of Norton-street, and I always said to the persons who I let them to, "Be sure you take no loose women, and have no people that are in the habit of drinking and fighting; get working men and their wives, if you can"—if I render the place respectable, it will add to its value—the houses are very much improved; they are worth half as much again.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">At the close of the case for the prosecution</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no case to go to the Jury. Counts two and three charged that the words "Bawdy House" were published of and concerning the occupiers of the house in Bolsover-street, without mentioning the names of those persons, and were therefore bad. Count four, which charged a nuisance by causing persons to assemble in the street and obstruct passengers, was not supported by any evidence. As to the first count, the words did not impute, as the inuendo alleged, that the house was a bawdy house to the knowledge of Mr. Williams, and although it might be a libel on the house, it did not amount to a criminal offence, unless it was also a libel on an individual</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">admitted that the fourth Count failed for want of evidence. He contended that the second and third Counts were good in point of form, if the Jury believed that the libel was directed against the persons inhabiting the house. But the real issue was, no doubt, raised on the first Count; and there was abundant evidence that the defendant, out of spite, and in consequence of being summoned by Mr. Williams for a breach of the peace, intended by the words to impute the charge set forth in the inuendo/—namely, that it was a bawdy house with the consent, and by the procurement of that gentleman</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>, <hi rend="italic">in reply, cited the Queen</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Barrett</hi> (32 <hi rend="italic">"Law Journal," Magistrates' Cases, p</hi>. 36), <hi rend="italic">where it was held that if the landlord of a weekly tenant, using the house as a brothel, received no additional rent, he could not be convicted of keeping a brothel after notice of the immoral occupation, simply because he did not give the tenant notice to quit. The learned Counsel also quoted the Queen</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Stannard</hi> (33 "<hi rend="italic">Law Journal</hi>," <hi rend="italic">Magistrates' Cases, p</hi>. 61), <hi rend="italic">where it was held that a landlord, letting the rooms of a house weekly to young women who, to his knowledge, used them for purposes of prostitution, could not be convicted of keeping a disorderly house, if he only went to his house to collect his rents, received no share of the girls' earnings, and had no other control over them than the right to end their tenancies. It was, therefore, clear, from these cases, that the libel could not affect Mr. Williams, who did not live in the house, and who was in much the same position as the defendant Stannard</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I have retired from business, and have lived at 76, Bolsover-street, seven years—that is on the same side as 63, some distance off—I am a vestryman of St. Marylebone—I have not seen anything particular going on at 63; but, six or seven months ago, in consequence of what my neighbours said, I told Mr. Williams that it was a serious matter, that there was no doubt the house was very badly let, and that it could be proved that women lived in the house who walked the streets for their living, and that if it was not altered, the Vestry would take the matter up—he appeared not to like what I said, and we separated.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did Mr. Williams really say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said, "You must not believe all you hear," and that there was a complaining party in the house, and he would get rid of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 73, Bolsover-street, on the same side as 63, and am a wholesale blind manufacturer—I know No. 63 very well, and have been accosted to go there—the first time was a fortnight before Christmas, when two ladies met me, and one said, "Will you go home with me, my dear?"—I said, "Where do you reside?"—she said, "A little way up the street here"—they told me that they lived at No. 63—I have never been with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at 64, Bolsover-street—I have stood at my door and seen gay women go into No. 63, and gentlemen in white kid gloves follow them, and dogs after them—I have seen those ladies walking in Portland-place—three or four have lived there since Mr. Williams took the house—they vary at different times; some leave, and fresh ones come in—persons from that house have walked the streets during the last twelve months—I have seen them look at gentlemen, and come home with them in Hansoms and go into the house, which has been a nuisance to me.</p>

I live at 41, Buckingham-street; the landlord's entrance is in Bolsover-street, near No. 63, which has been a thorough bad house for the last two months—I have seen ladies go in there with gentlemen—there was a lady on the second floor named Emma Moore, who was kept by a gentleman named Nat Savage, who drives in his coach and horse up Bolsover-street now—he lodges at No. 66, Mrs. Dawkins'—he is an old gentleman—I have seen Mrs. Simmonds open the door to gentlemen, and let them in and out—I know she used to let the parlours out occasionally for temporary affairs to gentlemen and ladies who did not lodge in the house.</p>

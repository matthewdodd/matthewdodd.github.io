I was talking of my loss at Leaden-hall, and was told there had been a goose sold for 3 s. which was worth upwards of 4 s. I went and looked at it, and found it a goose worth 4 s. 6 d. at Leaden-hall market; it was a town-fed goose, and was foul killed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find it?</p>
               <p>Laycock. I found it in St. Catharine's: the person said he bought it of the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by being foul killed?</p>
               <p>Laycock. It had had its throat cut, and was thrown into a sack; the blood was congealed in it: in the manner it was killed, it appeared to be a stolen goose.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176410170004"></xptr>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Laycock. I am a goose-seeder. I went and searched the prisoner's house, and found the two ends of goose wings: (produced in court): they exactly fit to the wings. I am sure they were cut off from that goose.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the goose in its feathers?</p>
               <p>Laycock. It was out of the feathers.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you distinguish with certainty between a country goose, and a town fed goose.</p>
               <p>Laycock. There is as much difference between the one and the other, as between a piece of superfine cloth, and other common cloth; they cannot feed a goose in the country as we can here.</p>

            . I sell geese. I had a goose which I asked 4 s. 6 d. for; a person told me he had bought a better for 3 s. upon which, when the prosecutor complained he had been robbed, I went with him to that man (he is not here): I saw it was a town fed goose. When the prisoner was taken up, he owned he sold that and two others, for 3 s. each: he said, he bought them of one Mr. Cook, for 2 s. a piece.</p>

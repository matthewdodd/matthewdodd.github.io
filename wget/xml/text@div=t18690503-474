                  </hi>. I live at 3, Raven's Row, Spitalfields, where I carry on the business of a grocer—the prisoners were my servants, Whimper as nurse and Toohey as her assistant—there was another servant, named Martha Bradley, who was my cook—on the afternoon of Sunday, 11th April, I and my wife went from home, and we did not return till about 11.30 at night—when we left, Toohey was gone to a Sunday school, and Bradley was to leave about 6 o'clock—everything was perfectly safe up to 3.45—on my return I found the police and firemen in charge of my house—ray bedroom on the second floor had been very extensively burnt—a chest of drawers</p>

               <p>were nearly consumed—the partition between the room and the adjoining one was burnt through—the part destroyed was not near the drawers, but in another part of the room—the paint on the wall was blistered—the bed-room on the third floor, which was occupied by the assistants, had been in flames all round—the mattress of the bed had been out open, and the straw pulled out on both sides, and it had been burnt, as also the bed-clothes, though they were not entirely destroyed—in this room the fire had not extended to the walls—in the room adjoining, the servant's room, the bed had been fired—the mattress on one side had been cut open, and the straw pulled out, and part of it had been consumed—the bed-clothes were also burnt—the walk were not injured—in the dressing-room adjoining my own room on the second floor, was a chest of drawers—a fireman opened one of the drawers, and called my attention to the burnt condition of some of my shirts there—on the Sunday night we questioned each of the servants as to how the fire had happened—Toohey made a statement to me and the inspector of the Fire Brigade—she said that at 10.30 she went up stairs with the candles and slop pail, to prepare her mistress's room for the night; that when she went to her mistress's bed-room door, a cloud of smoke came from the top of the house; that she placed the candlestick on the drawers and called loudly for help, and the other servant came up—I questioned Whimper the same night, and she told me she could give no information as to how the fire bad originated.</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—Whimper had been in my service three, and Toohey two months—I corroborate my husband as to the state of the premises when we returned home—about a fortnight before the fire I lost a bunch of keys—in the drawer above the one in which the shirts were placed, I placed, after I lost the keys, a small cash-box, con<lb></lb>taining two sovereigns and two half-sovereigns—after the fire the money was missing—I have since recovered the keys—I was present when the prisoners were given into custody on the Friday after the fire—Toohey said that she had not fired the house herself, but that Whimper had done it—she was with her when she opened the drawer, and that she, Whimper, took the money and placed it in her bosom—she said they had broken open the box in the young men's room; that they tried to break it open at the back by forcing open the hinges, but that they broke the back as well, and that Whimper said it was a judgment on them for doing wrong; that she should get up and murder Mr. Airton, one of the assistants, in the night; that she, Toohey, said, "Do not do that;" upon which Whimper remarked, "Then I will set the house on fire"—this conversation took place in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cook in the service of Mr. Barham—they call me Mary—on Sunday, April 11th, I went out about 6 o'clock in the evening, and returned about 8.20—Toohey and Whimper were in the house then, and master's three young children, Percy, Louisa, and Cor<lb></lb>nelius—I went into the kitchen and lit the gas, and then I accompanied Toohey to the nursery—Whimper was in the night nursery, getting the baby to bed—we had our supper in the nursery, and after that I went up stain with Toohey, for the purpose of taking my clothes into my own bed-room, at the top of the house—this was about 9 o'clock—she lit the candle on the landing, and then set it down on the table in my bed-room, and left—there was nothing the matter with my bed at that time—after I had put my things away, I came down into my mistress's bed-room, and all appeared to be right there—then I went into the right nursery, and next into the kitchen, and there I saw Whimper and Toohey—it was now about 9.20—we then went into the dining-room and played the piano, and there we remained about a quarter of an hour—Whimper then went up stairs, and Toohey remained with me in the dining-room—whilst Whimper was up stairs we heard a noise at the door, and I and Toohey went to see what it was—we found that some boys were at play; we ordered them away, and remained at the door for about five or ten minutes—then we returned to the dining-room, and it was about 9.55 then—Whimper had come down stairs again, I then went into the night nursery, looked at the baby, and returned to the dining room, where I had left Whimper and Toohey—in a short time Whimper asked Toohey to go up stairs, as she thought she heard the baby cry—Toohey was away about five or ten minutes, and when she came down she said the reason she had been so long was that the baby was awake, and that she had been lying down because she had a very bad headache—we remained in the dining-room for a short time longer, when Toohey asked Whimper to fetch down a piece of music which Whimper possessed, and she replied she did not know where it was—Toohey said it was the third piece from the bottom, in the night nursery, and she would go herself—I said that master and mistress would soon be at home, and that we had better go to our right places—this was about 10.20—Whimper then took the music, and went up stairs, and was followed by Toohey; but Toohey came down again, and fetched the</p>

I went to Mr. Barbam's about 11 o'clock on the Sunday night—I saw the prisoners in the drawing-room afterwards, and spoke to them—Toohey said, that at 10.30 she took a slop<lb></lb>pail and a candle to go and empty the slops in her mistress's bed-room, and that when she got on the landing on the second floor she saw smoke descend<lb></lb>ing, and gave the alarm; everything appeared to be safe in her mistress's bed-room at the time she went in; they rescued the children, the firemen were fetched, and soon the fire was extinguished—I took down a statement in writing, on the day they were taken into custody—I charged Toohey, first with stealing the money from the drawer, and then with wilfully setting fire to the house—this is the statement—Toohey said, "After Mary went out at 6 o'clock, we sat down against the window in the kitchen till 10.30, and then we put Percy to bed We then went into master's bed-room; Whimper had the keys, and looked into the dressing-room drawers; she opened a little box, which was inside, and locked it again. We then went up stairs to Mr. Airton's bed-room, and she undid the box—the lock broke whilst she was undoing the back screws with a small hammer. I said, 'That is a judgment on us;' she said, 'I don't know what to do, I shall murder Mr. Airton in the middle of the night;' I said, 'Don't do that.' We then came down stairs, and she said, 'I will set the house on fire;' then we put the baby to bed and Mary came in; we all three then had our supper in the nursery. Mary and I then went up stairs to our bed-room to take her things off. I came down first and she followed, and then we went into the kitchen and washed up the tea-things. We all three then proceeded to the dining-room and played the piano. This was about 9.30. Whimper sat in the arm chair a little while, and then went up stairs for about five minutes, then came down and played the piano for about ten minutes; she next went up stairs to fetch her music. When she came back she said, 'I can't find the keys of mistress's drawers; you go.' I said, 'I shall not.' She said, again, 'Go, your life depends on it.' Mary was present when this was said, but did not hear it. I refused to go; she then gave me the keys, and told me to go up stairs to mistress's drawers. Whimper went with me. I unlocked the dressing-room, and Whimper took the money out of the drawer, and put it into her bosom; she then said, whilst on the stairs, 'Don't it smell; Mary will smell it in a minute.' I then came down, and Whimper stayed up stairs. I washed my hands, and in five or ten minutes I went up stairs again with the slop pail and candle. I said, 'Look at the smoke, nurse; I shall call Mary.' She said, 'No,' but I did call her, and we all three took the children out of bed and saved them. Whimper has told me that she put lucifers into her mistress's drawers. This was said while she and I were making the young mens' bed that same night, after the fire was extinguished; she also told me she put the money and purse into the coal-cellar, and the keys under the sofa in the dining-room."—I saw both keys and money put into the coal-cellar by the nurse, the money about 10 o'clock in the morning, and the keys on Tuesday—I had seen Whimper a short time previous to this take the keys from a crevice in the night<lb></lb>nursery—on</p>

                  </hi>. I am a metal dealer, of 43, Silver Street, Rotherhithe—on 6th July the prisoner came to purchase four boilers—they weighed 111lb., at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound, which would be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he borrowed 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of me, and gave me this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, signed "R. Mole," as a deposit on the purchase—he said he would send on the Monday—on the Monday a person called from him and brought this cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "July 7, 1878. Dear Sir,—Enclosed is cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for coppers. Will see you some time to-morrow. Please return the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque by the bearer. Yours Wm. Bird.") I had cashed, the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque on the Saturday evening—I got it back on the Wednesday following from Mr. Glover, marked "No effects"—I took the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque to my own bank, the London and Westminster, and that was afterwards returned, marked "No effects."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Norman Street, St. Luke's—I know the prisoner—on 12th July he sold me this pawn-ticket, and with it I redeemed four boilers from Attenborough's, in Greek Street, Soho.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. It was not arranged that we should sell them and divide the profit—I promised, if I made so much by them, I would give you some<lb></lb> thing out of it—I have known you some time, and always thought you respectable—you brought some man to say he was going to purchase the boilers for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I admit writing the cheque, but with an ulterior motive, never intending it to be used. When I found that the negotiation was not going on, I wrote to Mr. Kennard requesting him to return the cheque, and I handed him my cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. where I had an account; he accepted it, and agreed to return the difference between the value of the cheque and the coppers. I intended to pay in money to meet the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque; but finding I could not do it, I went and asked Mr. Kennard to accept my own cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

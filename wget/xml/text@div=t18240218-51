On the 15th of January, he came to me, and stated, that a quantity of galls ought to be forwarded immediately to Scotland; we had been particularly engaged; he said, he had better pay for them, and forward them. I asked him the amount, he produced the weigh-notes of the East India Company, and in pencil put down the amount, and said it was 86 l. 11 s. 11 d., but that the Company owed us 9 l. 10 s. overpaid on a former occasion, and a draft for 77 l. 1 s. 11 d. would be required for these galls. I wrote a draft for that amount, desired him to pay for them, and forward them immediately. I asked him in the afternoon if he had done so, he said yes, and had forwarded them. I asked him repeatedly since, in consequence of a correspondence between us and our friends in Scotland; he invariably said, that they were forwarded; he absconded last Monday week, and we discovered this.</p>

I am engineer in the Metropolitan fire brigade—on 16th September, at 12.46, I was called to a fire in Hayter Road—I found the bottom part of the house well alight—the under part of the staircase was on fire, and the flames were ascending—I could not get inside, I saw through the glass of the door—I got an engine ready for work, and having some time to wait for water, my attention was drawn to some shavings which went from the house to the third house from it—I went to the third house, saw the prisoner there, and asked him if there was any chance of getting any water—he said "No, only the water which was in the closets"—I got some water, got the engine to work, and extinguished the fire—I then found the remains of a bag of shavings under the staircase—they were all burnt except the bottom part—I afterwards saw the prisoner, and asked him if he could account for how the fire originated—he said "No"—I called his attention to the shavings; he said he knew nothing about them—I said "Is there any way of getting into the place?"—he said "Any one could get in at the back"—I found the fire originated under the stairs, where the bag of shavings was—it had burnt the staircase away, and the whole house, nine rooms, was damaged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder of Battersea Park—the prisoner was in my employ as night watchman to look after some houses which I had completed in Hayter Road, Brixton—they were safe on loth September, and I left them in the prisoner's charge—I was called by a constable on 16th September, between 3 and 4 o'clock, and found the corner house which was named the Hayter Castle, had the staircase burnt out, and the ceiling was much damaged by fire and water—I said to the prisoner, who was there, "How did this occur?"—he said "I can't tell, I am sure"—I said "You ought to know; I put you in to look after the buildings, and it is your place to know"—I asked him where he was when it occurred—he said "Well, I certainly was not on the premises; I had run away for a time"—I told him he ought to be horse-whipped for not looking after the property better "How on earth could any one get in to fire this house, as I left it shut and bolted, with you last evening, and the front door locked—he said he could not account for it—I said "I have a strong opinion that you are the scamp who has done it"—he said "I am sorry to hear you say that"—I asked him where he had been in the habit of lying down lately, because he had no home—he said "On the first floor, back of the fourth house"—I said "Let us go and see your bed"—the constable, the fireman, the prisoner, and myself went there, and found two sacks—the prisoner said "That is where I laid down last night"—I said "I don't believe it; what has become of your bed, that you had in the back parlour down stairs? let us go and see it"—I went down, and found that the two sacks of shavings which he had been lying on were gone—I said "What has become of them?"—he said "Oh, I emptied those out about a week ago"—I said "You won't dare tell me that, will you? don't you remember my remonstrating with you last evening for allowing one of the sacks to lay out in the middle of the room, as I had always told you to stand thorn up against the wall in the day time?"—he said "I think you must be mistaken"—I said "You know I am not; if you emptied those shavings, what has become of the sacks?—he said "I put them in the lock up"—the fireman put his lamp down towards the floor, it</p>

               <p>being before day-break, and then we saw traces of mahogany shavings from the back parlour to the house that was burnt down, all along the passage and pathway—I said "This more than convinces me that you have done it, because we have no mahogany shavings on the premises, except those which your sacks were filled with—he said that nobody could get in as I had locked the whole of the doors and gave him the keys the night before—he then said "I cannot tell, I am sure, unless they have got over at the back"—I asked the fireman, in the prisoner's presence, how he found the back premises—he said that he found them closed—a police sergeant came up, and that ended the conversation—I afterwards saw the prisoner again, and said "I cannot tell what could possess you to do such a wicked deed; I have been to the police station, a detective is coming at 8 o'clock, and unless you can clear yourself very much more than you have at present, I shall be under the necessity of giving you in charge. (<hi rend="italic">The Court considered that this amounted to a threat which would exclude the Prisoner's answer</hi>). He made some answer and left at once—I went to look for him with the policeman, but could not find him—on the evening before the fire, a widow who has four children, and whom I employ to clean the houses, had some difficulty in getting water, as it was not laid on, and I told the prisoner I should expect him to get water for her, and assist her in any way—just before I left I saw her, some conversation passed, and I afterwards saw the prisoner and said to him, "How is it you have caused this poor woman to go home and lose her time, by not providing any water for her?—he said "I don't know"—I said "She tells me you would neither draw it for her, nor allow her to have the can; where is the can?—he said "It is in the cupboard, locked up"—I said "You are an unmitigated scoundrel, to treat a poor widow in that way, who has to keep four children; if I acted by you as you have by her, I should discharge you—you are not worth the name of a man—the Insurance company have paid me 147<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

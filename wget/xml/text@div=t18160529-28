On the 17th of May last, I had been passing the evening with some friends in Hungerford-street, in the Strand; it was nearly eleven o'clock when I left them; I drank nothing but ale all the evening; I came directly down the Strand, and Fleet-street, and up Ludgate hill, in my way home. When I got to the top of Ludgate-hill, I was going to cross to get to the left hand side of St. Paul's Church-yard, when an elderly gentleman, with either grey or powdered hair, ran against me; a few words ensued, and the two prisoners came up to me; I have no doubt of them. They said, the old man was in fault; they said they would stand my friends, and they each took hold of my arms, and took me out of the crowd which had collected. We then proceeded up St. Paul's Churchyard, and got into Friday-street, and met a watchman there, and asked him if any house was open in the neighbourhood where the prisoners and I might have a friendly glass together; it was I that proposed to take a friendly glass. The watchman told us that they were up at the White Horse, in Friday-street; we went there, and got a glass each, I and the two prisoners; I had a glass of brandy and water, and they had each a glass of rum; one of them paid for it. We all went out together; we were not in the house ten minutes; we all left it together. I then asked them the way to the Belle Savage Inn, on Ludgate-hill, as it was so late, and they said, they would tell me. We then turned down to the right into Fish-street; I was a stranger to that neighbourhood, and have learned since that that is the name of the street. We then turned down <placeName id="t18160529-28-crimeloc141">Lambeth-hill</placeName>

The effect of the blow was that I fell. I was a good deal stunned.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what happened to you while you were on the ground - A. I was robbed while I was on the ground; my pocket-book and watch were taken from me while I was down; I missed them when I came to myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel any body taking them - A. No; I did not. I was stunned by the blow or fall. I had my pocket-book and watch immediately before.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the last time you felt your pocketbook and watch about you - A. In Fish-street; when I had left Mr. Mountain's, then I had them safe. When I got up, Jonas was with me, and he only. The watchman came up just at that moment, and I told him, I was robbed of my pocket-book and watch. Jonas was present when I told the watchman this. He said, you don't think I have robbed you, do you, if you do, I will go with you to the watchhouse. We then proceeded down the hill altogether; when we got near to the bottom, Jonas asked the watchman how far it was to the watchhouse. The watchman told him it was close at hand, when he immediately ran off, and the watchman after him; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290018"></xptr>got clear off. I went down to the watchhouse. I saw them again in about a fortnight after; not before; I can't exactly say. I had given a description of them. I knew the notes, and the numbers of them; I went to the Bank of England the next morning; eleven of them came into the Bank of England, but they have all fictitious addresses on them; I had nineteen five-pound bank notes, and eleven of them have been stopped.</p>

            . I was a watchman on Lambeth-hill. On the 7th of May, I heard a scuffle and noise between twelve and one; I made up to the spot as quick as I could; when I got there, I found a little man, but can't swear to the prisoner Jonas. I found Mr. Shaw and that little man arm in arm; Mr. Shaw stood a little, and then said, he was robbed of his pocket-book; then he said, he was robbed of his watch. The little man said, if he thought he had robbed him, he would go with him to the watch-house, and he searched. I laid hold of the gentleman one side, and he on the other; we were alls going to the watchhouse together, and when we got a little distance from the watchhouse, the little man asked me how far it was off, and I told him not far, and he immediately loosed the gentleman, and ran away from him, and I after him, crying stop thief; but he got clear away, and was not stopped.</p>

            . I am an officer. I received information of this robbery from Richard Shaw; I think that was about Friday, the 10th; I received a description of the prisoners two or three days after the robbery, from Mr. Mountain; I did not know Mr. Shaw. In consequence of that description, I desired the two prisoners, whom I knew, to meet me at the Mansion House coffee-house; they met me there on the 21st. I did not tell Mr. Shaw that they were in the room; but I immediately went to Mr. Mountain, and requested him and his waiter would step down, and go into the parlour, and see if there was any body there they knew; the waiter came first, and I sent him into the room, and he came out into passage, and said he believed the little one to be one. I then desired him to go back and fetch his master. Mr. Mountain then came, and pointed out the little one. I then went up to the Mansion House; but found the Lord Mayor was gone. I locked them up in the Compter for that night; the next morning I brought them before the Lord Mayor. I suppose there were at least seven or eight persons in the room where the prisoners were, when Mr. Shaw went in; it is a back room; I had seen the two men at the bar the day before.</p>

After he came to me, we were continually missing things; that was the first time, when I turned him away. I had always a suspicion; and in a chest which he had locked up in my house, he had some of my goods; when I was going to turn him away, he wanted to go up stairs for a bundle. I went up with him; there was no bundle; he said it was down in a cellar. He went away; I never suffered him to go into the room any more. The box was locked; I asked him to open this chest, while he went backwards and forwards twenty times. I never could get sight of the things inside; he was indebted to me some money; I was to let him have his tools, and he was to leave those things in the room that were belonging to him, as a security till he paid me my money. I told him, from time to time, that he never should take the chest away till I saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140094"></xptr>inside of it; he left about the 6th of September; on the 31st of December, he came and behaved in a very audacious manner, and told me he would make me deliver the property up; he said he wanted a pocket-book out of the chest, concerning some law-suit, and begged very hard to go up to the chest; after my young man had got the key, he made answer, I do not know whether you will not find some spatulas of yours, and some files, which I put either in the chest or behind the chest, when the rooms were washed. The room never was washed since it was a store-room. I said then, that is the parcel we lost about five months ago; we had lost such a parcel, and the prisoner had been employed with others to get up some others in the place of those. I told him also about some other files which were in a store-room I would not let him go into; he said, when the room was washed, he put them in there because they should not be damaged; and the spatulas were not finished, and the files were in papers, when there were hundreds lying about the same room. The files must have been taken out of another room; my young man and me went up stairs. I never touched the key, nor did I unlock it. The prisoner swore d - n his eyes if he did not go up stairs, and pushed by the man; we were looking for the pocket-book, and there we found the spatulas and files; and the prisoner rushed in to the chest; whether we took any thing out, I cannot say; he endeavoured to put down the lid of the the chest; he locked the chest, and went away with the key. The next day I got a warrant from the Lord Mayor, and it was opened in presence of one of his officers; and these nine spatulas and four dozen and a half of files were found in it. I know the spatulas by being the work in my house; the files I know by the private mark.</p>

               <p>Mr. Schoen, prisoner's counsel. How long have you dealt largely in instrument-making? - Ever since the death of Mr. Wrigglesworth.</p>
               <p>Has not this man assisted you very much with custom in that trade? - He certainly has, or I never should have taken him again.</p>
               <p>Was not all of your work done from this man's patterns? - Not all of it; most of it was.</p>
               <p>Had not he the care of the room where the instruments were? - He had not the key wholly; the key hung always up in the counting-house; he had liberty to go and take it up at any time.</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to the prosecutor, almost four years; the prisoner gave me the key of the chest to go up stairs to get a pocketbook for him, wherein he said there was a duplicate for a watch, which he wanted; he then said, he believed there were some spatulas and files, either in the chest, or behind the chest, he was not sure which, which he put in when the room was washed. It is a small room, a store-room, and had been so used before he came this last time; but it had been made use of for a bed-room, after he left it the first time. The prisoner was in the shop while I went up: we did not chuse he should go.</p>
               <p>Did you find the chest locked? - Yes. I unlocked it; my master was present. I found those spatulas and files, and some other articles. The prisoner came up soon after, forced down the lid of the chest, and locked it and took the key. The next morning my master got a search-warrant, and opened the box, and there were found these spatulas and files.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>These spatulas were delivered to me, to be finished by me or the other workmen that were to work under my directions; and the files, some of them, had been used; they were put into the chest, because the maid has frequently moped the room, if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140095"></xptr>not washed it; nobody can swear to the the files. I had a very great opportunity of taking them long before I left Mr. Thorogood; and the spatulas were not finished.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eleven witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

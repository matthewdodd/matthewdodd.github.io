                  </hi>. I am the witness's father, and have been in the habit of having coals of the prisoner. On the 29th of January, my son came back about the coals he afterwards went back to Casey—the prisoner is the person who keeps the coal-shed—I saw the coals with when my son came with them—I asked the boy whether he and brought me good weight, and told him to put them on the floor in the bag—I then took hold of the bag. I took them to Mr. Haine's, in Noble-Steet, and saw them weighed—there they were 5lbs. short of weight, besides the bag—I went directly to Casey's shop—I saw him, and said, "Halloo, Governor, I am doubtful whether you sent my right weight of coals"—his boy had brought the coals back with me—the prisoner made an answer to that—a person named</p>

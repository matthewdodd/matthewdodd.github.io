                  </hi>. I live at 8, Worship-street, Finsbury, and am a car<lb></lb>riage washer, in the employment of Mary Ann Wright, a widow—she keeps livery stables at 10, North's buildings, Finsbury-circus—on 23d October last about a quarter-past 7 in the morning, I was in the yard dressing Mr. Carson's horses—he had a phaeton or waggonet then in the yard—the prisoner came into the yard at that time—I had not known him before—he first went to one of my fellow-servants, and he sent him to me—he said he came from Mr. Mason's for Mr. Carson's phaeton—I knew Mr. Mason; he is a coach-builder—I pulled the phaeton from the coach-house to the har<lb></lb>ness-room door, took out all the cushions, and was going to take out the lamps, when the prisoner said, "No, you had better leave them in, as the near lamp-iron is strained"—he said he was going to take it to Mr. Mason's, the coach-builder's, to have something done to the shackle-bolts—the shackle-bolts and spring-bolts are the same things—I made the remark that I did not think there was anything wanted doing to them—he made no answer to that—I allowed him to take the phaeton out of the yard, because he said he came from Mr. Mason—I believed what he said—I left the lamps in—the prisoner was alone—he was wearing a cap at the time.</p>

I live at 5, Queen's-square, Finsbury, and am a coach<lb></lb>man, in the employment of Mr. Pholinea—hie carriage stands in Mrs. Wright's yard—I was there on 23d October, about a quarter to 7 in the morning, cleaning my master's harness—I knew Mr. Carton had a carriage of some sort standing at livery there—the prisoner came in and said he came from Mr. Mason for a phaeton picked out with red, belonging to Mr. Parson—I said, "There is no such name here," and he turned it off and said, "Well, Carson"—he had a cap on his head at that time—the prisoner is the man—I told him to go to the other end of the yard—Hodges was there—I afterwards saw him in front of the carriage, after it was pulled out—I merely said to him then, "I don't envy you your job, dragging it up to Mr. Mason's"—he was not dragging it at that time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was going out one morning, looking for work, at different livery stables, when I met this man Brown, accidentally—he said he expected a job, and said he would bring it round to my place; the next morning he brought this carriage, and said, "In three weeks' time I shall see you again, and the carriage will be all ready." I said, "Yes, it will.' He then said he was going down to Brighton. I had no idea it was stolen, or I should not have taken it on my premises.</p>

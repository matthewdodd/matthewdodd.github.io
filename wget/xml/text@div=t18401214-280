                  </hi>. I keep a clothes-shop in Monmouth-street.

Lubbocks, the bankers, whom it was drawn on—I came back, and told him I had sent it to Lubbock's to get it changed—he then said he could not stop any longer, as he had to get his master's dinner ready by three o'clock—it was about ten minutes after three then—he said he would call again in the afternoon for the change, and the clothes also—I told him I suspected it was not right, and did not let him have the articles—I told him it was very strange for him, being a stranger to me, to leave 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my possession, that I was not satisfied with his answer, and I would follow him to where he lived—I followed him as far as Bond-street—he wanted to get down a small court there, in fact, he got down the court, and wanted to make his escape into a house there, which I prevented—he said he had a friend living there, a carpenter—I seized him, and got him into Bond-street, and gave him in charge of a policeman—I went with him to the station—the cheque was brought there by Alexander, my shopman, while he was there—he is not here.</p>

The prisoner was delivered into my charge in Bond-street by Aaron—I took him to No. 1, North Audley-street, as he said his master lived there—they knew nothing about him there—I took him to the station, searched him, and found two other cheques on him, which I produce—while he was there Alexander came in with the cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which has been produced—I am sure it is the same—it was shown to the prisoner—Alexander told him he had been to the bankers, and was not paid—he made no answer—the prisoner told me as I conveyed him to the station, that he had found the cheque—that was about a quarter of an hour afterwards when he told the prosecutor he lived in North Audley-street.</p>

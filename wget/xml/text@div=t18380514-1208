The prisoner is a letter-carrier, and has been em<lb></lb>ployed about ten years—he has been employed in several districts at Greenwich, Camberwell, and then at Kensington—he was employed at Kensington in sorting and delivering letters—letters which come from Kensington to London are sometimes taken by a rider, and sometimes by a mail cart—the prisoner was removed to the Kensington district about twelve months since—we have had a great many complaints of the loss of letters to and from Kensington, within the last twelve months—of letters passing through that post-office—on that account, these four letters were directed and sent to me—I directed them to be posted at Kensington and Bays water, by the witness Smithers—on the 18th of April, about the time these letters would come to London, J went to a house very near the Ken<lb></lb>sington Post-office, and when the mail-cart came up with the bags, I stopped it, and took, from the man who was driving, the Kensington Lon<lb></lb>don bag, which was sent from the Kensington office—it was sealed—I took it into the house, opened it, examined it, and found two of the letters which had been posted at Kensington, missing—the one addressed to St. John's College, Cambridge, and the one addressed to Messrs. Dill—one marked "double," and the other "double only"—the other two letters were in the bag—we had previously arranged to have the police in attend<lb></lb>ance, and if any thing was amiss, to give a signal—a signal was given—the officer was directed to detain all the carriers, and particularly to watch the prisoner—we immediately proceeded to the Post-office at Kensington, and on arriving at the door, found the prisoner in custody of Peak, the officer, who had give the letter addressed to Mr. Somers, I think, in his hand—the</p>

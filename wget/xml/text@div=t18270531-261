I and my family left town in October, and returned in November; the prisoner and Kelly (another servant) were left at home. On the 23d of December we went to Richmond, leaving nobody in the house but the prisoner, Kelly, and Mr. Smith, my brother-in-law; we returned on the 8th of January, and the prisoner said Kelly had been in the habit of having men living and sleeping with her, and unless she was dismissed she would not stay; Kelly was then dismissed; and two days after we sent the prisoner away, not respecting dishonesty but her morals, for doing precisely the same thing. I paid her 5s. I think - I believe there was about 1l. due to her - I have not paid her the rest - it has been demanded - she applied for a character on the 24th of January - my wife gave her a written one - she and her mother came to the house next day, and after that the prisoner summoned me for the 15s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What complaint did Kelly make of the prisoner? A. She said she had taken bread and meat and butter - the prisoner said Kelly had done the same - my wife was confined to her room, or she generally settles wages.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What did Kelly say? A. She said victuals had been sent out of the house once or twice a-week.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who gave instructions for this indictment? A. I did. I told the Grand Jury I did not accuse her of stealing the money.</p>

            . I lived as servant to Mr. Hume. The prisoner was there before me - she was cook; while master was away the last time there was victuals sent out; one day I remember a loaf of home-made bread, between a quartern and a half quartern, and about a pound of round of beef - she went out with it, and returned without it; she said it was for her brother John; I told master of it after I left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner had complained of you? A. Yes; I had my mother there once or twice, and a man once or twice a week - they had victuals there. I said nothing about any money - Mr. Hume sent to me - I went and told him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. By whose advice did you admit this man? A. By Callow's; the man who came to see her, brought the one who came to me. I was summoned in January; I told every thing to Mr. Hume then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you told this did you know you had lost your place through her? A. Yes.</p>

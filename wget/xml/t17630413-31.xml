About a month ago I had some people in my house drinking beer, there came two foreigners in my house, after they had been knocked down, that had met with some English sailors in the street, they had quarrelled; there came almost two hundred English sailors, the prisoner was one of them, they stripped my house entirely. The prisoner went into my cellar and drank four pots of porter; after that I saw him go up stairs, and break the lock of one of my chests; the rest of the sailors came to knock me down. I ran down stairs. The things mentioned in the indictment were all taken out of the chest by some body. They let my beer about the cellar.</p>
               <p>- Cole. I found the prisoner in the prosecutor's cellar: he let the beer about the cellar, and was very obstrepulous. I saw nothing of his taking the things out of the chest; I took him prisoner. The other sailors had ran away and left this alone, when they heard the soldiers were coming.</p>

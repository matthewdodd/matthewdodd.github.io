The two prisoners came to lodge with me on Tuesday fortnight—I have but one room; we all three lived in that room—on the Sunday morning following I went out about 9 o'clock—I left Wright at home in the room—I came back about half-past 11; Atkinson opened the door to me—she said there bad been two gentlemen for me; she could not tell me who they were—she told me they wanted me directly—I went, and returned back about 2 o'clock—I went out again between 3 and 4, and returned about 8 in the evening—my door was then locked; I could not find the key—I knocked at the door, and tried it, but I could not make any one hear—I went in search of the prisoners—I found Wright near a public-house—I asked her for the key of my door—she told me it was at Mrs. Bull's room, and I went there and got it—I then went into my room—I did not search, for I had no suspicion—on the Tuesday morning I went to my box and found it was broken open—the hasp was broken off—the box had been kept in my room, and was locked on the Sunday morning—I</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Cooke. On the morning of the 26th of June, I had just gone round the corner; I came home, went in, and shut the door after me. I went into the office, and on my return from the office I saw the prisoner going out with my master's coat on his back, and the hat in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he wearing then himself the coat - A. Yes, and the hat was in a handkerchief; he went out of the house; I pursued him to the end of the Terrrce; he dropped one end of the handkerchief, and the hat fell out, I picked it up; I saw him run into Denmark-court, in the Strand; he went into a woman's passage up the court; the woman turned him out.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him in that woman passage had he your master's coat on or not - A. It was off; he chucked it down that woman's kitchen stairs. I am sure the prisoner is the person that I saw come out of my master's house. This is the hat; I know it is my master's hat</p>

            . I live in Denmark-court, No. 20. On the 26th of June, a man ran into my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140027"></xptr>house; I insisted upon his going out. He had a coat on when he came into my shop; he pulled it off, and kept it in his arm; when I pushed him out of the shop into the passage I heard somebody cry out, have you seen a man go up here; I said, yes; here he is. I could not get him out. He tried to get in the yard, to see if he could go that way. Jones came into my house; the prisoner as soon as he heard a footstep on my door he threw the coat down the kitchen stairs; he ran to the street door; my child got the coat; I threw it in the court. Jones got it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. Did you receive the coat - A. Yes: this is the coat, it is my master's coat; this coat was left in the closet. I had seen it the over night; I looked in the closet and saw it was gone.</p>

             sworn. On the 21st of February as I was sitting at my breakfast, the prisoner went up stairs to my apartment; she came down in a short time afterwards, and went out of the door; I went out and saw her, being brought back with my coat under her arm; I took it from her, and assisted in bringing her back to the premises. I and Farrel, the person that went after her first, were at breakfast below with the landlord, when she came in and went up stairs.</p>

             sworn. Q. You lodge in the house with the last witness. - A. Yes; as we sat at breakfast there is a window that looks on the stairs, I saw the woman go up stairs, I followed her out of the door, and about three doors off I stopped her, and asked her where she had got that coat; it was under her arm, covered with her cloak; she told me it was her husband's coat; when the prosecutor came up he claimed the coat. (The coat produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

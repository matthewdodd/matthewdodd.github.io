               <p>he said the step and the wheel of the cart was injured—I won't be positive that he said both the step and the wheel; he said the wheel—I had not had any other summons for furious driving between the first and second hearings; I was attending on that summons—this was what the prisoner alleged had taken place on the 20th; what really did take place was this: I was coming down Oxford Street on the evening in question, about 5.30 or 5.45, in between that time, I won't be certain—I got as far as the Oxford Music Hall, and the traffic was very great at the time—I was in a line of traffic, a walking—I had just got out of a walk, between three and four miles per hour, when I got to Tottenham Court Road, from the Oxford Music Hall, a closely following a vehicle, a cart, standing on the west-ward side of Tottenham Court Road, driven by a man named Naylor, as I was passing Tottenham Court Road, drove between me and the vehicle I was following of, and forced me into the middle of the road in a slanting direction—we both went into the middle of the road together—there was an omnibus standing still at the corner of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street, by the brewery, with the horses' heads towards the City; it was drawn just to the corner, where they always pull up; in order to pre<lb></lb>vent a collision with vehicles coming in a westerly direction, the reverse way, I touched my horse with the whip on the off side, and being a high spirited animal, she caught the wheel of the cart on the near side, and took it straight on with me towards the City to the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> that was standing still at the corner of Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, and came into col<lb></lb>lision with its hind wheel; not very hard, a slight collision—I then drove on for about thirty or forty yards, I should say—the cart did not draw in front of the omnibus, it stopped there, and I drove on—I looked round and saw that the men had got out of the cart, and I then turned my horse and cab round, and waited until vehicles coming that way, and foot pas<lb></lb>sengers on the pavement said "It's all right, go on, there is nothing hurt," and I went on then—I did not, after the affair took place, whip my horse up, and drive off at the rate of fourteen miles an hour—I did not set to and gallop away—it is not true that when I was coming along, past the corner of Tottenham Court Road, I was coming at the rate of twelve or thirteen miles an hour, nor that I lifted the cart up against the omnibus, and that two men were thrown out—I did not turn it on its side; the men were not thrown out—it is not true that the wheel of the cart was lifted off the ground, it <hi rend="italic">skidded</hi> along at the time, the stones were slippy—the cart was <hi rend="italic">skidded</hi> on to the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>—I don't know the exact distance the cart was dragged, from the middle of Oxford Street to the corner—I should say it would hardly measure more than twenty yards; from the middle of Oxford Street, as you cross from Crown Street to Tottenham Court Road, our horses seemed to go together for that few yards only on to the <hi rend="italic">'bus,</hi> that was what it seemed to me—the horses in the cart, and in the cab, seemed to go over towards the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> together—the cart was Watling's pork pie cart—there were a great number of vehicles about at the time—the summons wag dismissed, and I then applied to Mr. Vaughan for a summons against the defendant, and he granted it that same day—I had not called Naylor as a witness, I did not call anyone—I had no occasion for the constable, there was one.</p>

I went up on the Saturday, and the prisoner told me the summons was put off till Monday—he did not say I was too late—he asked me to come up on the Monday, but I did not go—I went when I was summoned by Crouch; I think on the Friday—I told the police that I was not coming on the Monday—I was not summoned by the police—I went up for Crouch on the Friday because I was summoned—I did not tell the Magistrate that I was there for Crouch, and not for the police—I told him I was there for both—I saw Crouch only about half a minute before he drove against me—the driver of the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> called out tame "Is there not room enough for you?"—I did not reply "Can't you see it is the cabman?"—I said to him "All right, old boy," or "Old <hi rend="italic">pal;</hi> are you hurt?"—I did not mean him, I meant the <hi rend="italic">'bus,</hi> whether the wheel of the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> was hurt; my step knocked against the box-wheel of the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>—I did not jump out directly the collision took place—the boy and I did not jump to our feet directly; I got out, and so did the boy—I got down to see whether the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> wheel was hurt—I did not jump out pretty quick, there was no occasion for that, I got out as I usually do—I could not say whether I sat still a minute or two before I got out, I would not say to half a minute; I sat there some time, I don't know how long—I did not jump to my feet in<lb></lb>stantly to take the number of the cab—I sat in the cart to take it—I took the number of the omnibus, too—I took the numbers for fear I should get into trouble myself—I swear that nothing was said about my summoning the cabman—the prisoner said "If <hi rend="italic">you</hi> don't summons him you ought to he summoned"—I mean nothing was said by me about it—that was why I gave him the card with my name and address—the prisoner said this after the collision—I reported to Mr. Bird, my foreman, next morning—he was not there that night, but it was given to the clerk at the office that night, and reported to Mr. Bird next morning—I did not report that the cabman was to blame; I will tell you what I did say if you wish it—I have drunk with Crouch—I swore at the Police Court that I had never drunk with him—I was in a public-house at Bow Street, with a lady, and he was with his brother—I was drinking with him, and I was not with him, if you can understand—I have drunk with him several times now—at the time I was examined I had not drank with him outside the Police Court—I had drunk with him on the Monday evening, I was in the public-house with him—I was with a lady when he came and asked me to go up—I don't remember drinking with him at Bow Street before I was examined—I understood it was on the Monday night when he came down to Pimlico—I said, when I was examined, that I had never drank with him—I was in a public-house with him—I know Frederick Salmon—he was not present at the time—he came running up across the road from somewhere when I gave the card to the policeman—he has known me for many years by sight—I don't remem<lb></lb>ber his saying to me "Bob, have you got the cabman's number?—I won't swear he did not—I said, but not to him, "Leave that to me, old boy, that is the first thing I always do"—I said it to the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> man—I did not afterwards go over to a public-house at the comer of Arthur Street with Salmon; I went to a public-house—I said something to him, but not, I think, these words, "That b——fellow (meaning the cabman) turning me round on the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> like this"—I said something about being turned on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187109180050"></xptr>
               <p>to the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>—I did not use an abusive term about the cabman; I swear I did not use the word "b——y"—I told Salmon that I was summoned, and if he saw anything of the case I should like him to come down—he came—I did not then say to him "That cabman has been to me, you will be paid, old boy, for what you do"—I did not say that, or anything of the kind, in Crouch's presence at a public-house, or stores, in Bow Street—I did not at any time, in the neighbourhood of Bow Street Police Court, tell Salmon that if he would be a witness he would be well paid for it; he knows too much for me, he is a great deal too clever—I said to Crouch "Here is a witness for you"—I could not say whether Mr. Beard was present—I won't swear he was not—I don't, know that Salmon then told what he could prove—I know that the solicitor for Crouch did not call Salmon afterwards—I was not drunk when I was examined at Bow Street—if Crouch has sworn I was half drunk it is untrue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I was examined before the Magistrate I said I never drank with Crouch—I was then re-examined by the solicitor for the prosecution, and said "I went into a public-house with Crouch on Monday night; I had some refreshment, and he also"—I was in a public-house with a lady, and I did not want it known—there is no pretence whatever for saying that I have been in any shape bribed, or promised pay, for coming here to give evidence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 26, New Peter Street, Westminster—I go about with Naylor, in Mr. Watling's cart—I was with Nayloron the day this affair took place—we were coming down Tottenham Court Road, to go across to High Street, on the left hand side of the lamp post—in the middle of the street there was a line of cabs, coming along Oxford Street, towards the City—we were going across the line of cabs, and the cabman just touched his horse up, and came against us, and our step just caught the off wheel of the omnibus, and then we saw the cabman driving on after this—when he came against us he was driving about eight miles an hour—there were some cabs in front of him, and some behind—he touched our off side wheel—it was not done with great violence; it was just a touch—it did not knock the paint off the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>—our step was bent a little bit—it is not true that I and Naylor were thrown out pf the cart—it is not true that the cabman galloped away as hard as he could, whipping his horse—it is true that he galloped away—it is not true that he drove away at twelve or thirteen miles an hour, whipping his horse; he went about eight miles an hour after he done it—after he had driven away, a policeman (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) came up, from towards High Street, where the bank is, at the corner of High Street and Oxford Street—he asked if me and Naylor were hurt, and we said "No," and then Naylor gave him the cabman's number—I saw the prisoner again, I think, on the next Friday, in Tottenham Court Road, where the Camden Town <hi rend="italic">'busses</hi> are—he told me and Mr. Naylor that he had summoned the cabman for furious driving, and that he had pushed me and Mr. Naylor out of the cart, and he said he would summons us, and he thought we should have to go up to Bow Street on the Saturday—I did not hear Mr. Naylor say anything to him, only that he would not go to Bow Street, and then the policeman said he would summons him—that was all that was said—I saw the prisoner outside the Bow Street Police Court on the Saturday, and he told us we were to be up there on the Monday—we went up on the Monday, and the policeman called me and Mr. Navlor on one side, and said he had sworn that the cabman had pushed me and Mr. Naylor out of the cart, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187109180051"></xptr>
               <p>that he had broken seven spokes, and that we were to swear the same—I am quite sure about that—I did not hear Mr. Naylor say anything to that—about five minutes afterwards we were called up into Bow Street—I was not called—I did not hear anything of the sort sworn; only when I was going to say it they stopped me; just as I was going to say it, they called some other gentleman.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I have been about with Naylor ever since—I have not talked this matter over with him; never—I was not just going to say that we were <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> out of the cart—I was going to tell the Magistrate what the prisoner had told me to say—I remember being examined on the charge of perjury against the prisoner—I did not say a word then about the prisoner having said this to me—I was not examined on the charge of furious driving—I have never said a word about it until to-day—I signed my deposition—it was read over to me—Naylor did not tell me to say it—I have remembered it all this time—our cart was not dragged along 20 or 30 yards up against the omnibus, only just from where the pavement is to where the omnibus was, at the next corner—the omnibus was standing still at the brewery corner, with the horses' heads towards the City—I don't know whether we were dragged at all—we were trying to cross the traffic—the cabman did not whip up the horse—he never whipped it up—I did not see him use the whip—I don't recollect that I said he touched his horse up; I did not say it—he did touch it with the whip, to go straight in the line of the City, the way he was going—he dragged our cart away from the direction it was going, over against the omnibus—I don't know what distance it was dragged, about the length of this Court—I was not jerked on my seat a bit—I felt the collision—I did not jump down directly—Mr. Naylor got out on his own side, where he was sitting, to see whether there was any damage done, directly the collision took place—I think Naylor got out first—I was sitting on the side where the step caught the <hi rend="italic">'bus,</hi> and I could not get out on that side—that was the side nearest the brewery, the near side—I could not get out, owing to the step of the cart having struck against the wheel of the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>—we were right against the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>—Naylor got down on to the ground—I think he got on to the steps of the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi> afterwards, to get the A R on it—that was before the constable came up—the constable could not have seen him on the step of the <hi rend="italic">'bus</hi>—he had got everything done before the constable came up—I noticed the cab till it went on to the next corner, by Meux's Brewery, opposite Arthur Street—he did not pull up at all—I did not notice him—Naylor was not put out or angry about this—I don't know what "excited" is—I did not go into a public-house with Naylor.</p>

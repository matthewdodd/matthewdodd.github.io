            . On Friday evening, the 13th of June, about a quarter before ten o'clock, I was coming through Princes-street, Finsbury-square, with the bag, containing 1l. 14s. 11 1/2d. in halfpence, on my shoulder-it was my father's money-and saw three men; one of them came up to me, and rubbed a handful snuff down my face and into my eyes; it made them smart afterwards, but not directly; another man snatched the bag off my shoulder, and ran away with it. I ran after him, and called out stop thief! - I am certain the prisoner is the man that took my bag from me-it was a moon-light night; he let the bag fall. Thompson and Forbes ran after him with me; I saw Thompson lay hold of him. He was not out of my sight until Thompson laid hold of him. I did not see him afterwards. I picked the bag up.</p>
               <p>THOMAS THOMPSON. I am a constable. On the 13th of June, I and Forbes were in Barbican, and saw the prisoner, with two more, loitering about, we followed them all three into Finsbury-square, they followed the boy across the square, and then crossed over on the opposite side in Princes-street, and got before him and then crossed, and all three rushed upon him at once - They faced him; I was not near enough to see them take anything from him; I heard him call out violently, the prisoner and another ran from him, I heard something fall but do not know who dropped it, I seized the prisoner, a scuffle ensued between us and he made his escape, he got about four yards from me and Forbes seized him; I found a snuff-box upon him. I brought him back to the spot, the boy had gone home, and came back to me quite agitated, the snuff run out of his mouth.</p>
               <p>JOHN FORBES. I was with Thompson, and saw the prisoner in Barbican, I knew him before, I laid hold of him when he got away from Thompson. I am sure he is the man.</p>

            Not more than a minute; he went back to Thompson, I went with him, after he was brought to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your son say he had no knowledge of me - A. Thompson said, is that the man who robbed you, he said he did not know, he was much alarmed, and did not know what he was about when he was at the office, the next morning he picked the prisoner out from twenty more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The boy said I did not rob him.</p>

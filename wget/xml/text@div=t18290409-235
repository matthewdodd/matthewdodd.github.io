            . I live at No. 20, Buckeridge-street, St. Giles'. On the 31st of March I was in a public-house at the corner of Plumtree-street, and saw the prisoner Fox there; I came out of the house between eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090111"></xptr>and ten o'clock - I had been drinking, and cannot state the time I came out; two women followed me - Fox was one; Fox asked me to go home with her; I told her I would not - that I lodged convenient: and when I turned round the corner into the street I lived in, the woman who was with her put her hand into my pocket; I sang out for the watchman - I do not know what she took from my pocket; Fagan the officer came up immediately: I had been drinking for two days together - I was nearly drunk when this happened.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 31st of March I was on duty in Buckeridge-street, St. Giles', I heard a cry of Watch! between ten and eleven o'clock at night, and saw Fox with her arms round the prosecutor's body; she stood behind him, with her arms clasped round his body, holding him behind - Steel was in front of him, rifling his pockets: I did not think him drunk - there was not much difference in him than there is now; I took hold of Fox, while my partner took Steel; I searched Fox, but found nothing on her: when I took hold of her a button dropped from her - I searched Steel, and observed she had something in her month: she denied that she had - I insisted on her opening her mouth, and shewing me what she had; she refused to do so, and I used force; after struggling with her for a quarter of an hour, I succeeded in getting from her mouth a tooth-pick and three halfpence farthing: I secured, and took them to the watch-house - the tooth-pick is here; Wheatley found a duplicate in her hand.</p>

            . I was with Fagan and Wheatley. I picked up a button which laid on the ground, between Steel and Fox; I had seen Steel throw something away, but cannot say whether it was a button; I thought it was money - it sounded like a shilling; she threw it away directly we came up - we found no money, as the crowd collected and the street was muddy; the button was one of a Chelsea pensioner's; I have had it ever since.</p>

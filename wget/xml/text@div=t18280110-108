            . I am a patrol. On Christmas-day, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner near an iron-shop door; I watched, and saw him go away - he returned in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, with a bag - I then went and took him; I asked what he had got - he said nothing but a little old iron, which he wanted to sell - I took these bolts from him.</p>

            . I am a headborough, and live in Cowcross-street. I took the prisoner with the bag; he said it was old iron, and afterwards said he bought it by the road side, and then said it came back by Chenies' waggon, from Hertfordshire: after his examination he said he bought it of Jack Sheppard, for half a crown and three pints of beer.</p>

There were between five and six cwt. of bolts and nuts in his barn - they have been reduced, by being taken away, to about one cwt. When the prisoner was stopped I missed several more; I cannot say when they were taken: the prisoner lodges with his brother, in one of Mr. Morris' houses, about half a mile from Mr. Morris'. I cannot swear when I had seen them.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am a labourer. I sold this iron to the prisoner, for 2s. 6d. and three pints of beer.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. How long is it since you have worked? A. Eight months; I have been kept by the parish, and I belong to a club - I have 3s. 6d. a-week from the parish, for my wife and two children, and 9s. a-week from the club. I found the iron in a ditch at the back of my father's garden, in Solesbridge-lane, laying there loose; I put them into a sack, and sold them to the prisoner, about a yard from where I found them; he brought the sack, and I put them in; I had found them a week before I sold them - I do not know how many there were. I found them one morning; I told nobody of it: the ditch is near a lane. I have known Bull five or six years. I was attending the Grand Jury, as I was subpoenaed, but I was not called - I did not take the subpoena; I said I did not know what it meant, and threw it out. I was at Clerkenwell - I saw Mr. Rance at Chorley-wood - I do not recollect what passed between us.</p>

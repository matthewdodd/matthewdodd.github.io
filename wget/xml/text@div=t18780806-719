                  </hi>. I live at 61, Hartwell Road. Chalk Farm Road—on 2nd July, about 9 p.m., I went into the Lord Nelson, and after persuasion I treated the prisoners—I had in my left trousers pocket a purse containing 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say whether I took it out to pay for the drink, but it was in my pocket when I left at 9.30—the prisoners followed me out, and when I got a little way up the street I found Quinn's hand in my pocket—Riley tripped me up at the same time, and I fell very heavily, and have the scar still—I did not see them again till the following Monday—I am positive they are the women.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Quinn</hi>. I did not leave you in the public-house and go with some men who were playing tricks with cards; it is false.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I felt the purse in my pocket at 9.30—the two prisoners asked me to treat them, but nobody else spoke to me—I cannot swear</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 114 S.) About 10.15 p.m. on 2nd July I received a description of the prisoners and went all round the neighbourhood, but could not find them—I found them on another day in May's Place, and told them I should take them on suspicion of robbing a man of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they said "That is right, old man, we will go to the station with you"—when they got there they said "We have been drinking ever since we had the money"—Tovell identified them from among several more.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Quinn's Defence</hi>. The prosecutor treated me and gave me half-a-crown to go with him. He then said that he had no more money to pay for a room, and wanted the half-crown back. I refused to give it to him. As I went out I fell down the steps, being the worse for drink, and I went home and saw no more of him that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Riley's Defence</hi>. He called us in and gave us rum. I had my sister's baby in my arms. I went home and saw no more of him till a week afterwards.</p>

On the 6th of September, the prisoner came to the shop - I did not know him before - he wanted to toss for ginger-beer: he then came up to where I was selling ginger-beer, and said he wanted change for a half-sovereign - he afterwards said he must have change, and threw the money on the board - I took it up, and considering it to be a gilt sixpence, I refused to take it - my man took it up afterwards. I am not certain that the prisoner is the man - he said it was a half-sovereign; he was taken up outside my door - the watchman was in the house at the time he was turned out - I do not think they took him immediately - I understood they let him go; I did not see him again till he was at Guild-hall - I cannot say when that was; nor whether he is the man.</p>

            . I live with Nicholson. I saw the prisoner come in, and am positive he is the man; during the fair time we had a place in the shop to sell oysters - the prisoner came in, and asked for change; we said he could not have it - he wanted to toss for beer; they would do no such thing; he then said "Here is six of you, I will toss five of you;" he said he would have some beer, and threw down this gilt sixpence; the watchman took him out - I heard no more till I heard he had searched him, and found another bad half-sovereign on him; master said he should not know him - he has a very bad memory.</p>

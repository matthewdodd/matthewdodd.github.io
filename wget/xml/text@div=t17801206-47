On the 31st of October, between five and six in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my house for a gallon of beer; he said it was for Mr. Williams, in Steward's-rents. He said he would pay for the beer and take it with him; he did, and had a quart pot to drink it in. I sent my boy to follow him.</p>

               <p>Between five and six, I met Ibbetson's boy by Lincoln's-Inn-fields, following the prisoner. He said that man had some beer, and his master wanted him to follow him, and see where he carried the pots to. In the fields he threw all the beer out. I followed him to Weston's Park, there I stopped him, and asked him what he was going to do with the pots; he struck me, and a scuffle ensued. A mob gathering about, I took him into the Sun ale-house, and sent for Mr. Ibbetson.</p>
               <p>(The pots were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I live in Weston's Park. I had paid for the beer and was taking it home. I was in liquor; I mentioned a wrong name by mistake. This man came up and knocked me down, and said I was going to steal the pots. He struck me and I struck him again. It is not reasonable I should pay fourteen-pence for beer to throw it into the street. If I had sold the pots I suppose I should not have got so much for them.</p>

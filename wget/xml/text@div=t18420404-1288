                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Callow, and live in Philip-street, Kingsland-road. Judd hired a room of me for herself and her husband—Middleton is Judd's sister, and used to visit her, and sleep there—On the 28th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw Middleton go out—I spoke to her as she passed me—about half-an-hour after, Judd went out—she asked me if I would keep her fire in for her, that she expected her husband home to supper at nine o'clock—when I went up there was scarcely any fire in the grate, and I missed three flat-irons, a bolster, and two sheets from the bed—we afterwards met her hus<lb></lb>band in Islington, at eleven o'clock, not in his way home—we asked him to come home, which he did—I had seen the sheets on the Saturday before—these now produced are them, and have our name on them, which I wrote myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker. I took these sheets in pledge from Middleton, on Monday evening, the 28th of March, a little before nine o'clock—she was alone—I asked if they belonged to a ready-furnished lodging, or whether they were her property—she said she wondered I should ask her such a question, she never had a ready-furnished lodging in her life.</p>

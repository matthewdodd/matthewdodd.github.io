                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi> 230). On the evening of 18th Dec. I was in Skinner Street, Snow Hill—I saw a white bull coming in a direction from Smithfield, down Snow Hill; it went down Skinner Street into Far<lb></lb>ringdon Street; Harper, the drover, was following it; it was trotting; a large crowd was following—they did not do any thing to it, or touch it—therewere no dogs following it—I went after it—when it got into Farringdon Street it tossed a woman; it then turned up Stonecutter Street into Far<lb></lb>ringdon Market, and went into Mr. Child's livery stables—at that time, Wheatley, another constable, came up—the bull turned into the yard of the livery stables, and then to the right through a passage about eighteen feet long and four feet wide, and then into a harness room, which is about sixty feet long—I saw it in the harness room; it was not doing anything there; it was standing perfectly quiet—there were two or three men there in the employ of Mr. Child, I believe—there is a division which runs down the centre of the harness room, upon which they hang the harness, and there was some hanging there then—two of the men, in their shirt sleeves, stood on the top of this division, just over the bull—they had got long poles in their hands, and they were striking it with a view of turning it out—Mr. Child was there likewise; he had a stick in his hand, and he called to the men several times to turn the thing out, and they struck it—Harper, the drover, was there—I told Mr. Child that if he turned it out he would be responsible for any thing that might be done after, as it was then perfectly safe, and that a conveyance would be there in a very few minutes to take it away—he was likewise told the same by the other con<lb></lb>stable—hesaid he did not care a d—for the conveyance or any thing else, he would not have it there—I should say it was about ten minutes in the harness room; I cannot say exactly—they succeeded in driving it out, and, as it was turning out, he struck it three or four times himself; it was then turned out into Stonecutter Street—it ran out through the passage, through the yard, into Stonecutter Street, up Stonecutter Street to Shoe Lane, and there it knocked two or three people down—I saw it knock them down—I told Mr. Child, before he turned it out, that it had injured several persons, and he had better let it remain as it was, until we could take it away—when it had gone out, he laughed very heartily at it, and said it was a fine <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—heseemed to enjoy it very much—after it was gone they shut the outer gates—if they had shut them while the bull was inside, it would have remained there and been perfectly safe—there is a door on the right hand side of the passage, and I thought that door would close across, but I found that I could not succeed in doing that—it is a sliding door, and finding I could not do that, I called upon them to close the outer gate—they said they should do</p>

               <p>nothing of the kind—Mr. Child said so—when I told him that it had injured several persons, he said he did not care, he would not have it in his place.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that the rule with reference to depositions taken before a Magistrate, did not apply to those taken by a Coroner; a Magistrate was compelled, in the discharge of his duty to take the depositions and return them to the Court; but in the case of a Coroner there was no such obligation; the taking depositions in writing on his part was a voluntary act, and was nothing more than a private note or memorandum of his own; he therefore submitted that, as the production of the depositions in that cast would not be the proper mode of proving what had passed, the witness might be asked what he had stated on that occasion.</hi>

               <p>shutting any door in any part of the ride, only the outer gates; if the outer gates had been shut, the bull would have had full access to the dwelling house if the door was open, and to all the various stables round the ride—I went beyond the first stable in the ride; I went up the ride to within about ten feet of the bull, when he was at the top—I then got out of his way—I stayed there till he was driven out—I was on one side of the division and he on the other—I had no possibility of doing any thing beyond looking on—it was when they were in the act of striking him and turning him out that I took refuge in the room, as he was running out; I had not been into the room before that—thereis a room on the left—I can not say whether there is any stabling beyond—I did not see any horses in the stables—there might have been some there—there might have been three or four persons in the ride at the time the bull was turned out—at the time Mr. Child struck the bull it was passing through the alley; he was standing beside me at the entrance to the ride—when he struck the bull, it was going out—I cannot exactly say that it was going out quietly—he could not go out very fast on account of the turnings—he was going out as fast as he could, I am satisfied of that—when he once got into the alley there was no turning; he ran straight out then—I did not see the bull toss any of Mr. Child's men—I am not aware that he did; I have not heard of it—I was at the inquest—I did not hear Aldred examined—I have no idea that Aldred was tossed; I do not know that he was tossed by the bull, and that he went to the hospital; I never heard of it—when the bull was in the alley going out there were three or four men left behind him—whether any of them had been injured I do not know—Mr. Child was quite delighted to get the bull out—he exhibited no sign of fear or anxiety that I saw—I never heard any anxiety expressed with regard to the valuable horses that were in the stable—I think if any thing had been said I must have heard it, but I do not recollect any thing of the kind being said.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you tried to shut the gates, the bull was then in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; that was after I had seen it in the harness room—I went and saw him in the harness room; I then came out into the alley, and endeavoured to close the door, and then I went back again into the harness room—when I first saw the bull in the harness room, he was standing perfectly quiet at the upper end of the ride; when I came back from trying to shut the gates, he was still standing there, and two men were standing on the division, imme<lb></lb>diately over him, striking him—when I speak of trying to shut the gates, I mean the sliding panel that goes across the alley.</p>

I saw the bull run from the corner of Farringdon Street, into Stonecutter Street—I did not see it go into Mr. Child's stable—I went in there, and saw it in the stable, and saw three men beating it over the head with sticks—the prisoner was in the stable</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185802010049"></xptr>
               <p>calling out to the men to turn the b----thing out—I went into the stable, and called to them to desist, not to beat the bull, and told Mr. Child to allow it to remain where it was, and we would send for the conveyance and have it removed from there—he said that he was not going to have the b----thing in his stable—there was a small door at the end of the passage, and I told him I would shut it and keep it in there—he said, "You talk like a b----fool; I am not going to have the b----thing in here"—he then said to the men again,"Turn the d----thing out, I am not going to have it here"—the men had all left off beating the bull when I went in with my comrade; and when Mr. Child said, "Turn the d----thing out," the men laid on to it with the sticks again—it was started then from the end of the stable, where it was standing, and came to where Mr. Child was, and he then hit it himself with the stick, and turned it out—there were several parties present, one was a butcher, who lives at Mr. Comfort's, in Farringdon Street; and he said, "Mr. Child, allow it to remain where it is, and I will secure it for you"—there was another person, named Harding, who has been subpoenaed, and he persuaded Mr. Child to let it remain there, and he would not; and ultimately it was driven out by the three men and Mr. Child; he did not appear in the slightest alarmed—I saw the bull stopped at last, and put into the conveyance; that was by a small dock by the Thames—when I first went into the stable, the bull was standing in one corner very quiet, it seemed quite composed; when the men left of beating it, it stood there and looked round, and never offered to move at all; I went into a stable in the same compartment where it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The bull was never out of the ride in any of the rooms or stables? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see him there—the door I asked Mr. Child to let me shut, is one that I have since examined, and found to be a sliding door to close in a stable, and not that compartment at all—I thought at the time it would have shut the bull in; I could not have done it—I was alarmed at one time, when the bull rushed out of the stable—I was then standing in a narrow passage about four yards wide—I made a spring into Mr. Child's doorway; Mr. Child was behind the door, beating the bull with a stick—at that time three men at the end were beating it with sticks, they drove it from that part to the upper end, where Mr. Child was standing, with a long stick that he took from the drover, and when the bull came up to him, he hit it several times over the head—I was then in the narrow passage trying to keep it in, and when it turned into the passage, where there was only room for him to go by, I made a spring, and it rushed by me; I was trying to drive it back—there were three or four men in the ride at that time, besides Mr. Child—theeffect of driving it back into the ride, would not be to drive it up into the company of those men, it would have been impossible, because the men were elevated higher than the bull was, while they were beating it—there were two of them, I mean to swear that; at the time I tried to drive the bull back, the men were on the frame work—I will swear that two of them were there, and Mr. Child himself was quite secure—I tried to secure the bull two or three times—there were different attempts made to stop him and drive him back—I tried to drive it into the ride three times, not to drive it in three times, but to secure it three times.</p>

I was standing on the pavement near my shop—I saw a mob of persons coming, and then I saw a bullock turn the corner of Stone<lb></lb>cutter Street—I saw it knock a man down in Shoe Lane; it then walked past our shop, and walked up King's Head Court, a narrow court—about half way up he attacked a woman, and felled her to the ground—it then walked through the court into Gough Square; the deceased was coming through the square, turning an angle from a court in Fleet Street, and came right in front of the bull, and the bull tossed him directly against the wall—Iassisted him on to a step, and then followed the bull to the bottom of White<lb></lb>friars Street, where it was secured, and put into a conveyance.</p>

             (police-constable E 38). I fitted these sashes to the house, they fitted the place exactly - I found in the house a carpenter's basket, with some tools in it, and 13lbs. and a half of lead, which belonged to one of the back room window sills - thirteen of the sashes had been taken out, and six of them are quite gone, there were three left in the house - I took the basket to Hatton-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200042"></xptr>garden, and asked the prisoner if it was his - he said "Yes;" and there was a hammer, a pair of pinchers, and a screwdriver in it, which were his property.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there a lease to Mr. Luard's? A. I have never seen the lease - Mr. Luard is in France - but I believe there is a lease - he had received rent for the house for three years - Mr. Murden was the previous tenant, but he delivered up the key to Mr. Hopkinson, Mr. Luard's then agent - it is now in our office - I believe Mr. Murden had a lease, but I never saw it; I never saw Mr. Murden - the house has been unoccupied since we have been the agents - Mr. Murden has been insolvent - the prisoner called on us six months ago, to look at this house, and we showed it him.</p>

I was at work in my shop, near Clare-market, and a man came and employed me to go to this house, which I did about two o'clock; he told me to take the fixtures down, and he would bring a van to take them - I took the four sashes on my shoulder, and the gentleman came and took me - I did run, but it was very foolish of me.</p>

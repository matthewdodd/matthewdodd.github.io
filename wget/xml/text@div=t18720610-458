I keep the Green Man, Little George Street, Westminster—on 6th May, about 10.40 p.m., my sister-in-law served the prisoner with a glass of ale—she gave me a shilling—I said that it was bad, and the prisoner threw down a good shilling—I asked him how many more he had got—it was then bent, and the prisoner broke it in two, and gave me part of it—I asked him where the other piece was; he said he had not got it—he had had a glass or two, but was not the worse for liquor—I gave him in charge, and saw the other half of the shilling taken out of his mouth at the station, bitten in two.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman B</hi> 274). On 6th May I was on duty near Westminster Sessions House, and saw the prisoner stooping down near the National Society's Repository—he seemed to be hiding something—I walked towards him, and he walked away hastily—I followed him, but lost sight of him—I was afterwards called to Mr. Tebbutt's house, and the prisoner was given into my custody—I told him the charge; he said nothing—I received from Mr. Tebbutt this half of a bad shilling, and asked the prisoner for the other half—he said he had not got it—I took him to the stat ion, searched him, and found three good sixpences, a threepenny piece, and these two pieces of a bad shilling, which match the other part, but do not quite make up the whole shilling—I then examined the spot where I had seen the prisoner stooping, and found a bad shilling between two penny pieces, placed by the scraper of the National Society's Repository.</p>

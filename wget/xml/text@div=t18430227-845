               <p>—I was obliged to sell off my property at Paul's-wharf to pay the expenses of this law affair—it now belongs to Mr. Higton—I have the household furniture—the boats are not mine at present—there have been no boats built on the premises since this transaction—there were two boats belonging to me, but I sold them—I sold all my stock—I am now employed by Mr. Higton to superintend the business there at weekly wages—he is a supervisor in the Excise, and is my brother-in-law—it is about two years since that I sold my boats—I do not recollect exactly—it was in the summer of last year—I owed money to various persons, and I thought I had better dispose of my property and pay it—it was money I had borrowed—it was a rascally case against me at the Sheriffs' Court, and I dare say I shall ulti<lb></lb>mately be ruined by the parties I have indicted—I owed money to Higton.</p>

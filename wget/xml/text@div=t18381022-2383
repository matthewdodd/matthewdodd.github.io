                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Mr. Myddleton, my brother is a hatter and glover in Lamb's-conduit-street. On the 11th of Oc<lb></lb>tober, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was in the shop alone—the pri<lb></lb>soner came in, and asked me whether I knew of a situation—I said I would ring the bell—I went towards the bell to ring it, and saw him put his hand on the box on the counter, where the handkerchiefs were, take some of them, and put them into his bosom—my mother came down on my ring ing the bell, and I pointed to the handkerchiefs—she caught hold of the prisoner, and said he had got some handkerchiefs—her hand slipped, and he got from her, but she caught him again on the mat at the door—he dragged her into the street, and I saw her fall in the middle of the road,</p>

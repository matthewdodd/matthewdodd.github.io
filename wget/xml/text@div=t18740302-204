Now, if you will confess, if it is to the amount of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will forgive you, and your secret shall remain with me"—he did not make any confession—after the police had communicated with me, I saw Mr. Biggs, and received from him these invoices, of 23rd August for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 28th October, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 12th November, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 1st October, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and 22nd November, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have looked to see whether any of those sums are entered in the books and they are not.</p>

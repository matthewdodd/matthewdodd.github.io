                  </hi>. I am a merchant and commission agent, and carry on business in Old Broad-street. I had dealings with the prisoner previous to the month of Dec. last—he placed goods in my hands for sale, for which I have accounted—on 17th or 19th Dec. he called upon me, and inquired if my friend Mr. Freese would discount a bill for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at six months' sight, on Messrs. Van Notten—he did not leave the bill then—I saw him again on the same afternoon (19th Dec), I think about 3 o'clock—he called to inquire if Mr. Freese could discount the hill of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Yes, Mr. Freese could do it"—I next saw the prisoner at 25 or 20 minutes to 1 o'clock on Tuesday; I cannot exactly recollect the time; it was a little before I—that was on the 20th—he said he had been to Mr. Freese's office, and made an appointment to be there at half-past 1 o'clock, and asked me to accompany him there, as he wished to buy a bill on France—I accompanied him towards Mr. Freese's office, and we met Mr. Freese by the Mansion House—I told Mr. Freese that the prisoner wished to buy a bill on France—Mr. Freese said, "Come back in a quarter of an hour"—just as Mr. Freese left, the prisoner said, "But I want 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash," and I stopped Mr. Freese, and told him that the prisoner required 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, in order to buy a bank post bill—Mr. Freese then left—the prisoner and myself walked towards Lombard-street, and during the walk he said that Mr. Freese could deduct the cost of the French bill from the balance of the 2,480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—the prisoner and myself then parted—at 2 o'clock I went back to Mr. Freese's office—I saw the prisoner, after we left, turning into Williams and Deacon's, banking house, but did not speak to him then—I saw him again at half past 3—he came accompanied by Mr. Freese and two other parties, one of whom was Forrester, and the other Mr. Clark—Mr. Freese inquired for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said there was no 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there—the prisoner came forward, and stated that he had given instructions for l,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be left at my office, and that when it did come I was to hold it at Mr. Freese's disposal, which I said I would—the prisoner then said to Mr. Freese, "Let us go to my office; perhaps we shall find the money there"—they then left—I saw no more of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>he was introduced to me by Mr. Tidkins, of the firm of Tidkins and Butcher, and recommended as a highly respectable person, and whose letters of recommendation I hold in my hand—they are brokers—I had a first rate introduction with him, as a highly respectable, industrious, and clever man of business, highly esteemed by Messrs. Van Notten—I should have had no hesitation in entering into any mercantile transaction with him—if he had given me his own bill upon a first rate house, of course I should not have objected—I have not had any transactions with the house of Van Notten—I never saw the bill in question; I had nothing to do with it in any way—the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was spoken of, I heard was paid to Messrs. Van Notten in exchange for a warrant—I had several transactions with the prisoner after he was introduced to me, to a considerable extent—they were mercantile transactions, in reference to produce, rice, and that kind of goods—the first transaction we had was, he gave me a consignment of cochineal to New York, upon which I gave him an advance—that was in the month of April—that was not a large operation; it was about 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was cochineal consigned from the port of London to New York—it was not warehoused—he gave me bills of lading—the cochineal was to arrive, and to be sold in New York, and the produce to be accounted for—no bills of exchange passed in that transaction; I gave him money—the transaction about the rice was in Nov. last—I had several parcels—he gave me, at different times, about 8,000 bags of rice, and I gave him an advance upon them, and sold them—that rice had come from Montmeuil and Bengal—no bills of exchange passed then; it was cash—I gave him advances of money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know whether that rice was drawn upon by the consignor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing, except that I gave him money for the rice—they were warrants, not bills of lading; he gave me warrants—they were goods in port—I cannot tell the amount of those transactions; I should think from 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other transactions were not connected with Indian produce—there was a purchase made of raisins from Smyrna, and from indirect imports by way of the continent—that was as much as 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in addition to the other—I was not concerned in the currant speculations at all—on these transactions I always made him advances in money—I do not know whether the consignors had drawn upon him or Van Nottens—the transaction in Nov. was not the last I had with him previous to his applying to me about discounting this bill—the last was about the middle of Dec, as far as I can recollect—there was no transac<lb></lb>tion between the Indian rice, and the application about the bill—I had got one bill discounted for him before; that was in the beginning of Dec.—I do not know Van Notten's house from having transactions with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an exchange, discount, and insurance broker, carrying on business at No. 16, George-street, Mansion House. Previous to 20th Dec. I had a communication from Mr. Ryder, with reference to a bill of exchange, of about this amount, to be discounted for the prisoner—on 20th Dec. I received from my clerk, Mr. Green, a bill for 2,480<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this produced is it—I took that bill to Messrs. Over end, Gurney, and Co.—on my way there I met Mr. Ryder and the prisoner—he then gave me instructions to get 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash—I got the bill discounted at Messrs. Over end, Gurney, and Co.'s—I got a check for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I gave it to my clerk to get cashed on purpose that I might give the 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash to Anderson—my clerk gave him the 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my presence—before that, while my clerk was gone to cash the check, the prisoner and I had a conversation with reference to a bill for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Havre or Paris—it was arranged that I should send the balance of the money to Mr. Ryder—about 3 o'clock the same day I received some information from Messrs. Over end and Gurney with respect to the bill, in consequence of which I went to Mr. Chapman, the managing partner at Overend and Gurney's—he told me that I should find the prisoner at Messrs. Womersley and Burt's offices, in Cle<lb></lb>ment-lane—I went there, and found the prisoner in custody of Forrester, the officer—I demanded of him the 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I had given him—he said that I should most likely find it at No. 76, Old Broad-street, which is the counting house of Mr. Ryder—I merely asked the prisoner for the money that he had received from me—I did not say why I asked for it—I had been instructed by Mr. Chapman to ask for it, and therefore I demanded it—Mr. Chapman had told me it was a forgery when I saw him at his office—I went to Mr. Ryder's—the prisoner went with me and Forrester, and another person with Forrester—I did not find the money there—upon that, the prisoner said that most likely it must be in Billiter-street, which was his counting house—we went to Billiter-street—I went up stairs with the prisoner, Forrester, and the other person, and the prisoner decamped down another staircase, Forrester in pursuit—he went through some counting house, and down another staircase—Forrester followed him—I also followed—the other staircase led into Billiter-street and into Fenchurch-street—I overtook him in two or three minutes—he ran away, and there was a cry of "Stop thief!" and when I came up with him he was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with Forrester—I went with them in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Mansion House, and there he was searched—600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was found upon his person, besides other documents.</p>

Van Notten and Co., by the prisoner—I know Van Notten's very well—the firm consists of Mr. Charles Pole, and Mr. Lambert Pole—I suppose Mr. Charles Pole is the senior partner, he is the eldest brother and I suppose he stands first—I have known them many years—I have had very many transactions with them—very few in the way of dis<lb></lb>counting bills, it has been chiefly depositing money with us at interest, to make use of when they like, to draw it when they please—that was the chief nature of our transactions with them—we are bankers as well as bill brokers—I did not know Anderson—I believe Van Nottens have two places of business—I really do not know where they are—you will think I do not answer straightforward, but I really do not know—I seldom leave our own house; I have reason to think they have one house somewhere about Billiter-street or that direction, and another house in Token-house-yard—we have acted for them in money transactions generally, but banking has been the chief nature of our account with them—their accounts with us have been to a considerable amount—bills were never paid into our house, it was only cash that was lodged with us—we answer their checks—you will understand if you please that I give you the general character of our transactions with the house, that being the prominent feature, but we have had other transactions; we have lent them money occasionally, and we have occasionally discounted bills for them, but the chief feature has been depositing money with us, perhaps occasionally discounting bills for them—we have very rarely indeed discounted foreign bills for them, that has not been a feature of our account together—we have sometimes discounted foreign bills, very likely as high as 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that is not of any import<lb></lb>ance in our commercial transactions—I should doubt very much whether we have taken so large an amount with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you do not know Anderson; can you venture to say that on many occasions you have not discounted bills for them upon which Anderson's name was on the back, as endorser? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware of a single transaction of that kind—I should think it extremely extraordinary if such a thing had taken place—I should say certainly not—the bills we have discounted for them have had their own endorsement—they have been the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270041"></xptr>
               <p>last endorsers; it would be a most unnatural thing if it were not so—I should say we have not discounted a bill for them where Anderson's name has appeared as the previous endorser—I certainly can say that I did not know that Anderson was mixed up in very large mercantile transactions with them, for I never heard of the man's name before I saw these bills, and that is very easily proved—will you allow me to explain? when Mr. Freese brought me this bill, which was the cause of the discovery of the forgery, I would not take it because of its amount without Mr. Freese's assurance—I asked him who this Mr. Anderson was—he assured me, three times over, that Mr. Anderson was a person of the highest respectability, and had been well introduced to him, and upon that I consented to discount the bill; otherwise I am not aware that I ever heard of Mr. Anderson's name before—I have not since this affair occurred looked through the account to see the extent to which we have discounted for Van Notten's—I should doubt very much whether we have a single bill running on discount—I may just say, in answer to your inquiry (and mercantile persons will easily understand what I say), that the transactions of our house are so exceedingly numerous and large, that it would be perfectly impossible for us to look to the previous endorser—if a house of Van Notten's respectability and credit bring us bills I should pass them without looking at the endorsement at all, therefore I tell you candidly. I have not looked at any endorsement preceding Van Notten's—I should not look at the prior endorsement because I should take it on the respectability of Van Notten's—we have discounted Van Notten's acceptances on foreign bills—we have discounted two or three of their acceptances; that has been a very remote and very occasional thing indeed—that has been direct from them—we have also discounted some of their acceptances through bill brokers, foreign bills—I believe there is no Van Notten actually in the business—Mr. Charles Van Notten Pole is the senior partner—he transacts business with us, and his brother also—I am not acquainted with Mr. Hill—I have seen Mr. Lambert Pole to-day—I have not seen Mr. Charles Pole almost since this has taken place—I have not seen him here to-day—I cannot tell you who used to draw the checks—I should presume either of the brothers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever look at the endorsement when you discounted the acceptance of Van Notten and Co, or did you simply act upon their acceptance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Simply upon their acceptance, and I shall be very happy to do so again—I mean to say we should take the bills simply upon the credit of the acceptor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bill broker, carrying on business in Lombard-street Chambers, Clement's-lane, with Mr. Burt. On 17th Dec. last year, the prisoner brought me this bill for 3,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got it discounted at Messrs.

I do not understand what you mean; I will soon satisfy you that that is not the case if you will go on with me to Messrs. Van Notten and Co."—I said it was useless doing so, as they had seen the signature, and denied its being their acceptance—Mr. Freese came in afterwards, and the prisoner, Mr. Freese, and Forrester went away—the 2,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was given to Forrester—it was never discounted I have seen the prisoner write—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the three bills</hi>) I should say the endorsements "W.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270044"></xptr>
               <p>here—I should say, in round numbers, it was rather above 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it may be between 100,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 150,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not so high as 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in one transaction that we had we shared profits with him—that was among the earliest—that was a transaction of dried fruit—we bought and sold, and gave him half the profits; that was in the autumn of 1852—my brother Charles was not the principal partner carrying on these transactions with Anderson—we have two branches of business; they are in adjoining houses, Nos. 2 and 3, Lime-street-square—it was with No. 3 that Anderson had his transactions—our house carries on various kinds of business—we are general merchants, trading in commodities coming from all parts of the world, and drawn upon—Anderson got us a last number of consignments—bills have been drawn without our having any advice through Anderson—being his own goods, he had the direction of the sale; as a matter of courtesy to him, we gave him the power to advise as to the sale—when goods were shipped to our house upon consignments to his account, and they arrived, we spoke to Mr. Anderson as to the price to be taken for the goods on arrival—the bills would be drawn upon our house—bills were not frequently drawn without our knowing anything of the consignments—in most cases, where there were consignments, advices of drafts accompanied every consignment—there were not many cases where it was not so; there might be a case or two.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not he over and over again arrange the whole transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Under our control; we had a commission of sale upon them—the brokers effected the sale, employed by us, through the instrumentality of Anderson—I am not aware that he always named the brokers—they were our brokers as much as his—one of his brokers was a Mr. Leask—a vast number of these transactions were carried on through his broker, Mr. Leask—Mr. Richard Witherby was another of his brokers—Mr. Witherby was one of our brokers—he was his broker as well as ours—he was introduced to the house by Anderson before he commenced his transactions with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a good deal of bill of exchange business between you and Anderson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not understand the question; we negotiated his bills on Change for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When consignments were drawn upon, or foreign bills were drawn, used they to pass into your hands, or continue in his? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They came into our hands for acceptance—we did not occasionally send him to Hamburgh to draw bills—I do not recollect sending him to Antwerp purposely to draw bills—when he went over to Antwerp he had repeatedly to draw on the house against documents of goods that he was shipping for his own account—the last transaction was in March, 1853—he had been over to Antwerp before, and had drawn upon us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you never looked for the goods; he himself came and attended to that, did he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As our Custom-house agent, he would enter the goods—Mr. Major was our Custom-house agent; and he being Mr. Major's principal clerk, the business naturally passed into his hands—we had a banking commission—our acceptances were in the shape of advances—I do not know who discounted those bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who used to accept them; your brother or you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Whoever hap<lb></lb>pened to be in the way—a banking commission is a per-centage upon the amount drawn, a per-centage according to arrangement; sometimes half per cent., sometimes one per cent.; not more—in most cases the bills were to run three months—the half or one per cent, was the commission—we did not charge him a further commission—that was the commission.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, in point of fact, your acceptances were given for his use and accommodation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were acceptances given for goods consigned to us for account to Mr. Anderson.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But he provided the money to pay them when they became due, did not he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the goods when they were sold, the imports for his account, the goods themselves, paid the bills—we had the accounts of sales sent to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And how often used you to balance accounts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, we have not balanced accounts—we have not balanced them yet, not finally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the plan, as I understand you, was this, that when the goods were sold, he would send in an account of the sales; was that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The account of sales would come to us.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They would come from the broker through him, in all probability—the course of business was to send up the account sales to</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The cash concerns were what? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The cash concerns passed under the immediate control of our head clerk; the general manage<lb></lb>ment of the transactions was with ourselves.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not understand what you mean by the "general management;" you told me that he had the general management of the commercial transactions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Under our control—I knew the names and the houses that used to draw upon us—I will swear that I knew the names of all the parties that shipped on his consignment account, because they are many of them our own correspondents, and most of them—there were not many that were not our correspondents; I cannot say how many there were who consigned goods to him, although they drew upon us (<hi rend="italic">looking at some bills handed in by Mr. Huddleston</hi>)—the 1,860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a Paris transaction; it was an advance against goods; dried fruit, I think—the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was a Paris transaction, and the 840<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was a Paris transaction—these bills are accepted by my brother Charles; the other three that were produced just now were accepted by me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the first of your dealings, as far as you know, with Mr. Ander<lb></lb>son on his own account, I believe the course of business was that the invoices of the goods were sent over to him invariably, and not to your house direct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not invariably; it was not the general course of business that the invoices were sent to him, and not to our house; I think the reverse—it was the general practice for him to agree with the consignor—it was not the general practice that the invoices were sent to him instead of direct to our house; I think the general practice was to send the invoices to our house—the invoices were not sent to him in all the transactions in which Mr. Witherby and Mr. Leask were the brokers; I believe the general rule was that the invoices were sent over at the time of apprising the drafts—I cannot say that that general rule was departed from; my own impres<lb></lb>sion is that it was not—I do not think, when you asked me just now, whether it was not the general rule that the invoices should be sent over to him, that I said, "No, the reverse;" I think you are mistaken; I do not recollect making use of that expression—I do not think that the invoices were almost invariably either sent over to, or submitted to him, to put his initials to them—I have no doubt the invoices are here; all the papers are here—I have not stated that we were frequently called upon to accept bills before we got advices of consignments—I will swear I did not say so half an hour ago.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since you have been out, have you been talking to anybody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I have had no conversation about what my evidence was; I have been to relieve nature—I spoke to my own clerk, and desired him to get all the papers and things into the Court immediately—that was Hill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you speak about what you were saying? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, very little in<lb></lb>deed; I said very little indeed—I might have said I should be very glad when it was over—he said nothing to me—he said nothing about the course of business—I was not talking to Hill two minutes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you talk to anybody else? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I just spoke to Mr. Tilleard, my solicitor, just for two minutes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said "to watch" for you; what is he watching? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I can<lb></lb>not tell you—I have not given him instructions of any kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Don't you pay him for coming here? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe most lawyers require payment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not engaged him to come here to attend to your interest? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As a matter of course, he would come here without being instructed to come—of course I engaged him to come here to attend to my interests—I am not the prosecutor in this case—I have instructed him to retain counsel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I was going on to ask you about the ordinary course of business; the goods used to come over; then as to the receiving them, and as to the sale of them, Mr. Anderson conducted all that, did he? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Under our control—I cannot help putting in those words, I must do it—he was to come to us for directions—we certainly reserved to ourselves a discretion and a judgment as to the rates at which he should sell the goods—there was no necessity to exercise it—he laid before us, as the owners of the goods, his views as to the sales, and if we approved of the prices, we gave him authority to sell—when I say before us, I mean before the house—I think it was chiefly before me—I used to give my judgment as to the pur<lb></lb>chase and the propriety of the selling—we did not get anything for that beyond our commission upon the advances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During all the transactions up to, as you say, July, 1852, what share of the profits used you to get, running over all the period you have men<lb></lb>tioned, where you shared profits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Where we shared profits, we gave him one half, and we took one half—we did not get our commission besides, not for advances—he did not supply money as well as us—we were to supply the means—we were to be the persons to supply the means on all occasions in which we dealt—those means were sometimes by the acceptance of bills at three months; not sometimes at six months, certainly not—I know of no transaction where bills of exchange have been, accepted at as long as six months—the purchases during the time when we shared profits were made on our account; it was agreed that he was to have half—I say the purchases were made on our account, because the transaction was entered into by us; partly through him, and with our brokers—our own broken; we had the selection of the brokers—the amount of the transactions upon which we returned him one half the profit would have reached somewhere about 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 33,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was profitable—that closed the joint account—I have not got the joint account—our accounts are made up, and gone into the estate—he got the consignments, and the purchases in a great measure were through his instrumentality, from the foreign houses—we are general merchants—all the correspondence with the foreign houses did not pass with the prisoner; I should say a great portion of it did—it was not a very rare thing for any of the foreign houses with whom he negotiated for the con<lb></lb>signment of goods to write to us; they used to write to us, advising the drafts—we have not yet attempted to prove our accounts at the Bankruptcy Court; they are in the hands of the official assignee—in those transactions in which we were to supply means, I did not represent to the prisoner that we were able to supply to a large amount; certainly not—the prisoner did not supply the money to pay the bills; we paid all the bills; the goods</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270048"></xptr>
               <p>themselves supplied the money—we advanced money on goods lying in the docks, not upon the invoices—we took a valuation of the goods—we judged of the value of the goods ourselves, and, to a certain extent, from his repre<lb></lb>sentations of what they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You never advanced cash, did you? you never advanced him a half, penny in solid cash? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes! a great many thousands of pounds—our transactions were not always through acceptances—we did not give accept<lb></lb>ances over and over again—sometimes the goods were not sold, we paid the acceptances, and he repaid us, he took the goods—we sometimes charged one commission, and sometimes another—we used not to charge as much as six per cent. when we advanced on goods, and gave acceptances—we have charged six per cent, per annum, and commission also—I cannot say whe<lb></lb>ther we have sometimes received as much as 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. commission at a time; I should think not, I cannot answer the question without reference to books.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The prisoner always furnished the money to take up the acceptances, did he not, although you supplied it in the first instance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We supplied it in the first instance—he very rarely supplied it before the acceptance became due—my clerk, Mr. Hill, generally settled with him about what he was to pay—he will be able to tell you all—we first paid him either money, or if they belonged to his foreign correspondents, they drew upon us at three months date, sometimes at thirty days date.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect having a dispute with him a long time ago, when your brother and he were together, about some accommodation bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We never had an accommodation bill—there is a firm of the name of Dewhurst and Co., of Manchester—they are very highly respectable—they are to a certain extent our correspondents—they are still our correspondents—I do recollect that there was some conversation about a Bill of Exchange of theirs—I think it was between Mr. Anderson, my brother, and myself—I have no recollection of coming into the room whilst he was talking to my bro<lb></lb>ther about it; whether I was there first or last I do not know—I cannot say whether it was in May, 1853; it was some time in last year—the con<lb></lb>versation bore reference to a bill drawn upon us which we did not believe was in the market—he asserted that it was in the market; it was a bill drawn by Dewhurst upon us at six months—that did not lead at all to a question about our credit, or about its being a bill that ought not to be in the market, because it was of so long a date—I really think my brother may have been the first person he spoke to about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> One description of article, but a great many separate trans<lb></lb>actions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just so; those transactions originated with both myself and my brother.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Be kind enough to tell us very shortly, what took place with reference to that occurrence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the autumn of 1852, the blight had attacked the dried fruit in the Ionian Islands; Mr. Anderson came to us, and said, "Gentlemen, there is a large business doing in fruit, the market is going up, there is a good deal to be got by it, and there are a great many persons going into the article, and I should recommend your</p>

               <p>turning your attention to the article"—we refused, it being Hot our busi<lb></lb>ness to speculate generally—we declined it for a long time, but he being very urgent in his recommendation, stating that he had been under great obligation to the house, and that he would wish to have an opportunity of returning it; and as in this instance he could give a good deal of informa<lb></lb>tion upon the subject, we were induced to make some purchases in the fruit, he being a man thoroughly conversant with the article; and knowing he had a good deal of knowledge of the article, we availed ourselves of the benefit of his knowledge—he had one half the profits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It was not a separate transaction, it was several transactions in the same article? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; amounting altogether to from 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 33,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., split up into many more than five or six transactions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When were they concluded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Those transac<lb></lb>tions concluded, I think, as far as my memory serves me, somewhere about June or July, perhaps, last year—to my knowledge no bills have been accepted in respect of consignments until we have had the warrants, or the bills of lading, in our possession; I speak for myself only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the course of practice, after you had received the bills of lading and the warrants, and given your acceptances, as to giving up the bills of lading or the warrants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the case of the bills of lading, when there were goods consigned to our house, the bills of lading, as a matter of course, were given to Anderson as the clerk of Major, who was our Custom-house agent, to do that which was necessary with regard to the entering of the goods; in the case of the warrants, when the loan on the warrants was repaid, the warrants of course were handed up—the course of business, when the goods were sold, was for the broker to sell the goods, and when the prompt fell due the money to be received—sometimes the goods were sold and paid for before the maturity of the bills, sometimes afterwards—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>) I received this letter from the prisoner in reference to the three, bills which have been referred to for 861<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 760<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 875<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you give us any idea of the extent to which you have accepted or negotiated bills for Anderson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that I cannot, for I have not been in business for some time, and I cannot give you a correct idea, certainly I would not bind myself to it—I should say it was not very large; in the aggregate it might be considered large, but small in amounts—I think it very likely there may have been as much as 3,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one month—very probably it might be as much as 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one month—I cannot tell you whether Anderson constantly got the advices from abroad from his own consignors—they were his consignors—I cannot say that I recollect an instance of our accepting bills before we got any advice—the consignment was left to his management, under our control—I cannot say we gave him express directions, because as the consignment wan for his account we had the power, as the parties making the advance, of selling the goods if the bills were not paid—the consignments were to us, or we should not have accepted them—I cannot recollect an instance of bills coming for acceptance and our accepting them upon his representation, that the cargo was coming, or that the consignment was made—it was his consignor who sent over the currants and raisins—they were consigned to him—we never had any advice direct from the house—we did not accept upon his representation, but on the security of the bills of lading.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will see about that, and be very careful how you answer; upon your oath, on many occasions before you ever saw a bill of lading, did not you accept the bill that was drawn by the foreign house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say I ever did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But will you swear you did not, over and over again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Let me understand your question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I will repeat it again; on many occasions, did not you, before seeing any bill of lading at all, accept bills that had been drawn by foreign houses on the representations made by Anderson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think we may have done so—he would not then bring us the bill of lading, and take up the bill we had accepted—he gave us security, to enable us to accept the amount of the parties consigning, to be taken up by the bill of lading when it arrived—I will name the kind of security he gave, warrant; that was invariably the case—we never accepted without the security of warrants if the bills of lading were not in our possession—I cannot say that I remember an instance with reference to the currants and raisins, of accepting the bills before the bills of lading came—I would say we may have done it in 1852, possibly—I think we did do it then—it did not go on—during the currant and raisin transactions we did not go on over and over again, accepting bills of exchange before any bills of lading appeared—I will swear it did not—I cannot</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270052"></xptr>
               <p>recollect an instance—whenever we accepted, the plan was that he was to supply the money to meet the bills if the goods were not sold; if they were sold, then the goods met the bills if there was enough to meet them; if there was not enough, he was to pay the amount—I think in one instance in 1852 he brought bills to me which had been sent over by a foreign house, and they opened a credit in his favour—I think the bills of lading did not invariably pass through his hands in every case—I think there were some cases in the current transactions in which they were delivered by a third party to us for his account—in the course of last year he did not render us a very essential service with regard to some bills of Dewhurst and Co.—he mentioned that bills were in the market which we did not expect to be in the market, but I could never trace the circumstance as a fact; I strove to trace it—I think that may have been in May—it was said to be a bill at six months' date—it is the usual East India custom to draw bills at as long a date as that—it was their habit—Dewhurst and Co. of Manchester are manufacturers—we were not sending goods to the East Indies; it was for an East Indian account, one of our correspondents—they were in the habit of drawing bills at that long date—it is a very usual practice that such bills should be circulated in the market—the prisoner stated to me that one was in the market—I was annoyed at hearing it, because it was contrary to the information that we received that it should not be put upon the market—that was the arrangement with Dewhurst himself—we objected to a bill of this long date being put upon the market, because it is the practice of our house not to have long dated bills—I may have said to the prisoner on that occasion, "I have been deceived if that is the case most shamefully"—I cannot say that our conversation on that occasion was particularly long—I expressed my obligation to him, because he had mentioned the circumstance which brought to light that which I should not have known otherwise—I had no conversation with him on that occasion about his other transactions with us, not at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say to him that you had always confided in him, and that he had always acted with fairness towards you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Upon my word, I cannot say that I ever said anything of the kind, but I may have said so; I will not say that I did not—I certainly did not say that he had never deceived me, and that he might rely upon my confirming all his transactions—I did not say anything at ail to that effect—I said he had not deceived me—I said nothing about confiding in him to a very great extent, certainly not—I am perfectly clear that I said nothing of the kind—I trusted to him—I cannot swear that I used any such expression as that I would confirm his transactions—I certainly did not say that many of the transactions he had made abroad I had confirmed, nor that I had taken upon myself to confirm his transactions—I could not have said that I had taken upon myself to confirm his transactions, and had always found them right, because it was only some few transactions that I ever did confirm—those few had run over 1852, I should think, or 1853—the confirmation was not that bills had been drawn before the bills of lading had come, it was on the receipt of the bills of lading—our letters of confirmation were, "On receipt of the documents, such and such bills would be accepted"—we sent letters of confirmation in that way, for specified consignments—upon the occasion you refer to I do not think I stated that I had confirmed everything that I had been required to confirm—I am sure I did not—I stated that I had confided in him—on the occasions when this confirmation has taken place he has come to me prior, and spoken about it, and then I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185402270053"></xptr>
               <p>confirmed it, after the usual and proper consideration of it, acting for ourselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was it you confirmed? I do not understand. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mercantilely speaking, confirming is stating that a credit is open: for that extent, acceptable on receipt of the shipping documents for which the bills are drawn—that is what we term confirming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that to the amount of several thousand pounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think so, taking the whole together—on my oath I cannot say to what extent, but I think about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should certainly say it was not 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time, not on those letters of confirmation; but I cannot pledge myself—I am not quite clear whether he communicated to me that there was this advantageous speculation in currants, or whether my brother was present at the time—it was with me, as the senior partner, that the matter was first discussed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He came to you as a gentleman who had been very friendly and kind to him, did he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not think it was that—I cannot say that he ever said anything about my having been very kind to him in advances, and all that—I certainly took the information be gave me about the bill being in circulation as an instance of friendship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And also the recommendation of the currants and raisins, believing that he was a man of judgment and skill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That I did—in Oct last I recollect meeting him at the Bedford Hotel, and having some dispute with him—the conversation did not end with my saying, "Well, Anderson, I am quite satisfied with you"—I said this, "The explanation that you have come down to give me of the non-payment of a certain sum of money that we had understood was due to us, certainly has satisfied me that there was a mistake"—I had certainly been rather angry at first; that was respecting a consignment of currants—I did not, on that occasion, say, "Well, I will confirm your operations," or words to that effect—the dispute was, that the bills were drawn, and prior to the falling due of the bills we asked the question; in fact, it was an agreed undertaking on our part that we would not accept the consignment if the advance was to be prior to the realizing of the produce for which the bills were drawn, and before the bills came due we sent to inquire what time the prompt fell due, and the time was specified on the 22nd—the 22nd, if I remember right, was on a Saturday—the money was not forthcoming, and we sent the broker to know why the prompt was not paid, why he had not sent the check in—the currants were sold, and the prompt was not paid—it appeared, from the statement of the broker, that the prompt was not due till the following Saturday, 29th, which, as I was anxious to get out of town, I felt extremely hurt about, and I went out of town with that feeling—at the interview, when Anderson explained the matter, I did not say, "Well, Anderson, I am satisfied with you, and I will confirm your transactions"—I said nothing of the kind—what I said was this, "You have explained away what I felt was extremely detrimental to you, or rather injurious to the impression I had of your regularity"—his explanation was a long one, in which he stated that it was entirely his mis<lb></lb>take; that he had made the mistake, the prompt foiling on a Sunday—he thought the prompt falling on a Sunday ought to have been paid on the Saturday prior, whereas it was not due till the following Saturday—that was in Oct.—I think there was one other consignment of currants after that, or there may have been one or two or three, but that I really cannot pledge myself to say—I did not accept the bills for those, that I am aware of.</p>

               <p>or do you, if you accept, put your name, C, first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, always in the name of the firm, P. and C.—the name of the firm is P. and C. Van Notten.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect a transaction which you approved of, if you do not like the word "confirmed," of a cargo of rice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Per<lb></lb>fectly—I accepted the bills before that cargo came—I did not say with regard to that, "I will lend you 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from this house"—I lent him 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was for the account of the house, a No. 2 department; it had nothing to do with Mr. Anderson whatever; it was a cargo belonging to ourselves, in No. 2, which he purchased, apparently; he purchased through our broker, of ourselves—I lent him 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on security to pay to the house the amount of the cargo—I think that was in Oct. last—he saw me about it in the usual way of business, in our own private room—that has been settled long ago—the transaction was paid for by bills drawn by himself on the parties for whom he bought the goods—I took the bills, and re-negotiated them on Change—I advanced him cash to pay when the cargo of rice was to be paid—the feet was this, it was a cargo purchased of the house some time prior to the arrival—the name of the buyer was not on the contract—the contract was, a certain sum to be paid upon arrival, and a certain sum to be paid upon its getting to its destination—I objected to receive the contract in that shape, or the payment in that shape; I insisted upon having the money, as I did not like to trust 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. open; without security, as the contract was worded—I do not know anything about who the consignees were; I surmise it was a Rotterdam house, because all the bills were drawn upon a Rotter<lb></lb>dam house—Anderson drew them, then they were handed over to us, and we negotiated them—we advanced the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon the bills, on the under<lb></lb>standing that the bills were to be delivered—I think he gave me the bills a day or two afterwards; I cannot undertake to say whether it was a week afterwards, it was very shortly afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that a mere friendly loan, or did you receive any interest for the advance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a matter of business, the interest thereon, and com<lb></lb>mission on the advance—the commission might have been a half per cent, or a quarter, and I believe 5 per cent, for interest; I cannot say exactly—I do not think I had any transaction with Anderson afterwards—I was very unwell on the day he was taken into custody—my brother was at the office that day—I do not know that my brother was not so kind to Anderson as myself; I cannot say that that was the case—I do not think I was par<lb></lb>ticularly kind—I cannot say that Anderson frequently came to the office and saw me while I was transacting business—he came when there was any business which he thought we were likely to undertake for him, but that was not very often.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you allow me to ask you, without offence, whether since Ander<lb></lb>son has been taken up, you have drawn a good many checks, which you have afterwards torn up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not—there is certainly no reason for saying that I have drawn checks and torn them up—I should be very sorry to hear that my checks had been stopped at the bankers'—I am sure they have not—I am hot aware that they have—I have not been to business since Anderson has been taken up; I was under the necessity of leaving altogether two days afterwards, from illness, and confined to my bedroom—Hill, my clerk, knows where I was.</p>

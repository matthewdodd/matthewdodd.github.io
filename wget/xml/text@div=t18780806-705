                  </hi>. I live at Stepney—between 9 and 10 p.m. on 13th July I saw the prisoner at Fenchurch Street station—I was having my boots cleaned, and she came up and asked me to pay for hers being cleaned, which I declined—she then asked me to give her a glass of ale, which I did—she asked me to accompany her home—I agreed, and on going with her I felt her pull my watch, which was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I ran after her—I was stopped by a man—I struggled, got away from him, followed her, and gave her in charge</p>

I told them what you had done—I was walking with you a quarter of an hour before I gave you in charge.</p>

I was in George Street, Minories—the prosecutor called me, and he charged the prisoner with stealing his watch—he said, in her presence, that he took her down a court and felt her take it out of his pocket, that he ran after her, and when near the bottom of the court she stopped and spoke to a man and woman—I took her in custody; she was perfectly sober.</p>

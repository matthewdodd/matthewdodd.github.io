               <p>deceased was very irritable, quarrelling with the prisoner all the morning, from 9 o'clock up to about 12.25, when they went up stairs—he appeared in a good temper with her, begging of her to be quiet, and leave him alone—about 12.30 he said he was going up stairs to shave himself, and she said, "You can cut your throat if you like"—my uncle went up stairs first, and she followed him, and I followed her—when she got up stairs she commenced quarrelling again with him; she called him a grey-headed old b—and several other disgusting names—I did not observe that he lost his temper then, only he begged of her to leave him alone—I went down stairs shortly alter—I left the prisoner standing just inside the room door, and the deceased was just outside—the door was wide open—before I got to the bottom of the stairs I heard two reports of a pistol—I ran up stairs again directly, and saw Mrs. Midson lying on her face, apparently dead—she was just inside the room then—I saw a small portion of blood issuing from her—I went into the next room, and saw the prisoner lying on the floor, bleeding—I asked him what was the matter—he said, "I can't help it, she has drove me to it"—I then ran down stairs, and sent for a doctor and a policeman—when my uncle went up stairs to shave himself he was sober—he complained of having the headache in the morning, when he got up—he had been ill the night before.</p>

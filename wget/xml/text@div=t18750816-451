                  </hi>. I am a gas and stove manufacturer at Birmingham—I employed the prisoner some years ago as a clerk in the counting-house; he was then paid by a weekly salary—he afterwards became a traveller for me, and travelled for three or four years in the London district—he was to have a per centage on all the goods that he actually sold, and he was allowed to retain a certain sum, I think 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., until about October twelvemonth—I then thought it would be advisable for him to have a trap, and allowed him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week from that time—it was his duty to get orders and collect the money—he was to remit every Friday night the money he had collected during the week, and he did so I think without exception, keeping back the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if he received a cheque it was his duty to send it on to us—he had no banker of his own that I know of—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are his weekly statements, dated 20th and 24th March, which was the day before Good Friday—there is no entry in these of Soper &amp; Co's cheque for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nor of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his statements of 28th May and 4th June—on the Thursday in the first whole week in July I came to town and saw the prisoner-at his house, I said to him "Mr. Kirby, I am sorry to find there are some defalcations in your accounts"—he said "There are, but it is not very much, I think"—I said "You were down at Birmingham on Monday, and made out a list of the amounts for you to collect for the next two months, I want you to go through that list with me, as I am afraid the amount is very heavy, and point out those you have received"—he said "I can do that"—I had seen him at Birmingham on the Monday; it was his duty to come down every two months to make out the accounts for collection for the following two months; this is the list he gave me, I took it down in writing; he gave it me from a" book before him, and I copied it down at the time—he gives here the number of sums he said he had re<lb></lb>ceived, amounting altogether to 505<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that was the amount of his deficiency—among the list that I took down was Soper &amp; Cooksey, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but there is no mention of the larger sum of 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he did not mention that to me at all; I told him there was a larger amount due—nothing further passed—he asked me not to say anything to his wife about it—I said I did not want to say anything more, but he was to meet me at Lincoln's Inn Fields next morning at 11 o'clock"—he did so—he then told me that he had made a mistake, that there were some other matters, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187508160089"></xptr>
               <p>he had got an amended list—I said "It is in the hands of my solicitors, and I cannot say anything now"—he wanted to know if we could not make some arrangement by which he could continue to travel and have nothing to do with the money—I said I could not think of that—he stayed in the lower office while I went in to Mr. Preston's office—when I came down I called a cab and got in, and he came to the door and said "I have got to come down to your office on Monday—I said "Have you told your wife"—he said "No"—I said "Then if I was you I would go home and cousult her as to the best course to take"—I consulted Mr. Preston, and on the following Tuesday the prisoner was given into custody—he never sent me the amended list—all orders came to me to be executed.</p>

I don't know what card this refers to, I don't think it is this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), I can't remember, I can't tell what was on the card—I had not seen any card with "agent" on it—I know Davis &amp; Co., the printers; we have had an account from them since the prisoner has been in custody and we sent it back and said we knew nothing of it—we gave them an order to print some postage cards for the prisoner reminding people when he would come round—I have seen some of the post-cards—he was not described as our agent on any that we ordered—Mr. Robjohn is my managing man, he acts by my authority—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>:" November 23rd, 1871. Mr. John Davis, printer, 201, Old Kent Road. Sir,—Please get 1,000 cards printed as enclosed and and sent to our traveller as per address on card.") This is not the card—the address is in Kirby's writing—he lived first at 18. Benwell Road, and then at 48—I believe I have never seen any card of this description until before the Magistrate—I was asked about a card before the Magistrate, but not this card—Robjohn is not here—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter dated 6th February, 1874, from Robjohn to the prisoner telling him that he had better get Davis to do the cards for him, but that does not say what was to be on the cards—the prisoner had no authority to draw in advance—he never did so that I know of for three weeks—this letter is my writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated May</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1871, <hi rend="italic">stating that the prisoner had drawn two weeks in advance</hi>).—I did not remember that—he had authority to buy any stove for me if he saw one that he thought would suit me—I was to pay for it—I don't say he never</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I never knew that the word "agent" was on the card till I saw it at his house—his weekly remittances averaged from 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—if in travelling about he saw a stove that was something new in the trade he might buy that for us and that would be deducted—as a rule he would not have occasion to deduct it because it would be charged by the customer of whom he bought it—I don't think he ever retained two weeks in advance except on the one occasion referred to.</p>

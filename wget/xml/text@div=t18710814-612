                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). In the course of last April, I was watching the premises of a man named Roosslar, of 75, Oxford Street, Step<lb></lb>ney, who I afterwards had in custody—on 14th April, I saw a van with three horses drive up to his premises, it had on it the name of "S. P." (and some other letters), "Mumford, Greenwich"—the van was loaded with sacks, apparently of flour—the prisoner was driving it, and there was another man sitting on the tail of the van, with his legs hanging over behind—the van pulled up at the side door, in Russell Street, leading to the bakery—the man behind got down, untied a rope, took one sack off from behind, and took it into the side door—the prisoner took another one and followed him—the other man returned through the same door—the prisoner came through into the shop, and Mrs. Roosslar behind the counter, gave him some money over the counter—he then came out, got on the van, and drove away—the other man walked in a different direction to where the van was going—afterwards, about the 14th or 15th May, I searched Roosslar's premises, in company with another officer, and found three sacks, the pro<lb></lb>perty of Messrs. Mumford—we did not take possession of them—we were then searching for Messrs. Hadley's sacks—on 27th May, I saw the prisoner in the street, at Greenwich, and again on 3rd June—he was not given into custody till some time in July.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe it was on 19th July that he was given into custody—he was admitted to bail on the second examination, and has sur<lb></lb>rendered this morning—I had been watching Roosslar's premises from 4th March, in Messrs. Hadley's case; it was a baker's shop—I watched it up to 15th May, alternately, not every day, according to circumstances, two or three times a week, perhaps every day for a week, and then not for two or three days, up to the date that Roosslar was taken into custody—I am sure about the 14th April being the date I am speaking of, I made a note of the date at the time—I did not book the time, I believe it was some time after dinner; 1 o'clock, or something after; it might be 2 o'clock, I am not certain of the time—I have not heard that the prisoner has got persons to prove where he was in the middle of the day—I am not aware that Mrs. Roosslar is here—I saw her constantly up to the time of her husband being taken into custody, and I saw her here on her husband's trial, on 7th June—since then I have seen her once, I have been to inquire for her—I was not the officer engaged in the case—I did not go on to Roosslar's premises on 14th April, when I saw this—I never went there till 15th May—I and Legg were there on Saturday the 13th; up to that time I had never been on the premised—during the time I was watching, the business of a baker was being carried on there—sacks were delivered, not every day, perhaps once a week, or once a fortnight; some might have been delivered when I was not there—the side door is not the proper door for taking things into the bakery; there is a loft door where they take in a load of flour when it comes—a sack would be taken in at the side door, or the shop-door—the side door is the direct way to the bakery—I saw the prisoner once between 14th April and 27th May, but I did not speak to</p>

               <p>him till he was in custody; in foot, I did not speak to him then—I never asked him for any explanation—I did not take him into custody—I was in the parlour of a beer-shop, at the opposite corner to Roosslar's shop, where I saw this; about 18ft. off, it might have been 20ft. at the very outside—I was inside a room—the traffic was going on as usual, passengers were passing to and fro.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother Charles; we carry on business under the name of S. P. and C. Mumford, Greenwich—we brand our sacks in that way, and our vans and carts are so lettered—the prisoner was in our service as carman, on 14th April, and had been so for some time—I can't say exactly how long—the flour would be wheeled to him on a stage connected with the mill, and he would take it off the stage on his back, and so load his van—he would have a written ticket telling him where to take the flour, and the quantity he was to deliver to each, and he would bring back a counterpart of the ticket signed by the baker as having received such a number of sacks of flour—he would have no authority to dispose of any sacks of ours on his own motion to customers—I had no person named Roosslar, a customer, in the month of April—I never authorized the prisoner to deliver two sacks of flour to Roosslar on 14th April, or at any other time—there is no other miller at Greenwich of my name—in April, accounts had shown a deficiency for some time—the prisoner had no right to have access to our general stock—he could do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am very seldom there myself—I have never seen him have access to the stock—he has been with us twelve months, possibly more—we have five carmen, and five vans go out every day, twice a day when we are busy; that is the ordinary course of business—it would be extra-ordinary for them to go out three times a day—they do not always go out twice—an ordinary load would be twenty-five sacks, sometimes thirty—I do not personally fill up the check-book, it is made in three parts; the counterfoil, which is left in the book, the note for delivery to the customer, and the receipt to be brought back by the carman—some bakers buy twenty or thirty sacks at a time—I have heard of such a thing as a large dealer lending one or two sacks to a smaller dealer; if our man brought back the proper receipt that would not defraud us—it would be very unusual for a baker to get twenty sacks, and lend three to a neigubour—I never heard of such a transaction; sometimes they may exchange a sack in the evening before they set their batches—that would account for a sack of ours being found at a baker's, who was not a customer of ours; such a thing might happen—we should not fill sacks which had another name on them—if the sack of another miller came to us it would be sent to the owner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 31, Seymour Street, Deptford, and am a deliveryman in Messrs.

Cross, of Bethnal Green—after the van was loaded, I was away from the place about a quarter of an hour—the prisoner would then have access to the place where the sacks were, without my knowing it—the prisoner had two vans loaded that day—the second one was loaded while I was at dinner, between 12 and 1 o'clock—Chapman would load it, then—he is here—there was a man named Punt in Messrs. Mumford's service at this time, as carman—there were five carmen—Punt was one, and the prisoner was another.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A man would be about five and a half or six hours going to Bethnal Green Road, and back again—I was at dinner when he loaded the second time that day—I did not see that it was a load for Mr. Page, of Plumstead—I can't say whether he was gone when I came back from dinner—there are no other Mumfords in Greenwich, who are dealers in flour—there are two others at other places—one is P.

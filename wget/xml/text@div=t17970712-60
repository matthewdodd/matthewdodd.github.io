             sworn. - I am servant to Mrs. Sudbury: I was undressing myself to go to bed, and heard a great disturbance up stairs; I went and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120049"></xptr>knocked at Mrs. Sudbury's door, and told her the men up stairs were making a great distrubance, and she gave me the key of the street-door; I went up stairs, and the tall man desired the other to hold the candle while he tied it up, that the bed was his property, he had bought it for a shilling; I came down stairs, and knocked at Mrs. Sudbury's door again, and told her that the man said the bed was his, that he had bought it for a shilling; and she went and called the watchman; when she came in with the watchman, he was in the middle of the passage with the bed in his arms, and the other man with the candle in his hand.</p>
               <p>PATRICK DONOVAN sworn. - Mrs. Sudbury called me, and I went with her, and saw that tall man with the bed in his arms; he said he had bought it for a shilling, and was going to take it away; I said, do you think Mrs. Sudbury would sell that feather-bed for a shilling; she must be a fool; he said she did, and he would have it; I desired her to call another watchman, and we took them to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Timms's defence. We had been drinking together, and we lit of two girls, and this man went up stairs with one of the girls, and I followed them up; and we were to give them a shilling a piece; and the girls wanted more money to lay with us all night than we were willing to give them; and they went again and knocked with their shoe-heels as they went down; he came into my room, and said he would not lay there; I told him not to make such a noise, and he said he bought the bed for a shilling, and he would have it; and he went down stairs with it; there was no candlestick, and I held the candle till I burnt my fingers with it.</p>
               <p>Robertson's defence. Two girls took us to this house; the girls rapped at the window, and they let us in; we agreed for a bed for a shilling, and I gave her the money; the girls wanted more money than two poor men like we could give them, and they went away.</p>

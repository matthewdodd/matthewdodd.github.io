I passed on - she kept by my side, and a few yards further, I saw the prisoner sitting on some rubbish - the woman went up to her and said something, the prisoner instantly sprang from the rubbish, attempted to cross me, and at the same time snatched my watch from my fob. I instantly seized and accused her of it - she positively denied it, struggled, and by some means got down on the pavement. I looked to see that she did not hand it to the other; the watchman came up, and I gave her in charge - she was then on the ground; he insisted on her getting up - she refused - he made her stand up, and the watch was found under her clothes.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I came up, and found the prisoner on the ground, holding her gown rather up - her hand was under her clothes. Gibbs said she had his watch I lifted her up - did not see it fall from her, but picked it off the pavement, exactly on the spot where she had laid; she said it was her husband's, and desired me not to give it him.</p>

I had been drinking with two women; this gentleman came up, spoke to one of them, and turned up a passage with her, stopped there some time, came back, and said he had lost his watch, and they were going to take me - I fell down and resisted, but never had it.</p>

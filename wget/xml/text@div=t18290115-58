Having missed some property, I marked six half-crowns between five and six o'clock on the 21st of December; I put them into the till and went up to my tea, leaving the prisoner and the boy in the shop - I left them about half an hour, and when I returned, I missed one half-crown; I sent for an officer - the prisoner was searched, and the marked half-crown was found on him.</p>
               <p>JAMES STURT. I am an officer. I found in the prisoner's right-hand trousers-pocket, one half-crown, two sixpences, and two penny-pieces - here is the half-crown.</p>

            . This is one I had marked; the other five were left in the till.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Where did the prisoner come from to your master's service? A. I have heard him say that he lived with Mr. Fletcher many years - I have told him not to take money out of the till to repay himself for what he lent me; I did owe him half a crown, but that was a private account - I borrowed it on a Sunday; I have borrowed on several occasions - sometimes for the till, when I was short; I did not tell him what this half-crown was borrowed for - it was to come up to London: I had forgotten to pay him - I sent it after him by Jones, and I believe he refused it at first; I did not inform my master that I borrowed money from him - it is very usual to borrow if we are short of silver; I told him it was for the till.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have I not given money for oil of a morning, and taken it out of the till afterwards? A. Yes, when you have told me of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The half-crown was taken by me, because Mr. Rymer owed it to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Thomas William Willett,—we are linen-drapers, and live in the Commercial-road. On the 18th of May, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to the shop—I saw her move her hand up to her bosom from under her cloak when the young man who served her had turned to the window—when I had done with the customer I was serving, I went and missed this ribbon—the prisoner was then gone—I went one way and my young man another—he found the prisoner—she dropped this ribbon which is mine, and had been in the box which was put before her—I had seen it five minutes before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's employ. I served the prisoner with a yard of holland—she then wanted a ribbon to match one she bad—I set the box on the counter, and at the same time I looked in the window to see if the ribbon she wanted was there—I turned back, and said I had not got it—she then left the shop—Mr. Willett missed the ribbon—we both went after the prisoner—I overtook her, and said Mr. Willett wanted to speak with her, and we suspected her of stealing a piece of ribbon—she said she would go home and come again—I said no, she must come back—ingoing back she dropped this ribbon—she offered me half-a-sovereign to say nothing about it.</p>

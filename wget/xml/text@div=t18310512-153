            . I am a Police-constable. On the morning of the 9th of April, at half-past five o'clock, I was on duty in the East India-road, near North-street turnpike, about a quarter of a mile from Stinkhouse-bridge - I saw the prisoner, who ran away; I had not said any thing to him, but I pursued and took him into custody - I asked him about some tools, as I was looking for a man who had stolen some; he said he had a boat load of deals in the canal which he was going to deliver to a person of the name of Baxter, and he had brought them from a Mr. Bainbridge, near Deptford - I asked him at which end he came into the dock, as there are two entrances; he said Limehouse end, and he got there between eight and nine o'clock at night - (I suppose the Friday night, the night before) - he said it had been lying in the lock the whole of the night; I asked him to show me the boat - he took me to it, and I found in it six twelve feet deals - I asked him what time they had been put into the boat, and he said between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; I said that was impossible, as there had been a great deal of rain the day before - it rained all day, and I do not think it ceased till near ten at night; the top deals in the boat were dry, and the lower ones wet - I afterwards discovered that he was in the employ of Mr. Dixon - I had, for another reason, searched that lock at eleven o'clock the night before, and there was no boat of that description in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you search every boat? A.There was not a boat there - there were two barges; I will swear there was no boat, and I said so before the Magistrate - Baxter was brought to the station-house after the prisoner was there; I did not hear him say to Baxter that he had brought six deal boards from Mr. Bainbridge - Baxter said he expected some that day - the prisoner did say it was on account of a man named Rogers; I tried to find Rogers, and he absconded - the prisoner did not tell me where Rogers and Baxter lived.</p>

            . I keep the lock, at the entrance of Limehouse-cut; I was there on Friday night, the 8th of April, and remained till five or six o'clock on the Saturday morning - no boat, with deals in it, passed that night; I know the prisoner, and am sure he did not pass.</p>

The officer came to me and said he had stopped one of my men under very suspicious circumstances - I looked, and missed some deals - I had bought three hundred twelve feet deals a short time before; I had no mark on them - they stood up on end against the warehouse: I missed some, but I cannot say how many; I looked at the ground, and saw that some deals had been removed - they had been pitched on end on some ground which had been garden ground - the rain had washed up the ground against the deals, and some of them had been removed, because the ground was dry on which seven or eight might have stood, or more or less, I cannot say how many - the officer showed me some deals; I looked at them - one end of them was wet, and I concluded they had stood against the warehouse; I compared one deal in the boat with one against the warehouse, and the dirt corresponded exactly - I have no doubt they are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How is it, if you have no doubt, that you will not swear positively that they are yours? A. I swear to the best of my knowledge; do not let me swear to what I bought in a lump, and never marked - it is a difficult thing for a person conscientiously to swear to such things; Rogers was in my employ at that time - I believe he has absconded; I have employed the officers to search for him - the prisoner had been four years in my employ; I had a good opinion of him up to this time - I had sold some of those deals, but none uncut.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Am I to understand that upon directing your attention to the spot you missed some? A. Yes - the dirt on the boards at home, and that in the boat tallied, and the quality appeared the same - I believe they were mine; the prisoner was my lighterman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met Rogers at a quarter-past five o'clock - he asked me if I could lend him a pair of sculls to row the boat; I said Yes - I took the sculls, went down, and found this boat, with six deals in it; I put the sculls in, and he lent me a hand to row it - when I got to the Stinkhouse-bridge I made it fast, and he got out - he said he was going to four houses near the bridge; I waited a quarter of an hour, but he did not return, and I went to see if he was gone to the four houses - I looked up the road, and saw two Policemen, who had a barrow, with some cooper's tools in it - directly they came to the turnpike-gate they saw three more men, and they asked them why they did not come to their assistance when they heard the rattle spring; they said they heard no rattle - they then said they had better go down the lane and look for another man - I was in the lane, and turned to see if Rogers was gone to look for Baxter, to buy those deals, as he said he was; I passed the Policeman, and then walked on to look for Rogers - the Policeman then came to me, and asked what knowledge I had of that man that was collared in the East India-road; I said None - he said he thought I had, as there were two men in the robbery; I said I had no knowledge whatever of him - he said he thought I must be the man, or why should I be there - I said I had a boat with six deals in it, and I showed it to him; he asked where I brought them from - I said from the lock-gate, and the man who had employed me brought them from Bainbridge's the night before, between nine and ten o'clock, which was what he told me; the prosecutor always gave me leave to earn 1s. if I could, either in the day or night - I had 18s. a week of him.</p>

            . I am a labourer, but I was in the Police-force on the 9th of April. I attended before the Magistrate, on the part of the prosecution, and gave evidence - I have been subpoenaed here to-day. I saw the prisoner in the place which he has described - I did not speak to him the first time, but I took him afterwards, and asked if he had any knowledge of some tools which I heard had been lost; he said he had no knowledge of the tools, he had a boat laden with deals, and if I would go with him he would show them to me - he said they came from Mr. Bainbridge's, over the water, and a master carpenter had employed him, but he did not know his name - he said he was a master carpenter, and lived at Limehousecut, but he could not exactly tell me where; I had but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120085"></xptr>very little knowledge of the prisoner before - I may have seen him; I was not bound over, in consequence of the misunderstanding the Magistrate had of my discourse - he thought me not fluent in speech; my superior officer frowned and winked on me that I could not get on; I took a memorandum of the Magistrate's name, but being discharged I threw it away.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you see the prisoner run that morning? A. No, Sir - he did not run, he kept on a regular pace, quite slow; he kept on the same pace as when I first saw him - he did not keep the road, he turned over the fence to the Eel Pie-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What do you mean by a regular pace? A. He was going about three miles and a half or four miles an hour - I was discharged from the Police, as my superior officer made a report that I was not fluent in speech, to explain myself before the Magistrate, on this very charge.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. DIXON. Q.Had you any customer of the name of Baxter? A. No - I never knew any thing of him; I know Mr. Bainbridge is a repectable merchant.</p>

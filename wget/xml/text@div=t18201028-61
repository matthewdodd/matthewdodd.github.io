            . I was with my brother, and the officers. We had watched the prisoner and two or three others, attempting to pick gentlemens' pockets, from Templebar. This robbery was done while I was looking at the procession, I saw Coney and a number of people round the prisoner down Norfolk-street. I heard the prosecutor say he would swear the prisoner was the man who took his watch. The gang tried to rescue the prisoner.</p>

            . I first saw the prisoner at Templebar with twenty or thirty pick-pockets. I saw him in particular attempt several gentlemens' pockets, and at the corner of Norfolk-street, I saw him and the prosecutor in the midst of about twenty - we could not get near enough to see him take the watch, but the prosecutor collared him, and said he had taken it. I and others rushed in, and got him a few doors down Norfolk-street; the prosecutor said</p>
               <p>"D - n you, you should not have given my watch away if it had not been for these glasses." He told us positively that he was the man who took it, and if we took him before a Magistrate, he would take his oath of it. We were knocked about terribly, and there was a desperate attempt to rescue him - the neighbours brought us out sticks to defend ourselves - we at last got him to the watch-house, and next morning, the prosecutor did not appear at the office. Mr. Birnie granted us two summonses, and a warrant to compel him. He told me he knew he was the man, but would not attend, and no Magistrate should make<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182010280027"></xptr>him, if he did not think proper, and when he did appear, he refused to sign the book.</p>

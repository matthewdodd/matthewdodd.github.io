               <p>- Gimox. The Prisoner came into my House to call for a Pint of Beer; I desired her to go about her Business; she called me a saw Fellow : At last she was so saucy, I turn'd her out. She was not satisfied ; but she came again the second or third Time. As she went out I thought she made a Sort of a Stop, and had got a Pot mine; and I found the Head of the Hammer upon her as she was going out .</p>

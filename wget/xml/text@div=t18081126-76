            . Q. Were you an officer in the excise in November, 1797, stationed at Barestead near Maidstone - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, I remember seeing him on the 6th of November, about ten at night, I stood within the door of my lodgings, I saw a cart go past, and a person in the cart, and this prisoner riding behind upon a horse; I suspected that it was a smugling cart; I went into my stable and took my horse and followed them; I overtook them a little way beyond the Bell at Farnham, about half a quarter of a mile; I asked the prisoner what he had got in the cart; he said it was no concern of mine, or words to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it appear to you that it was in the cart - A. I cannot be certain what was in the cart; they appeared to be hogsheads of some sort; I thought it was tobacco at the time. I went to endeavour to stop the cart; I called out to the man in the cart to stop the cart, but he made no answer: I told him if he did not stop I would fire, and I fired at the horse in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you fired at the horse had you any opportunity<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260047"></xptr>of seeing what was the contents in the cart - A I endeavoured to put my hand into the cart to feel what it was, but was prevented by the prisoner; then I fired at the horse; the man in the cart said to Waddle, now at him; after that expression Waddle then rode up and struck me over the head with a large stick, what they call a bludgeon, such as smugglers use - He struck me over my head, which knocked my hat off, and cut my head open; and he kept after me, attempting to strike me, at some distance; he followed me; the other man was in the cart behind; - I then pulled up my horse, and took out my other pistol, and told him I would shoot; he said will you shoot - I fired at his horse; he then came to me with his stick, and I defended myself with my hanger in the best manner I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You still being a horseback at that time - A. Yes. He then hit my horse over the left ear, the horse fell and I fell with him; then he jumped upon me and secured me - he took my arms, my hanger, and my pistols; on the other man coming up to me, they took my belt that I had got about my body, and pinioned my arms back with the strap, and I laid in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did both of them do it to you - A. Yes; I laid on my back; the man that drove the cart came and looked at me; he took the stick and hit me on the collar; - it was a very bright moonlight night, I could observe Waddle and the other man whispering together in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of all these blows, with respect to your person - A. My head was cut, I think in four different places.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you bleed very freely - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was very much hurt was you - A. Yes, very much hurt; when I observed them whispering together in the road, the other man turned the cart round and went back on the road that they came. Waddle came up and untied my hands, and delivered up to me my pistols and my hanger; I then got up and went to Hearndon's house; it might be about thirty or forty yards; I went into the house and the woman brought me some water; I had my wounds washed, and she tied my head up.</p>
               <p>Q. You were bleeding then - A. Yes; Hearndon and his wife were both there at the time. Waddle said to Hearndon, that he would give half a guinea if he would go and fetch his horse.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did Waddle come along with you to Hearndon's house - A. Yes. Hearndon went after the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you together with Waddle in that house at Hearndon's - A. Upon my word I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Half an hour or more - A. I should think more than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a light at Hearndon's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that Waddle was the person that treated you in the manner as you have described - A. I never had any doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have mentioned Hearndon and his wife being there, do you remember a person of the name of Jones being there - A. While Mr. Hearndon was gone for the horse, I heard a horse come past the door, I holloaed out, I went to the door and I saw it was Mr. Jones; Mr. Jones got off his horse and came into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Mr. Jones before - A. Yes, he was a gentleman farmer at Farnham; - he came in and asked me what was the matter. Waddle told Mr. Jones that I wanted to rob him; then I told Mr. 
               <persName id="t18081126-76-person656">Jones</persName>
             the circumstance that I have been repeating to day; Mr. Jones told Waddle that he ought to be secured; Mr. Jones asked him what his name was, and where he lived; he said his name was Kingsworth, and that he lived at Lenham, or near Lenham, which is not a great way from Farnham; it is about six or seven miles. Mr. Jones was assisting the woman in tying up my head, and Waddle went out of the house, and I saw no more of him that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was his horse found - A. Mr. Hearndon brought my horse instead of his.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Upon the prisoner saying that he lived at Lenham, did Mr. Jones say any thing to Waddle about it - A. Mr. Jones shook his head, and said he did not recollect any such person living in that neighbourhood; then Waddle went out of the house and we never saw him till some time afterwards at Hyde fair.</p>
               <p>Q. You have mentioned Mr. Jones, and Mr. and Mrs. Hearndon - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They attended when you attended afterwards when you preferred the bill of indictment, and they attended afterwards when the trial was expected to come on - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of them - A. They are dead all of them now.</p>
               <p>COURT. When did the last of them die - A. Mr. Jones died, and was buried in April last; Hearndon was buried upon the 15th of May last; and Mrs. Hearndon, October 4th, 1803.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not see Waddle again until you saw him at Hyde fair, when is Hyde fair day - A. I am not positive, I think it was the 10th or 11th of December; the month after I saw Waddle there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt at all that the person you saw at Hyde fair, was the person that treated you in the way you have described, and was the person that was at Hearndon's house - A. I have no doubt at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not apprehend him at that time - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when you had seen Waddle again at Hyde fair - A. I returned home, and acquainted my supervisor of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. You then learned his name and who he was - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You attended afterwards to prefer the bill, and give your evidence before the grand jury - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When was that - A. I cannot exactly say the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards, in consequence of notice that you received, attend to give evidence here at another sessions - A. Yes, then I attended with Mr. Jones, Mr. Hearndon and his wife; the trial did not come on, Waddle did not make his appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Waddle after that time - A. I cannot say, I did not see him after some time, I cannot speak to the day now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you tried to apprehend him without effect - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Const. You have said in your evidence that you fired, you are positive, before they said any thing to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260048"></xptr>Q. You said nothing to them, but shot the horse - A. I cannot say whether the shot touched the horse or not.</p>
               <p>Q. But before any of them said any thing to you, you fired again at the horse - A. No; he struck me over the head and knocked my hat off, and then I fired at the horse; the horse he was upon.</p>
               <p>Q. You were both on horseback - A. Yes; the man was in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before any injury was done to your person, that you fired - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And no other conversation of any sort passed between you untill you got to the house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. The recognizance was estreated in April sessions, 1801.</p>

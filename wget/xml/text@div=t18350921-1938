On Monday evening, the 29th of June, I was called in to see the deceased—I found him outside the Eyre Arms Tavern, St. John's Wood, about seven o'clock—he was then perfectly insensible—he was bruised in the head—there was one bruise over the left eye, and the other about the temple—they were the effect of blows or falls, I cannot say which—I bild him immediately, but without any effect; and then sent him to the Middlesex Hospital, as there was no convenience where he was, for him to be attended to—I was not at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, but saw the head after it was opened, and there was a great qauantity of extravasated blood on the brain, which caused his death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine and spirit merchant, and live in Bedford-row, Walworth-road. I knew the prisoner at an assistant to Mr. Miskin, a surgeon—on the 8th of December he called at my house with this letter, containing this cheque—I was induced upon this to give cash for the cheque—it is all in manuscript—I gave the prisoner the cash, and weft asked him whether Mr. Miskin was likely to be engaged long where the letter stated him to be—he said he was engaged with a lady with her first child, and it was likely to be a protracted case, and that Mr. Miskin would call on me in the morning.</p>

The prisoner was my assistant for seven or eight months—he left me in July last—I did not send him to Mr. Bennett with any letter on the 8th of December—neither this letter nor cheque are my writing—they are the prisoner's writing—I know his hand very well—I never gave him authority to write a cheque on my account—he had left me nearly six months—I never gave him authority to use my name while he was with me.</p>

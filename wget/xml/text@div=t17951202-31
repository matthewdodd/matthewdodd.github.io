               <p>On his cross-examination, he said, it was an old coat, the collar saded; that it had been mended, and new buttons put on it; that it was made for him two years ago, and he knew it by those marks; that he employed the prisoner, and had a good opinion of him; that he had had the great coat in his possession ever since.</p>

               <p>On the 29th of October I was employed by Mr. Harlow to bring a load into the Old Bailey, from his warehouse; the prisoner delivered it to me; it was a glass door, a nest of drawers, and sundry articles; while I was packing up my load I saw him come out of the warehouse with a blue great coat under his arm; on the Tuesday following I heard that Mr. Harlow could not find his great coat, and gave him some information respecting it.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examination, he said, he did not mention it till the Tuesday following, because he did not know what he was going to do with it; and he did not know it was missing till that time.</p>

               <p>I live next door to the prisoner: Between eleven and twelve o'clock, on Tuesday morning, the prisoner asked me to let him have a great coat in my apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that before Mr. Harlow came and asked you if you had seen the prisoner? - A. About a quarter of an hour; I have two rooms; the inner room has a bed in it; he went and put it under the side of the bed, on the floor; he said nothing, but went away immediately.</p>
               <p>On her cross-examination, she said, it was plain enough for any body to see it if they went into the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have been entrusted with many, many pounds, by that gentleman; he never found me deficient in his life.</p>

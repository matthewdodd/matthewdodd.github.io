                  </hi>. I am single, and did live at 76, Rahere Street, Goswell Road, but left a fortnight ago—on 11th February I was lodging with the prisoner's wife; he was not the landlord of the house at that time—I had a sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I was desirous of depositing in the Post Office Savings Bank—I went with the prisoner for that purpose to the savings bank, in High Street, Islington—I deposited the money and received a depositor's book—the prisoner did not act in my behalf in any way on that occasion, he merely accompanied me—on 9th March I had occasion to draw 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked the prisoner if he would withdraw me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as I was not able to go out myself—he said he could not do it without the book, and I gave it him at that date; it was on a Saturday—the prisoner did not bring me the money or return the book—I waited till the following Saturday, the 16th March—I was not able to see him during the week, I was not well enough—in the following week I wrote to him, asking him if he had received the money—I received a letter in reply—I have not got it—ou the Friday I wrote to his wife—I saw her on the Saturday, and received some information from her—I afterwards sent my landlady somewhere with her—she gave me some information when she came back—after that I went to the post-office near St. Paul's Churchyard, and these documents (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were shown to me—I see my name here—it is not my writing—it was not signed by my authority—I see upon this same document some handwriting of the prisoner's—I never gave him or any one else authority I sign for me, or to withdraw the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at any time—the authority I gave him was to withdraw the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 9th March—when I applied at the office I found my money had been paid out.</p>

In the early part of February last I was living at 2, Barford Street, Islington—I never lived with the prisoner—I have been his housekeeper before, but I was passing in my own name—I never dropped my name—I remember his depositing this money for Miss Gale—he paid it in for her as trustee—I believe it was on the 11th—I re<lb></lb>member something being said about his going to Paris afterwards—I believe it was either on the 12th or 13th—I know it was about then, be<lb></lb>cause there were some valentines to be written to Miss Gale's little brothers and sisters by the prisoner—a party came into the room, and she said to the prisoner, "I will write you a valentine while you are in Paris," and then she said, "By the bye, Lyons, how about my money? I shall not be able to get it out if you go to Paris"—he said, "You will not want the money yet, will you?" and she said, "I think you had better give notice and have it drawn before you go; you can get it without me"—towards the latter part of the month I recollect her saying that she wanted the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her confinement, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. she would put away in her own name, and of course he could get it and sign her name, as he had always done—she said he had signed her name for her in the deposit book when she put the money in.</p>

I must have it; I shall require it shortly"—I am certain that was in February—getting towards the latter end, near the 20th—it was not in March—I believe she was confined the last day of March—it was not a fortnight before that that she came and asked if Lyons had got the money—the house we were lodging in belonged to Mr.</p>

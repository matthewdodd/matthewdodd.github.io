            . I am shopman to Mr. Thomas Simmons, a glass-man, who lives in Brownlow-street. On the 31st of March I was coming from the back part of the shop, and saw the prisoner in front of the counter - he took up a parcel; I asked him what he wanted, and he told me a gentleman had sent that parcel from Holborn - I said No, it was one I had put on the counter; his breast looked bulky, and I stepped to the door to look for an officer - I turned round, and saw the prisoner placing these bottles and this chandelier knob on the counter, but I did not see from what part of his person he produced them; the constable came in in about half an hour, and I gave the prisoner into custody - these are the bottles and the knob; they are Mr. Simmons' property - there were some odd drops, as patterns in the parcel which he took up; I had received it a short time before, from an out-door workman - these bottles had been on a shelf above the counter, and the knob on a shelf by the side of the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder. The prisoner carted bricks for me—on the 29th of June, I was at my buildings about ten o'clock in the morning—I told the prisoner to go to the field, and cart 2000 stock bricks—another carman went with him—I waited there three quarters of an hour—the prisoner came in with a lead of bats, which had nothing to do with the order I gave him—the other carman brought in 500 stock bricks—he unloaded to go to fetch the others, as I supposed—I returned about six o'clock in the evening, and while I was standing I observed the prisoner going along the Kingsland-road with a load of bricks—I had previously ascertained that he had only delivered one load of bricks on my premises—a thought struck me that something wrong was going on—I want to the field to ascertain how many bricks he had drawn—the kiln-man was gone, but I found that 2000 bricks had been had out of the field—next day I received information, and found 500 bricks at a house occupied by one of my la<lb></lb>bourers, 500 yards from my buildings—I went to the station-house, and gave the prisoner into custody—the bricks, I found, were part of what were booked to me—the cart was the prisoner's brother's.</p>

On the 27th of June the prisoner came to me for 2000 stock bricks for Mr. Vine—there was another cart had 500, and the prisoner took three 500's, which made the 2000—I saw him take them—the last load was five or six minutes past six o'clock.</p>

On the Monday evening, from six to seven o'clock, the prisoner passed my house with some bricks in a cart—he stopped at Brown's, the fourth door from my house, shot them out, and called to me to bring him a pot of beer—I took it—he said, "You may as well fetch us another"—I said, "What are you going to build?"—he said, "I have got some pigs I don't know what to do with; I have taken part of Brown's premises, and am going to build a sty."</p>

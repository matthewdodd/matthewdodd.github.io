                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Thames-police. On the night of the 8th of July, about half-past eleven o'clock, in conse<lb></lb>quence of information, I went on board the barque John Laird, which was lying in the London Dock—I saw Oxburgh in the Captain's state room—I said, "What are you doing here?"—he said, "I belong to the vessel, and am going to sleep here"—I said, "You are not going to sleep here, for there is no bed; do you know anything of any brandy being stolen from the vessel?"—he said there were two lads on board the vessel when became on board at eight o'clock, with a bottle; that they said it was water, and they had merely stepped on board to look at the ship, being an iron ship; that abont nine o'clock Mr. Somes, one of the Dock constables, came on hoard, and brought one of the lads with him, and a bottle, and asked him if he knew anything of any brandy being stolen from the vessel; he said no, he did not; that Somes said, "You must go with me to the guard-house;" that he went on shore to go with him, and on the way the lad ran away; that he ran after him, and overtook him, but the lad knocked him down and got away; that he then came on board the ship again, and found the cabin had been broken into—he said it must have been broken into, for he saw the mate lock it before he left; I then went✗the hold, and found ten casks of brandy there, three of them had been</p>

               <p>pierced and plugged, and on sounding them some were deficient—I could tell from the hollow sound that they were not full—we presume they are shipped full—I do not know whether they had been full or not—there was a little wet about the spile holes—I searched the forecastle and found a stone bottle full of brandy, it holds about a gallon and a pint—I also found a case bottle with about a quart or more, and a soda-water bottle full of brandy—it looked the same sort of brandy as was in the casks—I saw a tumbler on a cask in the forecastle with brandy and water in it—I said to Oxburgh,"You told me a falsity about sleeping aft, I think you have been sleeping here, for here is a bed which I think must be yours"—I took him to the station-house with the brandv, and set Fraser, a constable, to watch the vessel—about half-past seven next morning he brought the other two prisoners to the station-house, with three bottles containing brandy—I asked Large how he came by the brandy—he said, the steward of the <hi rend="italic">John Laird</hi>, pointing to Oxburgh, gave it to him—I asked him if he knew where Oxburgh got it—he said, "Yes, he got it from a cask in the hold"—I said, "Did you see him get it?"—he said, "Yes, I was with him."—Oxburgh was present—I have since seen the casks gauged—there was six gallons deficient in all, from what was marked on the lids—three gallons from No. 27, two from 28, and ore from 29.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable in the service of the London Dock Company. On the night of the 8th of July I was at the end of the West Quay, near London-bridge, and saw a lad standing against some stone paving, and a stone bottle lying alongside of him, containing about five and a half pints of brandy—I spoke to him, and in consequence of what he said I took him on board the <hi rend="italic">John Laird</hi>—I saw Oxburgh on the deck, and asked him if he had any brandy on board—he said no, he had no brandy on board, neither did he know anything about the brandy or the boy—as I was taking them to the station the lad ran away, and Oxburgh ran after him—the other lad is not here—information was given to Walker, and he went on board.</p>

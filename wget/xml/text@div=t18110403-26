            . On the 1st of March I was in my father's kitchen at work, between four and five in the afternoon, I heard somebody go up stairs, I did not go up immediately, and when I went up I saw the prisoner come down the stairs, she was going out of the street door, she had her gown up and something in it. I asked a person up stairs if any body had been there, they said no, not to them. I followed the prisoner and over-took her in Long Acre, crossing Bow-street, I asked her what she wanted; she said she had not been there; I asked her what she had in her apron, she said some things of her own. I took her apron of one side and saw this counterpane, it is my fathers, it was taken off his bed. I am sure the prisoner is the same person.</p>

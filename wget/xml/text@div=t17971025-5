On the 2d of October I went out in the morning, and left my husband in the house, and another servant, and a boy of the name of Hindes; I returned home about eleven at night, and went up stairs, and missed some of my things. I had seen 12l. of the Bank-notes, a 10l. and a 2l. the night before; they were kept in a club-box, it was the property of the club, but my husband had given security for it, I lost some more money out of a desk in my bed-room, which was not locked; I had seen them the day before; when I came home the prisoner was gone. I saw her again the Saturday after, at Maidenhead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say it would be better for her to confess?</p>
               <p>A. I did; she gave me 13l. 2s. in cash, and a 1l. Bank-note; I do not know whether it was the same note that I lost; she had not received her wages, except about 12s.</p>

I live at 80, Charles Street, Mile End—I have known the two prisoners about twenty-five years—on 26th December, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was indoors taking my tea with my son Thomas and four friends—while we were at tea there was a violent knocking at the door, I went to open it and found Samuel Draper there; he was alone at that time—lie up with, his fist and struck me a violent blow on the forehead, which caused my nose to bleed profusely—he did not say. a word—I went into the kitchen to wash the blood off my face leaving him in the passage—while I was in the kitchen I heard a struggle going on in the passage and I heard my son say "Father, I am stabbed"—I went into the passage and saw Mrs. Draper trying to pull her son out, and I heard her say, "<hi rend="italic">Sam</hi>, come out, you have given him enough of it"—I did nothing, I was in too much pain with my face—I saw my son bleeding from his eye and his chin—he did not say a word to me about it in the prisoner's presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Squarry Street, Bethnal. Green Road—on the afternoon of Boxing-day, about 4 o'clock, I and my husband and a friend went to Mr. Perkins'; he was not at home when we got there and I went to the public-house opposite and saw him there, and he went back with us to his house—he was sober and had been to work—I saw the son, Thomas Perkins, about the same time or two or three minutes after, he was standing aside of his father a little further in the public-house—he did not go back with the father and us, he came a few minutes after—he was sober—I stayed and took tea with them; I made the tea for them and cooked some bloaters—about an hour and a half, or a little more, after we had got there, I heard a knock and then a kick at the door—Mr. Perkins went to the door and when he came back his nose was bleeding from both nostrils—Thomas Perkins then went into the passage and said, "Halloo, what's up"—I did not hear any answer—the two prisoners and Tom were in the passage, and they seemed all together—he was in the middle—I put up my hand over the male prisoner's shoulders and said "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, what is all this bother?" and I <hi rend="italic">re<lb></lb>ceived</hi> a cut or scratch on my hand, just inside the thumb, and it bled very much—I did not hear Thomas Perkins say anything—I pulled him like to ma; my husband was coming out of the back parlour with his coat half on and half off, and I said "Come along, we shall all be murdered," and while I was pulling Thomas Perkins along the door was closed and the prisoners were gone—before they went I heard Mrs. Draper say "Come along now, we have given them enough"—I led Thomas Perkins into the kitchen and bathed his face, his eye-brow was cut across, and his lashes were full of blood—my husband went to see for a policeman but could not find one, and then we all went to the station, and Thomas Perkins then went to the doctor's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I first went to Perkins' house they were not at home, and I went over to the Crown and Sceptre—I found Mr. Perkins there, inside the doorway, and his son inside; Mr. Perkins came back with us and left the son behind, he came in about ten minutes afterwards, with a small bottle and a quartern of gin in it—Thomas Perkins and Samuel Draper were struggling together in the passage, he was not fighting—I have stated "They were haying a fight inside the passage by the stairs"—I think the deceased died on 9th January—I think he went into the hospital on the Sunday week after Boxing-day—I Saw him in the interval at my house, he was not going about, he went to get a warrant; I had not seen him walking about, I had not been in his company—this occurred about 5.30—the deceased went to a party after that the same night; after he went to doctor's; he went with me, my husband, and his father to Mr. Brown's house, in the Burdett Road, about half a mile from his house—there was a party at Mr. Brown's—he returned home about 12.30—there was no party kept, I was bathing his eye while I was there—there was to have been a jovial party at Brown's—we did not get there till very nigh 10 o'clock—there was some beer there—we satin the kitchen talking this affair over—there was some whiskey, but there was none introduced to any of them; I had a glass when I left, with the mother, and then we all returned with the Perkins he walked home with his father.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 68, Victoria Park Road, Hackney—I have also a surgery at 107, Globe Road, Mile End—Thomas Perkins came there between 6 and 8 o'clock on the evening of Boxing-day—I examined him—I found on the right side over the right orbit an in<lb></lb>cised wound bleeding most profusely, and also found on the left side of the lower jaw a similar wound, both wounds measuring 6-8ths of an inch in length—I arrested the hemorrhage from the upper wound, and ordered him to apply cold water dressings to both wounds—he came to my surgery the fol<lb></lb>lowing day—I then prescribed medicine for him—I next saw him three or four days afterwards—I then found that in the wound over the right orbit erysipelas was slowly setting in—I prescribed accordingly, and saw no more of him—I formed an opinion of what the wounds were caused by, but it was not a competent opinion; it was, that it was done with a clasp-knife or pocket-knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a M.R.C.S., and house-surgeon at the London Hospital—Thomas Perkins was admitted there as a patient on Sunday, 3rd January, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon; he was suffering from erysipelas of the face and head—he remained in the hospital till his death, which occurred at 3 o'clock on Wednesday morning, 7th January—I made a <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination—the scalp was very thin, infiltrated with serum from the erysipelas; the brain was wasted, the heart a little larger than normal, but healthy; there was old and recent disease of the lungs, phthysis; it was not tubercular disease, it was consumption; there were cavities; the lifer was somewhat fatty—he died from the erysipelas—there were two wounds, one Over the right eyebrow, and the other over the left side of the lower jaw, both 7-12ths of an inch long—the erysipelas probably set in upon those wounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was a very Unhealthy man—the wasting of the brain was very likely Caused by drink—he had probably drunk a good deal—there are two theories about erysipelas; one, that it arises with wounds, and one without; but with wounds they are more liable to erysipelas—no one can tell from what it may arise.</p>

               <p>EDWARD RAYMENT. I live with my mother, Sarah Rayment, who is a widow, and keeps a public-house - it is in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch - she pays the rent and taxes. On the 23d of July, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, I went up stairs to brush the billiard-table, and in about half an hour the prisoner and three others came in together. I put the brushes away, and took a pair of boots into the next room. I had laid my watch on a table on the left hand side of the room - the prisoner sat himself down by the side of that table. I then went into the next room with the boots, returned in about two minutes, and immediately missed the watch - the prisoner was also absent. I spoke to the others, and sent for two officers - Gleed came, and in about twenty minutes he brought the prisoner back. He came running up stairs into the billiard-room, and said "What is the matter?" I said "You know very well - I have lost my watch, and you are the person who has got it." He denied all knowledge of it several times, and at last one of his companions spoke to him in Hebrew, and then said in English, "You had better give it up, for you will get us all into trouble." I said he had better give it to me, or they would all be obliged to go to the Office. The prisoner came to me in a few minutes and said, if I would not trouble him with the law, he would produce the property. I said all I wanted was my property. He said I should have it, if Gleed would go with him and fetch it - Gleed went and brought it back - he was detained - the watch is gold, and worth 10 l. alone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you not go up to him and say I know it is a joke? A. No - I said at first to the persons in the room, if that they had taken it in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150076"></xptr>a joke I did not allow such liberties - the prisoner was not there then - when I spoke of a joke I thought one of them might have had it in his pocket - I found that the prisoner lived about half-a-mile off.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and searched the three persons in the room. I found nothing about them. I then went down stairs, and met the prisoner coming into the door of the house. I went up stairs with him, and Rayment said, "I think you have got my watch;" he said he had not; I only heard him say that once. The other three talked with him in Hebrew. Rayment then said, "All I want is my property, for I think it might be done in a lark." The prisoner said, "Gleed, if you will go with me I will give you the watch."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about not being prosecuted? A. Not in my hearing - I was on the other side of the room, which is large.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you brought him into the room, had you said something very unpleasant had occurred about a watch? A. Yes; and then he said he knew nothing about it; the prosecutor said he must be the person, for nobody else had left the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at your deposition before the Magistrate - you said there "He still denied any knowledge of it?" A. That in the room; he denied it at first in the street; I did not know that what he said in the street was evidence. I have been an officer twenty-six years. One of the Jews said to him, "You must be the man, for nobody else has left the room." They said they would not be charged with things they were innocent of. He said "Gleed, if you will go home with me into Cox-square, Petticoat-lane, I will give you the watch;" and when I got near the square, he asked me to lend him my pocket handkerchief. He went into his house, and came out with it in a handkerchief, and gave it to me, saying, "This is the watch, Gleed, that I took off the table of Mr. Rayment's house; I thought some gentlemen had been playing at billiards, and had left it on the table; I did not take it with an intention to steal it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. As long as you treated it seriously he was not willing to communicate about it - but directly Rayment said he only wanted the property, he proposed to deliver it up? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Luke's. I accompanied Gleed to the Wellington public-house, in Shoreditch - the prisoner ran up into the billiard-room - Gleed has stated what he said - I only heard him deny all knowledge of it once - I was not with him in the street - he said he took it out of a lark - it is a large room, I was against the door - they were talking together on the other side of the room.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I entered the room the watch lay on the table - the three persons knew I had it, and I was only down stairs - the moment I went up I said "Here is the watch; I did not know who it belonged to - I took it out of a joke" - he told the Magistrate he believed it was a joke - the moment I heard it owned, I said I had got it, and would produce it. I have been to that house for three years.</p>
               <p>EDWARD RAYMENT. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to GLEED. Q. Did not the witness tell the Magistrate he had seen me at the room before? A. He did not, nor that he had known you before.</p>

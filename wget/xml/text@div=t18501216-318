                  </hi>. I am a widow, and am a nurse at the Middlesex Hospital. In June and July, 1849, I was anxious to get a child into the Orphan Working School, and came in communication with the prisoner in that respect—she said, "I have a great number of votes at my command, but I cannot afford to give them gratuitously; if you can assist me in getting a person in whom I am interested, into the Governesses' Benevolent Institution, I can get your child into the Orphan Working School"—I told her I had no money of my own, and no one to whom I could apply except my sister, and she had assisted me so much since my husband's death that I doubted if she could—she had said she wanted a subscription to the Governesses' Institution, and could command 700 votes for the Orphan Working School, and for that she should want three guineas and a half, which were to be applied in purchasing proxies for the Governesses' Institution—when I told her about my sister she said, "You do not know what she might do if you were to try, to benefit the child"—I wrote a letter, gave it her, and she took it to my sister—she called again next morning, said my sister had given her a guinea and a half, and gave me this "I O U" for 300 votes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I believed she had the votes—she said in a fortnight or less my sister was to send her down another</p>

               <p>sovereign, and then she would give me another "I O U" for 200, which would make 500 votes—a short time after that, she called and said she was in great want of a sovereign, would I send her to my sister for it—I said my little girl had then gone to my sister, and would be home about eight or nine—she said she wanted the money, and I borrowed a sovereign and gave it her, because I thought she would give me the Orphan Working School votes in return—I went to the election, expecting to have the 700 votes, but have never got them—I did not see the prisoner there; her name was publicly called in the room several times, and she did not appear.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Box worth-grove, Islington, and am secretary to the Orphan Working School; I know the prisoner. In June, 1849, I was assisting a friend at the election of the New Infant Orphan Asylum, and she came to me and stated she had a great many proxies of the New Infant Orphan Asylum, which she did not require, and asked me to take some of them, and give her the value in proxies of the Orphan Working School at some future time—I told her I did not require them—I afterwards took ten proxies, or 120 votes, and gave her a memorandum—I am not aware that she has influence in the Orphan Working School, further than by canvass<lb></lb>ing as other people do—she afterwards applied to me for half a sovereign, for the Governesses' Institution, and wished me to cancel this memorandum, and sent me a memorandum for six proxies—about Sept. 1849, I met her, and she told me she had collected either eleven or thirteen guineas for the Orphan Working School, which she would come and pay me before the November election—she did not come, and I did not see her again until she was in custody—I have examined our books and find, on 29th Nov. 1848, she paid me four guineas for proxies on that day at the London Tavern—I do not find her name since then.</p>

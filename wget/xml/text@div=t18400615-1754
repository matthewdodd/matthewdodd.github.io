                  </hi>I am a farrier, and live in Upper East Smithfield—I knew Taylor by sight. On the 26th of April, I charged him with stealing some horse-shoes of mine, and he took me to Mr. Whitehead's shop where I saw the prisoner Clibon—I asked if she knew that boy, she said, " No" at first, and afterwards acknowledged she had seen him—I asked if she had bought any shoes of him—she said, " No"—I turned round, saw them, and said, " How can you tell me such a falsity, when here they are, before my eyes? "—I said, " You say you do not know this boy "—she then said, '' I think I have seen him before "—Taylor then said, " How can you tell such a falsity? I have been here not many minutes ago "—she then said, ''I think I have seen you before "—I said to Taylor, " Tell me the truth, how many have you taken away? "—he said he had taken a great many, and that Welsh, a lad I employed, encouraged him to do it—I said to Clibon, " How is it you can buy so many shoes of boys, without making inquiry? "—I said, "Did he name the name of Simmonds? "—she said, " Yes, I think that was the name "—I found about fifty horse-shoes there, and they are stubbed together with new nails—I understand Clibon is ser<lb></lb>vant to Mr. Whitehead.</p>

            . In consequence of suspicion I went to Marlborough-street, I got an officer, and the officer searched him and found a watch upon him. From that we thought he was the person that had got the spoons that we missed in August.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the spoons. - A. He owned to the officer that he took the spoons; we found the spoons at Mr. Harrison's, a pawnbroker. The officer said, have you got the spoons, he replied no; he said you had better own to it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then I cannot hear what he said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. When did the prisoner come into your service. - A. July the 3d.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost it in August. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a girl lived with you at that time. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you suspect her. - A. I never suspected any one; she went away near upon the begining of August.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, journeyman to Mr. Harrison, No. 5, Tottenham Court road. On the 17th of August the prisoner came to our shop, he asked us if we bought old silver; I said we did; I weighed the spoons, and they weighed four ounces; I gave five and six pence an ounce. One pound two I gave for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the spoons that you received from the prisoner. - A. Yes, I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Have you always said that. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said before that a girl bought them. - A. Yes, it was all through the foreman; at the time I bought them he was present.</p>
               <p>Q. The question is, whether you have not said before, that the woman brought them. - A. I said so at Hickes's hall, before the grand jury; never being there before, it was fright and flurry.</p>
               <p>Q. So fright and flurry made you charge another person with pawning it - which is the truth. - A. The prisoner brought it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280053"></xptr>Court. How was the transaction. - A. The prisoner came in our shop and sold the spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body with him. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you before to say that they were brought by a girl, was it upon your oath. - A. Yes. When the officer came to our shop, he said I have come about two spoons that have been stolen; I took him down in our kitchen, I spoke to our foreman, he said I do recollect buying two spoons of a woman; that made me say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it you bought them of. - A. The prisoner at the bar. I cannot say whether there was any body with him or not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called no witnesses to character.</p>

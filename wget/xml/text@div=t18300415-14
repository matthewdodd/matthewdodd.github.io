On Saturday, the 20th, at half-past nine o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my house; I went down to him - I had gone to bed; he said he hoped the money was safe - I had received directions to apprehend him when I could meet him; I told him the money was safe, that I had left it at a friend's house for safety, and if he would go with me, he could receive it - I and he proceeded towards the watch-house; my intention was to look for a Policeman - I saw a man standing, who I thought was a Policeman; I collared the prisoner, and expected that man to assist me - I told the prisoner he had sent me with a forged cheque, and had like to have got me into trouble, therefore I should detain him; he said he would give me a sovereign if I would let him go - I told him I should take no money, I should do my duty; the man did not assist me - a scuffle ensued, and he got away; I pursued, calling Stop him!- I kept him in sight, and a man named

            , 47 or 27, New Bond-street - the letter I found on him was wafered up and directed to Shaw; I gave it to Shaw in his presence - he opened and read it in the prisoner's presence, and returned it to me - he was kept in custody, and about two o'clock in the morning, he came to me at the desk, and asked if I would be kind enough to show him what charge I had got against him; I said I would, and showed it to him - he said that was not right, that his name was not Thomas but Mc-Donald, that he wished to say something to me, as he had told an untruth, and truth went the furthest; I cautioned him not to say any thing to me, but he said he had been lodging at a public-house in King-street, Golden-square, and the person who he had received the cheque from he had seen there two or three times; that he was in company with him at that house the night before the cheque was presented; he described the person, and said that person was in liquor the night before when he was in his company, and that the person told him if he would meet him there next morning he would give him a job; he said he knew him by the name of Thomas, that they met next morning at this house, and this person gave him the cheque, and asked him to go and get cash for it - he said, Yes, he would if it was all right - that he at first said it was all right, and afterwards said it was not right, but that Thomas had told him he would get the money, as it had been done before - he did not say in what respect Thomas had told him it was not right; he said he and Thomas then went out of the public-house together, and proceeded towards the City or Strand - that they were together two hours previous to meeting the porter - that they met a porter in Chandos-street and he went up to the porter and asked him if he would go and get cash for that cheque, but that Thomas kept back at this time; he said he told the porter that he would meet him at a house in Bedford-street, that he went to the house in Bedford-street, to wait for the porter coming back with the money, and that Thomas followed the porter to the City to see if any person came out with him; Thomas saw some person come out with Shaw, and came running to him to the house in Bedford-street, telling him some person had come out as if they thought that it was not right; that he (the prisoner) then ran out of the house, and did not see Thomas again for a day or two, and then he said he met him the next day in Oxford-street, and Thomas wished him to write to Shaw, thinking perhaps he had got the money - he did not write then, but two or three days after Thomas came and beckoned him out of the shop, or as he stood at the door beckoned him from the door, and asked him to go and take a walk with him - that they went away from the shop together towards Holborn, where Thomas and him went into a coffee-shop, and he wrote a letter to Shaw - that he asked Thomas at first to write himself, but he declined on account of having something the matter with his thumb, and then he wrote - that they parted that evening, and Thomas came on the Saturday on which evening he was apprehended, and again beckoned him out of the shop, and they went away that night together from the shop of Mr. Richards, in Oxford-street where he said he lived - that they went on talking together towards Holborn, till they got towards Hoxton, and came together to the corner of Pitfield-street, Hoxton, and Thomas requested him to go to Shaw for the money - he asked Thomas to go himself, but Thomas made some excuse and he went himself; I said, "Why not state when you were brought to the watch-house that such a person was waiting for you, I might have apprehended him then" - he said he was in such a flurry he did not think of it - he said he had seen Thomas at King-street, Golden-square; I went next morning at seven o'clock to King-street, Golden-square, and found a person named Thomas, and took him into custody; the prisoner afterwards saw him, and said immediately that was not the man; I took a person named Grant, in consequence of a description given me by the prisoner - he did not see that person - he is here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This must have been a very long interview between you? A. Yes he was not out of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150019"></xptr>presence all night; I did not think it safe for him to be out of my sight; he was not locked up in the watch-house; he could not get away; I did not tell him it would be better for him to make a statement to me; I put him on his guard; I asked him no questions, except the description of Thomas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state before the Magistrate that you could not tell but he might have said he had seen Thomas a week after? A. Not to my knowledge - my evidence was so long, I will not swear I did not say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you he had been the dupe of a man named Thomas? A. Yes something to that effect - he told me as we came down Pitfield-street that night, that he had heard from Thomas that the cheque was not right after it had been presented.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. But he told you at the watch-house, Thomas had informed him before the cheque was presented that it was right, and then afterwards that it was not? A. He did.</p>

               <p>I was very much surprised at your not returning with the money I sent you for yestraday, and went down the Strand after you, but could see nothing of you; but having got your address I did not quite despair of seeing you again - if you will write me a note, or send the money enclosed, addressed to Mr. Thomas, 2d. post, Brewer-street, Golden-square, to be left till called for, as I have had a terrible row with my employers; I do not like to trouble them with it, as they have made me responsible for the money.

               <p>20th March, 1830.</p>

               <p>I have been three or four times at Hoxton, but could never find such a place as Boot-street. After being so long of answering my letter, you might have left me the money in place of your address. Make up the money into a small parcel, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150020"></xptr>give it to the bearer, but you need not tell him that it is money you give him, as I do not know much of him; you may keep half a sovereign for your trouble - I think that will be sufficient, after giving me so much trouble about it - I would have gone for it myself, but it is so great a distance, and very inconvenient for me to go.

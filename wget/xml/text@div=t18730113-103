I am an omnibus conductor, living at Walworth—on Tuesday, 24th December, about 11. 25 at night I was at the Oxford Circus with my omnibus—the prisoner got into my omnibus there; he sat down, and as I shut the door he said he was going to get out directly, and gave me a florin; the fare was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I put the florin between my teeth and found it was bad—I said to him "This is a bad one, young fellow, it won't do for me"—he held out a handful of silver and said "Well, you may take what you like"—I refused to do that, and said "You must give me one"—I gave him back the one he had originally given me—he gave me another florin, I bit it, and said "Why, here is another bad one"—he said "You have been and changed them, let me get out, I will see into this"—he wanted to get out, but I would not let him till a constable came, and I gave him in charge with the second florin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He had a handful of silver when he got into the omnibus, and he gave me a florin, which turned out to be bad—he then held out a lot of silver, and said "Take what coin you please"—I refused, and then he gave me the other bad florin—when I told him it was bad, he said "You have changed them"—he did not say "I don't believe you"—he had a handful of large money in his hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MARGARET ANN WILSON</hi>. The prisoner is my cousin—on 24th December, about 10. 30 p. m., I met him by appointment at the corner of Euston Road, Hampstead Road—we went into a public-house at the comer of Euston Road—the bar was crowded—he treated me to a glass of port wine, and he partook of a glass of bitter—after that we were going out, and he said to me "I want change of a sovereign"—I said "What for, when you have other silver?"—he said "I have to pay a friend seven shillings that I borrowed of him"—he went back to the bar to try and get change; it was so crowded, he asked two or three times, and could not get it; there were three men at the bar, one a very short fellow, very fair; he offered to oblige him, and he gave him change for the sovereign, he put it in his pocket—he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take home—I then went home, because I felt rather ill; I had been laid up in the hospital, I had an apoplectic fit—he promised to return to me at 12 o'clock, but he did not, and on the following Monday I received a letter from him, stating that he was locked up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was to come to me at 19, Great Earl Street, Upper St. Martin's Lane, where I am residing—it was about 10. 45 or 11. 15 when he left me, at the corner of Goodge Street, Tottenham Court Road—I was not with him more than a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—the change he received was not all in large silver, I think it was four half-crowns and five two-shilling pieces, I am not certain.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I believe you are a watchman; you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040026"></xptr>was stationed at the time at the corner of Great Ormond-street? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. On the morning of the 24th of September, did you hear any noise? - A. I heard a noise below me, at No. 36.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour? - A. Between two and three; it was half past two or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to No. 36, upon hearing this noise? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look down the area? - A. I looked down the area; I observed the shutter wrenched, but the window shutter was then up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call? - A. I called several times, but no answer was given; I called who is below, no reply was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that what did you do? - A. I stood towards the door, and then I sprang the rattle; I saw then a man was coming out of the area; upon my springing the rattle, he was striving to get over the rails, and I immediately tried to strike at him with my staff.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see more than that one man. - A. I saw another, there were two.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you saw two, where did you see the other? - A. In the area, as the first was getting up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them say any thing? - A. They threatened to shoot me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not say they; what did either of them say? - A. They said shoot.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he really appear to you to be speaking to; did that person that said shoot appear to be speaking to the person that was getting out? - A. I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the one who was getting over the rails first, and when you gave him a blow, did he get over the rails? - A. Yes, I tried to give him a stroke, and the stick slipped out of my hand, and he ran down New Ormond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you observe when they were both in the area, whether that one that got out and you pursued to New Ormond-street, was the tall one or the short one? - A. He was the shortest.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar? - A. It was the short man that got out; I cannot particularly swear to the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe at New Ormond-street you lost sight of him? - A. I did, as he turned down New Ormond-street.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose he ran away as fast as he could? - A. Yes, he ran away as fast as he could; I called after him Stop thief to the other watchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. When did you first see the prisoner Richardson? - A. When I saw Richardson he was taken into custody by the other watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. And how long was that after? - A. In a very few minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say very honestly; you cannot say he is the man? - A. I cannot, it was extremely dark.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was it that you saw him in custody. - A. I saw him just by No. 36; he was brought back to the house.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. What are you? - A. I am a bill sticker.</p>
               <p>Q. You happened to be passing on the morning of the 24th of September last between the hours of two and three in the morning; did you observe the watchman at No. 36? - A. I heard him spring his rattle and call out for assistance; being near the opposite house, I ran over to his assistance as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any person besides the watchman? - A. I observed Richardson, the shortest of the two; I heard one person say, shoot him, as to Richarson; I never lost sight of him till he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was he to No. 36, when you first saw him? - A. He was just going from the rails.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any person there besides? - A. I saw the watchman; there was only Jacobs the watchman and him; I heard the expression, Shoot him, shoot him, twice; I cannot say from whom it came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pursue that man? - A. I ran after the watchman; the prisoner was first, the watchman was pursuing him; the prisoner made up towards a door about three or four doors on the right hand side, the watchman ran past him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you him in sight the whole time? - A. The whole time; the prisoner made a sharp turn round, and made towards Lamb's Conduit street again; I followed him into Lamb's Conduit street, and there I saw a watchman running from Red Lion street way towards me; his name is Morris; I called out to Morris to stop that man, that a house was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. You still saw that man? - A. He was never out of my sight; Morris was nearer to the prisoner Richardson than I was, he laid hold of him when I called out to him. Then I went and laid hold of the prisoner likewise, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite sure that the man Morris and you secured, was the man that run from the rails? - A. Yes, I never lost sight of him till I secured him; we took him to the door of the house No. 36 in Lamb's Conduit street where the rumour was that the house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040027"></xptr>was broken open, there I searched the man, and found this knife, some halfpence, and some tobacco.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was Richardson taken from this No. 36? - A. As near as I can guess about forty or fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first came to No. 36 did you see one man or two? - A. I only saw Richardson, he ran from the rails, I never saw the other prisoner till I saw him at the Foundling watch-house, when the watchman was bleeding in a dreadful manner.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard a cry of stop him, whence did that appear to come from? - A. It appeared to come from the area I thought, I cannot say it was from the outside of the area or within, I was then on the other side of the way, within four or five doors opposite.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you find? - A. This iron crow (witness shewing it); it laid in a puddle of water, and this part, (the bent part) was so much out of water in the channel.</p>
               <p>Q. Any appearance of blood upon it, at the time you found it? - A. I did not look at it at the time I took it to the watchhouse. I did not think it a proper thing to carry about.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards find any thing upon it? - A. Not till the next day, when it was brought before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. You left it with Mr. Spriggs? - A. I did. Here is a green bag I afterwards picked up.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you perceive any thing upon the iron crow when you picked it up? - A. I have no recollection that I did in my mind; the next day the magistrate saw some blood on it, and I saw some blood on it; and there is the appearance of blood on it now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver it to? - A. To Mr. Spriggs the watch-house keeper.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that crow delivered into your keeping by the last witness? - A. It was shortly after it was brought in: it was delivered by Morris to me; soon after the prisoner was brought in, I told him to go and make his observations.</p>
               <p>Q. You sent him out to search? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it the next day before the magistrate? - A. No, did not, I gave it to Lee the watchman, at the time he came off duty the next morning; it was in my keeping till I gave it to him; I did not observe any blood on it that night, I did the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it delivered to him in the same state as it was to you? - A. It was; prior to that I gave it to Lee the watchman, to see whether it fitted the marks on the shutters or windows.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you receive that crow from the last witness? - A. I received the crow first from Morris in the morning; when he found it I took it the next morning, Mr. Spriggs gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it fit any of the places that were broken there? - A. I found it exactly fitted, there was one shutter quite wrenched off.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You found it fitted exactly? - A. I put the shutter in the place as it should be, and then shut the other shutter too; it was a square hinge; I clapped the crow to the mark, under the lower part of the hinge, it fitted exactly both places; the frame of the window and the shutters; the crooked part fitted the place where the bolt was; it appeared to me that that was the instrument that went into it.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had fitted it, what did you do with the crow? - A. I took the crow up to the magistrate at Hatton Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take it in the same condition as it was given to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the blood was discovered upon it. - A. No, I took it to the magistrate the same as I had it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart.</p>
               <p>Q. Now all the time that you had it, did you discover any blood on it? - No, I did not observe it then.</p>
               <p>Q. You had it a long time in day light to try it; have you seen many iron crows? - A. I never had seen one before of that sort, most of our country crows are long and straight.</p>
               <p>Court. You say first of all you received the crow from Morris, and then you received it again of Spriggs? - A. I first received it about five o'clock of Morris, he found it then.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you that hat on which you now produce? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that cut through? - A. Yes, here is my shirt which I have got in my pocket, the hat was cut through, and my head was cut.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you called upon to attend this poor man, the watchman, on the morning of the 24th of September; and did you examine his head? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And what did you find to be the state of his head? - A. He had a cut between two and three inches long on the left pericranium bone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be done by a sharp instrument? - A. It might have been a sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that crow, was that a sort of an instrument by which that wound might be inflicted? - A. Most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. What penetration did it make? - A. It cut entirely into the scull, as near as possible through the integumentum of the head; the periosteum, I believe, was not penetrated.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe I need not ask you, whether in wounds of the head, the hat would been a considerable protection? - A. Most assuredly the hat might have saved his life.</p>

My Lord, on the night before this happened, and on the following morning, I had been to Gray's Inn-lane smoaking a pipe and drinking ale; coming up Guildford-street, (it was a very dark night) I heard a cry of Stop Thief; a few minutes a man came running before me as I was leaning against the post; I looked round the other way, I saw a man whom I supposed to be a watchman, I called out watchman, he says halloo; I says there he goes; he says I shall stop you, I am entirely innocent of the charge.</p>

On Sunday, the 2d of March, the prisoner's master (who is my son-in-law) came to see me, and brought the prisoner with him - his master is captain of a ship; we had several times found the till open on Monday mornings. I counted the money in the till, a few minutes before two o'clock, and then left it locked - when I returned from chapel, at night, I found the till open: the prisoner had been left at home - I had left there thirteen sixpences, a shilling, and a quantity of copper. I had put the copper in a row, so that I could tell if it was disturbed - I missed four sixpences and a shilling. I called the prisoner from the kitchen, and asked if he had any money about him; he denied it, but four sixpences were found in his waistcoat pocket, and fivepence in his trousers: we stripped him, but could not find the shilling; he at last said, voluntarily, that he had changed it in Tottenham-court-road, and bought a Times Sunday Paper, which we found on him, and had spent the change in nuts and oranges,</p>

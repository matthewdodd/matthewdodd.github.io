            . I am sister to Mrs. Sowerby, a pawnbroker. On the 13th of May the prisoner brought in this watch - I was in the shop; he pawned it for 1l.</p>
               <p>VICTOR RODRIGUES. I came from the East Indies, in the ship Oriental; the prisoner slept in my bed in a room in Cornwall-street. On the 13th of May I wound up my watch while he was in the room, and then put it into my chest - I went down to dress some victuals about half-past three o'clock, and at five I missed my watch - I had left the prisoner and Antonio in the room; I had put the key of my chest under the pillow of the bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was left in the room, but Antonio stole the watch while I was asleep - he then awoke me up, and said if I would go and pawn it I might have half the money, and he would have the other half.</p>
               <p>JURY to VICTOR RODRIGUES. Q. What was the character of Antonio? A. I believe he had a good character.</p>
               <p>COURT to WILLIAM JUDGE. Q. Did you take the prisoner to Antonio? A. I brought Antonio to the prisoner- he denied it, and the Magistrate discharged Antonio.</p>

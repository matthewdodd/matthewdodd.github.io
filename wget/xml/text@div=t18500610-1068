                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Devereux Hustler, of 40, Regent-street, a corn-dealer. On the Wednesday before the 11th of May I went into the shop, and found the prisoner in a stooping position behind the counter—we keep the till against the window, and the prisoner was about the middle-of the counter, half-way from the window, coming from the till—I caught hold of him, and before he got to the end of the counter my husband came down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I went into the shop, knocked twice, and no one came; a penny dropped out of my hand, and rolled between two sacks of flour; I stooped to get if, and the woman came out and held me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I went out of the shop between one and two o'clock, and this was between two and three; I was up-stairs, and could not hear anything in the shop.</p>

                  </hi>.

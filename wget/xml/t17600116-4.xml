I missed him at nine, and I asked the prisoner, the first person, if he had seen him; he said no, he had not, but I had a suspicion he had the cock; he came three days after, and asked me if I had found him, telling me he had seen a cock, and described him to be just such a one as mine. I ran to see the cock, but it was not mine. I found him in Swallow-Street, at the Fox and Hounds alehouse, in the prisoner's possession; he had him there in a bag.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Brittain. He is a <rs id="t17600116-4-deflabel17" type="occupation">cobler</rs>

               <p>Q. Who had hold of the bag?</p>
               <p>Brittain. The bag was hanging up. As soon as I challenged the cock, the prisoner said it was his property, he had bought him (the cock produced alive.) This is my property, I have lost many before, but never found any again but this.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in your cellar the night you lost him?</p>
               <p>Brittain. No, not as I know of.</p>

               <p>I told Mr. Brittain I would produce the man I bought the cock of, but the constable came in and took me away to the Roundhouse, and then to the prison, and having nobody to follow the man I have not been able to find him; but I have an evidence here who saw me buy the cock in the street, just by my stall.</p>

               <p>J. Ruth. About three months ago; whether it was a game or a dunghill, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a cock was it? describe it as well as you can.</p>
               <p>J. Ruth. It was a big cock, but I can't say that I know it again.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this cock. ( She looks at it.)</p>
               <p>J. Ruth. It was like this cock.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What time did you lose your cock?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost it on the 20th of October, and found it again on the 27th of December.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses to his character, one of whom had known him ten years, another five, and the other a year and an half, who all gave him the character of an honest and industrious man.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this piece of print? - A. Hanging outside of the door, on a round piece of iron, on the left-hand side of the door; the prisoner at the bar, and an elderly woman, were together, the elderly woman stood right fronting the door, and the prisoner stood on the left-hand side; they went away about twenty yards, and they had a little bit of discourse, I do not know what they said, I was not high enough to hear them; they came back again to the same place, and looked at the same print, and the prisoner at the bar unpinned it, and then went away about twenty yards again; they came back again to the same place, and looked at the same print they had unpinned; the elderly woman still kept her place towards the door, for a little while, and the prisoner at the bar snatched it off; they both then went away, looking at it for a little time, and then the elderly woman went a different way; I then run across the way, and told the gentleman that a woman had taken a piece of print from the door; the shopman and the master came out directly, and the shopman ran after the prisoner; I am very certain the prisoner at the bar is the woman that took it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Wilder.) When you were informed of this by the boy, what did you do? - A. I pursued her, and took her with this print; when I came up to her she threw the print down, and dropped on her knees, and begged that I would forgive her. (The property produced, and identified by

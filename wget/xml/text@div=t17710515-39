I ran after him and catched him; we took him to the Poultry Compter. An old woman came and brought my buckles on Tuesday; I gave the buckles to the constable; the old woman ran away.</p>

               <p>James Yard. About five o'clock last Monday the keeper of the Compter told me I was wanted; I spoke to the Dutchman; he charged me with that man, I took him into the Compter, and examined him. He said, as he was going along Fleet street, a man asked him if he had any gin to sell; he had none. He went into the Shepherd and Goat, Fleet ditch, the man called for six-pennyworth of rum and water; they talked of selling bullocks; he had got a bag of counters for money; he said that was the man that ran away with the buckles. I could not find them when I searched him; we went to Alderman Nash; the gentleman who helped him never came, then a woman came in; I could not take her as she gave him the buckles while I was not there (the counter money produced) they were in this man's pocket; he said he would swear that was the man that had them; he said they held him instead of letting him run after him.</p>

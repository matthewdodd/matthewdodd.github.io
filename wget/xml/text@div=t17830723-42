Did he endeavour to hide them? - Not at that time; I came up as far as Woolwich, and I fell asleep, he got out and took a boat to Tooley-street, taking my bundle with him; I took a wherry and pursued him, and saw him him going up Tooley-street, with my bundle in his hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure it was your bundle? - Yes; on the 12th of June, I saw him at Bow fair, on horseback; I seized him, he said, a woman had robbed me; we went before the Justice, and found the shoes he had on belonged to me, and he had my black handkerchief; it was marked; the strap of one of the shoes was almost torn off; I asked him what he had done with the rest of the things, he said, he had sold them.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell him you would overlook what he had done, if he would confess? - The constable would not let me say any thing to him; the prisoner said, he had sold the cloaths for fifteen shillings, and he had got eight shillings left, he offered it me, but I would not take it; he shewed me where he had sold them; we went there and found the things.</p>

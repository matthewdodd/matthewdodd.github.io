On 5th January, about 5.30 in the afternoon, I was crossing Tower Hill—I saw the prisoner run from the doorway of Mr. Pearce's shop, and as he ran he was rolling something up in his arms in front of him—he ran into the middle of the road, and I saw something white attached to it, and this ticket fell in front of him—I pursued him through Queen Street down Rosemary Lane, and then he doubled back—as he was going back he took off his coat—I was tripped up by some one—he threw this coat on the ground—I came up with him in the Minories, where he was stopped—I did not lose sight of him—he was conveyed to the station—I went and searched for the coat, and when I went back the prisoner said "Have you got the coat?"—I said "I have got the one you wore; where is the other one?"—he said "I don't know; you will find it somewhere over the Tower railings."</p>

I was with Osborne—I saw the prisoner running with something in his arms—as he turned the corner of Tower railings this ticket fell down in front of Osborne, and he picked it up—I could not say whether the prisoner threw anything over the railings—it was dark at that corner—I stopped there while Osborne went to the station and got a lamp.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 284, High Street, Wapping, and am gatekeeper at the Great Northern Railway—I saw the prisoner in Rosemary Lane on 5th January—he threw something away just behind a cart—I was about twenty yards off—it looked like a parcel—I was at the entrance to the station—he pulled off his own coat and threw it on the ground—I picked it up and gave it to the police—it was a light parcel that he threw down—there was a great crowd, and the constables were running after him.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. William Pearce, a tailor, at Tower Hill—I have a ticket here which I can identify—it was on a light grey coat which was over the bar in front of the window—I saw the coat safe five minutes before I missed it, about 5.30 on 5th January—it was worth about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have not seen it since.</p>

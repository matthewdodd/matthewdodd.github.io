                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live in Lower Grove-street, St. George's-in-the-East—I am a Scotchman. On the evening of the 31st of January I fell in with the prisoner in Pentonville—I wanted a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and the prisoner came up and asked me if I would allow her to go in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—we both got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I was not sober, but knew pretty well what I was about—I thought I had about six or seven sovereigns—I am sure I had four at least and some silver and copper—it was all in one of my breeches pockets, and I had a pair of spectacles in the same pocket—I told the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> to drive to White chapel church—before I got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> I missed my money, and said to the prisoner, "You had better give me my money"—she said she had not taken it—I called an officer, and gave charge of her—she still denied it—she was taken to the station-house and searched, and there I saw my spectacles—I had not missed them be<lb></lb>fore—there were four sovereigns and some odd money found on her—these are my spectacles—every thing I had in that pocket was taken—I feel confident there was more money than what was found on her in my pocket.</p>

The prosecutor took my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prisoner got in voluntarily, she did not resist—I drove then, and they stopped at a public-house—he called for a pot of half and half—when that was drank the prisoner wanted another—the prosecutor was going to pay for it, and missed his money—he said, "Call as officer," and I drove on to the station-house.</p>

I was called on in Aldgate High-street, and the prosecutor gave the prisoner into custody for robbing him of seven sovereigns and upwards—he had sense enough to know what he was about—the prisoner said she had not got any money about her at all; and she said at the station-house that she had not a farthing about her—I found two sixpences, one penny, and two farthings in her pocket, and these spectacles were in her bosom—my brother-officer found four sovereigns inside her stockings in my presence.</p>

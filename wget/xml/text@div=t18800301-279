I am Chief Clerk at the Thames Police-court—on 24th January I was present at the hearing of a summons against a man named Dodsworth at the instance of the defendant—I saw the defendant sworn, and took down his evidence.

               <p>the night of 10th January I was conductor of the last car from Aldgate to Stratford—when the car got near to Stepney Green I saw the defendant inside the car strike a match and light a cigarette, and throw the match down on the straw—I complained to him lor smoking in the car, and told him he must either go outside on the top or out of the oar to smoke—he said "I am coining out"—the straw caught fire from the match, and he stamped it out—I went on to the top of the ear to collect my fares, and when I came down the defendant was standing on the foot board smoking—he said "Who is this long b—here/' speaking of the timekeeper Yarrow—I told him he was the timekeeper—Yarrow referred him to me, and I told him he must leave the car or go on the top, as it was against the rules to smoke there—he said he would get off—I went on the top again, and when I came down I found him running alongside of the oar and striking the timekeeper with a stick, and he had hold of his coat trying to pull him off—I went to try and push him away, and he struck me with the stick—I then jumped off the car and held him to detain him while the car proceeded about 20 yards—I then let him go, and ran and got on my car—he ran too, and when he got abreast of the hind window or the second window he punched it in with his fist—I then stopped the oar, and went round to my driver and gave him my money bag and the alarm punch—as I was getting off the step the defendant struck me in the mouth with his fist and out my mouth—I tried to hold him by the hand, and he seized me by the throat and struck me with his stick—two constables came up at the time—he was in the act of striking me when they came, and they pulled him away—it is not true that when he came on the platform of the car I snatched his stick from him and cut him down the hat with it, or that while he was inside the car he was pushed, and that his hand went through the window by accident—I did not see Yarrow seise him by the throat and try to push him off the car, or kick him in the chest—it is not true thai he ran from Stepney Green to Whitehorse Lane calling for the police—after he struck me in the mouth he went back against the ladder of the car, and his hat came in contact with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Stratford Green, and am a time—keeper in the employment of the North Metropolitan Tramways Company—on the night of 10th January I was on the car at the last journey from Aldgate to Stratford—when we got near Stepney Green I saw Mr. Myers in the car lighting a cigarette—he lighted a match and threw it alight on the floor—the straw caught slightly alight, and he stamped it out with hit foot—the conductor told him it was against the rules—he said he was going out—the conductor then went on the top—Myers came out on the platform and stood there and commenced smoking—I told him he was not allowed to ride there or to smoke—he said he was going to get off at Stepney Green—as the distance was only a few yards I took no further notice of him until the car stopped at Stepney Green, or just past it; and then, as he did not show any desire to get off, I rang the bell and stopped the car—he then stepped off—I stood on the step with my face towards the driver to tell persons who were hailing the oar that there was no more room, when suddenly some one came behind me and pulled me by the coat and struck me across the head and hat with a cane—I saved myself by holding on to the rail with both hands—the car was in motion—I turned round and saw it was Myers—the conductor came down to my assistance and tried to persuade him to go away—he then turned round and assaulted Dodsworth, who stepped off the car and tried to keep him back for a short distance and he left him standing in the road and ran after the car and got on the platform again—Myers ran after the car alongside and deliberately put his right hand through the end window, smashing the glass and sending the fragments over a lady's shoulder inside—her face was slightly—cut, but in the disturbance her name and address could not be taken—after the window was broken Dodsworth rang the bell and stopped the car, and took his money bag, punch and badge to the driver—Myers followed him—I could see there was a slight disturbance at the fore part of the car, and when Dodsworth came back his lip was cut—I did not see the actual blow struck because I was at the other end of the car—I saw the constables come up—Myers then had hold of Dodsworth by the throat or handkerchief with one hand, and was striking him with his stick with the other—the constables stepped between them, the stick got knocked on the ground, and Dodsworth then gave him in charge for assaulting him and wilfully breaking the window—I picked up the stick and proceeded with the car to Stratford.</p>

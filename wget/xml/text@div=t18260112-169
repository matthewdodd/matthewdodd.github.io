            . I am servant to the prosecutrix. I know the lumber room - I had seen the trunks all safe on the 29th of December, when I went to take a shirt out; the articles stolen were all in one trunk. I did not hear any noise in the night - the house was fastened by Stephen. It was not I who alarmed my mistress.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN DOCKERTY. I live with Mrs. Laver. I sleep in the kitchen - this lumber room is on the first floor. I fastened up the front door of the house about eight o'clock - I was the last who went to bed, and know the house was all fastened; I locked the coach-house door, and one door of the stable, but the stable door next the yard was not locked - there was a ladder stood by the side of the wall, and a door leads from the stable to this lumber room; there was no part of the house broken, and we do not know how they came in. I lost a pair of braces, a handkerchief, a coat, a waistcoat, a pair of small clothes, and eight farthings. I have seen the prisoner Shaw before, but have not spoken to him - I had seen him that week, standing before my mistress's house, but cannot say on what day. I have seen my braces and handkerchief since.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Edmonton. I was passing the house on the morning of the 1st of January, about half-past three o'clock; I saw the coach-house door open - I went in and knocked, and asked who was there - there was no answer. I then went to the door of the house - Stephen, the servant came to me; I asked him if he had shut the coach-house door over night - he said Yes, and bolted it too. I told him to get a light, which he did; we went to the stable, and found a chest, which he said had come from the lumber room - we went up the step ladder, and found his box empty; we then went out, and found the back door leading to the stable open - we went into the wash-house, and found some hampers, which had empty bottles and straw in them, moved. I went out, and sprang my rattle, and two Bow-street officers came to my assistance; we went into the premises again, and then to Shaw's house, which is about two hundred yards off - we got there about four o'clock - we stood under the window about two minutes, saw a light in the up stairs room, and heard a whispering - we called to them to open the door, and soon afterwards broke it open- the two officers went up stairs; I stopped below for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, when the two prisoners were brought down, handcuffed, with this bundle of things - I have known Pratt above twenty years, but I did not know which house he lived at.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was all the property found? A. I do not know.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I was on duty, and heard the rattle - I went to the spot with my brother officer, and then to Shaw's house; I saw the light, and heard the whispering; I went and pushed the door open, and ran up stairs; Pratt passed me on the stairs; I called to my brother officer, who stood at the bottom, to stop him; I went up, and secured Shaw - he was dressed, but without shoes; Pratt was then brought up - he was without shoes also, but dressed; they were handcuffed together. We found a quantity of linen strewed on the floor - we sent for Mrs. Layer's servant, who identified it. We then went down, and found some more linen in the lower room. I found on Pratt a pair of braces and a key, which he said belonged to his father's out-house - a bad shilling and a farthing.</p>

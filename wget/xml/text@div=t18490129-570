                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Bennett, of Evelyn-street, Deptford. On 20th Jan., about two o'clock in the day, I went into the shop and saw the prisoner with a looking-glass under his arm—he left the shop—I called the apprentice, and my husband—they ran after him, and brought him back with the glass—he said he bought it lower down the town—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my husband took it from him, and he ran away—it is a bro<lb></lb>ker's shop, and the glass was just outside the door.</p>

As I was going up stairs I felt my pocket-book safe in my pocket, it contained sixteen 1 l. Bank notes, and five of the Ryegate Bank.

I offered her 5 l. to return it, she declared her innocence. I am certain it was safe when I went there. I was rather in liquor, but not insensible.</p>

            . I am a patrol of the Strand. About ten or eleven o'clock on the 20th of August I heard a noise up Swan-yard, and found Kenny and another man had been quarrelling; Kenny was at his door, I requested him to go in, which he did. In the morning I heard the same noise again, went up, and found Kenny and Davis quarrelling. I said,</p>

               <p>"Why it is not long ago since I separated you, and you are at it again! I shall take you to the watch-house as disorderly," which I did. Davis laid hold of Kenny, and said he would not let him go until he had got his money back, for he had robbed him of a pocketbook and 21 l., which was in Kenny's house. Kenny wished me to go in and search, I did not - they had both been drinking. Davis knew what he was about, but Kenny was rather more in liquor. I told Davis to be careful of what he said, for it was a serious thing to charge a man with robbing him - he still persisted in it, and I took them both to the watch-house, where he gave charge to that effect. On Saturday morning I took Kenny to Bow-street, the Magistrate asked Davis if he charged Kenny with robbing him? he said he was in liquor, and could not say whether it was him or not, but he had been robbed of it. The Magistrate discharged the complaint.</p>

            . On the 20th of August I saw Davis standing at Kenny's door with Kenny's coat on; after that I saw Williams come down stairs to go for some oysters; she crossed, and went to the oyster-stall, and had some opened, Davis followed her. She told him she was going for some bread and cheese - he said,</p>
               <p>"Now you had better let me go and do the trick." She said,</p>
               <p>"No, it is a man I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181910270071"></xptr>have known many years, and I will not have it done." When she came back he said,</p>
               <p>"You might as well have let me done it;" she said No, and went up stairs. I saw no more of her. About two o'clock in the morning Kenny and Davis were fighting. It was the night of the robbery.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Williams, who keeps the Swan, in Swan-yard. On the night of the 20th of August I went out to get some gin, and on coming back I saw Davis and Kenny standing under the lamp, counting some money. I heard Davis say there was 21 l. He had a pocket-book and the notes in his hand - this was between eleven and twelve o'clock - I saw them again at one o'clock; Davis had then changed coats with Kenny; they were drinking together at the top of Swan-yard with several girls. Between three and four o'clock I saw them fighting in Swan-yard. Davis charged Kenny with robbing him of a pocket-book and 21 l. I believe they went to the watch-house.</p>

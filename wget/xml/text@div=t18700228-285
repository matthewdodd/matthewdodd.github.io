                  </hi>. On 10th January I lived at 13, Upper Avenue Road, as servant—I have been acquainted with the prisoner since June, he has been courting me—about 7.45 that evening I was in the kitchen—there was a ring at the bell and I went to the kitchen door and saw the prisoner—he said "Let me come in"—I said "No"—he said "I want to come in, only for a minute or two"—he said "Have you written to met?"—I said "No"—he asked me if I would go to the theatre with him the next evening, I said "No"—he asked me why—I said "Because I have written and liked my aunt to come over"—he said "Then you meant to have deceived me again by not coming"—I said "Yes, if you had been silly enough to come"(something had been said on Saturday the 8th about going to the theatre)—I was in his company on the Saturday, and there was a quarrel Between us about a letter I had received the night before and which I showed him, and we did not part friends—I was not going to marry him—I was engaged to him at one time, and had broken it off in November; but he continued paying attentions to me, still pressing mo to renew the</p>

               <p>engagement—I had not been to the theatre with him—I think something was said on the Saturday about him coming to see me on the Monday—I had not deceived him before about going to the theatre, but I had often deceived him—I mean that I sometimes said I was going somewhere with him and I did not go—he asked me to let him in again, I still said "No!" and tried to push him out of the gate—he was trying to push his way in—I said "I shall not stand here any longer, for I am cold," and turned round and went towards the kitchen door—he was after me and caught hold of my throat—I pinched his arm and told him to let go, but he did not—I then slipped down and screamed, and he let go of my throat and caught me by my hair and dragged me to the back-door (there is a little garden in front)—I screamed, and Mr. Clarke came out of the kitchen and said "What are you doing?"—I then felt something across my throat, which I thought was a knife; I put up my hand and caught hold of something which cut my fingers—Mr. Clarke knocked whatever it was out of his hand, and he then let go of me and ran up the steps into the road, and I saw no more of him—I did not faint, I ran into the road and stayed there till a policeman came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at 51, Culvert Road, De Beauvoir Town—on the evening of 10th January I was at 13, Upper Avenue Road, St. John's Wood, in the kitchen—I remember the last witness going to answer the door—about five minutes elapsed, and then I heard a slight scream and a scuffle—I went to the door, and saw the prisoner dragging Julia Hughes along, but I could not see her plainly, because her back was to me—half of her body was on the ground—I said, "Cox, what are you doing?"—he then pushed her up in a corner, put his hand in his pocket, and I saw something glistening go to her throat—I caught hold of his wrist, and a razor fell out of his hand, open—I closed with him, and we struggled—he caught me round the shoulders; I gave him a push, and he went against the door, and he put his leg against me, threw me, jumped on me, knelt on my chest, banged my head on the stones, reached the razor from where it was lying a few inches off, and made a cut at my throat—he spoke two or three times, but I could not hear what he said—I got hold of the razor with my glove, and managed to wrest it from him, and put it in my pocket—my glove was cut, and it took the skin off my little finger—I ran to the door to try to get out, but could not, as I did not know how it opened—the prisoner ran into the kitchen, and I heard a rattling, as if he had got to the knife drawer—I ran up the stairs of the house, opened the back window, and called out, but no one answered—I opened one of the doors up stairs, and thon came down stairs again, found a policeman there, and gave the razor to him—the prisoner had then gone—I</p>

I am a surgeon, of Avenue Road—on 10th January I was called to the prosecutrix—she had an incised wound on her throat, more than three inches long, and widely gaping, as if the instrument had been turned round, so that it did not go very deep—she lost a good deal of blood, and was very faint—one wound was just under the jaw, and another near the clavicle—the upper wound just missed the jugular vein—neither wound was dangerous, but the lower one has not healed yet—this razor would inflict them.</p>

On the evening of 10th January, about 8.30, I received information, and waited in Manning Street, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey, till a little after 12 o'clock, when I saw the prisoner and another person come into Manning Street—I stopped him as he was about to enter the house, and said, "Cox, I want you"—he became very violent, called for his father, and said, "I know you; I know what you want me for"—I was not able to take him, and got the assistance of two constables—I searched him, and found a bottle of laudanum—I said, "Here is a bottle here"—he said, "Yes, it is poison"—I also found a <hi rend="italic">carte de visite,</hi> under which was written "Yours affectionately, Julia," also a lock of her hair—I told him I was an inspector of police, and took him in custody for cutting and wounding Julia Hughes, with intent to murder her—he said, "I did it, and I hope she is dead. Do not hurt me, and I will go quietly with you to St. John's Wood"—I put him in a cab, and cautioned him—he said, "I wont no cautioning; I did it, and I hope she is dead. If vou had not had me to-night it would have been too late in the morning; if you will allow me to leave the cab I will not be long two inches above water"—he then asked mo how Julia was—I said I could not tell him, for I had not seen her, but I believed she was very bad—he placed his hand to his throat, and said, "I would rather be <hi rend="italic">scragged</hi> for her to-morrow than see her belong to another"—he was taken to the station and there charged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner handed in a written defence, stating that Clarke had been passed of as the prosecutrix's brother; that he afterwards called on Clarke, and complained to him of his writing the letter which the prosecutrix had shown him; that he afterwards quarrelled with the prosecutrix, but made it up again, and determined to destroy his own life if she deceived him again, for which purpose lie carried the razor, and on the evening in question his suspicions were excited by her not admitting him, and confirmed by the appearance of Clarke, upon which he drew the razor across the girl's throat, but denied using it upon Clarke.</hi>

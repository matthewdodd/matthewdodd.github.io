            . I live in Great Charlotte-street, Blackfriars-road, and am a pawnbroker. On the 14th of February a watch, two seals, and a key, were pawned with me, by the prisoner for 1l. 15s., in the name of Robert Smith - I am certain of him - I asked if it was his own, he said it was; he returned to the shop a week afterwards, offered another watch in pawn, and produced the duplicate of the first which he had pawned, in order to show me his name and address - I detained the duplicate, and asked how he came by the watch he had first pawned - he said he had bought it for 4l.; I said I had had notice that such a watch had been stolen from the hotel at the foot of Westminster-bridge, and he must wait there till I sent for the waiter - he said he had a gentleman waiting to meet him, and it would be of consequence to him to go - he wished to go, but I detained him, and sent for a constable - I have the first watch here, and produce it - he was taken into custody by Doery - the watch and seals are worth 3l. - I would give that for them.</p>

            . This is my watch and seals - one seal has been taken off; the watch was made for me, and my name is engraved in it; it cost me 5l. 5s.; I have had it five years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Q. Are you positive I am the person who engaged the bed? A. Quite so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went into the hotel you made your how to me, and asked what I would take - I said a glass of ale, and asked if you had any knowledge of me; you said No, and the landlord said the same. Witness. When he was brought to the hotel I did not recognise him at first, in the hurry of business; he was then dressed in a black coat and waistcoat, blue trousers, and a dark green great coat; when he engaged the bed he had a light drab coat, buttoned up to his chin, and the same when he went away in the morning - I could not tell what clothes he had on under it - I am quite positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never had a drab-coat in my life. I bought the watch, the day I pawned it, of a respectable man opposite the Waggon and Horses public-house, near the Elephant and Castle, for 4l. I had seen the man before, and wanting money I pawned it in my own name.</p>

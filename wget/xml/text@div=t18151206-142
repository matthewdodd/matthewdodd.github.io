            . I am a book-seller, and reside in Holborn. Some time before the beginning of November last, the prisoner at the bar, came to me, one morning, and brought with him a parcel which was the ten volumes of the Statutes at Large, the value of which was thirty pounds; but for which he only asked ten pounds. I asked to whom they belonged? and he said to a gentleman of the profession going out of town, and he told me his name was Mr. Able Wright, of Lincoln's Inn. I told him in the first place, I must see if such a person lived in Lincoln's Inn, and if he did, and had sent these books, I would pay him for them myself. I went to enquire, and found that Mr. Long lived there, and not Mr. Wright. That same day, the prisoner came to my house, and I told him he was an impostor. He said he would take the books away, but I told him he should not, for I would keep them to find an owner; and he went away, and left them with me. In consequence of my making enquiries at all the law book-sellers, I found out the real owners. Paradice came to my house, and after examining them, knew them by some defection.</p>

            . I was in the employment of the prosecutors. I remember taking stock at Christmas last; and then having two hundred and four sets of the Statutes at Large, and I selected twelve sets as imperfect. In consequence of information, I went to Mr. De Arcey's shop, and then I brought this set home, knowing it to be one of the sets, which I had sealed up as imperfect. The prisoner was in our employ; and on my return from De Arcey's, he had absconded. I never saw him again, until he was apprehended.</p>

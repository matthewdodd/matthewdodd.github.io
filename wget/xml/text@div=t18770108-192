                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising at Colchester—I have been assisting my father, who is also a solicitor, in his business—I Was doing so in July, 1873—my father was then and is now Clerk to the Magistrates of the Lexton and Winstree Division, and also to the Highway Board—the prisoner was at that time a clerk in his employ—his department was that particular portion of the business which related to my father's appointment as Clerk to the Magistrates and Clerk to the Highway Board; it was the practise for him to receive payments on those accounts, all pay<lb></lb>ments I may say—all monies paid into the office on those accounts passed through his hands; if I received any I handed them over to him the first time I saw him; or if my father or some other clerk received any in his absence it was instantly handed over to him on the first opportunity—this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is called the Magisterial Cash Book—all payments respect<lb></lb>ing the magisterial department ought to have passed through this book;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080071"></xptr>
               <p>that was the course of business in the office—the left-hand page denotes cash received by the prisoner, and the right-hand page cash paid by the prisoner—when my father or I received sums from the prisoner we put our initials against the sums so received; it was very rarely indeed, I think, that my father received any—I see here an entry on 18th August, 1873; it is in the prisoner's handwriting—it is "August" 18th, 1873, to H. W. J., cash 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., H. W. J."—those are my initials—when I signed my initials to that item it was not as it is now; it then stood 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have my own cash-book which makes me say that positively, I have it here—the moment I received any money from the prisoner or anybody else I always entered it in that book—at this length of time I would not undertake to pledge my oath that on that particular day I only received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; it is four years ago, I could not go to the length of saying that—I notice something with regard to the figures in this entry in the magisterial cash-book—when I signed my initials to this entry the entry wag 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; another "I" has been put in front of it, and the first "1" is in a different coloured ink; the other two figures have been run over at the same time the second "I" has been put in; it appears so—the prisoner has had credit for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on that item—the prisoner used to hand me the balance of any sums he had in hand—the balance was taken at uncertain times, there was no regular time for taking it—the whole of this page is the prisoner's writing—there is no balance struck on that page, of course balances are struck after<lb></lb>wards, at the end of the year—this book shows that a balance was struck, there was then a sum brought forward to the 1st January, 1874—this book shows that at the end of 1873 the prisoner was indebted to my father on that account 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is, that he had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in hand.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This affair was on 18th August, 1873—the prisoner remained in my father's service up to the middle of 1876—my father is here and in Court—I know Mr. Fry of the firm of Palmer, Bull, &amp; Fry, attorneys—I do not know Mr. Bull—I was not present at Colchester when my father charged Mr. Bull with receiving a press copy of a letter knowing it to be stolen—I am well acquainted with all the business matters in my father's office except magisterial business—I know that my father had a client named Jeffreys—I know that my father is making certain claims upon insurance offices with regard to policies which had been assigned to Jeffreys from one Blomberg; we are bringing actions against these insurance companies; they are defending the actions; they are disputing the claim on the ground of fraud, they alleging that Blomberg had gone to Japan and had died before paying the extra risk premium—they also allege that my father was aware of the fact and concealed the fact of Blomberg's death—the prisoner abstracted a press letter written by my father to Messrs. Digby, solicitors, of Malton, and forwarded that press copy to Messrs. Palmer, Bull, &amp; Fry, the solicitors to the insurance company, and that is one of the charges against him—we charged him with stealing the press copy of the letter, and Mr. Bull with receiving it knowing it to have been stolen</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080072"></xptr>
               <p>—we preferred an indictment at this Court against the prisoner for stealing that press letter—Mr. Bull was discharged before the Magistrate—I have heard that the prisoner's defence with regard to that letter was that he had sent it to Mr. Bull because he knew that a fraud had been committed on the office, and for the purpose of furthering the ends of justice—it was after that charge that, we brought this charge of forgery, because we did not know of it till after he left—Mr. Digby was not representing Jeffrey because he was a client of my father's—I believe he was concerned for one of the assignees of one of Blomberg's policies—the charge of stealing the press letter was committed to the Colchester Borough Sessions—this book has been in my possession from time to time, and this one in the prisoner's—since he left it has been left in the office that he used to use; the clerk that succeeded him took over the books—when the prisoner left the books were taken home by my father—I believe the prisoner left on the last day of June or 1st July—when my father took the books home I believe they were brought back the next morning; I think we took them home two or three nights—there was no regular stated time for balancing the accounts between the prisoner and the firm—they were not balanced weekly—some<lb></lb>times they were balanced monthly, or when it suited my father and the prisoner to balance them, at irregular times—my father has two farms—I have never known him to borrow money of the prisoner to pay on to the farm—I never heard of it—he was paid his salary, sometimes by cheque, and when he was not, I used to pay him, that is to say, supposing 1 had not sufficient money in the office on the particular day his salary was due, I should go to my father and ask him to give him a cheque for it, and I know he has done it, but in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred I have done it, and you will find the entries in this book—he was always paid on the 1st of every month, unless it was on a Sunday, or I was not there, or some<lb></lb>thing of that sort, you know—I mean that his salary was not always paid on the 1st of every month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It is the fact that before Blomberg died the assignee of his policy had tendered the extra premium on account of Blomberg having gone abroad—it is the case that Blomberg had gone out of the limits of the policy before he died, and that before he died the assignee and holder of his policy went to the office and informed them that he had gone out of the limits of Europe that he did not know where he was, and tendered the extra premium—I was not present, and as to some of the questions 1 was asked by the prisoner's counsel, I was not present—it was alleged by means of a bill in Chancery that my father had concealed the fact—I know, as a fact that the bill has been dismissed with costs—Mr. Bull kept the press letter twelve days, photographed it, and sent it back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were asked whether the prisoner's defence was that he wanted to expose a fraud—as far as you know, was there any fraud to expose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not, that I am quite satisfied of—the prisoner was committed to the Borough Sessions at Colchester for stealing a letter; it was a charge of larceny, triable at Sessions; this charge of forgery* was not triable at Sessions, under an order in council, the Essex people are brought to this Court for the Winter Assizes—I don't think I have totalled the page in this book where the 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is—I will do it—the total in its present state is right—the whole of these figures are the prisoner's writing—I think there has been an alteration of the total in the book; I will just look at it again; there have been in several, I don't know whether there has been in that one.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. This book was not kept under lock and key during the time the prisoner was with us; it was kept on his desk—he had an office to himself; other account books as well were kept on his desk, anybody in the office had access to them—there was no formal audit of his accounts—I did not say to him "Bring your account in, and let us check it off"—I looked into the book a great many times, and looked through the different items; I did that sometimes twice a week—I am out a great deal, and I may not be in the office from one week's end to another—I have sometimes gone two or three weeks and not seen it; I think that would be a long interval—on the average, I think the book would be looked into once a week, because he used to make payments to me about once a week—the accounts on either side, debit or credit, would be presented to me; I should look at the items, I should not cast up—I took the items and looked at them to see if they were correct—I only pointed out one entry to him in my life as being erroneous, and that was within three days of leaving; that was the first intimation I ever had—that item appears in the books; that was the only one that I remember—I kept a cash-book of my own; I kept that on my own table, in my own private office—I have a separate room—that cash-book was subject to anybody's inspection at the time, it was always open to anybody who might come in and look at it—I made the entries under the prisoner's inspection, he used to bring me this book, and the cash, and say "I have to give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." whatever it was, he would previously have entered it in the book before handing me the money, and I should immediately put my initials, as I have done to thousands of items,. and make the entry in my book—I can't say when that particular entry was made—I have not the slightest recollection; it was a matter happen<lb></lb>ing every week, and twice a week sometimes—I have no recollection whether that entry was made in his presence or not—I made very few entries, I should think, when he was not present; I feel sure I must have made some—he used to see me make the entries, they were always done so that he could see them, he was not so far off as your Lordship is; my table is a small one—I can't say that he read it; I know that he has done so—this is the office cash-book, there are nobody's entries in it but mine—it was no part of the prisoner's duty to make entries in it—none of the entries in the other book are in any handwriting but his, only after his discharge.</p>

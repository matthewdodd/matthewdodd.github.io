                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker, and live in Hart-street Covent-garden. About one o'clock in the morning of the 29th of June, I was out with a friend in Short's-gardens—I went into the White Horse public-house—I saw the prisoner and another person, and two or three girls—I was drinking gin and water—I felt for my handkerchief and it was gone—I looked round and the prisoner and his friends had gone out—I went out, and caught hold of two of them—I was going to catch the prisoner and this handkerchief of mine dropped from behind him—I caught him, and the policeman came up and took him.</p>

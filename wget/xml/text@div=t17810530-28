            . The prisoner at the bar came into our shop last Tuesday was week, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, to buy a silk handkerchief; I shewed her several pieces. I was in the shop, by myself. She agreed for one, for 4 s. and, just as I was cutting it off, she put her hand into her pocket, as I imagined, for her money, to pay me; and, instead of money, she took out a handful of snuff, and rubbed my face all over with it; she rubbed it in my eyes and mouth; then she took the remainder of the piece of handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Did you see her? - My eyes were blinded; as soon as I opened my eyes, she was between the shop door and counter. The piece of handkerchiefs catched on the latch of the shop door, and the spikes of the kitchen window. I ran out, snuffy as I was, and begged of the people to stop her. She left the handkerchiefs behind her, hanging on the kitchen window, I believe.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the person? - I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>What became of the handkerchief that was cut off? - That was, all over snuff, on the counter.</p>
               <p>What was the value of the handkerchiefs? - Two shillings a-piece. A person picked the handkerchiefs up; but he went away: the handkerchiefs remained on the spikes.</p>

               <p>(The prisoner called her father and mother-in-law, who gave her a good character.)</p>

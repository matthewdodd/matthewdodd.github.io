             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker in Chandos-street, (produces the property): On Saturday, the 20th of September, between seven and eight in the evening, the prisoner at the bar brought these two curtains, a waistcoat, and cloak, to my shop; she had been in the habit of coming to the shop, but had always redeemed the things, so that I had no suspicion of her; she pledged the curtains for fifteen shillings;she then gave a ticket to my young man of a pair of ear-rings, for four shillings; and she left the cloak and the waistcoat for the ear-rings, which she took away; she had a very different appearance from that she has now; she was dressed very genteel; about an hour after that; Mr. Pearson sent a little boy to me with a pattern; I compared it, and found they were the same curtains; I then sent word to Mr.Pearson, that I had taken them in; she gave me her address, Wharton's-court; I went there on the Sunday, but no such person lived there, and on the Monday, the next day, she came to my shop again, to pledge the very ear-rings that she had redeemed on the Saturday; in consequence of that, I told her the curtains were stolen;she said, they were given to her by a young man who had been a compositor, and was now at the Star printing-office, his name I do not recollect; I told her, if she did not produce the person, she would be answerable for it; I sent for Mr. Pearson, and took her to Bow-Street;she there said,she had received them from this man, and described him to have something remarkable upon his cheek.</p>

               <p>Q. Was what she said taken in writing? - A. I am not certain; the Magistrate granted a warrant or summons to apprehend the man; the man came, and from his appearance, answered every description she had given of him; and when he came, she said he was not the man.</p>

               <p>Pearson. These are my curtains.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I watched for a young man of the name of Thomas Johnson; he owed me six shillings; he called upon me, and asked me to lend him two shillings; he said,she could get a place in the Star printing-office; I told him, I could not; I pledged a petticoat of my own for four shillings, and I let him have the two shillings on the Saturday night; he said, he wanted some money to go to work on the Monday, and he brought me these things to pledged for him, which I did</p>

I live at West Ham, and work at the leather<lb></lb>cloth works—on Whit-Monday, I was with the prisoner near West Ham church, at 10.15, I had a bottle of ale—we met the constable and Hip well—the constable said "How are we going on for a drink"—I said "Yes, you are welcome, you can have a drink"—as I was going to draw the cork, he pulled the prisoner off the path by the collar of his coat and asked him to have a spar for a <hi rend="italic">barney</hi>—the prisoner said "No, I don't want no <hi rend="italic">barney</hi>, drink if you are going to drink, you go your way and I will go mine"—the constable said "If I <hi rend="italic">lick</hi> you I will let you go, but if you <hi rend="italic">lick</hi> me I will run you m"—he then struck the prisoner across the face; I could not say whether with his open or shut hand, they closed and fell, they were rolling and scrambling on the ground—I and the last witness tried to separate them, at last they got up and the prisoner went away, and I went on towards the Unicom, and did not see the other bit of row at the corner of the King's Head—I did not see the other constable, only when I heard the bother I saw the prisoner n charge of the the other constable, and he said to the one that had hold of him "Let him alone he is going right with me, and he won't go quietly with you"—the constable was not sober, he appeared to have been drink<lb></lb>ing, excited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known the prisoner about six years; he is no particular friend—I had been with him that day; it was Bank Holiday—we had not had wonderful much drink—the prisoner was sober—I was once charged with an assault on a cow-keeper, and fined 17. and costs—I was taken by one of the police of the district and taken to this same station—that was the only time—I did not see McCardle's face bleeding or Horswell's lip cut.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 26, Doulton Road, West Ham—I was it West Ham Lame on this night, about 11.20—I saw the prisoner in custody of one constable, and another constable behind him, with his helmet off, walking in the road—I saw that constable strike at the prisoner, whether he hit him I can't say—I walked by their side to the station, and the con<lb></lb>stable had his staff drawn all the time—the prisoner was not violent; he did not strike or kick either of the constables—the constable said to me "You saw him strike me, did you not?" and I said "I did not; I saw you strike at him, and that I shall tell when I get to the station"—they were about half-way to the station when the third constable came up—I did not notice the constables bleeding—I have known the prisoner a good many years—none of us—were intoxicated that night—the prisoner has always been a quiet inoffensive man; he is a boiler maker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have heard that he was charged with an assault on a constable—I don't know that he got a month, I don't know what he got; it was at West Ham—I had been with him part of this day—he was not drunk, he was what I call sober—we had been out together from about 11 a.m.; we were jolly—I can't say how many public-houses we had been into; very likely too many to count.</p>

                  </hi>. I was potman at the King's Head—between 10.30 and 11 o'clock on this night McCardle was there talking to some gentlemen—I was getting out the shutters to shut up—he caught hold of my collar and said "Halloo, Rogers, how are you? What are you going to have to drink—I said "A glass of ale"—he gave roe a glass out of a quart pot, and turned to the gentlemen and said "That is the only man I ever <hi rend="italic">laggedb</hi> West Ham," meaning me—he had charged me with cruelly working a how—I saw that he was the worse for drink or I should have noticed his showing me up in the public-house—I refused serving him with any ale—he was the last man that went out of the King's Head that night—on the Wednes<lb></lb>day following he came and asked if I knew anything about the affair—I said "No, but I was surprised to see you with those eyes after leaving on Whit Monday night"—he said he got knocked insensible when he got outside.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not before the Magistrate—I was fined 4(k and costs at Stratford for cruelly working the horse, upon McCardle's evidence, but I did not have to pay it—McCardle took me into custody—it was on 23rd March last—I was detained till the fine was paid—I know the prisoner by sight, but never knew anything of him till this case.</p>

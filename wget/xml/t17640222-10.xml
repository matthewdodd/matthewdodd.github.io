            . On the 24th of December, betwixt 12 and 1 o'clock, I caused to be loaded on a cart, three cases, and two matted trunks, and on account of one of the trunks, I did not chuse to trust any body with them, but went myself with the cart, and did not lose sight of it, till it got down to the Custom-house key. When I got into Tower-street, I overtook our waterman which we employ, Mr.

                  William

            , who accompanied me down to the key; there I saw these trunks and cases unloaded, and put safely under the crane, which the merchants use for shipping goods, about 2 yards from the water-side. I gave orders care should be taken of them; they were delivered to the waterman, in his presence, and he was to ship them, but we were to wait a little: the thing in dispute was, which of the two ships we should ship them on board. When we had discharged the carman, Mr. Turpin and I went up together, to give him particular directions concerning shipping those goods; and I knew nothing to the contrary of their being shipped, till the Monday following, about noon, when Mr. Turpin came to my counting-house, and brought the captain's receipt for only four out of five of these cases. The ship is a Spanish ship, called the St. Michael: Mr. Turpin told me, at the same time, that the other trunk was missing, and he was in hopes it was wrong shipped. Upon which, I was very anxious of finding it, it was the richest of the trunks, marked with a Heart, and a Crow-foot on the top, divided in the middle with three letters, J. G. C. in Roman capitals, with No. 15. upon it. The others were different marks; this was a flat trunk, about 3 feet long, and about 22 inches broad, and about 20 deep. I went with Mr. Turpin upon the key, and we made all the enquiry we could, among the shipping, but could not find it; I suppose they must produce this trunk to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the contents of the things in in the trunk?</p>
               <p>Lucas. There were 871 fans, value 164 l. 5 s. two gold trinkets, set with diamonds, value eight guineas; a gold repeating watch, set with diamonds, and other precious stones, value 630 l. a gold toilet, value 28 l. a mother of pearl necklace and ear-rings, and other things; the whole value of the goods, I remember, were from 1000 to 1100 l. I saw them put into the box, which was matted and corded, and I sealed the key with wax, in the counting-house, under the matting. I have made all the diligent enquiry I could, but never could hear any thing of it.</p>

               <p>He is sworn.</p>
               <p>Henson. My master is Mr. Hunter, a watchmaker, at the corner of Lombard-street, next door to the pastry-cooks. I was sent by my master to the custom-house key with a clock, the day before Christmas-day, to be shipped on board; after that I had another Errand to go to Burr-street, St. Catherine's. I delivered the clock at the custom-house key. When I came to Brewer's key I saw Lot Lash standing under the crane, with a flat parcel, like a trunk, matted and corded; he desired me to help him up with it; I went to help him, but it was too heavy for me; I tried but could not; then she said he was afraid the officers would seize it; then I proceeded on my other Errand as far as the Tower; then I saw him with such a thing on his shoulder coming along.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you describe the shape or size of that parcel?</p>
               <p>Henson. I cannot directly; it was heavy; I followed him over Tower-wharf, where he turned round several times, but for what purpose I do not know; when I came to the farthest end of the wharf he turned towards Tower-hill, and I saw no more of him; I went of my errand, and then home to my master.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to recollect this?</p>
               <p>Henson. By the warning being brought to my master's; when he said there was a trunk stolen, then I told him what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Brewer's Key?</p>
               <p>Henson. It is two or three keys farther than the Custom-house key, towards Tower-hill.</p>

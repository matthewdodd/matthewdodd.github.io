             solicited me to know where I was going; I told her I was going home to my wife and family; she asked me to step with her into an alley, for she had some, thing particular to speak to me. Accordingly I did, when I came into the alley I clapped my hand on my breeches to the chain of my watch; I asked her what she wanted me for? she said, nothing; I took hold of the top of the chain, and she took hold of the body of it and twisted the chain in two, and delivered the watch first to one woman, and that one delivered it to another and ran away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she got the watch into her possession and broke the chain? - Yes. So I left her, and they took the hat off my head, and by running in pursuit after these that had got my property then in hand, I slipped my foot and fell down.</p>


               <p>Q. Had you known the prisoner by sight before? - Never in my life. Then I went into the street, and the watch was going his round, he was going into the alley, and I told him that I was robbed of my watch and chain, and hat. The watchman went round along with me, but he could not find any hat nor none of the girls; I went along with the watchman, and then in about ten minutes I returned to the alley, and near about the same place where I lost my watch, I found my hat laying in the gutter; accordingly after I found my hat I returned back again to go into the street to go toward home, and when I came to the street the prisoner at the bar was sitting on some steps quite unconcerned; I attacked her, and asked what she had done with my watch? and told her if she would be so kind as to let me have my watch again, or let me know how I might get it, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160073"></xptr>would give her four or five shillings, and let her go about her business, and not give her in charge to the officer; with that she cursed me in a very profane manner, and that instant that officer came up, and I gave charge of her. That is the very girl that pulled the watch out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found your watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not I at the end of the court when you lost your watch? - No, you was not.</p>

               <p>I am a painter and glazier by trade; I am headborough of the parish; I was officer of the night at the watch-house; I heard the man demanding of his watch, I was going my round, and I came up to see what it was; I asked what was the matter, and what led him there? he told me that he had been robbed of his watch, and the prisoner at the bar it was that robbed him. She was present at the time; he gave me charge of her as the woman that robbed him.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was the prosecutor sober at the time? - He certainly was not cleverly sober, but he was sensible enough to know what he said and did, for he said exactly the same before the magistrate the next morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was about eleven o'clock at night I came from over the way, from a public house, and I set me down at the end of this court for about ten minutes, and two girls came running down and jumped over me, and said, there is a man going to beat us; about five minutes afterwards this man came down and said that he had been robbed of his hat and watch; he said nothing to me, but went into a chandler's shop, in the mean time, when he was gone, a girl came down with a hat under her apron; says I, that is the man's hat; says she, don't you say nothing about it, I will go and throw it over the wall; and she went away, and I saw no more of it; after that he came back to me and said, you are the girl that robbed me, and he called our officer twice, and the officer came up, and he gave charge of me, and they took me to the watch-house, and searched me. I am sure if I had robbed that man I would never have been there.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is any thing true that the girl has said? - No. There were three girls.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses to her character.</p>

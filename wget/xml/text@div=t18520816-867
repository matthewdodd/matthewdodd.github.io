                  </hi>. I am a wool spinner, at Wellington, in Somersetshire. I was present at the prisoner's marriage at Wellington, on 17th Feb., 1840—he married Jane Ebdin, my sister—she is now living, I saw her in good health last Monday morning—I signed the register.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Newton-street, Holborn. I was in service—I was married to the prisoner in Bloomsbury Church on 25th Feb., 1850—he was not with me longer than eight weeks at first—he stayed with me till I had parted with every thing, and then he threw himself out of work and went into the country—he came back after that, and persuaded me to live with him again—I provided him another home, and he did not stay with me then more than five weeks—I did not hear he had got a wife till after I had been confined—there was a woman came and insulted me, and said she was his wife, but she was not his first wife, Jane Ebdin—the child I have in my arms is the prisoner's child—I asked him whether he was married—I put the ques<lb></lb>tion to him several times before I was married—he said he was not, and took</p>

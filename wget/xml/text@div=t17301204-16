               <p>The Prosecutor depos'd, That he having been at Christ-Church on the other side of the Water, coming Home had the Misfortune to fall into the Water, that going to an House, the Landlord lent him dry Clothes, and there he drank hot Liquors to prevent his taking Cold, and had drank more than he usually did, and coming on this side of the Water to the Old Swan, drank 2 or 3 Pints with two Friends, from whom he parted in Cornhill; and as he was making the best of his way Home, he met two Women, and they ask'd him to make them drink, that he reply'd, he had no Business with them; that presently after he met two Women again, but did not know whether they were the same Women or not. That one of the Women came up to him, which was the Prisoner, and he knew not what became of the other; that she clapped hold of him, and he put his Hand in his Pocket, miss'd his Gold, laid hold of the Prisoner, and said he was Robb'd, and call'd the Watch, and carried her to the Watch-house, where she refus'd to be search'd; but she desiring that he himself might be search'd, he consented, and the Watchman search'd him, and found only 18 d. in Silver, and no Gold; that afterwards the Prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173012040006"></xptr> coming to him, put her Hand in his Coat Pocket, and pull'd out a Guinea, but the half Guinea was still missing.</p>
               <p>- Frisby and - Carter, the Watchmen, and Mr. Rimes, the Constable, confirm'd the searching the Prosecutor, and finding no Gold about him; and as to the finding the Guinea, afterwards they could not say she put it there.</p>
               <p>There were several Persons call'd to the Prisoner's Reputation, who gave her a good Character; where upon the Jury <rs id="t17301204-16-verdict81" type="verdictDescription">

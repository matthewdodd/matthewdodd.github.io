On the 30th of December, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner was brought into my shop by Eames, with two coats; he asked me in the prisoner's presence, if they were mine?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130016"></xptr>They were, I had not missed them, as I was engaged with a customer; they were taken from off the counter at the further end of the shop; I had put them there not an hour before, and was in the shop all the morning. A young man came in, and wanted a waistcoat; while I was engaged with him, a person might come in, and take the coats without my seeing them. The prisoner said it was his first offence, and begged of me to let him go - I gave him in charge. I only rent the lower part of the house, and sleep there - the landlord does not live in the house. One coat cost me 2 l. 10 s., and the other was worth 7 s. or 8 s.</p>

            . On the 30th of December, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, I was passing along the Strand, and saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's shop in a very suspicious manner, stopping down with the coats under his arm. I suspected he had stolen them, followed him, and told him to take them back from where he took them. He asked for what? came back with me, and said I might take them back myself; just before he got to the door he threw them down. I collared him, picked them up, and took them into the shop with him; I merely pushed him into the shop, and asked the prosecutor if he had lost anything? I gave them to him, and said the prisoner had taken them - I then left the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anybody with him - A. There was a man near him - I live with my father, who is a coachmaster.</p>
               <p>JAMES HOWES. I took the prisoner and coats in charge at the prosecutor's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never begged the prosecutor's pardon; I saw a boy come out of the shop, and drop them - I never touched them.</p>

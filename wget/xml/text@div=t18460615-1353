At twelve o'clock at night, on the 7th of June, I met the two prisoners on Tower-hill—they fell up against me, nearly knocked me down, and began to rifle me about—I had a lot of flowers in my hand, and had a hard matter to keep them from taking them—Burke had her hand in my left hand waistcoat pocket—I pulled it out and held her tight—I put my hand into my pocket and found 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was gone, I had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. left-in five or ten minutes a policeman came up, and I gave both the prisoners in charge—Shacklewood stood by all the time-my money was safe a quarter of an hour before.</p>

               <p>my apprentice—he had the use of my tools to work on my premises—I lost tools from time to time, and obtained a warrant to search his lodging, at No. 41, Union-street—I knew his workshop and his sleeping-room—he was present when the search was made—we found a great number of tools, some of which I can speak to—he had no permission from me to carry my tools to his lodging—he never did any work for me at his lodg<lb></lb>ing—when I found the tools, he pretended some of them were his, and some he acknowledged were mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you receive 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. premium with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—his apprenticeship expired on the 6th of May, or about then—I did not request him to stay with me as a weekly servant—it was his own wish, and I consented—James Ezekiel Clark is in my em<lb></lb>ploy—I had a paper made out of the prisoner's lost time while he was my apprentice—I believe this is the statement—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—his wages were to be 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, as a journeyman—did not demand of him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said that was the amount of his lost time, if he felt disposed to make it up to me—he is a very fair workman, for a young man—he is fit to go into any shop—he had been in the habit of working over-hours, before his apprenticeship expired, in my shop, and very likely in his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you presented this statement to him did he say, "Why, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., you might as well make me your apprentice again, you know I was never absent except I was ill?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He could not say so rightfully and with justice, because he was absent a great many days—I will not swear that he did not say so—I showed this paper to his father—I did not refuse to pay his wages on the first Saturday night, on account of this being due to me—I paid him at once—I did not bring the statement forward on the second Saturday night—I never pressed the "thing—there was one paper presented to him, and one to his father, I believe—I have his indentures now; but I told his father he should have them at any time—I did cer<lb></lb>tainly refuse to deliver up the indentures on the day the prisoner first demanded them, when his time was out—they expired about the 6th of May, and he continued to work till about the 22nd—I know Thomas Skipper, but am not acquainted with him—he is no relation or connexion of mine—he may be a distant relation—I believe I saw his wife yesterday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you employ Skipper to go to the prisoner's premises before you obtained a search warrant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He pointed out the premises to Sadler, a nephew of mine, before I got the warrant—he is not here—I do not know that Skipper has absconded from a charge of felony—I cannot say when I saw Skipper last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, have you not yourself sold the prisoner tools? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I never took any money for tools from him in my life—I never sold him any tools—I never sold him a lot of tools for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the presence of a man of the name of Speechly—I never sold any to any person living—it was perhaps a month before the prisoner was taken that I saw Skipper—I never took particular notice.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, did you not see Skipper on the very morning upon which you took the prisoner into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I saw his wife yes<lb></lb>terday in the neighbourhood of the Borough—I met her by accident—I do not know whether it was by accident or not—I did not send for her—I do not think I saw her the day before—I have not seen her every day for the last ten days—I have seen her once or twice this week—I do not know her that Skipper has run away—I have reason to believe it, when I</p>

               <p>see this paper (the "Hue and Cry Gazette")—I have not inquired what he had done—I care nothing about it, I have enough to do with my own business—I have been told that he had been assisting the prisoner in some carpenter's work that he was doing while in my service—I believe he as<lb></lb>sisted him to do some jobs, that is all I know—my nephew told me so—I swear I never sold the prisoner any tools—my nephew went with Clark and Skipper to the prisoner's place before the warrant was issued—the prisoner was in the habit of using my tools to work over hours in my em<lb></lb>ploy during his apprenticeship—I never permitted my workmen to take home some of my tools to work with in over hours, to the best of my recollection—I believe I could safely swear that—I never permitted my apprentices to do so as well as my journeymen—I do not know of the prisoner having bought any tools of a Mr. Palmer—(<hi rend="italic">examining the property</hi>)—I believe these two castings came off my pattern—I have every reason to believe they came from my shop—this is a coal chisel, or more properly, a cast-steel chisel—the name has been hammered out, but I think I can see where the name has been hammered out—it is made exactly the same as we make our chi<lb></lb>sels—this is made out of a cast-steel bar—I mean to swear to this from my belief that my name has once been on it, and is now hammered out—this other chisel has my name on it—here is another article has my name—these other tools I can swear to, but they are not all named—I have thousands of tools in my shop that have no name on them—I can swear to them by having them so many years in my use, and I can bring the re<lb></lb>mainder of the nuts and tools to fit them—they are not made of one size—these nuts would fit on the tools that I have—those tools that I can swear to, are of very little value without the other portion of the tools.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not on Skipper, your nephew, and Clark's information that you took the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My nephew pointed out the place—I took the prisoner from finding the tools—I got the warrant, as I had strong reason to believe he had been robbing me a long time—I discovered the place through my nephew, who is not here to-day, he is very particularly en<lb></lb>gaged putting up a steam-engine—Skipper did not come to my house to my knowledge after he had been to the prisoner's—I did not see him to my knowledge—I went out—I cannot say whether I saw Skipper or not—I did not employ him to go there—I did not know of his going before he went—I must know it certainly before we got to the place—I was informed he could point out to me where he thought there was something going on wrong—my nephew told me that—I did not send Skipper to the place—I did not go with him—he said he had been employed there by the prisoner—I never saw Skipper there—he told me he knew where the place was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear he did not tell you he had been there and seen some tools? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not swear it—I said to the prisoner, "George, you know we have for a long time been robbed of a great many tools"—he said, "I know you have, master"—I said, "If you have no objection we will walk to your premises"—he said he had no objection, and we went part of the way—Clark and my foreman were in company—the prisoner said, "I will go with nobody but you"—he walked with me to Union-hall, that was after I got the warrant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not on Skipper's information that you would find some tools at the prisoner's that you got the warrant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner give you up the keys of his shop before you got the warrant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, alter—he gave them up to the officer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170293"></xptr>
               <p>—we walked together till we came to the office—I said to him, "Wait here"—Clark and Sadler saw that he did wait there—I fetched the officer out and the warrant—he waited, but I suspect the others would not have let him run away—I told them (but not in his hearing) not to let him go—I did not wish to hurt his feelings—I did not wish to lose him, nor did I wish to lose my tools, but I have lost some scores of pounds' worth—when the officer came, the prisoner took us to the place where the tools were—I do not know what has become of Skipper—I know nothing about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did it not occur to you that your distant relation might have put some of these tools there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not ask him—I have no reason to know whether he did or not—the prisoner's workshop is not above half a mile from my place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was the last application on your part, when you told the prisoner you thought him bound to make good the time he had lost during his apprenticeship? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say whether it was just before he was out of his time, or after—the account is 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was about the 22nd, I think—that was the day I got the warrant—I do not think that I ever heard of any tools of mine supposed to be on the prisoner's premises till about the 22nd—it was the same day—I do not remember that I had heard it before—Clark did not give me any information—the prisoner said it was a hard thing for him to work to make that up, and I said it was a hard thing for me to lose it—I said to his father, "I shall give him up his indentures"—I left it to himself—I gave him a chance of working it out if he chose—he did not choose—I never demanded the money of the father—I had the account made out to show his father the time he had lost, and to see whether it was not right that he should make me some remuneration for it—I thought it good to let him know, and his father also, the time he had lost in my service, not taking into account any holidays or illness, but just working time—Clark made out this account—I certainly knew the prisoner had been absent when he first demanded his indentures—I have been losing tools for three years, but till the 22nd of May, I never took any steps to see whether he had them—I had very great reason to suspect him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that you took any step against the prisoner till you were foiled in this application? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not prove it before—he had been suspected a long time—it was about the 22nd of May that I was told I should find tools at his lodging—I did not set up any claim against him till he had asked for his indentures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say, after the indentures were de<lb></lb>manded, that you would make an example of him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I should be as ham to make that remark.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is barge-toaster to the Waterman's Com<lb></lb>pany, and a fellowship-porter—a lad whom I brought up is in the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's service—I don't know the prisoner, I never saw him but once—I know Mrs. Cook and Mrs. Newland—I know the witness Clark very Well—on the 5th of June I met him and walked to the house of Mrs. Cook—Mrs. Newland was at that house—the prisoner being in custody, was the subject of conversation—Clark said he was quite aware of the prisoner haying taps and dies, that he had lent them frequently to him, and he had brought them back again—he said he was aware of his having knife-shanks, and Mr. Sadler had frequently lent him tools to work with—he said, "If we don't get Batchelor transported for fourteen years, I shall be out of employ and Sadler will have nothing to do."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Cook, a lighterman—on Wednes<lb></lb>day, the 5th of June, Sophia Lewis came to my house with Clark, about ten minutes after one o'clock—Elizabeth Newland was there—the discourse turned on a young man of the name of George Batchelor, being in prison—I never knew him nor the prosecutor, in my life—Clark said he was aware that the prisoner had had taps, and dies, and other tools, and he had frequently lent them to him, and he had brought them back—he said he was aware of his having had some knife-shanks, for Mr. Sadler lent the journeymen and apprentices tools to work with, and he said, "If we don't get him transported for fourteen years, I shall be out of employ, and Sadler will have nothing to do"—I was so shocked, that I wrote to the prisoner's father, (I did not know the address, till Clark gave it me,) and after doing that I went to Mr. Humphrey's office, and stated this.</p>

I am an acquaintance of Rose Cook's—I was at her house on Wednesday, the 5th of June—Mrs. Sophia Lewis came in and Clark—I did not know Clark before, I never saw him—I do not know the prisoner, I never saw him in my life—the discourse turned on the subject of the imprisonment of a young man of the name of Batchelor—Clark said he was quite aware of his having taps, and dies, and knife-shanks, and several other tools—that they were frequently lent him, and his master was not averse to it, provided he brought them back, and that James Sadler was aware of it—he had lent them several times as well as he had, and if he was not transported out of the country, Mr. Sadler would lose his connexion, and he would be out of employment.</p>

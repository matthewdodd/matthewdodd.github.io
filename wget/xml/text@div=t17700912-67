             the evidence to be concerned; I search'd after him; he came to my house; he said that he heard I suspected him, and he came to clear himself. I told him I did suspect him: he said then he would go to Justice Girdler immediately, and turn evidence; he went and surrendered himself, and was admitted an evidence. I went to see Dixon in the Compter, who was taken up on suspicion of another robbery; he had a pair of my silk stocking breeches on, one of my shirts, a pair of stockings, and a linen apron. I went to get an order from an alderman, to take Dixon before Justice Girdler; when I went back again to the Compter, he had changed my cloaths, by the direction of the accomplice Herbert. We searched Burrell's house in Coleman's Alley, Bunhill-row; he gave me the key of his box; there I found two shirts, two pillow cases, a piece of sattin cloak, and a single stocking. Burrell and Barton lived together as man and wife; they were both present. I search'd Mary Johnson's lodgings in Henry-street, Old-street, on Friday; she was there at the time; I found there two dimity petticoats, and the scissars, with the brass hook; we found them in a cupboard with a great many lumbering things upon them.</p>

When the watchman went by, we struck a light at the corner of Normond-street, and went in. I had the flint and steel, and one of them carried the tinder. I can't say which. Dixon and Wood went in. They put up the goods, and then they blowed the candle out, and came out. Wood and I took a bundle a-piece, and Dixon carried the tea-chest, which, before we had got far, we threw away. We took the bundles to Mary Johnson's lodgings. I pushed open the door; the lock was very slight, and in a little time we awaked her; and when we awaked her, she was frightned. The street-door is left open, and her's is the first room. She desired we would take the things away. We told her, we would not go till five o'clock in the morning. She went to work between five and six next morning. We left the things in the room till dark; then we went and fetched them away. Two petticoats dropt out; I kicked them under the bed.</p>
               <p>Court. This story may be true. - I desire you will tell me the truth, the whole truth. You are not to say any thing that is false to screen any body; it will be dangerous for you to tell me any thing that is false. You say she went out between five and six to work?</p>
               <p>Herbert. Yes, I left the things there and came back again at night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time?</p>
               <p>Herbert. About nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she at home then?</p>
               <p>Herbert. No; she was just by the end of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave them?</p>
               <p>Herbert. They dropt out of a pillow-case, and I kicked them under the bed; I would not stay to pick them up. We carried two of the bundles and threw them over into Mr. Burrell's yard. I did not see any body there to receive them. I saw

             the next day about three o'clock in the afternoon. He said, he had sold the things for fourteen shillings, and gave me four shillings and six-pence of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cohabit with either of these women?</p>
               <p>Herbert. No; not at the present time.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the way to Johnson's lodgings?</p>
               <p>Herbert. I had not been with her a good while; I had been ill in the workhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Johnson again after the evening you took away the things?</p>
               <p>Herbert. I did not see her for a day afterwards; I believe I did not go to her lodgings after I fetched the things away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see her afterwards?</p>
               <p>Herbert. I saw her pass by the top of Whitecross-street once; I did not speak to her to have any conversation with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no conversation with her?</p>
               <p>Herbert. I had no conversation with her after the time I put the petticoats into the cupboard, after I carried the things away.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just now, that you had no conversation with her after that; did you stay all night?</p>
               <p>Herbert. I fell asleep in the chair; I was in liquor. I got up about four in the morning, and came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you took the two dimity petticoats from under the bed?</p>
               <p>Herbert. Yes; and threw them into the cupboard among the foul things.</p>
               <p>Q. And she saw nothing of the matter?</p>
               <p>Herbert. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Give the jury a reason why you put these petticoats into the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Herbert. With intent to fetch them away. I was afraid of Dixon's turning evidence, and I went to the prosecutor; I told him that I had these petticoats.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you put them there?</p>
               <p>Herbert. I did not do that. I told him I had them under my own care. We went to the Crow and had a pot of beer directly, and he gave me the four shillings and six pence; that was Tuesday. We parted then, and I saw them no more till taken. Wood was with them at the same time.</p>

               <p>I had two of this accomplice's companions taken up about two years ago; he came to me, and said, what makes you do such a blackguard action as that? and he said he would make me suffer for it. Last Tuesday se'ennight he said, do you intend to appear against these two chaps? he swore I should not, and punched my face; I lick'd him well; he swore he would have my life, and he had me taken up; I had the same things upon me then as I have now, excepting the apron, and that they took from me one night when I was asleep. I had none of his things on at all.</p>
               <p>Burrell's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went to Kingston, to fetch Elizabeth Barton; we came back about eight or nine at night; I went to bed about half after ten, and she too: she got up first in the morning, which is uncommon, and went into the yard; the yard is common to other people as well as me. She called out and said, here are some dirty things in the yard; I bid her bring them in; I did not know what they were, they were so dirty; there were these two shirts; the stocking was clean, the pillow cases were dirty, they were dirty with street mud; she wash'd them next day; these two shirts were dry first; I put them by, and said if any body owns them, they shall have them; they hung upon the line; when the prosecutor came on Thursday, I said he had the most right to them, and I made no objection to their taking them.</p>

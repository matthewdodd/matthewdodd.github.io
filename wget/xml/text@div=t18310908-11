            . I am a potter, and live at Lambeth. On Friday, the 22nd of July, in consequence of information which I received, I went with Lawrence to Dean's-yard, Wentworth-street, Whitechapel; I do not know the number of the house - I saw the prisoner

I said, "Is them things all right?" he directly jumped off his chair, and he had something between his legs in his lap: it seemed like chalk - he chucked it out of window, and said,"I don't live here, now I have done you:" he put himself in an attitude to fight - he took a mallet off the floor, and said to Lloyd, "If you don't let me go I will knock your brains out;" we had a bit of a skirmish - I took the staff out of my pocket, and we took them into custody - we found in the room some half-crowns, some pewter spoons cut up, and a band to put round the plaster, to form moulds with; I found on the mantel-piece two half-crowns, and a shilling - I believe in all twelve or fourteen half-crowns were found; I gave the two half-crowns and the shillings into Lloyd's hands.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You are a potter, where do you live? A. At No. 1, Lambeth-butts<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080015"></xptr>- the pottery is in High-street, Lambeth; Mr. Walter is the master - I am a journeyman; I did not work for him at the time I took the prisoners; he keeps a pottery, and makes pots; I do not know that I have worked for him above once before, and that was about two years ago - I am working for him now when I am at work, and I have worked for other masters; I did a day's work for Mr. Walter the day before yesterday - I have been taken into his regular employ since this affair; I have worked for Mr. Denew, in Ferry-street - it is four months ago since I was regularly employed there; I cannot say what month it was- I swear I worked for him in April as a regular servant; I think it is about four months ago that I left him, because he was slack of business - I had a guinea a week; I have a wife.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you do for the two months before the 22nd of July, up to that day? A. I used to get jobs where I could - I worked for Dalton and Watts, in High-street, Lambeth; I did several days work for them between the time of my leaving Denew and going to the prisoner's - I had a whole week's work there, and I have worked at getting clay out of barges by the water side; I have supported myself by my own work as a potter - I was not in want of money, not to be distressed; I had money at home which I had earned by working as a potter - Lawrence is a fishmonger; I have known him in Lambeth, I suppose, six or seven years.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you first to go with Lawrence? A. I was desired by Gollocker to assist in taking him - I expect nothing but my expences; I did not go for the purpose of making money by it - I have not been told any thing about what I am to receive, nor that I am to receive any thing; I do not expect to be paid more than for my loss of time -I was never in trouble myself; I was never at the place till Lawrence took me - I went with Lawrence; he gave the order for the money - I afterwards went and took them; Forecast was not there the first time I went - I saw Forecast put the metal into the pipe; I went to take them, not to entrap them.</p>

            . I live at No. 23, Lambeth-butts. I know Gollocker - he is a parish constable; he asked me to go to the prisoners' lodging - I said I would; I accompanied Brummitt on the 22nd of July - I had seen Brummitt twice before; when we got there we went up into Bagley's room, and I asked if he had any half-bulls, meaning half-crowns - he said No, and asked what I should want; I told him I should want a score of half-bulls and a score of garter-bobs, which means shillings, and a score of plain, which means plain shillings that have not got the garter round them - I asked him how long they would be before they were ready; he said he would have them ready in an hour and a half - we then went down, and went to the public-house at the corner of the street, where the officers were waiting; I did not go to the place a second time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.How long have you been a dealer in counterfeit coin? A.Since the 10th of June; I have been with Gollocker at times - I am not a dealer; I consider myself an honest, upright man - I have not given more than six or seven orders for counterfeit coin; I believe it is not more than five times - Gollocker is the person I principally go with when he calls on me; he never pays me, nor has any body else paid me - I expect to be paid for my loss of time, but as to any thing furthere I cannot tell; I do not get people to make coin, to entrap them, and then inform the Mint - if a person is introduced to me, I go and make a purchase of him; I never go myself, because I have no connexion with dealers in coin, except they are pointed out to me - Gollocker asked me to go to the prisoners'.</p>
               <p>Q. He asked you as a friend of his? A. He and I have been together many years on the watch - he was a patrol, I was a private-watchman; I am a fishmonger - I live by that, and not by following Gollocker; I have never received a halfpenny for this, and as soon as I go from here I shall go to my employ - if a person is pointed out to me, I make it my duty to go, if I am sanctioned by an officer; it is my duty to go under the patronage of the officer, and detect them - I was not acquainted with coiners, so as to introduce myself to them - Gollocker was waiting in the street while I went in to the prisoners' - he had been with me previously to the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be acquainted with the terms? A. It is language I hear them make use of - I ordered a score of half-bulls, &amp;c. in those words; I used those words when speaking to those sort of people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go there on purpose to betray them? A. I went to convince the world that they were the people they were represented to me; we knew of it a long time before - I do not entrap any one.</p>

            . I am a tobacconist, and live on Newington-causeway. On the 22nd of July I went to the prisoners' lodgings with Brummitt, Lloyd, and Hall - I followed Lloyd up stairs, and after we got on the first floor I heard a man say, "Who have you got there?" and at that moment he rushed down stairs - when he came down I seized him on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080016"></xptr>landing, and forced him into a room on the first floor; it was Bagley - when I got there another man was behind the door, and directly upon that the female prisoner and another man came round, and endeavoured to get him from me; I drew my cutlass, and said if he did not go up stairs I would cut him down - I forced him up stairs, and Forecast was sitting in the chair with Lloyd holding him; after he was secured, this tin dish was on the hob in the two pair of stairs room - there was a sharp fire there; two tobacco pipes were in the fire red hot, and full of metal - on the top of the ashes, under the fire, was this half-crown, which I picked up; it was very hot - on the table laid two pieces of metal, called gets; another get laid on the right-hand side of the fire place, and a three-square file and scissors on the table; a blue cloth on the right-hand side of the fire place on a chair, and on the table laid these pieces of new pewter spoons, cut up; on the bed by the side of a shawl lay these four half-crowns, finished - on the floor, by the side of a chair by the window, laid four more unfinished; in a cupboard, in the room, was this tin band, which they make the moulds with, and this knife with plaster of Paris on it - some wet plaster of Paris in a basin, and by the side of it a paper bag, containing a quantity of plaster in a dry state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The room seems to have been nearly ready to receive you? A.It appears like it: Gollocker is here - Lawrence goes with us both if we want him; I cannot tell how much money I have received in two years from the Mint - you asked me yesterday that question on a trial, and I told you if you had asked me to bring my book, I would; I have not looked at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you have not had 100l. in the last two years? A. Not within twelve months; I will swear I have not had 150l. within the last two years - my business as a tobacconist is very good, but I do not depend upon that; I have landed property - I did this out of regard to the laws; I am entitled to my expences - I have been in the habit of going with Lawrence about twelve months; I should think it is nearly as long - he was at Maidstone, at the Spring Assizes, and you saw him there; I believe that was the first Mint case he had, but I have known him about twelve months - when we send him on this business we can trust him, and he never deceives us; he does not get people to make coin that I know of - I do not think I have been paid any thing by the Mint for these twelve months; I have done business for them for the last ten years, but do not think I have been paid above five years.</p>
               <p>Q.Is there not one Perkins employed about coin? A. Yes, he came to us; I do not know of his having been convicted - I told you yesterday; I sometimes gave him a shilling or two - I will swear I never gave him 5l. - I mean to charge the Mint with what money I pay.</p>
               <p>Bagley. Q. Did you not put out your hands to stop me from going out at the bottom of the stairs into the street? A.When I first saw him he was coming out of the two pair of stairs room - he rushed by the witness; I stood at the corner of the stairs, and as he came by I seized him with my left hand - he never got down the stairs; the staircase is very narrow and dark - I pushed you into the front room; another man and that woman came into the room, and gave me a drive towards the window - I drew my cutlass, and you surrendered; you said you did not live in that room - I seized him at the bottom of the second flight of stairs, coming down from his room, not near the street door - the female prisoner and another man came into the room to us.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On the 22nd of July I accompanied the officers to the prisoners' lodgings in Wentworth-street; Brummitt and Lloyd went across the yard first - Myers and I were following them; I saw something come out of the two pair of stairs window; it fell on the ground, and fell almost all to pieces; it was like chalk - I took it up, and have it here - it was quite warm at the time, and I picked up one half-crown close by it, that was quite hot, and another at a little distance off; one of the half-crowns had the get to it - I then went up stairs, and saw Forecast at the top of the stairs, endeavouring to get away from Lloyd; I assisted in getting him into the room, and after the two men were secured I took off the table three pieces of metal spoon.</p>

            . I am inspector of coin to the Mint, and have been in the habit of seeing counterfeit coin for many years. I am acquainted with the materials coiners use - this mould is made of plaster of Paris; there are the two sides of a half-crown, of the date of 1817, impressed on it, here are also two pieces of what appears to be a plaster of Paris mould - it has part of the impression of the reverse side of a half-crown of 1817, the date is on it now - one of the half-crowns produced by Hall is finished, and the other has the get to it, as if just out of the mould; they are both counterfeits, and of the date of 1817 - I cannot say they are made from this mould, it being so broken; the two produced by Lloyd are both counterfeit, and dated 1817 - one is finished and the other not; the four produced by Myers are counterfeit, and dated 1817 - they are finished; here are four more produced by him, one finished and three unfinished; they are of the same date, but cast in a different mould to the others - they appear to me to have been cast in the mould which is perfect; in fact I have no hesitation in swearing so - there is an indented mark just under the chin of the whole four, and there is a corresponding mark in the mould; the moulds are made by inserting a good half-crown into the plaster of Paris - the unfinished ones merely require small particles of metal to be removed from them, which is occasioned by the mould not being closed; it is removed by a file or scissors - a spot or defect in the mould would appear in the coin; these are Britannia metal spoons, which is similar metal to the coin - a tin band is usually used to form the mould.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you call this half-crown entirely finished for circulation? A. Yes - aquafortis would entirely destroy it; I cannot say these smaller pieces of plaster of Paris have ever been a mould for a half-crown, because here is only part of the reverse side - whether the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080017"></xptr>obverse side was to it I cannot tell; I have no hesitation in saying it is the obverse side of a half-crown - part of the impression of this other mould is broken off on the outside- rubbing it together would produce that; the convex part of it is in a perfect state, but there are projecting parts in order that the mould might fit together in one place always, and those are off.</p>

I do not live there, but live in the same street - I went to the Star, and asked for a newspaper; they said it was out, and if I went to such a place I should get it - I went to this room, and asked two females for the newspaper; they said I should have it, and directly the officers came they took and threw me on the bed; a mallet laid there - I laid hold of it, and he said if I did not go up stairs he would cut me down with his staff - I did not see Bagley in the room when I went up; one of them says I threw the handkerchief out of the window; these men say they picked up the mould, but there was no handkerchief found - I believe Sheen can prove I was taken at the street door.</p>

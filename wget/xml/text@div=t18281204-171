            . I am a carpenter, and work at Mr. Matson's. On the 1st of December the witness came to the yard - I looked, and missed two pieces of timber out of three which I had laid out about five o'clock, and this was about seven; I went to No. 4, Harford-street, and found these two pieces, which I can swear to.</p>

            . I am a watchmaker, and have known the prisoner these ten years; he has been a clerk at Messrs. Everett's - he has very recently had a brain fever, and was very bad; I saw him several times, and twice when I saw him he was deranged - I have had an opportunity of observing his conduct since, and he has been flighty; he had borne an honest character before that, and his parents are most respectable.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Nottingham. On the 12th of May, be<lb></lb>tween twelve and one o'clock, I was in Billingsgate-market—I had a hand<lb></lb>kerchief in my coat-pocket—I did not feel it taken—I received informa<lb></lb>tion from a boy and missed it—the boy said he could point out who stole it—I followed him—he pointed out the prisoner, after running about one hundred yards—I did not see him running—I secured him and found my handkerchief in his hand—he said he found it—it was safe in my pocket before it was taken—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Billingsgate-market—I saw the prosecutor and another gentleman walking round the market—the prisoner and two other boys walked down the market, one after the other—the larger boy took the gentleman's handkerchief, and handed it to the prisoner—they all three wept down Dark-house-lane—I told the gentleman—we followed and took him—he said he had picked it up, but I saw him receive it from the other boy.</p>

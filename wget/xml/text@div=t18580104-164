On Sunday, 13th Dec., between 1 and 2 o'clock in the day, I was at a public house in Kent Street—I found the prisoner there with a friend—the friend spoke to me first, and said that he had bought a pair of boots at my shop; that they were very bad ones, but he was going to have another pair of me—he said something to the prisoner, which I did not hear, and then the prisoner said, "Oh, you are in the shoe line; I have six or seven odd boots; do you think you can match them?"—I said probably I might be able—he said he would bring the hardest boot out of the seven to show me—he went out, and came back again with a boot, which he placed</p>

                  </hi>. I am a City detective officer. I produce seven odd boots, which I received from Mr. Nathan—on Wednesday evening, 17th Dec., from information I received, I went with Nathan, and a police officer, to the prisoner's house, No. 277, Kent Street—he keeps an oil shop—I found him behind the counter—I asked if he knew Mr. Nathan, pointing to him—hesaid, "I do"—I said that we were two police officers, I was about to ask him some questions, which he might do as he pleased about answering—Isaid, "I have received seven odd boots from Mr. Nathan, and he says he has received them from you to make fellows to them"—he said, "I never gave Mr. Nathan any odd boots"—I said, "One on Sunday last, and six last night; Mr. Nathan says you were in his company last night"—he said, "Yes, I was, and had some gin and water with him"—I said he might con<lb></lb>sider himself in custody for receiving a portion of boots that had been stolen from Messrs. Ansell and Hobbs, of Gresham Street, City, on the night of the 3d, or the morning of the 4th of the present month—he said, after the caution I had given him, he should reserve his defence—I then proceeded to search the house—I found several things, but not connected with this indictment.</p>

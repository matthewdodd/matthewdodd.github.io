                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Potter, a tallow<lb></lb>chandler in Crawford-street—on the 14th of Nov., about six o'clock, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner at my master's counter—he asked for a penny candle—I put the candle down—he offered me a counterfeit sixpence—I noticed directly that it was counterfeit, and I bent it and gave it to my master—he collared the prisoner and took him to the station, which is about ten minutes' walk—I went with him—as we went along I heard money jingle on the stones—the prisoner was close by the spot—we stopped instantly, and I saw a boy pick up two pieces, which he gave to some person who I thought was a policeman, but found it was Mr. Potter.</p>

I am Swaine's master—I received a counterfeit six<lb></lb>pence from him—the prisoner was then in my shop—I took hold of him, and asked if he had any more of these pieces about him—he asked what I meant—I said he knew very well; and I asked him again if he had any more pieces about him—I then saw him in the act of swallowing some<lb></lb>thing, and he spoke indistinctly—I said I should take him to the station, as there was no policeman there—I took him—a policeman overtook me in Seymour-place, and I gave the prisoner to him—I was walking along, and saw the throw of the prisoner's arm, and heard money sound on the stones—we stopped immediately, and two counterfeit sixpences were picked up close against my feet, by a boy who placed them in my hands—I took them to the station, and gave them, to the officer; and the one which I took from Swaine I gave to the officer at the station.</p>

               <p>his master, who came out directly, caught hold of me, and held me till the young man put his hat on, and they brought me as far as Seymour-place; the policeman came and asked what was the charge; Mr. Potter said I had been into his shop, <hi rend="italic">smashing</hi>. They brought me to within twenty yards of the station-house door, and the policeman said, "Stop, I think I heard the jink of money on the stones."

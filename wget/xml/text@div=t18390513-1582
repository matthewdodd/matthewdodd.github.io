                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Elizabeth Oldham, a grocer in Hackney-road. The prisoner was in our service for two months—on the 11th of April the cash-box was up stairs in my bed-room, there was 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it in gold—I missed from it seven sovereigns, and some silver, next morning—I cannot swear to the quantity of silver—I missed some half-crowns, I should say ten or twelve—I had in all 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on Wed<lb></lb>nesday night I counted it, and put 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into it, making 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Thursday, the 11th of April, I went to the prosecutor's house, and saw the prisoner—I asked her if she had got any money—she said, "No, not a farthing"—I said, "Turn out your pocket"—she said, "I have not any"—I said, "Be cautious, I shall have you searched"—she made no answer—I sent her to the station-house while I went on other business—when I returned I had her searched—the sergeant produced to me a parcel of rags tied round with string—I cut it open, and found seven sovereigns and thirteen half-crowns in it—I said, "How is it you have got so rich all at once?"—"Oh," she said, "I picked it up in the park."</p>

Q.</hi> What did you ask her first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What had be<lb></lb>come of some other property that was missing—she said she did not know, she had not had it—I then asked her if she had got any money, and if she had any duplicates—she said no—I asked her if she had any money at home—I went to her home and searched, not particularly for money, but other property, but found nothing—the rags were sewn to<lb></lb>gether in the shape of a "bustle," and tied up, and the thread quite clean—I asked if any one saw her pick it up, and said, "Did you tell your mother and father?"—she said, "No; my father and mother, walked on before, and I did not like to tell them."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a searcher at the station-house.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you told all you found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she had no pocket, nor any thing; it was tied round her waist with a string—I cannot remember whether I found a key on her—I gave the policeman all I found—I gave the policeman the bustle, and she told me there was money in it—I did not find any picklock or wire or any key—the bustle was sewn up carefully, and twisted round with a string—that would take, I should think, ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>

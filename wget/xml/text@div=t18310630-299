            . I am a Policeman. On the 25th of June, a little after seven o'clock, I went into a public-house opposite the prosecutor's, and saw Duncan come from the shop, with three hats under his arm - he was apprehended by Hollings; I then saw the prisoner walking about the front of the shop, and saw Pattenden go into the shop and bring out three hats, in consequence of which I apprehended Honey - I had not seen him give Pattenden the hats, but they were in the shop together.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Have you any other name? A. No - I am a native of Maidstone; I never assumed any other name - I never went by the name of Randall; I am nineteen years old - some have called me Randall, as my mother was married to one Randall, but the marriage<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300136"></xptr>did not stand good; I have gone by that name sometimes- I lived with a Mr. Terry, in the Borough-market, and left him eighteen months ago; I have dealt in the market myself, and had a stand there - I have known the prisoner eight or nine years; I first saw him in London, about four months ago, and on the 21st of June he told me he was in the prosecutor's service - I did not go to see him on the 16th, 17th, or 18th of June; I never told him it would be easy to get me a hat or two - I never talked about hats till he mentioned it to me on the 21st of June; I gave information to Mr. Perring on the 23rd. On the 21st I was going to see the King go to the House of Lords; Honey showed me the house, and said he was in a regular gang of thieves, and had been so for a long time - I thought it my duty to let Mr. Perring know; I never bargained for four hats for 14s. - I was offered as many as I would take, at a crown a piece; I gave him 14s. for the three - he said that would do; I have received no money for this job - I received 16s. in marked money from Mr. Perring, and gave 14s. of them to the prisoner; I cannot tell how much I have received for myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When did you first propose to the prisoner to buy hats of him? A. On the 24th - I had told Mr. Perring of it on the 23rd; I was acting under the officer's direction.</p>

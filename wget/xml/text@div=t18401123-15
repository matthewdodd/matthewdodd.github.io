                  </hi>. My brother, Philip George Dodd, keeps the house, No. 25, Leaden hall-street, in the parish of St. Andrew Undershaft. On Thursday evening, the 5th of November, the prisoner came to the shop, showed me a gold watch which he had in his hand, and asked my opinion as to the value of it—I gave my opinion, and handed it back—in doing to the glass fell out—he said, "Never mind"—when he had the watch fairly in his hand, he retreated towards the back of the shop, and seeing a gold watch on a raised platform at the extreme end of the counter, he snatched it, made a spring towards the door, and ran out immediately—I followed to the door calling "Stop thief"—a young man followed him by my order—this is the watch—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it belongs to my brother.</p>

On Thursday evening, the 5th of November, I was on duty in Billiter-square, and hearing the cry of "Stop thief," I ran towards Billiter-street, and saw the prisoner running, calling "Stop thief—there he goes"—several people were about twenty yards behind him, also calling "Stop thief"—I immediately prepared to stop him—he ran violently towards me and struck at me with both his fists—I avoided the blow, and immediately seized his hands, not allowing him an opportunity to open them—I took from his right-hand these two gold watches—he said he wished he had a knife and he would rip my b—y guts open—he was taken to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller in Bishopsgate Within. On Thurs<lb></lb>day evening, the 5th of November, about half-past five o'clock, the pri<lb></lb>soner came and asked to see some gold watches, I think he said three or four—that he was going to Havannah, and wanted to speculate—I looked at him very hard, and asked what description of watch be wanted—he said something at a low price—I took out the lowest priced watch near me, being suspicious—I had scarcely given it into his hand, when a respectable look<lb></lb>ing man came in and asked for a wedding ring—I said I could not attend to him till I had served this person—he said, "Never mind, I will call again in five or ten minutes"—he opened the door very wide, and the prisoner rushed out as swift as he could with the watch, and the other after him—I went to the door, but by that time he had gone up Camomile-street.</p>

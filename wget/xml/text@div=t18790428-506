                  </hi>. I live at 12, Essex Street, Great Guildford Street—on 5th April, at 3 p.m., I was standing outside the Queen's Head, Great Guildford Street, and saw a pony and cart—three people were in the cart sitting abreast—the prisoner was driving at the rate of 10 or 12 miles an hour—I knew him before—it was a very fast pony—I saw an old lady crossing the road—I won't be sure whether the pony hit her, or, the shaft of the cart, but it knocked her down and ran over her; she was then about two feet from the kerb; she was crossing—she had crossed the road all but two feet—I saw two people pick her up, put her in a cab, and take her to the hospital—one was named Jones, and the other was a woman—she was bleed<lb></lb>ing from some part of her head—I stopped the pony, and Strange, who was in the cart, said "Barrett, you know me well, you let go the pony, I am all behind with my chairs now, if there is anything wanting for evidence you know where to come to me"—the prisoner was present—lie said nothing to me—I did not hear him say that he was very sorry—I think he had been drinking—Strange said to him "I was a fool to let you have the reins"—he did not pull up at once, he drove on for 20 or 30 yards, and then I stopped him—there were no other vehicles in the road—the cart went on again, and the prisoner went after it.</p>

               <p>the Magistrate—I said before the Magistrate or Coroner that after she was knocked down Mr. Strange's son drove on at the rate of 10 or 12 miles an hour, not that the prisoner did—I ran after the cart and overtook it—I can't say the prisoner was properly drunk—when a man falls down in the road then he is drunk—the prisoner did not fall down in the road; he was too drunk to drive a horse—I do not know that I said any thing to the constable about his being drunk—I did not say to the constable "He was not driving fast as he was obliged to go in and out; there were other things in the road at the same time"—I knew the old woman, she was a lodger of mine once—I do not know her son who is here, but I know another—we went down to Mr. Strange's house to see the prisoner on the Monday, but he would not be seen—I saw him on Tuesday evening, but not in the presence of Thomas Patten—I also saw him on the Sunday—I did not say "The best thing you can do is to square this job at once, and if you will I will bring the son round to you," what had I to do with it?—I, know Mr. Strange, the owner of the cart, but have not spoken to him since the prisoner was com<lb></lb>mitted for trial—he came down to where I stand with my goods, but I would not speak to him—he wanted me to go and drink with him, but I would not—I do not know that the pony is 14 years' old—I never looked at its teeth—it is a light cart—it was filled with chairs, and there were three men in it—I can't give a notion of the pony's height—I don't know that it had been driven to Richmond and back that-morning and the West End afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer of 44, Great Guildford Street, Southwark—I am accustomed to horses, and have kept them for some years—on 3rd April, about 3 p.m., I was outside my confectioner's shop—I nave two shops—I saw a pony and cart coming with three men in a row and some chairs, and the cart driving on its proper side; the pony was going rather fast, I should say 8 or 10 miles an hour—my attention was drawn to it, and I did not see the woman till the accident occurred, as I kept my eye on the cart; either the horse's head or the shaft knocked her down; she seemed to reel and fall across the road with her head towards the kerb to which she was going to—she was very near the middle of the road, but more towards the other side—I understood that she came from my grocer's shop—there might have been other vehicles in the road, but I did not notice—the cart went right across her and jolted, by the wheel going over her—I went up to her and saw Barrett holding the trap from 30 to 35 yards off—I had seen the trap I dare say 50 or 60 yards before it passed me, and saw it for 60 or 100 yards after it passed me—I heard no noise or shout—the prisoner did not get out at first when it was stopped, but he came back in a little time and came up while I was seeing to the woman, and then the cry was raised "There goes the trap," which was being driven away, the prisoner being by the woman—several persons ran after the trap and the prisoner went after it as well, quietly—he returned with the con<lb></lb>stable a little time afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The street is about 7 yards wide—the woman was more than 2 feet from the kerb she was walking to—she was struck by the off side shaft—I should say, at all events, she fell towards the kerb, not away</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187904280114"></xptr>
               <p>from it—I should think it was the off side struck her, but I cannot say, because the back of the cart was towards me, and the chairs in the cart obstructed my view to a great extent, but it was the wheel nearest the kerb which went over her—I think they were sitting much too forward in the cart; there was too much weight forward, which would make less leverage for the driver to control the pony—I did not hear any one in the cart call' out—I was about 50 yards from where the accident happened—the trap jerked, and then the pony started on again—I believe I said before the Magistrate, in answer to you, that I would not swear that the pony was going more than six miles an hour, and that if he had driven properly he could have stopped in time—I could have stopped, I believe—I believe he could have stopped it if the cart had been properly weighted—I did not hear the prisoner say that he was going for a constable, but I saw him with one afterwards—I saw Barrett and the constable and the prisoner talking together.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Moss Alley, Bankside—I was in Great Guildford Street and saw an old woman crossing the road—she had half an ounce or an ounce of tea in her hand, and I saw the cart coming along and the prisoner driving very fast—it was three or four yards from her when I saw her—some one in the cart halloed—she looked up, and before she could get out of the road the young man drove over her—he might have gone the other way if he had pulled the reins; he would then have gone past her—I saw no other vehicle but Barrett's barrow—the road was free for the cart to have passed her without touching her—it is a straight road—the cart went over her twice, and her hand was cut almost to pieces—it was the left-hand wheel that went over her; if he had turned the other way he might have saved her—I saw Barrett run after his barrow and took hold of the horse's head—the prisoner jumped off the cart and came and looked at the old woman, and I said, "Oh, you brute, you ought to be ashamed of yourself"—he never answered, but ran away, saying that he was in a hurry—I did not see him afterwards, as I helped to get the woman into the cab—she never moved or spoke—she was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not go with her—she fell 2 feet from the path, I think—I did not say before the Coroner or Magistrate that I never looked round before the cart was over her—I said then and say now that I only saw the cart for two or three yards, but yet I can say that it was going very fast—I said that if he pulled the off rein he could have got away, and he may have done so—I don't believe I said before the Coroner, "My attention was not drawn to the cart at all, but I will not swear it"</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 57, Great Guildford Street, South<lb></lb>wark—on this Saturday afternoon, about 3 p.m., I saw a pony cart coming. down the street at the rate of 10 or 12 miles an hour to the best of my judgment; I am not a judge of horses—I heard a shout of "Hie, hie!"—the pony was then about 10 yards off—there were no vehicles in the road but a costermonger's barrow standing outside a shop—I saw an old woman in the middle of the road; she seemed to look up and stagger; she was knocked down, and the wheel went over her—I picked her up and drew her to the kerb; she was insensible—the cart went on—I don't know who stopped it, but I saw Barrett holding the horse—the driver had, I think,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In my opinion he could have pulled either on one side or the other—he could have passed on either side—he could have driven between the near kerb and the woman—he was driving about three feet from the kerb—the horse was going more than as fast again as I could walk—I did not say before the Coroner that the horse was galloping very fast; more than 12 miles an hour—they asked me if the horse was galloping with four legs at once—I said, "No, it was not galloping, it was trotting about 10 or 12 miles an hour; the driver could have prevented the accident; if he had pulled up on one side or the other it would have saved the old woman"—I don't think I said before the Coroner that it was impossible for him to pull up between the shout and the accident—I said that he could not pull up in front of the old woman—I did not say, "Going at the rate he was he could not pull up at all"—the cart went on about 20 yards or 30 yards after the accident.</p>

I saw the prisoner at Bear Lane, and said, "I have come to make inquiries about the accident the other night; I want to see young Mr. Strange and the man who was driving"—he said, "I am the man who was driving"—I said, "You had better go to the station and see the inspector"—he walked to the station, and I walked behind him—he was detained there, and after going before a Magistrate was bailed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furniture broker of Hoxton—I was in the cart at the time of the accident—we started from 24, Gravel Lane, Mr. Strange's house, and were going to Finsbury Square to deliver some chairs; the prisoner was driving, and young Strange was also in the cart in the middle; the prisoner was on the right side and I was on the left—the cart was full of chairs at the back—we were ten or twelve yards from the deceased when I saw her crossing the road in a slanting direction—she had started from the other side when I first noticed her—a van was standing on our right, and she came out from behind it when I first saw her—the cart was on the near side, about 3ft. 6in. from the kerb—we were going at the rate of five or six miles an hour, and she walked on towards the cart, but in a direction slanting from us with her back to us—the prisoner and Strange shouted out "Heigh!" and if she had gone on she had time to reach the kerb in safety, but she made a stop when we were two or three yards from her; they both shouted and I shouted, but she took no notice, and the</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of the owner of this cart, and was in it on 5th April—the pony is my father's, it is 15 years old—I have never trotted it from Gravel Lane to Epsom in an hour—I took it from Gravel Lane to Richmond a little after 7 o'clock on 5th April, and got back to Gravel Lane about 10 o'clock, then started to Leicester Square about 10.30, and got back about 2; then we started to Gravel Lane—the pony was only out of the cart for half an hour between the journey to Richmond and the journey to Leicester Square—the prisoner is a friend of mine—he is an iron worker, and has frequently driven the pony for me—he has had experience in driving—we went on both journeys to deliver chairs, and had loads—we started before 3, and when we got to Guildford Street the prisoner was driving at about five or six miles an hour; we were in the middle of the road—a van was coming along the road, and the old woman came from behind it and crossed the road in a slanting direction towards the kerb and then stopped, and I shouted "Heigh! Heigh!'"—if she had gone straight across, or if she had not stopped, the accident would not have happened—the prisoner tried to pull up, but the near shaft struck her and she fell with her head towards the kerb—the cart went on five or six yards and then the prisoner pulled up and jumped down, and went to where she was lying, and did not get into the cart again—it is not true that he tried to run away until he was stopped by Barrett—I did not say to Barrett that I was a tool for allowing him to drive—I said, "You know where I live?"—he "Yes"—I said "If there is anything the matter you come down to our place"—he said "Yes," and I went on—I have been with the prisoner and seen him drive before—the pony was at a standstill when Barrett came up.</p>

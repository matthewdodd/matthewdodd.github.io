               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober? - A. No, I was not perfectly sober; if I had, I believe I should not have been in that situation; I had been drinking both in the afternoon and evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there no circumstance from which you can guess when she took it? - A. No; I missed it, but did not discover how it was gone.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable of Langbourn Ward: On Thursday the 16th of this month, being officer of the night, between twelve and one on Friday morning the 17th, the prisoner was brought in by the prosecutor, he said she had robbed him of his purse; she denied it; I asked her to give me the purse; and she said she had not seen any purse; I told her to pull off her petticoat and her stays; she still persisted that she had not got it, and Mr. Thornton would have it that she had; the woman being almost naked, I ordered them all out, that I might search her more closely; I put my hand, and was working my fingers down her under petticoat, and the purse dropped from her; I saw it the instant it fell, close at her feet; (produces it); I have kept it ever since; there was in it a half-guinea, a half-crown, five shillings, and three sixpences; the prisoner said, hide it, for God's sake, do not let him see it; I then called out to the prosecutor, the patrol, and the rest of them, to come in; they came in, and Mr. Thornton said he could swear this to be his purse; I asked the prosecutor what there was in it; and he said he could not properly tell, but there was a half-guinea and some silver, and that one of the shillings was a new one; there is one new shilling among them; I then immediately took her to the Compter.</p>

               <p>Thoonton. This is my purse.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am an unfortunate woman: I went with the prosecutor up an alley; he would not go into any house; and he wanted me to oblige him; and I being an unfortunate woman, naturally wanted the money first; he was to give me two shillings; and he said if I was afraid, I should have his purse to hold till I had obliged him; and when I had obliged him, he directly charged the watchman with me. <rs id="t18001029-15-verdict90" type="verdictDescription">

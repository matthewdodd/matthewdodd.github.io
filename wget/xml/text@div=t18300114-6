            . On Monday, the 21st of December, I saw the prisoner on the road from Pinner to Rickmansworth, on this horse; he asked me the way to Amersham, and how far it was - I said fourteen miles; I told him he had a shoe off, and the horse would be crippled<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140011"></xptr>unless he had one put on - he said he would get one at the next blacksmith's; I said it would be crippled, and left him - I afterwards heard he had been offering the horse for sale; I then saddled my horse, and overtook him on the road from Rickmansworth to Amersham - when I came up to him he asked if I could write; I said I could not - he said he wanted a direction wrote where he was going to take the horse, for he had lost his direction; I asked whose horse it was, and where he was going to take it - he said it was his uncle's, and he was taking it to Stoke; I said, "You have got a stont useful horse" - he said, "Yes, and I will sell him to you if you will buy him; I was to sell him if I could" - I asked what wanted for it; he said he was to make thirty guineas of him if he could, but I should have him for 7l. - I said I would give him 5l.; he said that was too little, but if I would give him the money there I should have it - I said I had no money with me, as I did not think of buying a horse, but if he would turn back with me I would pay him for it, and, as it was very cold, I would give him a little of my elder wine; he turned back, and went to my house, which is about a mile and a half - I gave him some wine, and sent for an officer; I did not give him the money - I gave him into the custody of Leach, who is not here; I took the horse before the Magistrate, who gave me orders to take care of it, which I did from Monday to Wednesday, when Froggatt saw and claimed it - it was the same horse.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM STEWARD. I am in Mr. Froggatt's service. I locked the horse up about a quarter past four o'clock on Sunday afternoon, in the barn at the farm, with two more - I missed it on Monday morning, at a quarter to seven o'clock; the door was locked - I saw it again at Edgware on Wednesday, in Wilson's possession; I have known it about nine months - it is the same, and belongs to my master; he was there, and claimed it - it had been taken out at the back door, which was bolted inside at night: I found it unbolted in the morning, but latched - the prisoner was in master's service; he was discharged on that Sunday morning.</p>

            . On Monday morning, the 21st of December, about half-past eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner and this horse at the Red Lion, at Pinner; he was standing there on the horse, and a great many people round him - a man, named William Oldfield, asked what he wanted for the horse; he said thirty guineas - the man said he had not got thirty guineas, but he had a 5l. note in his pocket if he would take that; he said, "I will, and will call on you in about a month - if the horse suits you can pay the 25l.," and if it did not suit him he would take the horse and return the 5l.: I went up to him after that, and said, "You have stolen this horse" - he said, "No, I have not, it belongs to my uncle;" I said,"Where did you bring it from?" he said it had been at Westminster three months to a gentleman on trial - the gentleman had wrote to his uncle to send for it, and his uncle sent him for it, and told him to be sure and sell it for what he could get before he got home; I took hold of the horse - he struck me with a stick, and rode off - I met Wilson, and told him the circumstance.</p>

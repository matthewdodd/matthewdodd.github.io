Upon this they began to make a strange Uproar. Upon which, I sent for my Master, who is a Common Council Man, and was gone to the Bell Tavern upon Parish Affairs -

Peggy, says he, its bloody cold, I fancy your Maiden-head and mine will keep one another warm. I told him I could not oblige him without a Present. Why, says he, I have not much Money, but if you'll oblige me, I'll give ye my Watch to pledge for a Guinea. And so he gives me the Watch accordingly, for he knew where I lived: And next Morning he comes and demands this Watch again, and gives me a Guinea to redeem it; whereof he had his Watch again tho' I ought to have kept it till he had given me the New Gown he had promised me - Besides he run me to sixteen Shillings charge in Coach-hire and Wine and Veal Cutlets for him and the Constable. And after he had sworn I had robb'd him, he told Alderman Brocas, it was a Mistake for he had found his Watch in his Coat Pocket. It's not the first time he has pledged his Watch to be obliged by me and by other Women too, for he makes a common Practice of it. The Jury <rs id="t17350416-24-verdict109" type="verdictDescription">

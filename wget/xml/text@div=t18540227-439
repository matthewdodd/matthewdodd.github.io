I keep a tobacconist's shop, in Rotherhithe—on Sunday evening, 29th Jan., about a quarter to eight o'clock, the prisoner came with another soldier for some tobacco—my eldest daughter served him; I saw him give her half a crown; she gave it to my youngest daughter, who gave it to me—I had not lost sight of it—I thought it was not good; and returned it to my second daughter to give to my eldest daughter to try it—she tried it in the detector, in my presence, and said that it bent—the prisoner was not present at the time it was tried, he had just gone away with the change—there was another man with him; and as soon as he saw the half crown bent, he left in haste; so much so, that he fell out of the door—I went out after them with the half crown in my hand, and overtook the two soldiers together, and asked them to turn back with me; and said to the prisoner, "It is respect<lb></lb>ing your passing a bad half crown I wish you to return"—his companion, with an oath, objected—they returned some distance, and then stopped and endeavoured to get from me—I kept them both, called the police, and gave the prisoner in custody, with the half crown—the other soldier was allowed to go—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it.</p>

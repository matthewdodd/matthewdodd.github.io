                  </hi>. I am a cutler, and reside in Han well-street, Seven<lb></lb>dials. On the night of 6th Nov. I went to bed about 11 o'clock—every door and window was fast, except the second floor landing window—it was shut down, and quite closed, but not fastened—there is a balcony to the next house and a person can get from there—I was disturbed about 4 o'clock in the morning—I got up, and heard somebody in the next room—my wife called out, "Who is there?"—I heard somebody rush down stairs, and go out of the window—I ran to the window, and called "Police!"—I dis<lb></lb>covered in the next room the drawers and cupboards all open, and seven shirts and other articles were gone—a number of lucifer matches were all about the room—this is my property—it was all safe the previous night.</p>

I was on duty in Great St. Andrew-street that morning—I heard the cry of "Police!" about ten minutes before 4 o'clock, I ran to the spot and saw the prosecutor looking out of the bed room window—I rang the bell next door and got admission, I looked about and found the prisoner lying down close to a chimney—I asked him what he did there, he made no answer, and appeared very sleepy—I found on him a pair of gloves, and three parts of a box of lucifer matches—I saw the lucifer matches which were in the house of the prosecutor, and they were the same sort as those found on the prisoner—a person could very easily get from the window on the landing to where I</p>

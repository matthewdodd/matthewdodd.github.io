                  </hi>. I was formerly in the service of the bankrupts Poole and Bryan, to look after the horses and as a kind of carman—on 13th August I received directions from Mr. Poole to go to Earl's Barton, and fetch all the work that the agent, Thomas Stone, had got ready, and take it to Kings<lb></lb>thorpe to Mr. Chapman—I went to Stone and received a large hamper of Wellington boots and half Wellingtons and Bluchers, which I took to Chapman's place at Kingsthorpe, and left them in the coach-house—on the 14th I went to London; I returned to Northampton between 5 and 6 o'clock on the 15th, and went to Poole's house between 10 and 11 o'clock—I saw Poole, Chapman, and Ventris; Poole gave me the keys of the factory and I received directions from Chapman, in Poole's presence, to go to the factory and pack as many fronts of boots as I thought would fill the van—Woodford assisted me—we packed from seven to eight trunks with Welling<lb></lb>tons, half Wellingtons, and spring sides—while we were packing them Poole and Chapman came to the factory, and Poole ordered me to load them in the van—Chapman gave me orders to take them to his house at Kingsthorpe; Poole was present then—I took them to Chapman's at Kingsthorpe—there are two roads to go there, the Kettering-road, and the Kingsthorpe-road—we went on the Kettering-road—that maybe two miles further than the Kings<lb></lb>thorpe-road or a little more—we got to Chapman's, at Kingsthorpe, somewhere about 11 o'clock, and left the goods in the coach-house at his house—we returned to Northampton that night, and paw Poole at his house, and we told him we had delivered the goods at Chapman's house—on the following morn<lb></lb>ing, 16th August, I saw Poole at the factory—Chapman, Ventris, and Woodford were also there:—Mr. Poole ordered us to go into the shoe room and assist him and Chapman in packing a lot more trunks of boots—we packed about twenty trunks—Poole was present during that time—we took them to Chap<lb></lb>man's house at Kingsthorpe, by Chapman's directions; Poole was present—we took a van and a cart load too—I drove the van, and Woodford the cart—we left the goods in Chapman's coach-house, where we left the others—we left the factory with the goods on Thursday night about 12 o'clock and got to Chapman's about half-past 12—the Kettering and the Wellingborough-roads, branch off at a short distance from Northampton, just against the toll<lb></lb>gate—I returned to Northampton on Thursday night, saw Poole at his house and told him that we had delivered the trunks at Chapman's place—he said that he and Chapman and Ventris were going to London the next morning; that would be the 17th—I saw Poole on the night of the 17th between 10 and 11 o'clock, he did not return till a late train—he gave us orders to be at the factory next morning, the 18th—on the morning of the 18th we took two van loads of solving leather, about thirteen bales, to Mr. Pearce's—it was then just getting on for dinner time—after we had taken those goods, the men were paid, and after that, in the evening, we received orders from Mr. Poole to carry all the work out of the office into the factory—we did so and after that Mr. Poole ordered us to fetch some trunks and to pack all the work in them—Mr. Ventris and Poole and Woodford were present—we packed six or seven trunks and received orders to take them to Mr. Pearce's warehouse in Dychurch-lane—we loaded the van and started with it—John Woodford was with me—we left the factory with the goods between 10 and 11 o'clock at night, and when we got across the Market-square, Ventris came</p>

               <p>up to me and told me that I was watched, and that I must give the watchers a good chase, and I went a little faster—we went by Dychurch-lane and took the van to Mr. Poole's house, and not to Mr. Pearce's—Mr. Poole was there and Ventris too—we got there at a little after 11—the goods were put in the stable, and I went home—on the 19th I saw Poole at his house, and he ordered me and Woodford to go down to Chapman's house, but not before night—we went at 6 o'clock on Sunday night and saw Thomas Chapman, who took us into the kitchen of his house, where we re<lb></lb>mained till 11 o'clock, when Chapman came to us and told us that he had taken a barn of one of his neighbours, and he wanted us to shift all the goods out of the coach-house into the barn—we removed twenty-six or twenty-seven trunks and a hamper or two, and left them in the barn—we finished about 2 o'clock next morning and then returned to Northampton, to Poole's house—Woodford was with me when I got back—the gate was left undone and the back door like wise—we went in and found Mr. Billing<lb></lb>ham asleep on the sofa, he is a broker of Northampton—we awoke him—he gave us some orders, after which we loaded the van of the trunks that we took there on Saturday night in the stable, Woodford, Billingham, and myself, and took them to Hartwell, which is a few miles out of Northampton—I never was there before—Billingham went with me, and when we got there we put the van under a carrier's shed—I do not know his name, but I saw him afterwards—we went into his house and had breakfast with him, and the goods-were unloaded out of our van into his cart—I returned to Northampton with the van, and Billing-ham came with me—the carrier's cart started from Hartwell after me and it went to Billingham's house at Northampton—when we got to North<lb></lb>ampton, I saw the carrier's cart standing in the Bed lion-yard, opposite Billingham's house—I did not see whether the goods were in it then—(<hi rend="italic">Jeffs was here called in</hi>)—that is the carrier—it was between 10 and 11 on Monday morning when we got back to the Red Lion, near Billingham's house—I saw Poole afterwards at his house, and told him that we had taken the goods to Hartwell, and that they had returned to Northampton—I accompanied the messenger to Billingham's house in October, when some goods were seized—I think it was the 29th—I saw some trunks there in one of his bed-rooms, covered over with cloth—they were similar to what I took to Hartwell on the night of the 20th, and I believe they were the same make—they were then empty—we found a lot of leather and Wellington-tops at Billingham's—the leather was in one of the top rooms—I did not see any skins fetched, but I saw them—the twenty trunks that we took to Chapman's house on the 16th might measure two feet nine inches, two feet six inches, and two feet three inches—they are made especially for packing goods—I do not know what wood they were—they were covered over and had tin plates at the corners—the twenty trunks I took that night were covered with canvas like this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have never packed shoes—I put all the tarpaulin on the trunks after the goods were packed—Foster is the person who usually packed them.</p>

               <p>against us—on 30th August, I received a message, in consequence of which I went to Kingsthorpe, where I found Poole—he said that there had been some goods seized the day before, from the premises next door—that was some rooms that Chapman had occupied—we were then at Chapman's house—<lb></lb>he wanted me to assist him to get them back again, and to see Mr. Dawson of St. Giles' Street, Northampton, an attorney—I was to bring Dawson back to Kingsthorpe—I went to Dawson's, and brought a message that he and Mr. Chapman were to go to Northampton to see Mr. Dawson about 10 o'clock or half-past, on the same day—after I had delivered that message, one of them, I cannot tell which, mentioned Mr. Cooke—they were both present—they said they had telegraphed to Walsall for Cooke to come up to claim the goods, as being the purchaser—they said Cooke would be a likely man to be sent for—I cannot say how far Walsall is from there—you are about two hours or two hours and a half going—you have to go round by Birmingham—that was all that was said at that time—Poole then went to Mr. Dawson's office with Mrs. Cave, his housekeeper, who had been present at the latter part of the interview—that was over the breakfast table—I did not accompany them—she was present when the conversation took place about telegraphing for Cooke, and that he was a likely man—I and Chapman then went to Northampton, and we went to Dawson's about half-past 10—Mr. Dawson was engaged—we waited some time and when we were asked up stairs, Mr. Poole was with Mr. Dawson, and nobody else—Poole said, in the presence of both Dawson and Chapman, that I must come up to London to fetch some boots—he told Dawson that I had been his foreman, and that I must say that I packed the goods which were seized at Kingsthorpe—I hesitated some time, and Poole said, "It is all right, there will be nothing at all the matter"—he said that Mr. Cooke of Walsall would be there as soon as he could receive the telegram and come up by the train, and we were to wait at Dawson's for him—I never in my life knew of any sale whatever to Cooke—I had never packed these goods—Mr. Dawson was to draw a paper up, and I was asked to sign it—I do not think any paper was drawn up then; not till the evening—Poole stopped there, he asked me to come to London, to Quilter and Ball's office—Dawson was present and heard that request—he directed me to go to Mr. Ventris and ask him for some books; a day-book and a small book, and to tell him that the goods had been seized that were at Kingsthorpe; and that they had got a man coming up from Walsall, named Cooke, to claim them—that was, I believe, said in Dawson's hearing—I went up to London by the train, went to Ventris, delivered the message, and brought back some books to Mr. Dawson's office—I got there about half-past 7 or a quarter to 8 in the evening, and found Mr. Dawson there, Mr. Poole, and Mr. Poole's father—I have not seen Mr. Poole's father in Court during these trials—I saw him last, I think, about a week after this affair took place—I delivered the books to Mr. Poole, who put them on one side—we stopped there till 10 o'clock with Dawson, and Poole, and Poole's father—I do not think anything was done to the books that night—I do not think Cooke's name was scarcely mentioned, because he had not come from Walsall—we stayed there to have a glass of wine together, and did not leave till 10 o'clock—I went again next morning, about 10 o'clock, by myself, and found Mr. Chapman and Mr. Cooke, they having come by the first train from Birmingham—I do not think Poole was there—I saw a paper that morning which Mr. Dawson had drawn up—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not it—the paper that I saw that morning was the one he had drawn up for Mr. Cooke to take to</p>

Poole and Co., as foreman, up to 18th August last; I know Mr. Fisher, traveller to Mr. Cooke, of Walsall, I have seen him very frequently at Messrs. Poole and Co.'s warehouse, in Northampton, soliciting orders. I recollect seeing Mr. Cooke himself there on 9th July last, as near as I remember; he was in conversation with Mr. Poole, and I understood, and was afterwards informed, that he had on that day purchased a last quantity of miscellaneous stock; on 14th July I was desired by Mr. Poole to assist in the packing of the stock so purchased by Mr. Cooke, which consisted of boots, shoes, patent leather, elastic uppers of various kinds, and leather, laces, silks, and threads. I did so, with Thomas Beard the carter, and they were in due form conveyed away in the van by Beard, as I understood, to Mr. Chapman's of Kingsthorpe, for Mr. Cooke; there were in all three van loads, and they left all in the same day; the last load left, I should think, as near as I remember, about half-past 5 or 6 o'clock, p.m.").</p>

               <p>Ball could not have been present without his knowledge—I suppose my son is 15 years old—he was not at borne—he had not been at home in the morning—it escaped my recollection: I remember now that he was not at home, because I was alone at dinner—I did not cook my own dinner; the same servant cooked it—she had the same opportunity of seeing Captain Poole, and I believe she knew him—I suppose she would have known perfectly well if Ball had been there—she brought in coffee and cigars—there were no pipes—Captain Poole smoked—the servant did not come up to replenish the glasses—I do not know whether she let my visitors out at night, I did not hear her do it—I shook hands with the gentleman from the Peninsula, and the friend of my old schoolfellow, and I believe my servant let them out—I saw my client next morning—I had never seen him before—he was not a schoolfellow, or connected with a schoolfellow—when I saw Cooke he em<lb></lb>ployed me—Captain Poole was present, and Mr. Poole, and, I think, Chapman—I produced one or two papers—there was a sort of an invoice with a receipt—Poole was living at Northampton, he represented to me that he had made a sale of goods, which were seized by the messenger, and which really belonged to Cooke—it did not occur to me to say that such a thing would be entered in some book or other—Chapman was the man who made the first communication, and Poole' afterwards—I did not ask him whether he had any entry in his books—I asked him nothing about his books at any time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, did you mean to go to trial without ascertaining whether there were any entries in Poole's books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, I did not ask any question about the books, and I did not think it necessary then—I have been an attorney 20 years, and I mean to say that, as an attorney of 20 years' standing, I commenced an action without any inquiry into the books—I heard afterwards that the books were in—the hands of the Bankruptcy Court—I made no inquiry about the books as a foundation to go to trial upon, and swear I had not seen them—certainly not—on my solemn oath these entries were not made in my office, and with my ink—Cooke produced some papers—I have no recollection of this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but this other is the document he produced to me; this one with the receipt to it—it purports to be a receipted invoice, signed by Poole &amp; Co.—Poole was present at the time—I did not inquire whether he had any entry of the transaction in his books—I asked Poole if it was so, and he said, yes, it was—I asked him what he did with the money, and he said he had given it to his father.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Here is, "29th October, 1860, I wrote to my housekeeper, Mrs. Cave, to-day, and told her to try and get Woodford to your office, so that you may make a handling of him;" what did you understand by "making a handling of him "<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, that letter has reference, I apprehend, to a matter of Admitt's—there were some goods seized of Admitt's—I never saw Woodford in my life till he was at the police-court, and did not know, who he was at all—I had never heard of him—this letter was written to me, and I put it among the papers and never took any notice of it at all—I was acting for Cooke, and it was represented to me that Beard was going to contradict what he had said in my office, add I recommended him to be given in custody—I know Mrs. Cave—I made no inquiry of her—I do not know what was meant by making a handling of him, no more than you do, perhaps not so much at all events, I took no steps in relation to it,—I suppose there was an inclosing in the letter, as he asks me to destroy it "in his presence"—it was a sort of receipt; a note of hand, or a receipt—it is among your papers there, the papers seized on my person—I presume this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have no recol<lb></lb>lection of seeing it in the letter—it was found with the papers—I cannot iden<lb></lb>tified it, but there is no doubt it is the paper—I dare say it is—I have no doubt—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Northampton, 9th August, 1860.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you the least doubt that it meant that if Woodford would give</p>

               <p>such evidence as was desirable, you were to give back that memorandum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The letter would bear that inference, but I do not believe I read it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>, When you get a letter from a client, or a material person connected with a case, do you mean to say you do not read it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I may have cursorily read it over, but I paid no attention to it—though it is an I.O.U. for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, I paid no attention to it—I knew it came from Poole—I knew he was in difficulties, and I put it by as waste paper—he had no right to write to me in that way—I did not assist him in his difficulties, nor was it my object—I think this letter was a most monstrous and injudicious one on the part of Mr. Poole—I did not write and tell him so—I told him so personally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You told me you had hardly attended to the letter at all, and did not know whether you had read it through or not; that you put it aside and never gave it a moment's thought? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I mentioned it to him, and he told me it was respecting Admitt's matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you actually had a conversation with Poole in relation to this very letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I recollect I told him of it—I did not ask him who Woodford was—he told me that certain goods, belonging to Mr. Admit, had been seized by the messenger, and that John Woodford knew all about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not tell me that you had never heard Woodfbrd's name until the proceedings at the Mansion-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This was about the same time—it was close upon it—the conversation with Poole was after 29th October—I never saw Cooke's books, nor asked to see them, nor for a copy of them—I did not ask him whether he had any entry of the purchase—I considered that the purchase was a legitimate transaction—I asked no questions of Poole or Cooke in relation to their books; I may have erred, but I did not think it necessary—I knew Cooke was at "Walsall—I asked him horn it happened that all the goods were at Kingsthorpe, and I asked him how he purchased them—I must have asked him how it was that they were at Kingsthorpe—I have no recollection what he said—the action was down for trial after the sittings in November term—I understood that they were taken to Kingsthorpe by Chapman's orders, as agent for Cooke—I asked him why they were taken to Kingsthorpe, and why they remained from 9th July till 29th August, and he told me that they were removed there for con<lb></lb>venience—Cooke told me so—I understood that they were removed for Cooke's convenience, to his agent Chapman's—I did not ask what the nature of the convenience was—I should produce the witness to prove the delivery of the goods, and the sale, and I made no farther inquiry—I heard from Poole that they were put into a barn at Kingsthorpe, in the occupation, as I understood, of Chapman, and that they were removed from there by the messenger.</p>

               <p>cannot think why it should he said—I say it applies to Beard, because the mail was coming down to me as ostler—it was a bit of nonsense on the part of the young man, no doubt about it—after I saw Beard I would not have anything to do with him—I saw him a day or two after he came—my traveller told me he was to call again next day; he did not—he said he was going to Birmingham—I did not know whether it applied to Beard or not; of course it must—I said the conversation applied to Beard, not the telegram—it must have applied to Beard—I don't think I have any doubt about it—it meant that Beard had arrived—I don't know why I should have telegraphed to Northampton that Beard had arrived—I can't give any reason—I cannot imagine why it was—Mr. Fisher, my traveller, saw him fist, and he gave him a note or something—I never heard of Simpson—my name is to the telegram, but my traveller did it, I did net know anything about the words he said in it; he brought it to me and I signed it, at dinner, and he sent it away—I may say I did not read it down—I would not swear I did not—I am not sure whether I knew what was in it or not—I did not know what was in it before I signed it—this is the first time I knew what was in it; I merely signed it, I did not know what was said in it—of course this is the first time I knew what was in it—I will not swear it, I may have read it and I may not; I do not recollect it—this is the invoice that I de<lb></lb>livered over to Mr. Dawson (<hi rend="italic">selecting it</hi>), I know the other—this is a copy of the goods I bought, and then, upon going down again on the Wednesday after I got a stamped receipt and got my money—they are in Poole's writing—I gave them both to Mr. Dawson—I explained to Mr. Dawson what I have explained here; I believe I said that the one was a copy of the other; I did say so—I did not receive both these at the same time—I received the one without a stamp first, the copy of the order—I received the first when I bought the goods, and the other when I paid the money—I did not buy the goods and pay the money on the same day, it was a day or two after, I think I bought them on the 9th and paid on the 11th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at that, dated the 9th, and you will find at the bottom of it, "Paid, at the same time." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That may be, because the 9th was the day I was there; it is possible Poole may have made cot this invoice on the Mine day and got it ready for me against I went down—I have a book<lb></lb>keeper, and there are entries of the transaction in my books.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to consult Dawson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because my agent had previously done it—I was telegraphed for—I do not know exactly which day it was that I arrived—I received several telegrams from Chapman—I think the one by which I learnt that the goods at Kingsthorpe had been seized, was about 3d or 4th September; I am not sure which—I can't say whether I was there on 31st August—I can't say whether I was telegraphed for on the 30th, and arrived on the 31st—no one fetched me—I am not aware that anyone fetched me—I am not aware that Chapman came and fetched me; he was there—I won't say positively that he did not come for me, and that I did not come back with him on the morning of 31st August; I have been in Northamptonshire so much during these two or three months—I remember the first day I saw Dawson—I can't say whether Ball was or was not present at the time I had the first interview with Dawson—I will not swear anything about it because I do not know that the man was present—I will not swear either way, because it would be wrong of me to do so—I explained to Dawson that I had the entries of the sale in my books—I had not got my books with me—I do not know that anything was said about showing the books—I told him the entries had been made by my clerk</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101070090"></xptr>
               <p>—I am quite sure I told him that, at least I would not swear I told him exactly those words; I should think it would be to that effect—Poole was not present that I am aware of; I do not recollect—I do not recollect whether he was or was not—the first person I saw on getting to Northamp<lb></lb>ton after the seizure of the goods was Chapman—I did not afterwards, and before I went to Dawson's, see Poole—Chapman did not tell me that Poole's books had been sent for to Ventris; nothing of the kind—I did not heir that they had been sent for—I did not see Poole's books; not at all down there; at least, I saw some books in Mr. Dawson's office, but I do not think they were account books—they were some of his own books—they were not open—I saw a book lying on the table—it may have been his own book for what I know—I do not know whether they were account books—they might be law books for what I know—I saw books there—a book was not referred to; no book was referred to me—I am sure I cannot say that no entry was referred to in any book, the time is so long ago—I do not recollect whether there was anything of the kind—I do not recollect Chapman having told me anything about the entries in the books, that they were all right—they were not referred to in my presence by Dawson that I know of—I will not say on my oath—I forget, if there was anything.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you, on your oath, whether that very book was not lying upon the table at Dawson's office, and whether it was not referred to in conven<lb></lb>tion between you and him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect, I can assure you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just look at the entries, because they have a material bearing upon your case; I ask you whether that entry, which agrees with your invoice, was not compared with the invoice in your presence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I beg your pardon; I did not hear that last part, I was looking at the book; you say the invoice and in the book.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you by it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> gave the order to deliver the goods to Chapman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But how came you by this order, that is what I want to know—this is your own order for the delivery of the goods, how did it come out of your possession into the possession of Dawson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not understand you.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let me look at your book 1 <hi rend="italic">A</hi>, It is the bottom entry on the second page—it is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let us see the entry in the cash-book (<hi rend="italic">it was handed in</hi>). Your entries in this cash-book do not seem to me to be in order of date exactly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; you will find, if you look through oar cash-book, that is frequently the case—our travellers were out, and received monies on certain dates and we did not make the entries consecutively—we make several entries together—the transaction of Poole and Bryan are all my writing—I should not say they were written with the same ink, and at the same time, a day or two after—I am certain that the entry about Poole and Bryan was written at the time I say, on or about 9th July—I can speak with confidence to that—it was written the day he gave me the document, the receipt—I am not aware that there is anything in the book to show that particularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That entry of Poole and Bryan is at the very bottom of the page, and turning over, there is no page or two afterwards filled up; are you quite certain that you wrote that entry while the two following pages were blank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I am quite sure of it (<hi rend="italic">the book was handed to the Jury</hi>)—I have the ledger here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I am certain that I made the entry of Poole and Bryan in the bought book on 12th or 13th July, I am not certain which—it is very probable that there may be a previous entry, dated 30th July—We frequently let our invoices run, goods do not come in for a fortnight or three weeks, and we do not enter them up until we get the goods—I do not know how this entry came to be made after one of 30th July, unless I had got the invoices to refer to—the probability is that those are entries of 30th June—the top of the page is headed "July," but you will find many things of that sort, if you look through the book—for instance, here is 30th and here is the 21st (<hi rend="italic">referring to the book</hi>)—these must refer to June invoices—I have not got them here to refer to—if they had not come into my hands previous to the 30th, probably I should not enter them till that date—I have no doubt these are invoices of 30th June, instead of July, and that they did not come into my hands until the latter part or middle of July—these figures refer to the folios in the ledger—here is the entry in the ledger—it is 30th July here—this would not be posted from the invoice, but from the bought book—I should take the same date that was there, therefore the mistake, if it was one, would run through the books—this "21" means July 21st—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186101070092"></xptr>
               <p>of course these would all run the same here, on account of being posted up in July—these figures are a reference to the number of the invoice—we have not brought the invoices here—this reference does not help me to fix the date—there is no reference to the cash-book in any of the previous entries on this page.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BEST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you explain what is the custom in your office in respect of invoices? What do you do with them when you receive them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are put in a clip similar to a letter-clip—they are put there as they come in—sometimes they remain in the clip a fortnight or three weeks before they are posted up—we do not sort them at all before posting—we enter them in the book just in the order in which they are in the clip, so that the 30th would be at the top, and the 1st at the. bottom—this invoice of the 12th I entered in the cash-book at the time, not in this book—I placed it among the invoices till it was posted, and then filed it; having the receipt it would not go among the regular invoices.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a furniture broker and general dealer and live in the Horse-market, Northampton—I had some dealings with Poole and Bryan in May and June last; this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) contains the account of the goods I received from Poole and Co. up to the 20th June—I remember Mr. Shepcutt coming to my house and making a seizure of goods there—those goods were a portion of the same goods that are contained in this invoice, something like half, or hardly half of them, I should think, according to my calculation—I had them all together when I made the pur<lb></lb>chase of Poole—the goods that Shepcutt seized were the same goods I purchased of Poole—Shepcutt took away about half; a portion I had sold; those he seized were a portion of the purchase—I never went with Beard on 20th August last, to Hartwell, to Jeff's, the carrier.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 60, Mayton Street, Hoiloway, and am a tallyman—the prisoner owed me some money—I called on her on 25th September, and she paid me two florins, which I put in my waistcoat pocket, where I had no other money—after leaving her house I went round the corner and looked at them, and one florin was bad—I ultimately gave it to Cain—on 2nd October I called on the prisoner again, and she paid</p>

               <p>me three separate shillings—I kept them in my hand, and directly I got round the corner I found that one of them was bad—I took it to the police-station and gave it to Bull—on 9th October I called again—Cain and Baker remained outside—the prisoner paid me two separate shillings and a sixpence—she said I need not stop now, but I might put it on the bill next week—I left and found that one of the shillings was bad—I showed it to Cain and Baker, and returned to the house with them and the prisoner was charged—she said "Why did you not bring it back and have another for it?"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been calling there to get my weekly instalments since April last—I have about 200 people to call upon on my rounds—I collect about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day, mostly in silver—I generally carry it in my trousers pocket—I have also called on the prisoner from 5.45 to 6 o'clock, after my rounds, so that I had all that silver when I called upon her—I never asked her a question about the florin—I am so in the habit of taking silver that I put it in my pocket quietly without noticing it—I did not go back to her on the first occasion—I waited to see if I took any more—I did not put it with the rest of the money—I kept it in my waistcoat pocket on account of it being bad—I had got bad money on Thursday for some months pre<lb></lb>viously—I put the money in my pocket and looked at it afterwards, and to see who I had got the bad money from—I was responsible to my em<lb></lb>ployers—it was so much loss to me—I did not examine the three shillings on 2nd October before I left the house—I had no more bad money that day when I got home—I did not communicate with the police before 2nd October—I believe the prisoner passes as a married woman—this money was for furniture for the house which I had supplied to her: a set of chairs, price 36a., and she had had some drapery in April—she paid me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I always called on Thursdays—the police-court is about a mile from her house, but I was only 15 yards from her house when I found the shilling was bad on the 2nd—I preferred walking a mile to going back to her house—the police accompanied me on the third occasion—I did not tell her the police were there—I kept the coins in my hand until I saw the police—I have never been a prosecutor before—I go my rounds every day in the week—I did not hear her say "If I have given you a bad shilling I was not aware of it"—she said "Why did you not bring it back and have another one?"—she also said "I made 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by pawning some things, and if I have I must have got it from the pawnbroker"—I do not recollect whether she mentioned Mr. Hornsey, of Stoke Newington, as the pawnbroker—I think the Magistrate said to the policeman or inspector "If you take my advice you will consent to the case being dismissed"—being a married woman she, was obliged to get a security, and was admitted to bail in 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. On 9th October I watched the prisoner's house at Margaret Street, Clapton, with Baker—I saw Johnson go in and come out—he showed us some money, among which was a bad shilling—she said "If I have given him a bad one I will give him a good one for it"—he said that she had given him one the week before—she made no reply—a man named Brotzell was there, who I believe was her brother.</p>

               <p>—I did not hear the name of Hornsey, of Stoke Newington, men-tioned, but there is such a person in Stoke Newington—I have been there many times—I did not go there to make inquiries in this case—I saw a man who the prisoner said was her husband—the Magistrates refused to take her own recognisances on the ground of her being a married woman, and she obtained a surety for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have no ground for saying that the man was not her brother—she may be respectable, but her connections are not—she occupied one room—there were several people in the house—the is only a lodger—I did not know whether her brother lodged there till I went there on October 9th—there was another constable with us on the Thursday before, when Johnson took the coin at a shop to get it tested—his name was Boon—he is dead—I do not know whether he went to the pawnbroker—I know that these coins are not from the same mould.</p>

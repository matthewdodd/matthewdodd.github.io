               <p>Q. On the 31st of October was you going your rounds? - A. I was.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the night was this? - A. Seven minutes after eleven. I looked at my watch at the present time I found her in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you observe the gates to be fastened? - A. The gates were fastened before the clock struck ten.</p>
               <p>Q. After eleven o'clock you came to the cart-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that a cart-house that is occupied by his grace the Duke of Marlborough? - A. It is. I observed in the cart the prisoner at the bar, she was covered over with one sack, and two were under her, and a pair of shoes and a pocket handkerchief were in one of the bags. I asked the prisoner were she came from, she said she was just come out of the country, and she was going to London to get into service. I then asked her how she got there, she said she got over the fence.</p>
               <p>Q. How high may this fence be? - A. About a foot higher than I am, about seven feet high, and a ditch very near a yard deep before the fence, between the road and the fence. I told her it was impossible for her to get over the pales by herself, she said, she did. I asked her whether there were any body else belonging to her, she said there was not. I insisted upon her getting out of the cart, and took her to the cow-house and bolted her in, and then I returned to the cart-house, where I took her from; after I went round every place and searched. I put up a ladder against the cart-house; as soon as I put the ladder up, I heard a rumbling at the top; I went up the ladder as fast as possible, and when I got upon the top, I observed two men at the further end of the gutter; I says, halloo! damn you, if you do not speak I'll blow your brains out. Before I got round they tumbled off the further end.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the lead? - A. Yes, it was all removed from the place where it had been at the top of the cart-house.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did you find it removed? - A. It was cut in small pieces, excepting one piece which was six feet long; the tiles were also removed from their place in order to take the lead off.</p>
               <p>Q. The tiles being removed, there was such an opening that persons being above might put the lead into the cart below, supposing there was a person below ready to receive it? - A. I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. You came away and brought the lead with you; you have the lead here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was the cart the Duke of Marlborough's cart? - A. Yes, it was in his cart-house.</p>
               <p>Q. None of the lead was carried away? - A. No, it was only cut and removed from the place where it had been, they had not an opportunity of taking it away.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen the prisoner above the premises before? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. What are you? - A. I am under-gardener to his grace, I was called up by the watchman to take these people into custody, if we met with them. In consequence of which I took the woman into my custody and locked her up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner? - A. I had, from about five o'clock in the morning till nine. I asked her how she came there; she told me she had been to see her friends at some village below Uxbridge, that she lived in London, and got her living by washing and mangling. I said, you have got very much out of the way, what time did you get into these premises? she told me at ten o'clock, and she was helped over by a game-keeper. Then I said to her, my friend, you must certainly know of the people being over your head when you was in the cart-house, you being so near them; she openly confessed that she heard them, but did not consider that they were doing any harm.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the woman by herself, from the road, have got over the paling? - A. I think it impossible for a woman to do it without some assistance.</p>

I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180512040048"></xptr>found a great length of the gutter had been removed, and a part of it cut in pieces; they must have got over very near that place, because near the orchard there are spikes on the pales.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 31st of October did you see the prisoner? - A. I cannot swear to the prisoner; just before the clock struck ten, I saw a woman sit down under a tree, by a pale, over the ditch at the outside of the duke's paling; she had a bundle and a little dog with her; I asked her whether she was distressed; she would not give me any answer; it was quite moon light; I told her if she was in distress I would give her a shilling to go to Brentford and get a lodging; I thought it was a pity that she should lay there; I said I shall not hurt you; she then said, no, no. A man came over the duke's paling immediately over the woman's head, where she was sitting; he took the bundle out of her hand, and helped her over the ditch; they had some discourse together; I wished them good night, and they wished me good night; they stopped talking together till I was out of sight.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not speak to the person of the woman, but whoever she was she had a bundle with her and a little dog? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Nicholas) Did you see that little dog? - A. Yes, the dog was along with the woman in the cart; I took the dog and the woman out of the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a druggist and lozenge manufacturer, in Aldersgate-street. The prisoner Bowes was in my employ up to the 9th of February—I lost some loaf-sugar—the sugar-baker puts a number on the paper it is in—they put no mark besides the number—here is the paper—the whole lot that comes to my premises was marked the same generally, particularly of this quality—the mark is altered every day—this is No. 56—I may have had several Nos. 56, I cannot tell—I lost a quantity of sugar market 56, I believe, but it is impossible to miss even a hundred weight—I have a paper here belonging to a loaf of sugar which came in at the same time with the same mark—it was a very fine quality—it cost 130<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a hundred weight—about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—the colour is the principal indication of the quality and its hardness, it is almost trace<lb></lb>parent, and very full of crystals.</p>

                  </hi>. I was on a visit to the prosecutor—on the 9th of February, about a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning, I was hid behind some hampers in a back place on Mr. Lucas's premises, and saw Bowes go into the suger-room and take a loaf of fine sugar out—he went into the powdering room with it—he party closed the door after him, so that I could not see what he did—he came out in about half a minute with a sieve in his hand and went into the shop—Thomas Lucas came to me in about a quarter of an hour, and I came out from behind the hampers—we could not find the sugar anywhere—he was not in the powder<lb></lb>ing room half a minute, and if he had powdered it the door was sufficiently open that I could have seen him do it—he does that with a pestle and mortar.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I took it into the hot room to dry. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I put the sugar outside the door while I went up into the hot room—there is a long passage, and if he was behind the hamper he could not see into the shop. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

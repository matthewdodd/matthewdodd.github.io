                  </hi>. I live at 80, Greenfield-street, with my brother—the prisoner is my husband—he left me on 11th May—on 15th Dec. I was at my brother's—about seven in the evening my niece told me the prisoner was in the parlour—I went up from the kitchen, found him there, and said, "Millisent, what has brought you here to-night?"—he said, "My legs"—I said, "Yes, I suppose so"—he asked if I had got his things ready (some linen)—I said I had not, but if he allowed me time I intended to do so—he said, "Because I have come for a settlement to-night, to clear off old scores"—I stood with my knee on a chair turned round towards him, and said, "Millisent, what do you mean?"—with that I saw he had got something in each hand, down by his side—I stepped, and said, "Millisent, what have you got there?"—he raised his right hand, I screamed, he said, "something for you," and instantly fired—it did not hit me—I screamed, and my brother came and seized him at the corner of the door outside—other persons came in and held him—I said, "he has got another pistol"—they were then both in his pocket—I took them out—he had called on me about three days before, and said he was going into the City, and would call on me coming back to settle off old scores, but I did not know what it meant—he did not come again till this happened.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not you sing out, "My God! he has got two pistols." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—my arm did not strike you in turning round, and make the pistol go off—I was half or three-quarters of a yard from you, and having a bad knee I kept it on the chair, which kept me in the same position—you rose your arm in a manner to come towards me—you pointed it towards me—you no sooner said the word than it was off—I did not know it was a pistol till it went off—I did not say to my brother, "Let him go."</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mrs. Millisent's brother. On the evening of 15th Dec. I was in the kitchen, and heard the report of a pistol, and my sister scream—I went up, found the prisoner in the passage, and closed with him—two or three persons came, and we held him while his wife took two pistols out of his pocket—I did not see them examined.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 23). On 15th Dec. I went to Greenfield-street, and found the prisoner, and people holding him, who said he had shot a woman—he made no answer—he was sober—Mrs. Cocking gave me two pistols—I examined them at the station—one was loaded with this gun<lb></lb>powder and leaden shot, and the other had been recently discharged—I found ten shot in one waistcoat pocket, and some gunpowder in the other, loose, and two stone marbles—in going to the police-court on Saturday the prisoner said he was very glad it had not hit her—I examined the room and passage, but found no mark of shot on the wall—there was a carpet on the floor—I took it up, but found no shot there, or any dent on the floor—the room is not papered, it is thickly painted—the piece of paper did not appear to have been used as wadding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I did not go to the house with any intention to hurt my wife; I have always told her since I left her that I never wished to hurt or injure her in any shape whatever; when I went in she sung out, "My God! he has got two pistols;" there was one in each hand certainly, and she turned round and struck my right aim;—it never rose high; if I aimed at her would the shot have gone down on the carpet, or the lower part of the wainscot? the fact is the pistol was intended for myself; I lived a miserable life; I have been robbed of my peace of mind through that vagabond that was a witness against me, her brother; he has robbed me out of house and home; it has distracted my brain; I have never been a man since, and never shall be; the only crime I have to clear myself of, is wishing her an injury; if I was to meet him to-morrow, and see the opportunity, I would never rest till I gave that man an injury; I will have my revenge of him if I was going to suffer for it to-morrow.</p>

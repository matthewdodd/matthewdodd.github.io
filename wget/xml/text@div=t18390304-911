                  </hi>. I am compositor to a morning paper, and live in Drury-lane. On Sunday morning, the 10th of February, about four o'clock, I went into the Antelope public-house, in White Hart-street, Drury-lane, went to the front of the bar, and sat down—I undid the clasp of my cloak, but made it fast by the ties, allowing it to remain on my shoulders—I wrapped it about me on the seat, and fell asleep—when I awoke my cloak was gone—I do not think it could have come undone by itself—I was not sitting on it, I merely put it round me not to crease it—I never saw the prisoner till he was at Bow-street.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 22.) On Sunday morning, the 10th of February, before five o'clock, I was on duty in Wel<lb></lb>lington-street, Strand, and saw the prisoner coming from Exeter-street, which is the adjoining street to White Hart-street, towards me with this cloak on—it occurred to me it did not belong to him, and I stopped him—I said, "Where did you get this cloak,?"—he said, "I found it"—I said "Where?"—he said, "A little higher up"—I said, "It looks very clean, it does not appear to have been in the road," as it had been a very blus<lb></lb>tering wet night, and the roads were in a dreadful state—I took him to the station-house.</p>

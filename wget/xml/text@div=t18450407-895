                  </hi>. I went with the prisoner to Chelsea on the 27th of March—he had a wagon and three horses—in going along he said, "I have been making a <hi rend="italic">young one</hi> this morning"—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "Have you been so long on the road and do not know that? I have been making a truss of hay"—we went on to the Bell, and he told me to give him the truss down off the wagon, which I did, and he put it into the stable at the Bell—we only stopped there while we gave the horses a mouthful of hay out of another truss—we went on to Chelsea, and there fed the horses out of the other truss, then took a load of dung, and came back—we called at the Bell again, had some drink, and fed the horses out of the other truss, the truss that was allowed for them—they never had any out of the <hi rend="italic">young one.</hi>

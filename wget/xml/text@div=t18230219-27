On the 5th of February, these notes were in my desk, which was in the kitchen; I had seen them safe two or three days before, they were in a leather case and put into the desk, which was locked; I missed them between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, a piece was broken off the front of the desk, and the lid forced open; I had no more notes there, than what I missed. The prisoner used to call occasionaly at the house. I had not seen her there that day, and did not know where she lived. I have seen a 5 l. note since, which I believe to be mine, and I have seen the three 10 l. notes, which I can swear to. The officer produced them. She was apprehended on the 5th.</p>

            , who appeared mistress of the house; she told me to come at nine o'clock in the evening, which I did, and saw the prisoner standing at the door; she went in very quick upon seeing me, and tried to shun me. I went in and found her behind the door; I told her she was charged with stealing 35 l. from her uncle, (Mr. Kemp.) she denied knowing any thing about it. I took her up stairs to an apartment, which she shewed me as her own, and searched her in Wayling's presence. I found no notes upon her; I said,</p>
               <p>"You have robbed your uncle before." She said, she never did it before; I neither promised or threatend her, she was much in liquor. I told Wayling to take her to the watch-house, and I searched the house. Parrott was out at that time. I put Eagleston at the door to take her if she came in, and bring her up to me. I remained up stairs with a girl who was in the house, and in about an hour Eagleston brought Parrott up to me. I searched her but found nothing. I told her (Parrott) I was still certain she had the money. She sat down on the bed and called God to witness she had never seen it. I was going to take her to the watch-house; she wanted to go down stairs to a young girl who was laying in - she wished me to leave the room; I refused, and she then asked the girl to give her the notes, she had given her to take care of; she handed them over to her; I caught hold of them; there were three 10 l. notes, which the prosecutor claimed. We took them to Bow-street, and went from thence in a coach to the Mansion-house, and as we went, the prisoner said to Parrott.</p>
               <p>"I never should have robbed my uncle if it had not been for you." (Parrott is between fifty and sixty years old.) She said, Parrott had said she owed her a little money, and she must get it somewhere or other, and that she told her afterwards, that she had robbed her uncle of the money; that Parrott had a son in Whitecross-street prison, and the notes were to be taken there to be put off, and that Parrott was to have one 10 l. note herself out of it, and that she had nearly the whole of the change of the 5 l. note.</p>

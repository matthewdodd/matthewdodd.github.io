               <p>Prisoner's Council. When you was desired to go you went to the house of Mr. Willett, then you gave the alarm of course to the servants, in the first place that you wanted to search Willett's house, and you wanted to know which was Allen's lodgings; and the maid then told you which they were, and you went into the room that Allen had occupied, and you found nothing; the maid told you that she had removed the things out of Allen's room, for the sake of accommodating the guests, and they were openly exposed? - No, they were locked up.</p>

               <p>Did he work at Mr. Hartley's? - No, I have a number of lodgers.</p>

               <p>Did any of them work at Mr. Hartley's? - I do not recollect at that time that there was any body worked at Mr. Hartley's house, there was some few days before.</p>
               <p>How many might they be? - I do not know whether it was one, two, or three; I believe it is near half a mile off, the workmen in course frequented my house, and several of them lodged there at times, sometimes they spent their evenings at my house, I never saw the bundle with Allen, nor in the bed-chamber.</p>

             lodged there, I know nothing of the bundle being brought into the house by Allen, I have seen the bundle in the room where he slept, in the two bedded room, nobody slept in that but himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What, did not one man sleep there? - Workmen sometimes slept in that room.</p>
               <p>You say you never saw Allen bring the things? - No.</p>
               <p>He never gave you charge of these? - No.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Do you recollect of telling Mr. Stevens when he came with a search warrant that that was Allen's bundle? - It was the bundle that I carried out of Mr. Allen's room.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon yourself to say that that was Allen's bundle? - Only that I carried it out of Allen's room, I cannot say it was Allen's.</p>
               <p>Did you ever tell Mr. Hartley that that was Allen's bundle? - I told him it was the bundle I carried out of that room.</p>
               <p>I ask you did you say it? - I said no more than what I say now.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say to Stevens that was Allen's bundle? - I said it was Allen's bundle that I carried out of his room, Mr. Hartley and Mr. Stevens were both together.</p>
               <p>Court. Take care what you say, do not bring yourself into the hazard of swearing a falshood, I ask you, as it will rest upon your testimony, I ask you upon your oath, and apprizing you that there are two gentlemen here who were present; whether you never told Mr. Stevens and Mr. Hartley that this was Allen's bundle that you took out of Allen's room? - I told him that it was Allen's bundle, because I took it out of Allen's room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. That is a necessary conclusion: How do you know it was Allen's bundle? - I did not know it was his, it was in the room where he slept.</p>
               <p>Then you only informed him it was Allen's bundle, because it was in the room where Allen slept? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you have, upon the oath you have taken no better evidence that it was Allen's bundle than that? - No, I have not, and in that room there were two beds, and workmen frequently slept there that worked at Mr. Hartley's.</p>
               <p>Court. I desire you will recollect yourself, did you never tell Mr. Stevens and Mr. Hartley that that was the bundle that Allen brought in? - I never did because I never saw it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Have you no other evidence that Allen brought it into the house? - No, my Lord.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230127"></xptr>Mr. Hartley. I wish to be understood to the Court, that I am no more interested in this prosecution, than your Lordship or the whole Court; I do not wish any evidence to be adduced, that is not fair and legal, but I do really wish to take notice of an evidence that appears like that woman, and I cannot help saying, that the declaration was positive; and Stevens will say the same; it was natural for me to ask Willett, how came these goods here, Willett says, I cannot tell, and he grew refractory, I said then, I will take you before the magistrate, upon the maid seeing I collared Willett, she said, Sir, this is Allen's bundle, brought in by him.</p>
               <p>Court. Your evidence will not establish the affirmative, if the woman takes upon herself to say positively, she did not say so; she says it at her peril.</p>
               <p>Jury. I think, after Mr. Hartley has given his evidence, he has no right to reply.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Hartley seems to conduct this prosecution with a good deal of candour, but his evidence will not establish the affirmative.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I want to put the prisoner forth into the world again, with as good a character as he had before, and the Court and Jury will pardon me for the trouble I give them.</p>

               <p>From the time the prisoner had worked for me I have known nothing of him, but as an honest man, I always put confidence in him, and he always discharged his trust with fidelity.</p>

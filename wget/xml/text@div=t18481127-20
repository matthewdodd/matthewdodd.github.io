                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Union-street, Hackoey-road. On 27th Oct., the prisoner Bland came to my shop a little before eleven o'clock in the morning for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco—I served him—he tendered me a bad sixpence—I noticed that it was bad, and I bent it a little—I told him that would not do for me—he said he had taken it at a pawnbroker's in Shoreditch, where he had pledged a handkerchief, and he must take it back directly—I let him take it, and he gave me a good sixpence—I gave him change, and be left—my little girl spoke to me, and I went out and saw Bland about two doors from my house—he went round the corner and joined Francis who was standing still, and appeared to be waiting for him—I followed them—they went to a pawnbroker's shop in Hackney-road—Bland went up a passage by the side of the shop—Francis went on a little way, and waited for him—Bland came out of the passage, and they went on—I followed them to a shop kept by Crisp in Maria-street—Bland went in there, and Francis waited outside—Bland came out, they joined in company, and went to Huntingdon-street, to a shop kept by Goddard—Francis went in there, and Bland watted outside under an archway—they joined again—I continued to follow them to a good many shops—they at last went to Mr. Aylin's—I told an officer, and I went in there with him—I found Francis there—I secured him, and the officer went after Bland—he brought him back, and they were taken to the station.</p>

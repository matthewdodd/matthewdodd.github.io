T -. I searing some hurt might have befallen him; and as he was going, met Mr. T - and the Deceased coming along, and the Deceased saying he was Wounded; Mr. T - reply'd, that if he had Wounded him, or done him any hurt, he was Sony and that Mr. T - desired him to assist him in carrying him to a House hard by in order to send for a Surgeon; and as they went, Mr. T - telling him he attempted to wrest the Pistol out of his Hand, he made no reply; but upon charging him with an attempt to break into the House, he reply'd he was no Thief, but said D - n it, what a Fool was I. And as they were going along, of a sudden he fell down; but by the Assistance of another Person that was there, they carried him to a House, Mr. T - sent him for a Surgeon, who came and let him Blood, but he bled no more than a Drop or two; and they found he had a Wound in his Breast. Mr. Westerburn deposed, that he having had occasion to be out late that Night, coming a long after 12 a Clock, saw a Man lying in the Road groaning, and ask'd him what he did there, but the Deceased made him no answer; and Mr. T-not being far off, desir'd him for God's sake, to take some care of him. Whereupon they carry'd him to a House, and sent for a Surgeon, who endeavour'd to Bleed him as before; that then they got him to Bed, dress'd his Wound, and about a quarter of an Hour after be came to his Speech, but was very much disorder'd in Drink, Cursed and Swore, and said what a Fool am I, I shall dye this Night; told them where he liv'd, and dyed about 5 a Clock that Morning.</p>

               <p>The Witnesses all agreed that Mr. T - shew'd a very great concern and care for the Deceased's welfare, tho' he was not sensible but that he was a Robber as he took him to be. Mr. T - in his defence gave the same account that had been given by the Evidences for the King, adding that he seeing the Deceased run away upon seeing of him, was fully persuded he was the Person whom the Footman had heard about the House; thereupon taking him for a Robber, he pursued him, and following him to the corner of a Street, where he seemed to turn up, and tho' he might easily have escaped, he turned suddenly upon him, and tho' he caution'd him to keep off, telling him he suspected him to be a Thief, yet he Swore violently at him, clos'd in with him, caught hold of his Pistol, and endeavoured to wrest it out of his Hand; and in the Scuffle some way received the Wound, by pressing upon him, without any design of his, or so much as knowing he was Wounded. He called divers Gentlemen of Distinction and Reputation to his Character, who all gave him the Character of a very Civil, inoffensive Gentleman, never inclining to Quarrels or Passion; but of such Affability as rendred his Conversation desirable, both by Superiours and Inferiours, And the Reverend Doctor

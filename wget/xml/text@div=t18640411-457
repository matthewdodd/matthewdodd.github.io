                  </hi>. I am the wife of Francis Sillence, of Plaistow-road, Essex—last Wednesday week I was removing from one house to another, and the prisoner offered to assist me, which he did from 2 till 9 at night—a few days afterwards I went into the kitchen with a lighted candle in my hand, and saw the prisoner standing and staring me full in the face—I</p>

               <p>screamed for my husband, and the prisoner jumped out at the window, which I had seen shut about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw the prisoner next morning, and told him that I was so frightened at the man coming in at the window—he said, "Have you got your boots all right?"—I said, "I believe I have"—he said, "If you have not, they are not far away; what sort of a man was it that got in at your window?"—I said, "Just like you"—I had told him if he came early on the Saturday I would pay him, and he came early in the morning, and said he was surprised to see me down at the shop so soon—I told him the reason of my coming was that I was so fright<lb></lb>ened at the man who stood before me—he then said, "What sort of a man was it?"—I said, "Just like you," and I told him if he would come between 5 and 6 my husband would pay him—he came in a different dress, and I hardly knew him—he said, "I am the man who removed the goods"—the next morning I missed a pair of boots—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this jacket is my husband's—it was found on the prisoner.</p>

I am 11 years old—I was at Mrs. Sillence's when she was moving—I saw the prisoner go right straight through, uncatch the window, and set the boots against it—that was about half-past 4 o'clock he then opened some boxes—I asked him what he was opening them for, and he said, "Mind your own business"—I did not see him do any thing with the contents—these are the boots I saw.</p>

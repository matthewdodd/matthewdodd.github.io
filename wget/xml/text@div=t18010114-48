               <p>Q. You only guess the number? - A. No; from which parcel he gave me a one pound note, which was readily taken; I asked him his name, he said it was James Edmonds; where do you live, asked I, at No. 9, King-street, answered he; what King-street? King-street, Mile-end, New-town, answered he, which name and place of abode I put upon the back of the said note.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note? - A. That is the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your mother present during the whole of this time? - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. While this was passing, had you sufficient opportunity of observing the person with whom you were dealing? - A. The case was this; it was about eleven o'clock in the evening, my father went out, and I was left in his place to serve the customers.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of light was there in your shop? - A. About twelve candles.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. To the best of my knowledge, he appears to be the same man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. This was on the Saturday night? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Saturday night, at eleven o'clock, is generally<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140050"></xptr>a very busy time? - A. Sometimes it is, and sometimes it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it happen to be that night? - A. There were, I think, five customers in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. And who were in the shop to serve them? - A. Myself, my mother, and a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you sold this beef was it, that you saw the prisoner in custody? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Four or five weeks, was not it? - A. It might be.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him before the Magistrate, I believe you did not speak to his person? - A. I was not requested to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him, did you know him again? - A. From the impression it made on my mind at the time he bought the beef, to the best of my knowledge I believed him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you could say so much as that you believed him to be the man, was he not dressed up in three or four different ways by the order of the officers? - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any reason upon earth why that was done? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. What is the first name of your father? - A. Abraham.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. My husband keeps a butcher's shop in Whitechapel; about eleven o'clock on Saturday night, a man came to our shop, and purchased an haunch-bone of beef, my son agreed for the price; I was there to take the money, the man gave me a two pound note, which I refused; my son then asked him for a one pound note; he had a bundle of Bank-notes in his hand, out of which he gave me a one pound; my son then asked him what his name was; he said his name was James Edmonds; he asked him where he lived, he said, at No. 29, King-street; he asked him, what King-street, he answered, King-street, Mile-end New-town; I gave him the change, the haunch-bone of beef came to five shillings and ten-pence halfpenny; I gave him two seven shilling pieces and one penny halfpenny; then I went in and the man went away; my son wrote upon the back of the note, the man's name, and where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, is he the man who came to purchase the haunch-bone of beef? - A. Apparently, to the best of my knowledge, he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the prisoner again? - A. The first time, was the Saturday after Christmas-day, at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it the beef was bought? - A. I cannot justly say, but it was in November, and it was on a Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him at the office, what was your opinion of the man? - A. To the best of my knowledge, it was the same man that gave me the note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was four or five weeks between the time when the beef was sold, and the time when you saw the man at the office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had several examinations, had you not? - A. Only two.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the manner in which you expressed yourself concerning your knowledge of the prisoner at the bar, at the next examination was not his dress changed? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that done for the purpose of removing the difficulties you had upon your mind with respect to the person? - A. The first sight I had of the man, it appeared to be the same man that gave me the note, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in consequence of the doubtful manner in which you had expressed yourself, that this man's dress was changed - Was not the motive for so doing that you might be better able to speak to his being the man? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you give any directions, or express any with that any alterations should be made? - A. No, I never saw any body to say so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at any time produced at the office dressed in pantaloons? - A. Yes, he had grey pantaloons on when he was in our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the colour of the pantaloons that he had on at the office? - A. They were grey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be the same sort of pantaloons? - A. I cannot say; there are many grey pantaloons, but they were of the same sort.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Garrow. I am a patten-iron maker, No. 8, King-street, Mile-End New-Town; I have known the prisoner at the bar nine or ten years; he was an anvil-marker, at Wolverhampton; the prisoner was at my house the latter end of October last.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after you had first seen him there, did he make any application to you respecting Bank-notes? - A. In about five or six days the prisoner calld upon me again; there was nothing then passed about Bank-notes that I can particularly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at any time make any application to you with respect to a five pound Bank-note? - A. Yes, about ten days after he first called; he then asked me if I could let him have a five pound note for small notes, I think they were all one pound notes, but I am not certain, there might be one of two pound, and three of one pound.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, in the course of you business, attempt to pay away those notes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any difficulty with respect to any one of them? - A. One was refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate that circumstance to the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it? - A. I gave it to him again, and he gave me another for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this? - A. In my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at that time, see any others in his possession? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after that with any number of Bank-notes in his possession? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after? - A. A short time after, I cannot say exactly, it was in November.</p>
               <p>Q. As near as you can tell, how many were there? - A. There might be as many as eight or ten, I cannot tell; he said he was going to buy some things to send into the country to his wife; I asked him if they were good notes, and he said there were some good and some bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him your reason for asking him that question? - A. Yes, I did, because I had had a note refused that I had taken from him; he said, if he could pay one away a week, it would be a great thing for him, he said, he was going into business.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you gave him the note back that had been refused, did he make any difficulty in changing it for you? - A. No, he said he was soon going into the country; I saw him again after he returned from the country, which was nine or ten days after the conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his coming to your house, and bringing a joint of meat? - A. Yes, on a Saturday night, I cannot say when.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the month of November? - A. It was late in the month of November; he brought home a haunch-bone of beef, he put it down, and said, that would do for dinner to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it? - A. Between ten and eleven, I believe it was nearer eleven than ten; I saw no more of him that night; he dined with me on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect a person, who was bricklayer, calling upon the prisoner? - A. Yes, twice; he called once, and the prisoner was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. It was after the haunch-bone of beef was brought? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you inform the Court, how soon after he brought the beef it was that the bricklayer called the first time? - A. On the Sunday; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140052"></xptr>next day he called again, on the Monday, in the evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon his telling you this, what did you say? - A. I told him I supposed they wanted to arrest him; and he said, they did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you mention any other reason for which they might want him? - A. Yes, I told him I supposed they wanted him for what they had him before at the Whitechapel-office.</p>

               <p>Q. I am asking you about the conversation that you had with him about the bricklayer? - A. He said he should not stop in town.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what he said would be the consequence if he did not go out of town? - A. No; he said they had been seeking after him several times at the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he the poker in his hand? - A. He took tip the poker and laid it upon the bundle of papers to press them down.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that there were papers resembling Bank-notes? - A. None; he said he could not stop a moment; he said, I have seen the bricklayer, and the bricklayer tells me that the same people have been seeking for me at the shop, and I cannot stop a minute, he went away directly, and did not stop half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take his clothes with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they of a size that he could conveniently have taken them if he had had time to stop for them? - A.

               <p>Q. Did they not tell you why they sent you to Cold bath-fields? - A. Mr. Bliss found in my pocket three notes, which I had had from Wooldridge, and which he said Wooldridge had in his pocket when he was at the office before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean, upon your oath, to say you did not know that you were charged yourself with a forgery at the time you were sent to Cold-bathfields prison? - A. They said nothing to me about forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, did you or not know that you were charged with a forgery? - A. I heard nothing about forgery at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many examinations might you have attended before the Magistrates at Lambeth-street? - A. I was down three times, but was never called for but twice.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140053"></xptr>Q. Do you mean to say, the Magistrates sent you to Cold-bath-fields before they examined you? - A. Yes; I never was examined at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you were sent to prison without calling upon you for a defence against the charge? - A. I have told you it was for three 1l. notes that were found in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always told the truth before the Magistrate when you were called upon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at the first examination, say that the notes found upon you were given you by the prisoner for a five pound note? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, when called upon by the Magistrate, say that you received them from the prisoner for a debt of four pounds twelve shillings? - A. I said no such thing; for the Magistrate even asked me where I got my five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I am to understand you that you said no such thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a Mr. Tilsey? - A. Yes, a cheesemonger, at Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. The one pound note that you returned to the prisoner; and which he changed, you had offered to Mr. Tilsey, in Whitechapel? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not say to Tilsey when you offered it to him, that you had received it from a different quarter? - A. Yes; I told him I believed I had received it that morning in Leadenhall-market in change for a five pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. And you now think fit to say you had it from the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; when I came home I recollected that I had it from the prisoner. I had changed a five pound note and received three one pound notes that morning in Leadenhall-market; but when I came home I recollected that I had wrapped up three one pound notes together, and the other was by itself: after Tilsey had refused that note, I unwrapped the others, and I thought it must be that single note, by its being wrapped up by itself: it was in the morning I had been in Leadenhall-market, and in the evening I was at Mr. Tilsey's.</p>


               <p>Q. Did you mention this at the Magistrate's at Whitechapel? - A. Yes; they asked me, and I told them so.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it happen that you employed an attorney to defend you? - A. I did not employ one; but there was one employed for me unknown to me; that was at the third examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that you were charged with forgery, and did he not recommend it to you to turn King's evidence? - A. No; he said my brother had employed him, and he was to ask me such questions as he thought proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, from his representations, know and believe that you would be prosecuted if you did not turn evidence? - A. He told me nothing about evidence; he said he was to attend upon me at Whitechapel office.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you were not you taken from the office into a private room, and was it not some time after you had been shut up with your attorney before you agreed to become a witness? - A. No; they said nothing to me about witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were not threatened to be prosecuted if you did not turn King's evidence? - A. Nobody threatened me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it happen that you were in irons at all? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were your irons taken off till after you had had this conversation with your attorney? - A. I had no private conversation, it was all public, and they said nothing at all about evidence; they proposed to bail me, that was what they took me out for.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have not been bailed yet? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You came in custody here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever in custody before? - A. Yes, in Staffordfhire.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you in custody for? - A. An assault; I never was found guilty in any Court of Justice at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you were in custody at that time for nothing but an assault? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were not in custody and tried for house-breaking, or any felony? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever been tried at Coventry? - A. Yes; that was on suspicion of robbery, and there I was honourably acquitted.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140054"></xptr>Q. Have these notes since been returned to you? - A. No; Mr. Bliss told me they were good notes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. (To Mr. Bliss.) Q. Do you know any thing of three Bank-notes that were found upon the witness at the office? - A.

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner respecting any forged Bank-notes, and of his know ledge of their having been forged?</p>
               <p> Mr. Alley took an objection to the question, which, having been argued on both sides, Mr. Baron Thompson proceeded as follows: -</p>
               <p>The question proposed to be put to the witness seems to me to inquire after a conversation which the witness is supossed to have had with the prisoner at the bar, on the 18th of December, at the distance of about-three, weeks from the day when the note in question was uttered to Roderiques; and the effect of that conversation is something from which a knowledge of the forgery may be inferred as to the goodness or badness of certain notes then in his possession. It is supposed further, that an inference may be drawn of his knowledge and skill in discovering good notes from bad notes antecedent to the time; but it seems to me, unless the conversation goes so far as to affect the prisoner with the general knowledge of good notes and bad notes antecedent to that time, so as to connect it with the time when he really uttered this note, his then knowledge of a good note from a forged note, will not of itself be sufficient to afford the inference that at the time he uttered the note in question he necessarily knew that note to be forged, because he is speaking only of the knowledge of specific note in his possession, and the knowledge that he has of good notes from forged notes; but if the conversation goes further than that, and has any relation to notes that he has before issued, and to his knowledge of the goodness or badness of such notes before that time, in that case only, I think, is that conversation admissible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow (To Ferriday). Q. Upon your meeting with the prisoner at the bar at the Windsor Castle upon the 18th of December, did he say any thing to you with respect to forged Bank-notes? - A. After I had been some time in his company, he said his relation Frank had been taken up for a had Bank-note, and had been tried for it at the office; he said he looked so foolish with respect to Bank-notes he did not know any thing about it; that he told the Magistrate he had it of his master, and that he, Francis, had called James for ward, and that he owned to it that he had given that note to him; he said Frank was always getting into some foolish scrape or another; he said he himself had given the officer a card of his place and shop where he lived, in Nightingale-lane; he said he had had a quantity of bad Bank-notes; I asked him what he had done with them; he told me he had passed them over Blackfriars-bridge and Westminster-bridge, and round the Borough; the next day I was to see some of them; I was to meet him at six o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these notes that you were to see forged or good Bank-notes? - A. He said they were bad; he said they were at Mr. Pritchard's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Pritchard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know he lodged there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he going to do with them? - A. He said he was then going to pass them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body of this meeting that you had had with him? - A. Yes; I told Mr. Rogers, a Police officer, of on the 19th; I happened to meet him again at eight o'clock at night, and I went and found the prisoner there; he asked why I stopped so long; I told him I could not conveniently come sooner; I went there alone; he and I went together to Pritchard's; I went in without him; I did not get any thing, and I returned to the prisoner and told him Mrs. Pritchard was coming; she came, and then I left them together; the next morning he was apprehended, in consequence of the information I had given to Rogeres.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what is become of Mrs. Pritchard? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. But had you the ill luck to get into jail for it? - A. Yes; I was put into the whipping-house.</p>

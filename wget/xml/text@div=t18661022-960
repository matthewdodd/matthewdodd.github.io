               <p>Saturday morning, 8th September, I missed fourteen live geese from my stable—I had seen them there the night before—I called in the police—I traced the feathers through a meadow to a haystack at a place called "Hilly Fields," about three-quarters of a mile off, where I found six dead geese—I recognised them as my property by marks that were on them, and from their general appearance—the fourteen geese were worth about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On Saturday, September 8th, about two o'clock, I went to the Hilly Fields and saw some geese concealed under the hay—I got up a tree about fifty yards off, and watched—shortly afterwards I saw Bailey going towards the stack with a bag under his arm—when he got as far as some iron hurdles he went on his hands and knees to the stack and began putting something in the bag—I got down the tree and waited until he came up to me—I asked him what he had got there—he said, "Some geese"—I asked what he was going to do with them—he said, "It is all right; you have got me right this time, but I have been a tool for others"—he said something about other persons being at the "Oak" public-house—I took him to the station, and then went to the "Oak"—I made some inquiries there, and then went to Hibbert's house, in Hanover Street—I found him at home, but he was not sober—I told him he was charged on suspicion of being concerned with Bailey in stealing fourteen geese—he said he know nothing about it—I took him to the station.</p>

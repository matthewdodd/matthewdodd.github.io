On the 23rd or 24th of March, I was returning home, and met the prisoner between one and two o'clock in the morning - I entered into conversation with her for about ten minutes, did not go to any house with her, but into a mews; when I got home, on taking my things off, I missed my watch - the chain came off without it; I had lost my watch, and part of the chain - it was a gold guard-chain; I returned, and described her to a Policeman - he said she had just passed him, but we could not find her then; I gave twenty guineas for the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was crossing from Thomas' hotel when you came and caught hold of me. Witness. No, it was in <placeName id="t18310908-154-crimeloc820">Bond-street, near Berkeley-square</placeName>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you leave the prisoner under such circumstances, that upon any little scuffle the watch might have fallen from you? A. Oh no! it was impossible; the chain was so thick it must have been cut.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I stood full ten minutes, and if I had stolen the watch I could have gone off; he rushed from me very swiftly, and I caught hold of his cloak. Witness. She never took any means to restrain my going - I do not recollect her taking hold of my cloak; I certainly did run home.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I took the prisoner coming out of the House of Correction, where she had been one month for being disorderly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to Mr. Hall, and made inquires about the watch.</p>
               <p>MR. HALL. Yes, in about three weeks she came and desired it to be stopped, as she had lost the duplicate; she did not leave any message about its not being inquired for, nor did she pay any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to MR. TALBOT. Q.Did I have my hands in any position about your person, either when your cloak was open or when you were rushing from me? A.Very likely you had - you asked for money, and I said I had none; I have no recollection of saying I would meet you at the theatre.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On his leaving me I was running, and struck my foot against something, which proved to be this watch; I followed the prosecutor to the end of Grosvenor-street, and the Policeman said he ran so swiftly that he could not tell which way be went; I examined the watch - it proved to be gold, and had the glass broken; I remembered I had heard it crack, as I was following the prosecutor because he had not given me any money; I went with the watch to the theatre, where he said he would meet me - after going through the saloon several times, I then went to Berkeley-square to see for him: I should have stopped longer, but a Police-officer said, "I am not certain you are the person, but there is a tall person suspected of stealing a gold watch;" I said I had stolen no watch, but I asked where the gentleman lived, and they would not give me the address - I had mislaid the duplicate, and could not find it: I went to the pawnbroker that no one else might get it till I found who it belonged to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder—I was employed by Mr. Dean to take down a building—there was a quantity of lead and some copper nails lying about—the prisoner was employed under me to work in different parts of the building—he would have access to these copper pails—they were on the roof of the old station—I did not authorise him to take them away—these nails produced are such as were on the roof of the railway station.</p>

Yes—a man named Collins was tried for stealing lead and copper pipeing—Collins was working at this place—these nails were fastened into the roof of the station—there were no other copper nails except those on the roof—all the slates were not then taken off the roof—about half cf them had been taken off on the 18th—I had not missed any nails before the 16th—I missed the lead and copper that Collins was charged with stealing on the Monday—I was employed by Mr. Dean abont the 14th—I had known the prisoner about eight years—I never knew anything against him before—I did not miss these nails, they were taken out of the heap of nails that had been taken out.</p>

             sworn. - I was returning from Mr. Astley's theatre, and coming on between Dover-street and Gloucester coffee-house I saw a man running with a bundle under his arm, and just against Mr. Dobey's shop he dropped the bundle; my friend and I pursued him; he proceeded down St. James's street, and turned round into Jermyn-street; where he made a slip, and just as we came up to him, the prisoner got up, and ran down Brewer-street; there I caught hold of him by the collar and tripped him up, he fell into the kennel; then a man came up and he was secured; I am sure he is the man that dropped the bundle, because he was not out of my sight till I had hold of him; it was about half after eleven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not stop to pick the bundle up, therefore you cannot say whether that is the bundle or not? - A. Certainly not; I can say, that was the man that dropped the bundle, and was running.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What is the reason that your witnesses did not attend, pursuant to the notice? - I do not know, they may be here now, they were not come when I came in; I thought as I had received two notices of trial, the court would indulge me 'till tomorrow. </p>
               <p>Have you given them notice to attend? - I did give them notice.</p>
               <p>When? - Last night I desired them to be here at nine this morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Is your name Samuel Ravenhurst? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Relate in what manner you lost your property? - On the 9th of September: I am not possessed of the paper now; I have neither counsel or attorney.</p>
               <p>Why have not you? - It is so early in the morning, that I thought the court would indulge me till the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Court. The court never indulges any body without a proper reason assigned.</p>
               <p>What time of the day was it? - Between one and two in the morning.</p>
               <p>Was it the morning of the 10th or the 9th? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What day was it? - I forget it now; I have it down in writing, but I am not possessed of my writing now.</p>
               <p>What day of the week was it? - Tuesday I believe; I have it down in writing at home.</p>
               <p>Was it Tuesday night or Wednesday morning? - I think it was Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>Was it Tuesday morning or Tuesday night? - I think it was Wednesday morning, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>You think it was Wednesday morning? - I think so.</p>
               <p>Where were you at that time? - I was at Mr. Jenkins's, that is the gentleman who ordered me to bring the oysters and the fruit; he is not a house-holder, he is a lodger.</p>
               <p>I ask you where you was? - I was in Mr. Jenkins's house.</p>
               <p>Where was it? - In <placeName id="t17881022-67-crimeloc309">Holborn</placeName>

               <p>To do what? - To come to bring the oysters there; tell me what you want, and I will tell you.</p>
               <p>Court. I want you to tell your story? - I came there at eleven, to Bradbury's-house; Jenkins was the person that ordered me to come there; I came to Mr. Jenkins's where he lodges; where this dance was; where this grand company was; about eleven on Tuesday night I came to the lodgings of Mr. Jenkins in Holborn.</p>
               <p>What did you go there for? - In order to bring two hundred oysters, one hundred pears, and one hundred apples, according to order; I delivered them, and they gave a general satisfaction; I had no complaint; as soon as I had opened the oysters, I ordered my servant to take and clear all the shells and throw them away; then I applied for my money, to Mr. Jenkins; it was in the passage that I opened them; and he took me into a room, where there was nobody but me and him; I sat there for the space of half an hour; then I told him I must go to Billingsgate in the morning, and I should be much obliged to him to discharge me, and let me go home; then I applied again to him, and told him I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220087"></xptr>would be very much obliged to him, if they would pay me; then he said they were at supper, and he could not speak to the master of the ceremonies; in short supper came out, and he asked me to eat a bit of supper with him; and I told him I could not eat any thing at all; I applied the third time; he begged I would not be angry, and he would get me the money; then Jenkins's wife went in and fetched out this Mr. Frazier from the room where they were dancing; she called him by his name; I knew no more of it; when he came out he called me every thing but a gentleman, a damned scoundrel, and villain, a damn his eyes if he would not knock my head off.</p>
               <p>What provocation had you given him? - None at all, I never spoke to the gentleman in my life; says he d - n your eyes you scoundrel, you have no business here; Sir, says I, I ask pardon, I was asked up here by Mr. Jenkins to be paid; I will go down immediately; and I got up to go down stairs; he kept swearing and cursing me, and saying he could have credit for five hundred pounds; Sir, says I, I have no demand upon you, I agreed with Mr. Jenkins for ready money; and I should be glad to have it, as I go to market; then when I came to the landing place of the stairs, he struck me over the eye, and knocked me from the top to the bottom; I dare-say, there were eighteen or nineteen steps; but luckily, as it pleased God, I caught hold of the rail, or else I cannot say what the consequence would have been; then he came down to me, and I got up; and he said d - n you, you scoundrel, what is your demand? Sir, says I, it is seven shillings the oysters, and two shillings the fruit; then he gave me, to the best of my knowledge, two half crowns, three shillings, and two sixpences; then when I had the money in my hand, he d - d my eyes, and bid me look at the money; accordingly I did look at it; then d - n your eyes you rascal, says he, you shall not have a farthing, and he gave me a blow over the nose, it spun of blood, and down I fell; and he took the money from me, and kept me down; one of the ladies had some humanity and mercy and came and took him off, and begged he would not murder me; my little girl cried murder; and as they were kicking me, I bid her call the watch; accordingly she did; then this lady came down, and took him round the waist, and begged for God's sake he would not strike me, but let me have my money; he said no, d - n his eyes if I should have a farthing; then he pushed me out of the door, and I called half a dozen watchmen in a very little time.</p>
               <p>Court. This was a gentleman that Mrs. Jenkins brought out, and called Mr. Frazier? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know him again? - I do not know that I know him, but I think that gentleman in green is him; to my knowledge; I cannot say that I am sure; another gentleman struck me beside him, but I do not know him; I found out where he lives; I had not put up the money, I had it in my hand; he laid hold of the money with one hand, and struck me with the other; he took the money out of this hand; he took two half crown pieces out, and the other fell to the floor; I was down, my nose bled so, you would have been surprized.</p>
               <p>You had no demand upon him? - No, I made no bargain with him.</p>
               <p>Then by your account, he put some of his own money into your hands and took it away again? - Yes, I would have given it to him again, if he had asked me for it; he did not give me time to speak, I just clasped my hand, and he directly d - d my eyes; and I wished myself out of the company; his hand was not two inches from my face.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. So you are a <rs id="t17881022-67-viclabel310" type="occupation">dealer in oysters and fruit</rs>

               <p>You have had no other business for the last six years than that? - Yes, I <rs id="t17881022-67-viclabel311" type="occupation">sell bread, fish, rabbits</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17881022-67-victim571 t17881022-67-viclabel311"></join>, and fruit, or any thing.</p>
               <p>That is the way you have got your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220088"></xptr>bread for the last six years? - Yes, I mean to swear that positively.</p>
               <p>Then you have never acted as solicitor, within the last six years? - Solicitor! No.</p>
               <p>Carrying on suits, and hunting after causes, and carrying them on? - I am not admitted an attorney.</p>
               <p>You have never attended courts of justice, in the character of a man soliciting causes? - No, I do not say I have not, I say I have, I do not practice in any courts.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have not you got your living the last six years in attending at the New Sessions House Clerkenwell? - No, Sir, I never attended there, I attended Mr. Jackson, whom I am with; he lives in the Fleet Market, he is an attorney; and he lived and boarded with me at that time.</p>
               <p>Then you acted as his clerk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then of course you never put your name to the back of briefs, as an attorney? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you never deliver a brief in your life, with the name of Ravenhurst on the back of it, as an attorney? - Never in any court; nor I never attended without Mr. Jackson; he never tried a cause; he has sued out writs; I never attended the prosecution of any cause in this court in my life; Mr. Jackson never had a cause here.</p>
               <p>You never attended any in your life? - Yes I have attended to some but not here.</p>
               <p>Where? - I attended one when Mr. Eccleston was the attorney, if you remember before the recorder of the city of London; I occasionally act for him, a friend of mine I recommended to Mr. Eccleston; you and Mr. Silvester were both employed, at the Sessions of Peace for London; the brief was indorsed Eccleston the attorney; he attended and I was there with him.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, that in the course of the last six years, that is the only cause you attended? - Yes, I do not recollect any other, I do not believe I ever did any where.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you never did.</p>
               <p>Court. Consider, if he acts as an attorney, without being one, he is subject to the penalty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Perhaps in the course of the last six years, you may have had other occasions to attend courts of justice, have you been a good deal at Westminster, in term time? - Yes, I have been at law with my brother for fourteen years; every body knows me; I certainly have a good deal of law of my own.</p>
               <p>Is that the only business you have at Westminster-Hall, for the last six years? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, how often have you justified bail, in the course of the last six years? - I do not suppose I ever justified bail in my life, I do not know I ever did within six years, I do not believe I ever did.</p>
               <p>Will you swear positively, that you never did? - I do not know that I ever justified bail in my life in Westminster-Hall; I do not know that I ever did.</p>
               <p>Court. It will be mis-spending the time of the court, to go on further in this business, I have stated the whole of the evidence to the learned Judges, and they both concur with me, that however violent the assault, there is no pretence to charge a felony: the case is this; the prosecutor is employed by another, who was to pay him for his oysters and his fruit nine shillings; the prisoner, Mr. Frazier, who had nothing to do with the employment of him, and owed him nothing, comes out; attacks him, whether with or without provocation does not signify any thing here; d - ns him, abuses him, and beats him, he pulls out nine shillings and put it into his hand, then takes the money back; we are all of opinion there is no foundation for a felony, the assault was very improper and violent, he changed his mind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. We were perfectly assured of this, but I venture to pledge myself, if you will only have the goodness to examine one or two witnesses, on the part of the defendant; I will prove this to be the most diabolical business that ever entered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220089"></xptr>into the mind of man; and then your Lordship may grant us a copy of the indictment: Mr. Frazier is of as high reputation as any man in town; I wish it in order to shew you the depravity of the prosecutor's mind.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Have you any further witnesses? - Yes,

               <p>What are you? - Servant to Mr. Ravenhurst.</p>
               <p>Where did Mr. Ravenhurst live at that time? - In Blackman-street, Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Now take care to speak the truth; tell us the whole truth and nothing else; if you do not tell the truth, you will be in danger of a prosecution; do not let any attention to your master, or any other motive induce you to conceal the truth, or go beyond it? - My master was in the house at eleven o'clock, he went with some oysters and fruit; the fruit was sent first, and my master and I went with the oysters; when we went with the oysters, Mr. Jenkins said, it was time enough yet to open the oysters, he did not open them; then afterwards he was called up to open the oysters, he opened them all; then he went up stairs and asked for his money; he asked Mr. Jenkins for his money; he said how much is it? my master said seven shillings the oysters, and two shillings the fruits that was nine shillings; he asked again for his money; they bid him stop, and he did stop; then the gentleman went into the dancing-room, and called a gentleman out; and he knocked my master all the way down stairs; when my master went to the bottom of the stairs he got up; the gentleman followed him; he asked him his demand; my master said seven shillings the oysters, and two shillings the fruit; he then pulled his hand out of his pocket and gave him the money, and d - d his eyes for a rascal; he said look at your money; he would not let him have time to look at his money; but he took hold of his hand that had the money in it, and knocked him down with his other hand, his nose spun blood; my master told me to scream out murder, and I did.</p>
               <p>What did your master say to this gentleman, tell the whole truth; did he say any thing to him before he struck him? - No, he did not; he said do not d - n my eyes Sir, d - n your own eyes; that was before he struck him.</p>
               <p>After the gentleman gave your master the money, what did your master say to him, when he had the money in his hand? - My master did not say any thing then.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself, you know you have not heard your master examined, you was not in court; now the minute he got the money into his hand, what did your master say? - I do not think he said any thing; he gave him the money, and snatched hold of his hand that the money was in, and knocked him down, and his nose spun of blood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. How long have you lived with this man? - Past three years.</p>
               <p>He is very good to you as a master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you breakfast with him? - Some times I do.</p>
               <p>So then of course, as you was coming here, you breakfasted with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he take care of you as you came along the street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You know he swore he did not know this girl was attending.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Now as we have examined your master, we know a great deal more than he has told you; when you was up stairs with him, was you up stairs all the time that he was there? - I cleared all the oysters.</p>
               <p>Where was you when the oysters were opened? was not this man extremely drunk at that house? - No Sir, he was not.</p>
               <p>Did not he make a great noise, and behave very rudely, and the gentlemen there wanted him to go down stairs? - No Sir, he did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. It is almost a shame to ask the poor child.</p>

               <p>What age are you? - I am turned of sixteen.</p>
               <p>Where does your mother and father live? - My mother lived in Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst. My Lord she lived servant at a public house, just near to me, two years, before I had her.</p>

               <p>Who desired you to come here? - Mr. Ravenhurst, he called at our house last night.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to be at Mr. Jenkins's, at the dance? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Tell us what passed between Ravenhurst and any person? - As to Ravenhurst, I cannot say, till to day, that ever I saw him; I saw the scuffle between the oyster man, and this gentleman; I was there, while there was a dance, in which Mr. Frazier was with a young lady, a Miss Steward; they were dancing, I was only looking on, at the time; I had occasion to go to the top of the stairs, and heard a noise below; I went down and saw a scuffle; at last I understood, a man was turned out, the door was shut; I understood he had insulted a Mr. M'Cree, and he had turned him out.</p>
               <p>During that scuffle, where was Frazier; - Up stairs, I left him there dancing, and I was not two minutes below, when I went up stairs again, I found him dancing; presently, indeed it was, I believe, as I was walking up stairs, I heard a terrible loud rapping at the door; that was after the fellow had been turned out, and it was repeated often; I know that the oyster man was delivered over to the watch, on account of this noise, and rapping at the door; I also know that during the whole of this scuffle, and his being delivered over to the watchmen, Mr. Frazier was in the room; he might have stept out for all I know, the moment I was down, but I am positive sure he never was down at the door.</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst. May not I ask this gentleman a question or two? I have no counsel.</p>
               <p>Court. State them to the court.</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst. Do you remember Mrs. Jenkins's calling any gentleman out of the room to the oyster man? - No, I did not see her call any body out, but I understood she called out a Mr. M'Cree; I should suppose I must have been then in the dancing room, but I cannot just tell where I was.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the justice's the next morning when Mr. Jenkins declared it was Mr. Frazier? - I was not at the justice's at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Stockton. Was not you talking to Ravenhurst before he came into the court to day? - I spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Then you saw him at the door, before he came into court? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst. I want the chief man, he is not here, his name is

               <p>M'CREE sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I believe you was at this house? - I was; there was a little dance, and a dancing master; there were three or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220091"></xptr>four and twenty couple; I remember Ravenhurst being there that evening.</p>
               <p>What was the first part of the evening in which you saw him? - I did not see him till after supper.</p>
               <p>In what situation was he? - Some time after supper, after having finished a dance, in the hall room, Mrs. Jenkins came in to me, and told me a man was behaving very insolently, and riotously, in the supper room, and had frightened her, and begged of me to go out; I went out into the supper room, and found this man, Ravenhurst, sitting at the supper table, with his hat on; and speaking very insolently, and speaking to the ladies as they passed backwards and forwards; I went up to him, and asked him what he wanted? and he said nine shillings; I put my hand into my pocket and found I had not silver enough to pay him; he was going to follow me; says he d - n me, I want my money, and will have it; he pushed me on my left breast, in order to get into the room; I pushed him backwards by the breast, and that sent him two or three steps down the stairs, on his hands and feet; I went into the room without taking any other notice, and borrowed two half crowns, of the first gentleman I met; I went down, and I found him at the bottom; he said it was nine shillings; Mr. Jenkins, I believe, said it was only eight shillings; however, I said, I will give you nine shillings, if you demand it; I gave him three half crown pieces, a shilling, and a sixpence, and bid him to see whether the money was good; says he, tell me whether it is good: I could not bear this man's affronts without defending myself, I struck him, that sent him reeling against the passage; in order to save himself from a fall, the money dropt in the passage, I heard it fall; it was picked up by the girl; Sir, says the girl, when I struck him, my master will go; I paid him the money; Mr. Frazier was at that time in the dancing room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Will your Lordship permit us to call another witness, in order to commit this man.</p>
               <p>M'Cree. The door of the passage was quite shut, nobody was admitted.</p>
               <p>Who were the gentlemen of your party, that was present? - Mr. Jenkins the dancing master and Mr. Williams.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Jenkins or Mr. Williams here? - Mr. Jenkins is here.</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst to M'Cree. Was you the gentleman that Mrs. Jenkins fetched out of the room? - I have told the court I was.</p>
               <p>Who was in the room when you came into the room to me? - I cannot recollect who were there,</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst. Nobody was there but you and me. - Mrs. Jenkins was reasoning with him at the time, he was thumping with his hat on the table, she told him the company had not yet settled the business.</p>

               <p>JENKINS sworn.</p>
               <p>I understand you were the dancing master, at whose apartments these gentlemen and ladies met? - Yes; after supper I asked him, and his little girl, to sit down with the servants, to eat a little supper; he asked for porter; I desired them to help themselves; after some time, he saw some ladies coming out, whom he made some rude observations on; my wife said, what is the matter? she went into the room, and brought one Mr. M'Cree.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. M'Cree the person she brought out? - Yes it was.</p>
               <p>Was it Mr. Frazier? - No, it was not; he said nine shillings; says Mr. M'Cree, come out and I will pay you; the man went out of the supper room, to the top of the stairs, Mr. M'Cree, put his hand to his pocket, and went into the room; this man followed him in; says Mr.

            , you are not to come in here; the man turned round and said d - n me I want my money; he slipt down upon his toes, on the stair; then Mr. M'Cree went into the room; the man by this time was at the bottom of the stairs, and M'Cree, came out and stood on the two last steps of the stairs; the man held out his hand, and he gave him three half crowns, a shilling, and a sixpence; says the man, is it good? says Mr. M'Cree, make use of your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220092"></xptr>own eyes, I am not obliged to look at your money; the man pushed him, and said, d - n your eyes, and a scuffle ensued.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Frazier in the passage, during any part of that transaction? - No, positively he was not.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Frazier take him by one hand, and take the money out of his hand, and strike him with the other? - No.</p>
               <p>Did any person take the money out of his hand? - No.</p>
               <p>That you swear positively? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But in the scuffle the money dropt out of his hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To Mr. M'Cree. Upon the oath you have taken did any person take the money out of Ravenhurst's hand? - No, Sir, certainly not, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst. How came the money out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Ravenhurst, Mr. M'Cree has already told you.</p>
               <p>Mr. M'Cree. In addition to that he was so completely drunk, that the smallest push I gave him knocked him down; I gently touched him, he fell down, he was so completely drunk.</p>
               <p>Mr. ATTORNEY GENERAL sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When we have the good fortune to call such a witness, we need not trouble your Lordship with any other gentleman; Mr. Attorney General happens to be here on another prosecution.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Mr. Frazier? - Several years; I have had occasion to know him in two different capacities; first, as clerk to Mr. M'Kenzie, a wine merchant, with whom I dealt; and as secretary to a society, which is a large subscription; and I believe every gentleman of that society, beside myself, will say, that he is exceedingly honest, and a reputable man.</p>
               <p>Court. Now, Mr. Ravenhurst, you see that gentleman, Mr. Frazier, in green, and that other witness; now which of them was it that took the money from you?</p>
               <p>I told you at first, I could not tell; he did not let me look at him; if I was to die I cannot tell which it was; but the good woman swore before Mr. Walker, that it was Mr. Frazier; Mrs. Jenkins, Mr. Jenkins's wife, I asked her in particular, what the gentleman's name was; when she was upon her oath, before Mr. Walker, and she told me his name was Frazier; I did not know the gentlemen or lady neither; and I wish I had not seen them then.</p>
               <p>Another thing; did she call the gentleman Mr. Frazier, that night? - Yes, she did say so; she went out and said, I will fetch Mr. Frazier, the master of the ceremonies; that gentleman that swore last, said he was to pay me</p>
               <p>She told you she would call out Mr. Frazier? - Yes, and he was the master of the ceremonies, and he would pay me.</p>
               <p>Did she speak, when she brought him out, did she speak to him, or call him by his name, after she brought him out? - No, I do not believe she did, for he would not let us stop a moment; he came as hot, as ever was a Scotchman; I expected I was not to live a moment.</p>
               <p>What situation was you in, when this person, that Mrs. Jenkins called, came out? - I was then sitting nigh to the door, and my servant girl was close to me; and there was not another soul in the room but we two, not at that time; they were all dancing; and a vast deal of company was gone; I suppose it was near two o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Were you sitting at the supper table when he came out? - Upon the seat by the supper table, but I never tasted any thing, my servant did, but I did not; I was ordered to sit there by Mr. Jenkins, to be paid; and this gentleman was called out to pay me; I immediately went out of the room, and when I came to the top of the stairs, he knocked me from the top to the bottom against the rail.</p>
               <p>Then there was nobody in the room when that gentleman was brought out by Mrs. Jenkins, except you and your girl? - No, Jenkins was not in the room at that time; when he knocked me down to the bottom, there were several people there then.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Jenkins. Was you in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220093"></xptr>room when your wife brought out Mr. M' Cree? - I was, and at the same time, I said to the man, how dare you sit with your hat on in this room?</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst. I never had my hat on after I went up stairs; I never spoke to any man living.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, you have heard the evidence, I believe I need not trouble you with summing it up.</p>
               <p>Ravenhurst. May it please your Lordship, and you gentlemen of the Jury; I was brought here to serve these oysters, I did do it; after this I was beat; my money was taken from me; as for the gentleman that struck me, I did not know him; the lady told me at Mr. Walker's, his name was

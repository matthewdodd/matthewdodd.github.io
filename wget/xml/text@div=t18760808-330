                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi> 41). At 12.30 on the morning of 1st August, I was in Copenhagen Street, Islington, with another policeman—I heard cries of "Murder" and "Police" proceeding from the Regent's Canal, which was about 150 yards off—I ran down Bath Place, and saw a child lying on the towing-path, and the prisoner struggling in the water—I laid down on my belly on the towing-path, and got hold of the prisoner as she rose up out of the water, and dragged her to the side, and with the assistance of the other sergeant, pulled her out—I then examined the child, it was about fifteen months old—it was drenched—the prisoner was unconscious when she was pulled out, and remained so</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187608080051"></xptr>
               <p>about five minutes—she then said "I took the child into the water with me, but it would not stop down, so I threw it out"—the child was not unconscious, it was crying—I took the prisoner to the station, and got some dry clothes for her, and sent for a surgeon, and he ordered her to be taken to the workhouse infirmary—she came out three days afterwards—the towing-path along the canal is the private property of the Regent's Canal Company—there is no road or path down to it; but the railings there are broken, and a person could get through—I believe the prisoner is married—her husband is here; she did not say that it was her child, but she said its name was John, and it was six months old.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The towing-path, is used for horses, but this was 4 feet higher than the towing-path, and there are railings, which are broken down at one place, and there are gates at diffierent places, but I think they are locked during the night—the prisoner was not excited when she come to herself—I said "You had better tell me where you live and I will take you home," but I made no allusion to the child—she was very weak, and I had to carry her home; she was half-drowned—I saw no horses on the towing-path, there was a barge, which had passed her without stopping, and they must hare seen her in the water—I cannot say that the cries did not come from the woman herself; it was a long distance—the other constable assisted me, he is not here—I was there first—the woman was striking out, and she went down in the water; I laid down on my belly and got hold of her.</p>

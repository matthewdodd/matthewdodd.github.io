                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Neath, a pawnbroker in Duke-street. On the 10th of October the prisoner came to our shop to sell I silver fork—she said it was her own, that her name was Smith, and she lived at the first house over Blackfriars-bridge, on the right hand—I said that was a glass-manufactory—she said, "Yes"—I said I did not believe it was hers—she said she would go and fetch a person—she went away—I did not see her again till I was fetched to Mr. Worth's.</p>

               <p>door was rung, and the door was opened by the cook—I was up stairs at the time—I heard the cook say, "Here is Mary, Sir, will you like to see her?"—I came down, and saw the prisoner—I heard Clark say, "That is the woman"—I told her what she was charged with—she said she had never seen it—I asked if she had been to the house on the 10th—she said she had, and some persons were with her at the time—I asked what time she left—she said the woman with her left at four o'clock, and she at six.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook to Mr. George Worth, of Montague-street—the prisoner lived at my master's mother's, as her maid. On the 10th of October she came to master's house between twelve and one o'clock, and left between three and four—I am sure of that—a female was with her—she wanted to see my master—he was out of town—she was in the front kitchen—the plate was in a cupboard in the back kitchen, which is generally kept open—the doors of the two kitchens are quite convenient one to the other—she did not call again till the day my master came home—the policeman came on the 11th with Clark, and brought a silver fork—I then missed a fork—this is my master's fork, Mr. George Worth's—these are the sort of forks that were in the cupboard the morning the prisoner was there—I opened the door to the prisoner the morning the policeman came—I told her there was a piece of work about a fork, and the pawnbroker and policeman were there—I asked if I should announce to my master that she was there—she said I might if I liked—I left her in the hall, and told my master—she said she never did it, she never saw the fork—Clark said he could swear to her.</p>

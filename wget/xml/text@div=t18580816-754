                  </hi>. I am barmaid at Exeter-hall Hotel in the Strand. On Thursday, 8th July, Butler came about half-past 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I served him with a pint of beer which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and he gave me in payment a shilling—I gave him change—he drank part of the beer and left. I put the shilling in the till—there was no other shilling there, I am quite sure—just as he went out, Mr. Hall came in and spoke to me, in consequence of which I looked at the shilling. I found it was bad—I gave it to Mr. Hall—he bent it, and left the house with it. I saw Butler again the same day; I am sure he is the man—I did not have the shilling lack—I did not see Godfrey.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Wardour-street. About 12 o'clock, on 8th July, I saw Godfrey standing in front of my shop. I afterwards went out at a qurter before 3 o'clock—I went through the Strand, and saw Godfrey again standing in front of the Adelphi Theatre. While he was standing there Butler joined him, and they walked as far as the Exeter-hall Hotel—Butler went in there, and Godfrey went up Exeter-street—I went into the hotel and asked some questions—when I came out I saw Godfrey standing at the corner of Burleigh-street, waiting there—I then returned to the hotel, and the last witness gave me this shilling from the till—I bit it, and took it out and gave it to the policeman—I then went after the prisoner—I saw Butler join Godfrey at the corner of Burleigh-street—they walked up to Exeter-street. I met a policeman, and made a communication to him—I gave the prisoners in custody for passing bad money—Butler's conduct was very riotous, he tried to throw the policeman—Godfrey was very quiet indeed; we left him—he might have walked away.</p>

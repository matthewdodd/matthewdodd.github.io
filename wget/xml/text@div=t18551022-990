The prosecutor has sworn that I was in his house on 13th Sept., at which time I was at Wateringbury, in Kent, working among the hops; he has stated I was in his-house on the Saturday, and gave him a bad shilling; there are witnesses who could swear I was in Wateringbury on that day, but, unfortunately, I have no means of procuring their attend<lb></lb>ance; I hope the Court will not be satisfied without making the inquiry at Wateringbury; as my circumstances entirely depend on your decision, I trust you will be guided by the evidence; I leave myself in your hands without the slightest doubt as to the result.</p>

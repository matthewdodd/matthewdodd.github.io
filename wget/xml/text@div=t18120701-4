            . On the 14th of June, about a quarter to two, in the morning, I was returning home, from the George public house, in St. Mary Axe; it is a house of call for tailors. I was going to No. 7. Glocester-place, Commercial-road. I live there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been at the George that night - A. I went there, and stopped till rather better than half past one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober at the time of going home - A. Yes; I had drank but two pints of stout.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what happened to you as you were going home at that time - A. As I was going past the corner of Union-street, in the <placeName id="t18120701-4-crimeloc26">Commercial-road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18120701-4-crimeloc26" type="placeName" value="Commercial-road"></interp>

               <p>Q. Were you alone - A. Yes. They tripped me up, and dragged me on the stones to Mr. Whitbread's milk-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that from the place where they first came up to you - A. About twenty yards: they never spoke a word. I felt one of their hands in my trowser's pocket. I had a dollar, a sixpence, and an eighteen penny piece in that pocket I felt a hand there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a watch at the time - A. Yes; that was in my fob. They all ran away. They had got my watch when they ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perceive them take it, did you - A. No; two of them went away together, and the prisoner happened to be the last, and I never lost sight of him from the time he left me until he was taken by the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you on the ground when they left you - A. Yes: I rose up as quick as I could, and ran after him, and got a gentleman who helped to secure him. I was a little way behind when he was laid hold of. I saw him laid hold of. He was never out of my sight from the time he ran away until he was laid hold of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light - A. Yes; I could see him very plain; it was day-break.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. No; I never saw him before. When he was laid hold of, he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010007"></xptr> taken to Whitechapel watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he was laid hold of did he say any thing - A. Not as I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find that you had lost your watch - A. At the time I got up I put my hand to my fob: I found I had lost my watch. I did not perceive my money was gone until I returned home.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you perceived your watch before you had lost it - A. It might be a quarter of an hour. I looked at it in Whitechapel, and put it back again. It was a metal watch. I had it four years and a half. It was given to me by my grandfather.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in the public street that you were walking along that this happened - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You say you were coming along Whitechapel - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw your watch how far might that be to where this happened - A. About four hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose before this happened you saw some women - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not they take the watch from you - A. No. I am certain I had the watch when I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my lord, as I understood, that you never felt your watch go from you - A. I cannot say that I did at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not feel it at any other time - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did you perceive your money go from you - A. No: only one of their hands in my right-hand trowsers pocket. I missed my watch immediately they rose from me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the place where you were down did you see the prisoner stopped - A. I saw him stopped in Lambeth-street: that might be about two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw his face - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, if you convict the prisoner of a robbery, there is a forty pounds reward - A. I have heard such a thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say there was a corner which the prisoner had turned - A. As soon as he let go my head I got up, and ran after him, and called, stop thief. I kept him in sight until I came to the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. When he turned the corner you lost sight of him at the time. Did you catch sight of him again when you came up to the corner - A. Yes. I saw him catched by the watchman and another gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. What street was that the corner of - A. The corner of Lambeth-street.</p>
               <p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty on the 14th of last month. At half past two in the morning I was going my round. I heard the call of stop thief. I was coming up Lambeth-street. I saw the prisoner running round the corner as hard as he could. He ran out of Little Ailiffe-street. I was coming the contrary way. The prosecutor and this gentleman was running after him. I stopped the prisoner, and they came up in about a minute and a half. The prosecutor said he had been robbed of his watch, and that he had been very ill treated. The prisoner said nothing. I had a hard matter to stop him. He crossed the road two or three times. Then I took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it - A. It is light now at two o'clock, and it was so that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor sober - A. Yes. He was very much exhausted with running.</p>

            . I was going home this Sunday morning. About two o'clock I was going to No. 16, Gloucester-street, from Lower Thames-street. I heard the call of stop thief as I was coming up the opposite side of the way, nearly opposite of Whitbread's milk-house. I was walking on. I saw four men together; at the moment I took one of them to be intoxicated, and the others helping him up.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw four men, and one of them down - A. Yes, I think the other men took down towards Gower's wharf. They went part of the way the same as the man that went last. I missed them. Robbins called, stop thief. The prisoner was about three yards from me. The prisoner was running quite fast. I pursued the prisoner; and Robbins followed me as fast as he could. I never was more than three yards from the prisoner until he got to the corner of Lambeth-street, and then I got hold of him. I laid hold of him before he turned the corner. We turned the corner together, and then he got away from me. I am lame in one arm. I could not hold him. I saw the last witness lay hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man that the last witness laid hold of was the person that you pursued - A. I am quite positive.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, As I was coming down the Commercial-road to my lodging in Sun-street, Bishopsgate-street, on the morning mentioned in the indictment, some person was calling out stop thief. A person called to me, do you hear the cry of stop thief? I answered, what is that to me? He said, I was pertinent: he would charge the watch with me. The prosecutor came up when I was stopped. He said, he had been robbed of his watch. He said nothing about losing money at that time.</p>

            ? - A. She lodged in the same house; she is no relation; I took the prisoner up into the room and told her to mind the place; she had lived in the house three weeks.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you leave her in possession of your apartment? - A. I did; she herself called me up at five o'clock, I told her it was too soon to go out; I went out at six, my husband was out at harvest work, I came back about eight o'clock in the morning and she was gone; I missed all the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>

Yes, in the kitchen; I rented it of Mr. Dillon; I left my things in Mrs. Sulivan's room; I thought it was the safest part of the house; I am a single woman; I went out at six o'clock, selling milk; I did not come home till nine; when I came home I went into Mrs. Sulivan's room and found them gone; I saw them on the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make search after the prisoner? - A. I did, but it was of no use; I never saw her till the day she was taken up; she lodged in the house with me; I do not know how she got her living; she had a petticoat of mine on when she was taken; I have never seen the other things.</p>

On Tuesday the 9th of January last, Mr. Byron called at Mr. Gedge's shop; I did not know him before; he had the appearance of a gentleman; he was very genteely dressed; he called to look at some Irish linens; and ordered some to be left at his lodgings in Poland-street the next morning; I went the next morning and took several pieces of linens, and some handkerchiefs; he Bought four pieces of Irish and twelve pocket handkerchiefs; the whole amounted to about twenty-one pounds; this Mr. Byron presented this bill for payment for the goods; I told him, I could not possibly take it, as I knew neither of the parties, without making enquiries about it; I then asked him who this

This is the bill I presented to him; I asked him if that bill was drawn by him; he took the bill into his hand, and looked at it, and he told me it was drawn by him, and it should be paid as soon as it became due; I then left the house, and made some enquiries in the neighbourhood about it; I found he was not known by any person in the neighbourhood; I then immediately went home, and told Mr. Gedge; he said, he would not take the note by any means; we kept the note in our hands three days; the third day Mr. Byron called at Mr. Gedge's shop, to know if we approved of the bill, Mr. Gedge told him, he did not, and could not possibly think of taking it, as he knew nothing of either of the parties; just as he was going out of our shop, a man came in and took him by the arm, and desired him to go with him; he was taken into custody immediately; it was Mr. Lee's man of Charing-cross, a hosier; and he was taken immediately to Justice Hyde's; I know nothing further of the prisoner; this note was presented by Byron.</p>

               <p>What time was this? - It was Monday the 8th of January; in the afternoon I went to No. 4, Argyle-street, and knocked at the door; the prisoner opened the door, and I asked for Mr. Mason; he appeared as the person; I told him I was referred to him, by a Mr. Byron for his character: he asked me if it was H. Byron of Case Haughton; I told him yes; he told me he was a gentleman, and a man of fortune, and that I was very safe; I was then satisfied with the character he gave; I never saw Mr. Mason before.</p>
               <p>But he was the person answering to the name of Mason at this house? - Yes.</p>

            , at the Btitish coffee-house, in New Round-court; I heard it from the mistress of the coffee-house.</p>
               <p>How do you know he was called Mason at that coffee-house; - I called there upon him in the name of Mason, because I am accustomed to these things, in having gentlemen coming to my house not in their own names, on account of their creditors; he told me his name was Mason, and ordered me to call him by that name.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did not you keep the British coffee-house? - Never, Sir; I live at No. 2, Wilson's-court.</p>
               <p>How long afterwards was it that he was at your house, that he ordered you to call on him by the name of Mason? - A great while after; I conceived that to be his name; he lived at the British coffee-house two years ago; I called for him by the name of Mason, but he was not at home, but they answered to the name, and said he was not at home; in consequence of that, he called upon me.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear any body call him Mason? - Not in my house.</p>
               <p>Any where else? - Only at the coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Why you never saw him at the coffee-house? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear any body address him by the name of Mason? - No, I conceive<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210087"></xptr>Mason to be his right name, because he told me so, when he told me to call on him by the name of Mason; it is more than two years ago; I cannot positively say to the time; I was called upon to prove his hand-writing by the Grand Jury, at Guildhall, but as I had never seen him write, I could say nothing on the business.</p>
               <p>Have you ever been a witness in this Court before? - I never was in this Court before this trial came on.</p>
               <p>At any time? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear this man call himself Mason, except in the conversation to you that you have talked of? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any letter from him? Never.</p>
               <p>People enquired for him at your house? - Yes, in the name of Aikles.</p>
               <p>Never in the name of Mason? - No, Sir; he at that time kept a house in Bateman's-buildings, Soho-square, No. 6; his wife used to come to him at my house.</p>
               <p>What name did he keep it in there? - By the name of Aikles.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired for some time, and returned, finding a special verdict, and said they had not the least doubt, but the name of Mason was assumed for the purpose at that time; because, they said, they disbelieved the evidence of the woman; and that it was the sense of the whole Jury, that his name was Aikles, and that the name of Mason was first assumed for this purpose. The Court asked the Jury, if they found that he never went by that name before; to which they replied, never my Lord, we cannot suppose he ever did; Upon which, Mr. Knowlys, counsel for the prisoner, informed the Court, he wished the Jury, having this opinion, would find a general verdict of guilty, subject to the opinion of the Judges.</p>

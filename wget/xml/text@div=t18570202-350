                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Richard Attenborough, of No. 8, Bridge House-place, Newington Causeway. On 1st Nov. the prisoner called there in a sort of dog cart, and asked if we advanced money on plated goods—I said, "What sort of plated goods are they?" he produced a sample parcel, and said that he had the rest with him—I said that I should like to see the bulk—I had asked him how much he wanted, and he said, "100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I said, "How am I to tell about the quality?"—he said, "It is very easy to do that, because these are marked 1, 2, and 3, and Elkinton marks his goods A B and C;" that, they were his manufac<lb></lb>ture, and that his No. 1, which he offered me, was equal to Elkinton's letter A in every respect; that there was as much silver on them as there was on Elkinton's, or anybody else's—I do not think anything particular was said about the foundation, but he said that they were equal to Elkinton's in every respect—he said that he wanted the money to take up a bill—he gave me this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and brought an invoice with him; but he took that back again—he said that he was a manufacturer of those articles at Sheffield, or a Sheffield manufacturer, and had a warehouse in Dyer's buildings—he gave me to understand that he made those articles—he said that he had 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of spoons and forks always on hand, at big warehouse in Dyer's buildings—I do not recollect that he said anything about who was the maker of them; he only said that he was the manufac<lb></lb>turer—I advanced him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them by a cheque—he came again on 4th Nov.—I did not see the dog cart then; but he could not have carried the goods, as he brought ninety dozen, and said that he wanted a further advance to take up a bill—he said that they were the same goods as before, and I lent him 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them (<hi rend="italic">looking at a memorandum</hi>)—he came again, I think, on the 15th, which was Saturday, and left the goods, 150 dozen, I think; but I can tell by looking at this paper—I will swear that it is a correct abstract—it was 150 dozen—I did not feel quite confident, and wished to speak to Mr. Attenborough; in consequence of what I said he left them till Monday—he came on Monday, and I went in with him to Mr. Attenborough, who told him he hoped the goods were of the quality he represented them to be; that he did not care how much money he lent him, provided the goods were genuine; but, if he found out that he was cheating him, he would prosecute him; the defendant assured him that they were all genuine goods, and equal to the representations that he made, and he was very sorry that Mr. Attenborough should make such a remark to him—I said, "You warrant these goods to be equal to Elkinton's letter A?"—he said, "So they are"—I said that I did not think they were so good as some we had purchased at his warehouse in Dyer's buildings, for the purpose of testing the quality—he seemed surprised when I showed him his own spoons; put the two together when I said that, and he pulled out a knife to cut the silver off—we thought we had hurt his feelings, and Mr. Attenborough then agreed to lend him the money, and wrote a cheque for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was left with me, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money, as the defendant could not wait—part of it</p>

B., E. P., which means John Bryant, electro plate—since this has been going on I have learned a little about it—these are very nicely finished; I saw some of them tested, but they did not appear, after testing, as good as Elkinton's; the foundation appeared to be inferior, but as to the quantity of silver on them I do not understand it.</p>

Elkinton's, I should have been perfectly satisfied—Mr. Round, of Sheffield, tested them—some were sent down to him, and Mr. Attenborough had some tested at his own house immediately after we returned from the police Court, on 2nd Jan.—Mr. Round was not present then, he went away to catch the train—they were tested in the presence of Mr. Elkinton's foreman, I do not know his name, and of Mr. Kemp, of London Wall; they were spoons and forks, I brought them from Mr. Attenborough's warehouse, No. 8, Bridge House-place, and gave them to the tester—I saw him test those which I brought from the warehouse—I brought down all that were tested from the warehouse, and gave them into the hands of Mr. Attenborongh, I believe—I did not see the whole process while they were in the tester's hands—I think there were a dozen table</p>

B., and the electro plate is my No. 1, it is the best quality, and is equal in quality and quantity of silver to Elkinton's A, and the foundation is of the best quality "—from the fact of his saying that he was the manufacturer, of course he knew what the spoons were made of, and, from his appearance, I agreed to take them, and at a price entirely from the representations he made of himself and of the goods, and believing he knew what was in the goods—I lent him 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and paid him partly in gold and partly in notes—I have since taken some of them to Mr. Kemp, of London Wall, to be stripped—if I had known what the articles were, as I found them after the testing, I would not have taken them at all.</p>

B., which I received from Mr. Attenborough, and I have them here, with my report—there was a slight difference in the table forks; the others exactly agreed; the table forks were 4 dwts. instead of 2—I have not tested any of those from Cotton's or Russell's (<hi rend="italic">look<lb></lb>ing at them</hi>), they appear the same description as those I received from Mr. Attenborough—if you will allow me, I can, perhaps, make myself more sure upon that point by just scratching with a penknife (<hi rend="italic">scraping one</hi>); I firmly believe them to be of the same quality as those sent down to me—we put on the silver by electricity applied to a certain solution; the article requires preparation previously to the solution being applied; it is polished after the silver is applied—the prisoner is not a manufacturer at Sheffield.</p>

Atten<lb></lb>borough, Russell, and Cotton, the silver disappeared instantly; those of Messrs. Elkinton's make, after being in twenty minutes, the silver was acted upon—there is no doubt about the test, you could see the silver walk off, or run off—independently of the test, the article itself was such as we should never think of sending out of our house, nor would any respectable tradesman—in some of the instances, as regards the dessert forks and spoons, there was a greater disproportion than in the table spoons—Mr.</p>

I made the test at Mr. Attenborough's; Mr. Cotton and Mr. Parker were present the whole of the time, and Mr. Russell part of the time—the test I used was oil of vitriol, and nitric acid—this is my report, made at the time, and certi<lb></lb>fied by several witnesses—I did not strip any spoons and forks belonging to Mr. Attenborough, those I stripped belonged to Mr. Elkinton, Mr. Cotton, and Mr. Russell'; these are Mr. Russell's, I received them from him himself—on three table spoons, I found 1 dwt. 6 grs. of silver; on three table forks I found 16 grs; on three dessert spoons, 16 grs; on three dessert forks, 13 grs.; and on three tea spoons, 12 grs; that is much more than I found on some others—on three table spoons of Elkinton's, I found 9 dwts. 16 grs.; on three table forks, 7 dwts 12 grs.; on three dessert spoons, 6 dwts. 15 grs.; on three dessert forks, 5 dwts. 11 grs.; on three tea spoons, 4 dwts. 20 grs.—I then tested some of Mr. Cotton's; on two table spoons I obtained 7 grs. only; on two table forks, 6 grs.; on two dessert spoons, 4 grs.; on two dessert forks, 4 grs.; on two tea spoons, 2 grs., being one grain to each tea spoon—I stripped both Russell's and Cotton's in from one to two minutes; by the same process it took me from twenty to twenty-five minutes to strip Elkinton's—the foundation of these articles is third quality metal; it is a very common article—I saw Mr. Round test Mr. Attenborough's; I agree with him as to the value of the test, I did not exactly go into figures with him—I have known the prisoner for about two years—he is not a manufacturer at Sheffield to my knowledge; I knew him as a dealer in London, occasionally travelling in the country, as rather a better class of hawker, supplying hotels and so forth, not travelling as a commercial man—I have not known him with any manufactory; I think he has had the place in Dyers'-buildings about nine months; before that he was at some other building, no great distance from there, Staple's Inn buildings, I think—he had no warehouse there, merely an apartment, a lodging—the place in Dyers'-buildings was fitted up with glass cases, and so on, for his goods, commonly called a warehouse.</p>

               <p>two years I carried on business by myself, partly as a dealer, and also as an agent for several Birmingham and Sheffield houses—we are still agents for some houses—we are not directly manufacturers of plated goods, we say that we are manufacturers of electro plate, and we are justified in saying so; we buy goods of the manufacturers in an unfinished state, and have them plated and finished in London—as a matter of strict fact we are not manufacturers—we do not represent ourselves to the public as manufacturers at Sheffield—we have an establishment at Birmingham for the manufacture of jewellery, but not for electro-plate—the firm there if Bostick—we have been under arrangements with him for five years, to take all he can make; we take the whole of his produce; if any one went there to buy goods, they would be bought in our name; they do not sell to any one but ourselves—we sell plated spoons and forks—there is some great trash made for the Spanish market that is unsuited to any other—it is impossible to cover spoons with a less covering of silver than these; but it is possible to have a brass foundation instead of German silver—I am not an assayer, but we have at times to strip them after plating, where there are certain mishaps.</p>

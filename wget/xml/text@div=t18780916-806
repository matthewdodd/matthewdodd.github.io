                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On Saturday afternoon, 10th August, between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day, I was watching the prisoner in Cannon Street, near the Globe Parcels Booking-Office, 33, St Paul's Churchyard—I saw him enter the office—there was a case standing inside; he sat down on it, took an apron from underneath his coat and spread it over his knees; he sat there for about eight or nine minutes—a number of persons were pass<lb></lb>ing in and out of the office—a boy came to the door with a small truck con<lb></lb>taining parcels—the prisoner got off the case and removed it from one side of the passage to the other, looked to the back part of the office, and then removed the case down the steps on to the pavement; he again looked into the office, then placed the case on his shoulder, and proceeded down Old Change in the direction of Knightrider Street—he set the case in the door<lb></lb>way of No. 24, Old Change—I went up to him and asked what he was going to do with the case—he said "Take it to Sutton's"—I said "Did you take it to the Globe Parcels Office?"—he said "Yes; I took it there half an hour ago"—he then started running without the case—I pursued him—he was stopped by a man on Lambeth Hill, and I took him in custody—I opened the case at the station, and found it contained two bottles of whisky, a bottle of liqueur, two pictures, and two pots of marmalade—the prisoner said he was of no occupation, and of no fixed residence.</p>

I was standing about 12 or 13 yards from the booking-office, at the comer of Watling Street; the case was standing about a yard and a half inside the office—I did not stop you on leaving the office, because I wanted to see what you were going to do with it—you went about 160 yards before you put it down—you afterwards gave your correct address, but I had then received information—I did not ask you who the chap was that you were talking to at the booking-office.</p>

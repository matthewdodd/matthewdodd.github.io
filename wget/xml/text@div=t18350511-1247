                  </hi>. I am the wife of Richard Holderness, a pork-butcher, in Bunhill-row. On the 27th of April, at half-past seven o'clock, I was in my room, the door was half open—I heard a noise—I looked into the shop; and saw the prisoner, Sarah Stephens, was putting some pork in her apron—I went to the door, Matilda saw me, and threw a shilling on the counter and asked for a saveloy; but as Sarah was making off with the pork, I went after her, and stopped her, just as she got outside the door—I said, "You have got some pork of mine"—she said, "I have not"—I said, "Yes, you have, I saw you take it, and will see what you have got"—Mr. Hampton, who was over the way, came and saw me take the pork from her—she said it was not mine; she had bought it in Chiswell-street—this is the pork—I swear I saw her take it.</p>

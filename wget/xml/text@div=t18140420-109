               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose a chaise and harness - A. I did. On the 7th of February the prisoner came to my shop and hired a chaise and harness of me for two or three days; it was to be taken over to Mr. Fonteine's premises, opposite of mine; accordingly I took it, and delivered it myself. A few days afterwards I saw the prisoner at Mr. Fonteine's livery-stables. He asked me if I would part with the chaise, and what did I ask for it. I said, forty-five guineas for the chaise. He then stated that he had a chaise at Lamb's Conduit-street, and if I would go and see that chaise to allow him what I could for it, and meet him at a coffee-house near the Exchange, he would talk to me. I was to meet him at half past two that day. I went to the coffee-house at half past two; I waited an hour or more. I saw nothing of the prisoner. Ten days or a fortnight elapsed before I saw the prisoner again, and then I met him at the place where his broken chaise was. I went there to enquire after him; it was at a mews near Lamb's Conduit-street. While I was talking to the stable-keeper the prisoner came in with a one horse chaise, not my chaise. Having heard that he had a grey horse to dispose of, to get a sight of my chaise if I could, I told him I wanted a grey horse for a customer of mine. We both went together to a stable yard, he in his chaise and I in mine. He drove first; I followed him to go and look at the grey horse. He told me it was at the Lemon Tree yard, in the Haymarket; the stable-keeper's name is Spry. I went to the Lemon Tree yard; he there shewed me the grey horse. I then asked him where my chaise was. He said he had an accident with it coming down Bond-street; it was at the coach-maker's to be repaired; he had it new painted and new lined, and made it look very smart. He said it would be home in the morning. On the next morning I took Armstrong, the officer, with me to the Lemon Tree yard, and there I saw my own chaise. I said to the stable keeper, here is my own Tiloury. In about two hours and a half the prisoner came into the yard on horseback; he said he was ready to give me up my chaise, or to pay me for it. I told him it was then out of my power to bargain with him, he must go before the magistrate. He said he had laid out eight pound on the chaise. I have got my chaise again, and the harness.</p>

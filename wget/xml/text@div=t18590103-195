                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 54.) On 30th December, about 7 in the evening, I was with Clark, a policeman, and went to the house of Mrs. Slater, who has been tried before the Magistrate, to search it—we found some things, and some duplicates, and then went to Mr. Basley's, and showed him something, and then to Mr. Philips's shop—Slater was at the station on another charge, and the sergeant said something about Mr. Basley's cotton print, in consequence of which I went to the prisoner's house at 9 o'clock that evening, took her into custody, searched the house, and found twenty-three duplicates in a dust heap in the back yard—she sent her girl</p>

               <p>to fetch them—she told me that the reason why they were there was, because she did not want her husband to know she had so many—among those duplicates I found one for a gown, pledged on 23d December in the name of Faulkner for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and went to Philips's shop on the following morning—that gown was afterwards shown to Mr. Basley.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Philips, a pawnbroker of Stratford—I produce a gown which does not appear to have been worn, pledged on 23d December—I cannot say by whom—I have seen the prisoner in our place—I gave this duplicate to whoever pawned the article—both the women had been continually at the shop in December, over and over again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I said, "What will become of my poor children, and what are you putting it on my back for?"—and she said, "I will be a mother to your children." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There was some little conversation between them, but I could not hear what they said.</p>

I am a linen-draper of Stratford—between the 6th and 10th December I missed a large quantity of cotton goods from my shop-door, and gave information to a constable, and patterns of the goods—on 31st December I was shown the piece of cotton produced, which is made up into a dress—I believe it to be mine, and part of that which I lost; I only speak to it by the pattern—I had not sold any when I lost it, and the whole piece was taken—I have sold none since, it is not a common pattern—I lost the whole of two patterns.</p>

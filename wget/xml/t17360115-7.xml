            . Capt. Smith brought the Prisoner that Night, into my Kitchen, (assisted by his Friend) and charged him with the Fact. They searched him, and found nothing upon him; I said it was not usual for these Fellows, to keep what they steal in such a way, about them; and would have had 3 Men searched, who followed them into the Kitchin at some Distance, but they slipp'd off. and presently after the Prisoner took an Opportunity to cape; but being pursu'd, he was taken, and brought back; then he begg'd for Pity, and cry'd; but all of a sudden, he changed his Note - And said who dared detain him without a Peace Officer? - And fell to fighting, and laying about him in a desperate Manner, and would have made his Escape, if I had not seized him by the Collar, and detained him. Presently after this, a Man, who sometimes plies as a Porter for me, came, and desired to speak with me; he told me, he had found the Gentleman's Watch: The Captain described the Watch to me; and the Place were the Fellow found it, answers to the Account, the Captain gave of his losing it.</p>

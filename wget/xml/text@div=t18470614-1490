                  </hi>. I am a porter in the employ of the Eastern Counties Railway Company. On the morning of the 22nd of May I concealed myself behind a sack of flour in the flour-warehouse—after remaining there about two hours the prisoners came—they walked across the floor of the ware-house to find a broom—they could not find any—they went to the upper-floor and came down with brooms in their hands—they went and opened the inner door of the granary, and walked from thence to where this flour was—Kynaston walked by the sacks as they stood—Miller called him back, and</p>

               <p>said, "Stop; here is a sack"—Kynaston went back to him—they undid the sack—it was loose but not opened—they opened it, and each of them took flour out, and put it into a bag or cloth—each of them had some—they put it under their clothes and went away—I went to the sack and found it was pulled together, but not tied—it had been tied before—I missed from 8lbs. to 9lbs. of flour from it.</p>

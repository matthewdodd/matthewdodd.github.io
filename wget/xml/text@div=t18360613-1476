On the 23rd of May, about nine o'clock in the morning, I was in Chiswell-street—I saw one of Mr. Johnson's carts drawn up to Type-street, loaded with paving-stones, and four pieces were out of the cart on the ground—the prisoner was at the hind part of the cart with the carman—he and the carman together assisted in taking out three pieces more of stone, and the cart went away—I had the curiosity to go to the prisoner, and said to him, "Where have these stones come from?"—he said, "From Westminster"—I said, "I do not believe that, as I saw you come up Milton-street"—he then said, "Them stones was brought from London Wall"—I said, "What are you going to do with them?"—he said, "We are going to pave that little court," pointing to Miles court, Type-street—I took him over to a man who lives</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman to Messrs. Johnsons, paviors. On the 23rd of May I was directed by Mr. Chadwick to take some old stones from London-wall to the City Stone-yard—I had been one week in Messrs. Johnson's employ—I never saw the prisoner till past eight o'clock that morning, when I saw him at London-wall—before he came up I had ob<lb></lb>served him talking to some of Johnson's men—after I had laden the cart full of stones, the prisoner said, "You are going to the City Stone-yard with these stones?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I am in Messrs. Johnson's a employ, and am going to use a few of them"—I said, "Whereabout?"—he said, "Come along with me, I will show you; it is all in your road going along"—we went down Milton-street, and, at the corner of Type-street, he said, "I am going to use some here"—I said, "Very well"—I took out the tail-board, and we got out these stones—he said, "These will do for the present; I shall see what more I want"—I went on to the City Stone-yard, and unloaded; and then the policeman came to me—I did not count what stones I left, but I belive it was seven.</p>

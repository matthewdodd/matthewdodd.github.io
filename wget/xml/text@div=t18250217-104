I took hold of Wortley and the parcel; I asked what he did there, and was going to take him out of the room, but was stopped by Mrs. Benjamin and her son. I told my brother officer to take Bennett, who had come in, I took a pair of handcuffs out of my pocket to put on their hands - Mrs. Benjamin came up to me, and pushed me away, and said she would give me two sovereigns if I would let them go - she then said she would give me three sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you state before the Magistrate that Mrs. Benjamin took hold of you and put herself in your way, and hindered you? A. I told him there was money offered me - I did not mention about Mrs. Benjamin interrupting me - I said when I went into her house money was offered me - I did not say that she laid hands on me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined here as a witness against these two young men last session? A. Yes; and said she laid hold of me.</p>

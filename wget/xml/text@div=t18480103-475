                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Peter Charles Bruneau, of 5, Oxendon-street. On the evening of 16th Dec., about seven o'clock, I was on the second-floor landing, and heard a door shut up stairs on the third floor—the prisoner came down—my father asked him what he wanted up stairs—he did not say anything—I went up to the bed-room, and found my sister's box opened, and my shawl removed from the cupboard and put on a box next to the door—I had been in the room about an hour before, and the things were safe then—I had locked the door when I came out—I gave an</p>

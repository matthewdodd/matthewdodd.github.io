                  </hi> I am a greengrocer, and live at No. 27, Eliza<lb></lb>beth-street. Eaton-square, Pimlico—Cloud was in my service, and stopped with me a fortnight after the robbery. On the 28th of May I was called down at eight o'clock in the morning—I found the kitchen window was open, and a table which stood near it had been moved; a box which was there had been unlocked, and a small pasteboard box, which contained jewellery, was gone—the key of the box had been in the table-drawer the night before, where it has been always kept; and the box had been in the same place these four years—I had been sleeping there myself till recently—I found my clothes all thrown on the ground, the drawers all open, and every thing dis<lb></lb>turbed</p>

               <p>and confused; and the head and foot of the bed were turned up-there is a trap grating over the area, and that was lifted up—I did not keep it fastened—it could be opened by anybody, and when anybody got into the area, they could get in at the kitchen window—I do not know whether the window was shut on the over night—Cloud did not sleep on my premises—he left about nine in the evening—I do not know what time he came the morning—I was not up till eight—I sent Cloud for a policeman—he returnes without one—I waited a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and I sent him again—he then returned with one this brooch is mine—it was gives me by Stanford, and he told me where I should find the locket—here is the mark where the pin was broken—the gold was broken out, and I had a small plate put to it—it is a very old brooch—it is not for the worth of it that I prize it—it had a glass in it, and a piece of hair—this is my locket, and chain and key—here is the reminder of the chain which I was wearing at the time—I value all the property I missed at 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it cost me a great deal more—I could have got 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it if I had wanted to part with it—I found the locket at Mrs. Hughan's—I had seen my box safe on the day before the robbery—I kept my cash there, and had occasion to go to it that day—these things are part of the jewellery I had there.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner Cloud on the 17th of June—I told him it was for being concerned in a rob<lb></lb>bery, at his master's house, on the 28th of May—I showed him the brooch and locket, and said he had been offering them for sale—he said he had not himself been offering them for sale, but Robert Hugham had offered them, and he was with him—I mentioned the circumstance of his being in the eating-house with two others, and told him the ale glasses out of which they were drinking were cut—he said it was not him that cut the glasses, it was Robert Hughan, and that the subject of the robbery had been introduced by <hi rend="italic">Buck</hi> Anthony (I did not then know who he meant)—he said he had received the watch and the diamond rings from <hi rend="italic">Buck</hi> Anthony, and had given them to Robert Hughan—he also stated that he had been drawn inno<lb></lb>cently into it by the others—I apprehended Hodgson—on the way to the station, I asked him how he came in possession of the seal and chain—he said he found them in Hyde-park, on the Sunday morning previous—it was on Saturday, the 19th of June, that I took him—the Sunday before must have been the 13th of June—he said he was walking across the park, by himself, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, and he found the seal and chain lying on the grass, near a plantation, about 500 yards from the</p>

               <p>Stanhope-gate—I inquired which gate he went in at—he said, "At knights<lb></lb>bridge"—I have since examined the park between the two gates—there is not a plantation near the footpath—the distance from one gate to the other is about 300 yards—I apprehended Adams, I told him what he was charged with—he said he knew nothing about it, and if justice was done to him, he was innocent of the charge.</p>

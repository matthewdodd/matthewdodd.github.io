            . I am one of the marshal's men. I was on my duty at the <placeName id="t17690222-63-crimeloc378">Mansion-house</placeName>

There was a great riot and disturbance, with a number of people before the Mansion-house. I saw the prisoner Williams there among them. They were hallooing out Wilkes and Liberty, and throwing stones up at the windows, and breaking the lamps. We went out by turns at the back door to try if we could detect any body; I went out and saw the prisoner go and pick up a stone and throw it. I saw it go over the stone banisters, where it hit I could not see. I went and took hold of him, but he wrenched himself away from me. I catched him again and took him into the Mansion-house. I received a good deal of hurt on getting him in at the gate by other people. There were four of the lamps broke in the front of the house, and several windows that night; some were broke before I took the prisoner. We secured him in the house till the mob was gone, then we took him to the Compter.</p>

               <p>I was a little in liquor, and there were a vast number of people assembled before the Mansion-house. I thought I could not get through without I was busy amongst them, so I catched up a bit of dirt, or some thing, lest I should get some hurt among them. I came out of the Strand, and was going to White Chapel, and could not go on the other side the way. I did not intend to do any damage. I thought it the best way to do as they did to get through.</p>

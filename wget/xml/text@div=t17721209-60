            . I remember this man's receiving sentence in September sessions, 1767; he was convicted on the 14th of September. I was at the lower part of the chain, when we were taking the transports to put on board the vessel at Black-friars; one of my men came, and informed me, Doyle and another had got from the chain and run away.</p>

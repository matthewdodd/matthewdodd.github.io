            . Q. Had you known the prisoner before? A. No; my father was not at the cart all the time - he was gone down Old-change with a large bundle on his back - it was between twelve and one o'clock in the day - there were not many people walking about - there was a woman selling apples, and she saw it - I saw the prisoner again in about half an hour - the cart was then led away up Old-change - I am not mistaken in him - I took particular notice of him - I was frightened when I was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. You were quite speechless? A. Yes - he dropped the parcel on the pavement when I got up again - he put it down as I walked towards him - he chucked it down, and broke the string - I took the parcel up while I was on my knees - I was almost up when he threw it down - I was in the road - he ran away, not taking any thing with him - the parcel is not very heavy.</p>

            . I live at No. 111, Cheapside. I was present, and saw Holt on the ground with the parcel in his hand - I saw the prisoner running - the boy was on his knees calling out, "Stop thief" - I did not see him get off his knees - I followed the prisoner through St. Paul's churchyard - he ran along the back of St. Paul's into Newgate-street - then left off running, and walked down Butcherhall-lane - I saw the policeman take him - I never lost sight of him, and am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not turn a corner? A. Yes, he turned two corners - I saw round both corners - I cannot see through a house; but I saw him turn the corner - I was following after him, within a dozen yards - I did not turn the corner at the same time; but I did not lose sight of him - I was not so close to him, when he turned the corner, as I was before, and of course lost sight of him - I knew him again the moment I got my eye on him - the boy cried, "Stop thief," as loud as he could bawl - he was not running when he was calling"Stop thief."</p>

             (City policeman, No. 36). I took the prisoner into custody in Bartholomew-close - he had been previously stopped by a crowd who followed him - I do not recollect seeing Sayer till we came to the top of Butcherhall-lane - I took him at the corner of Old Change, and the boy was there with the cart - that was about three hundred yards from where I took him - there is one turning into St. Paul's Church-yard, another into Newgate-street, a third into Butcherhall-lane, and a fourth into Bartholomew-close.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How near was Sayer to the prisoner when you took him? A. I cannot say, but to the best of my recollection the first time I saw him was near the corner of Butcherhall-lane - there is a turning between where I saw Sayer, and where I took him - Sayer certainly might have had me in sight when I took the prisoner - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100038"></xptr>do not mean to say he was not present - he might be in the crowd - there was a cry of "Stop thief" - Sayer was standing with the rest of the crowd when I saw him, and appeared to have been running - I should think it is above one hundred yards from where I took him to where I saw Sayer standing.</p>

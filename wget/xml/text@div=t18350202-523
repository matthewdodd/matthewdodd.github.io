                  </hi>. I live in Waterloo-place, and am a hackney-coach-man. I have known the prisoner a year and a half, or two years—he is a waterman—on the 5th of December I saw him on the stand—he said he had got two nose-bags for sale—he brought them out of the public-house, and asked 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was all I had—my coach was then at the Finsbury election—these are the bags—the name is on them, but it was then daubed over with grease—I pointed the prisoner out, and he was taken.</p>

            . On the 16th of October, I was working at army jackets, two jackets for marines, and two for privates. The prisoner, on that day, came to my lodgings; I went out between ten and eleven, I left her with my two children; I left the four jackets in my room, two finished and two not I returned to my lodgings about ten minutes after eleven, the prisoner and the jackets were gone. In consequence of what my landlady told me.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310040"></xptr>I went in pursuit of the prisoner; I found her at her lodgings in George-street, formerly called Dyot-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the jackets - A. No, the constable found the collars, lining, cuffs, and buttons to the jackets, in her bundle in her room.</p>
               <p>- GALLEY. I am a constable. I went with the prosecutrix to apprehend the prisoner; I found her at No. 7, George-street, St. Giles's, I found a bundle in the room. I opened the bundle and the prosecutrix claimed it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. These pieces of cuffs, linings, collars, are what I had in my room for the two made jackets.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen her there that morning - A. Yes; she came in between nine and ten, she had nothing in her hand then, I saw her very plain at the door, scraping her feet; and when she came down she had the basket in her hand; she asked what o'clock it was, I told her half-after ten; she said she was to take them in by eleven.</p>

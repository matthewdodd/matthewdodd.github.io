               <p>Are you sure it was the prisoner? - Yes; I knew the prisoner; he laid the duplicates down on the compter; he said he knew the hand-writing of the duplicates, that they were his things.</p>
               <p>What become of them afterwards? - My sister came in to show me the tickets, to see what they came to; I then saw the prisoner shove them all into the woman's apron, and bid her go away, and he went after her; my sister went over to the woman that pawned them, and she came to me and desired me not to surprise myself, that she knew where to find them. On Monday morning the prisoner came to my house again; there was no one at home but myself at the time, and I could do nothing with him; he was very bold, and asked me what I intended to do, if I meant to advertise them; I said no, why should I advertise them when I knew where they were, that he was the man that had taken them; he said I must be mistaken, for he was not the man. My sister then came in and said, I am surprised you should say so, you know you are the man; I said I would swear that he was the man; he said that they were his things and that he valued them at three pounds; I told him I valued them at thirty shillings, that he had taken them from me; I knew they were his things, the woman told me so when she brought them to pledge.</p>
               <p>You had him taken up? - Yes; he was examined by Justice Wright, and committed to Bridewell.</p>

He had a woman with him who had a large cloak and bonnet on. She looked at the shirt, and told him it was his; he then asked for a handkerchief pawned for one shilling; I reached it, and then took the duplicate and tickets to my sister to look at, and in the mean time he shoved the things into the woman's apron, and they went out.</p>

               <p>I went down to the prosecutrix for the things; she said she had burnt the duplicates when she had given the people the things. I have a witness here to prove it.

I said so upon my oath.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell the prisoner you would advertise them when the man was present that took them away, and you knew he was the man that took them away? - I did to be sure say it to him, because I had said it to Cardwell. He said you told Cardwell you would give half a guinea reward. I said, so I would rather than have any trouble, upon which he said, I am three pounds out of pocket, how is that to be settled.</p>

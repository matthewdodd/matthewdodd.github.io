                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Josiah Wilson; he is a farmer and market gardener, at Enfield Highway and Edmonton. The prisoner was in his employ as a labourer; he was employed in digging—he came about six or seven weeks ago—he brought a spade with him, which was not a good one; it was not capable of doing the work—I got him a new one, which my master told me to get from his ironmonger's—I did not pay for it—the prisoner had worked four or five weeks before I gave him that spade—when I gave it him, he worked through the week with it, and came on the Saturday night for his wages—I cannot say how much I paid him; it was somewhere about 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—his wages were 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, but he had lost three quarters of a day by stopping away—when he was paid it was his duty to leave the spade at my house—I gave charge to the men to leave the spades at my house, if they belong to Mr. Wilson; if they are their own I do not trouble myself with it—the prisoner did not give up his spade that evening—I saw him again on the next day, Sunday evening; he came into my house two or three times; and I said, "What do you want here?"—he paused for about a minute, and then said, "Lend me a shilling"—I did so; and I said, "Remember to be up in the morning, and come to the Halfway field early; I shall be there myself—I was there, but he did not come—he had not left the spade at my house on the Saturday night, but I did not speak to him about it on Sunday, because I thought he would bring it with him on Monday morning to hip labour.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Enfield Highway. I bought this spade of the prisoner, about three weeks or a fortnight ago; it was on a Saturday night—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I asked him if it was his own, and he said, "Yes"—he said he had been digging for <hi rend="italic">Josh</hi> Wilson, and he did not intend to do any more work for him, and he would sell his spade.</p>

I received information on 28th March, and went in search of the prisoner—I did not find him that day, but I found him on the 30th, at his own lodging—he was very drunk—I said, "I want you, about that spade"—he said, "What spade?"—I said, "Mr. Wilson's spade; I came to take you into custody for stealing it"—on the road to the station he said, "I suppose if you get the spade that is all you want?"—I said, "That is just what I do want"—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> Challis has got the spade"—I went to Challis', and he said he had got the spade which he bought of the prisoner in the tap room of a public-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I was intoxicated when I sold the spade; I meant to get it back again, and take it to Mr. Wilson's; I went down last Thursday to see if I should get the spade, and I called the foreman outside, and he told me not to bring it back, or I should have done it; I came up to. London, and was at work three weeks at the gasworks in Oxford-street.</p>

I know Conner was at the house of Herbert on the 3d, being the day<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175901170004"></xptr> after, in the morning. I was going to see about, to find the remains of what were scattered about; one Smith told me he saw a bundle of things carried into Herbert's house; I went and got a warrant from Justice Barry, and went and searched the house, and found a sheet and a towel; there had been my name on the sheet; we could see a name had been picked out, so I can't swear to them. Mrs Herbert told me her husband was gone to pawn a petticoat in Long-Lane, Smithfield, and that Conner had brought a bundle in for him to pawn with that in it; I went in pursuit of Herbert, and found him with the petticoat upon him. It was not quite finished; I am pretty sure it is my wife's property, but she is not in a condition capable to attend the court, so is not here. I lost more wearing apparel, that I have great reason to believe was not consumed in the flames, to a great value.</p>

            . I live near Mr Cotes in Shadwell; the Wednesday after the fire was, which was on a Tuesday, Herbert came to my House with a bundle under his arm; he told me he was going to fit some things on a lady at Covent-Garden. He came to tell me I might get work where the fire had been; I am a carpenter and joyner; he desired me to call at his house concerning some money I ow'd him. When I came there, they said the landlord Herbert was gone off with some things stolen from the fire; I said he was at my house; I told them he said if the things got wet (for it rain'd) it would be the ruin of him. I and a constable went back to my house with another man, and found he had left word with my wife he would call again at two o'clock: I went with the constable at the time, and took him at my house with the petticoat; he said he had met the lady in Rosemary-lane, and they had drank two bottles of wine together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the things the first time he came to your house?</p>
               <p>Walmsley. No, he did not open them. The petticoat produced in court. This I saw taken out of his handkerchief before the Justice.</p>

            . I had a warrant brought me to search Herbert's house; we made a diligent search but could find nothing; we were for taking the woman away, the man not being at home. She said, If we would stay, she would shew us something, which she did. A sheet, a towel, and some wrappers. Producing them.</p>

I call'd for a pot of purl, and before I had drank it the people came in, and his wife told them I brought the things in there, and they took me.</p>

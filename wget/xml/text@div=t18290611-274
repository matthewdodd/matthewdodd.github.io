               <p>GEORGE COOMBS. I come from the prison in custody: I know the prisoners at the bar - I became acquainted with Conway about three years ago, he at that time lived in the Temple with a Mr. Bale; I was living as clerk to Mr. Busby, a barrister - our acquaintance was broken off, and resumed about four months since, when I saw him in the Temple: I was still living with Mr. Bushy; I told him where I was living - he stated that he was living with Mr. Hinrich, in the Adelphi; I had taken him to Mr. Busby's chambers, and this conversation was there; he asked me if I would call any evening, after six o'clock, at Mr. Hinrich's house to see him - I agreed to do so; Mr. Hinrich lived at No. 9, John-street, Adelphi - he is a solicitor; we saw each other frequently after that; we sometimes met at Mr. Hinrich's house, and sometimes at the Brunswick coffee-house, in Pickett-street, Temple-bar, kept by Jonathan Busby; I recollect Conway saying to me that he was very much in want of money - that he had unfortunately seduced a young girl who lived at Mr. Hinrich's house, and he wished to marry her; he said if he did so, he feared he had not sufficient from his employment to keep her, and the only thing he could do, was to ask Mr. Hinrich to advance him 10l.; the next evening when I met him there, he said Mr. Hinrich had declined to do so - this was about the beginning of March; a few evenings after that I went there, and he said Mr. Hinrich had refused to advance him the money, and he knew how he could obtain some money if I could obtain him a blank cheque; I said I did not know how to obtain one, and if I did I should not like to do it; the conversation dropped then, and I appointed to meet him next evening at the coffee-house in Pickett-street; I did so - while we were in there reading the newspaper over, Martelly was there, and got into conversation with us - I only knew him before by seeing him at this coffee-shop; Martelly said he had been out of work a long time, and asked if we knew of any situation we could tell him of; I said I knew of none - Conway answered the same; Martelly said he had been out of a situation since last September and no one could assist him, and he was almost starving - I think he said if he did not soon obtain employment he must do something; Conway answered, and asked him if he could obtain a blank cheque, and I recollect Conway saying he knew of a good go - Martelly said he could obtain one, that his father had been a clerk, and I think he said at a banking-house; Conway then asked me whether I would give my consent to his procuring one; I said I would leave it entirely to him - Conway and myself got up and went out, Martelly followed us, and said if we were afraid to let him get the cheque, he would tell us of a circumstance for which we might have a down upon him: I understood, from what he related afterwards, that we could tell of a circumstance he had committed in case he split upon us; he said, that about two years ago he saw an advertisement in the paper of a young man wanted at a wholesale stationer's in Cornhill, and that security was required; that he endeavoured to get the situation by forging the name of some security, and that he obtained the situation, and was sent round the country to obtain orders; he received money for other orders which had been completed - and that on one occasion when he went out there was a great deal of money owing, that he had contrived to collect as much as 200l., absconded, and went off to New York with it; I believe Williams and Co. of Cornhill, was where he got the situation; Conway said he felt disposed to let him have the cheque - we then parted, and he promised to meet us next day at the coffee-house in Pickett-street, this was about the 12th of March; we met, and Martelly said he had got information from his father how he could obtain cheques, but he knew a clerk living with a solicitor in Old Burlington-street, who kept cash at Drummonds, he said he would rather go there and try to obtain a blank cheque than that he would go from the information of his father - he appointed to meet me on the following morning at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q.Before that application did Conway say any thing?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110117"></xptr>A. I do not remember: he was to meet me at the coffee-shop, in Pickett-place, next morning; I met him there, and he asked if I would walk a little way with him - we went to Old Burlington-street: nothing whatever passed about where we were going to; when we got there, he asked me to wait at the corner of the street until he returned - I did so; when he returned, he said he had been to the gentleman he thought he could get the check from, and was sorry to say he had not obtained one, and could not obtain one; he did not mention the clerk's name, but said the solicitor's name was Hoper - we came back again to the coffee-house, and in a short time I left him; in the evening we all three met there - Martelly stated to Conway that he could not obtain the cheque there, and he must go to his father's, and get information how he could obtain it - we were to meet there next morning again; I and Martelly met there next morning - he said he had got information how he was to obtain the cheque-book, by going to Drummond's, and asking for a cheque-book in the name of Mr. Hoper - he said he would see Conway, would tell him of it, and he would go next morning to Drummond's to obtain the cheque-book: he appointed to meet me next morning, at half-past nine o'clock, at the coffee-house in Pickett-place - I went, and Martelly was not there; he came in about half an hour after, and said he had been and obtained the cheque-book; that I was to accompany him to Conway's office - we went together to Mr. Hinrich's office, and I saw Conway; I do not remember what day that was - there were several cheques shown me by Martelly; he had them in his hand when I first saw them; they were filled up, ready to go to the banker's - he showed me several; they had Mr. B. W. Horne's name on them; I believe he belongs to the Golden Cross, Charing-cross: as Conway had shown me a letter which had come from Mr. Horne to Mr. Hinrich, Conway asked me which signature I thought was the best; fetched a letter, with the name of B. W. Horne to it, and asked me to compare it; I said I thought he was better able to tell than myself - Martelly was there - I had seen Conway write the signature" 
               <persName id="t18290611-274-person1985">B. W. </persName>
            Horne" from the letter, on a blank piece of paper; he asked Martelly if he would select one - Martelly selected one, which he thought would do: it was put into my hands to present at Drummond's; Martelly said I must go to Drummond's to get the money for it - Conway was by; I took the cheque, but told them I thought I could not present it, for I thought I should betray myself - Martelly said he would go himself.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any woman in the office? A. A pot of ale was sent for, which I paid for; there was a woman there; I believe her name is Mead; she brought the ale - we were all together when she brought it; we each partook of some ale: Mrs. Mead left the room; Martelly said he would go and present the cheque, and that I should not have any of the money; I said he might do as he pleased: I do not recollect saying any thing else - the cheque was for 100l.; Conway made answer, and said I should have a share - we then all three went out for the purpose of going to Drummond's with the cheque.</p>
               <p>Q. When the cheques were brought, with the name of Horne to them - were they all filled up? A. Yes; Martelly asked if there should not be a signature at the back of the cheque? Conway said he did not think it was necessary, but he could put it if he Martelly pleased, and he put on the back "Wood and Co., Long-acre" - this is the cheque, (looking at it) - I saw him put that name at the back - the cheque appeared as if it had been fresh drawn when I first saw it; nothing else passed - we walked together arm-in-arm to Drummond's, the bankers' door, which I believe is in Parliament-street - it is three or four doors from Spring-gardens; I understand that to be Parliament-street - it is about sixty or seventy yards from the figure on horseback, at Charing-cross: Martelly went into Drummond's - I and Conway were very near the door when he went in; I and Conway walked on in the street towards the Horse-guards, on the same side of the street: we crossed over, and waited at the corner of the street, and looked for Martelly coming out - we stood at the corner of Craig's-court, which is nearly opposite Drummond's; we saw Martelly come out, and cross over in a direction for St. Martin's-lane - we walked fast, and got up to him; Martelly said he had got the money - we went as far as Bedford-street, Covent-garden, and took a coach to Coleman-street, in the City; Martelly gave me in the coach twenty sovereigns, and Conway twenty sovereigns - he counted twenty, being all he had remaining in gold, which he kept for himself; we all three got out of the coach in Coleman-street, and Martelly said he would go into the Bank of England to change the notes with Conway - I remained at the corner of Tokenhouse-yard: they went away together - I remained where I was, and in about twenty minutes I saw them at the corner of the Bank and Bartholomew-lane; they came towards me, and we walked together as far as King-street, Cheapside, took a coach, and went to Lant-street, in the Borough - I and Martelly stopped in a coach, while Conway went into a house to see his young woman; he came out and got, into the coach again, and we went on to No. 7, William-street, Waterloo-road - a person named Johnson kept the house; I went there for the purpose of seeing a young woman named Smith: while we were in the coach going to William-street, Martelly gave me twelve sovereigns and 1l. 6s. 6d. in silver, and the same to Conway; I was acquainted with Smith - I lived with her occasionally; we had a bottle of wine there - Smith was there: we staid there about half an hour - I gave the landlord money to get the wine; I did not pull any out of my pocket - I pulled sufficient to pay for the wine out of my pocket, and gave it to the landlord; I gave the girl Smith two sovereigns - Martelly and Conway went away in about half an hour, but I remained there the whole of the evening; I did not go any where with Smith that evening; I may have pulled ten or twelve sovereigns out when I gave her the two; I cannot safely say there were more than ten.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not brought into this business altogether against your will? A. I accepted the money - I did enter into this king of life against my will, and continued it all through against my will - it might be going on a fortnight from the time it was first proposed - I was then out of employ; I had been with Mr. Busby, a barrister - before that, I was with a Mr. Martin, a silversmith, of Falcon-court, Fleet-street - that was seven years ago; I was in his employ I think about a year and a half, and should think a year and a half elapsed from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110118"></xptr>that time till I went to Mr. Busby - I left that situation in consequence of having ruptured myself by carrying more than I was able; and at the end of a year and a half I went to Mr. Busby - I left Mr. Busby for a short time, then I went to live with Mr. Spearman, No. 11, Paper-buildings; I was only a month with him; Mr. Busby's was the first situation I took after leaving Martin; I left Mr. Busby, and went to live with Spearman, and Mr. Busby took me back again; I swear I was in no person's employ from the time I left Martin till I went to Mr. Busby - I only went to live with Mr. Spearman while his servant was absent through illness.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you leave Mr. Busby? A.Conway had done something wrong at Mr. Bale's chambers; and as he came to see me, I believe, Mr. Busby discharged me; he charged me with nothing up to the time I went to live with Mr. Spearman; it was not for any thing I had done that he discharged me - he did make a charge against me about three months ago; it was for fees I had put to my own use - Mr. Busby, I believe, saw I had no intention of robbing him, as I expected some money by which I could have made the fees up - he knew it was in my power, and had he not discovered it before, it would have been made up - he did not make an accusation of robbery - he charged me with taking nine or ten guineas - I had no salary but the clerk's fees - it was not more than ten guineas that I kept - he did not accuse me of doing this for any length of time for he knew what I should receive - I was absent from the office when he discovered it - I did not fall out with Mr. Spearman - he found no fault with me - he is a barrister or conveyancer, I do not know which - I was only his servant, and never received fees for him - I lived with Mr. Busby, altogether five years and a half - I gave no information about the prisoners till I was in custody - I was sorry for the offence I had committed, when I was in custody - I gave information because the other prisoners, I believe, had offered to give information themselves - I gave information, because I believed they meant to do so, if I did not - that was my reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was to save yourself, and from no motive of honesty? A. I thought it my duty to do so from the persuasion of my parents - I submitted to their persuasion; it was not altogether to save myself - I do not know whether I shall escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not a hope that you will be saved, if they are convicted? A.From what my parents say I believe I shall - I made the statement by their persuasion - it was not from the pure motive of getting off myself - I do not hope to get off if they are convicted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Then if that is the case, your disclosure has been voluntary all along, and you come here for the purpose of justice? A. I have acceded to the persuasion of my parents; it is not with the hope of getting off myself that I gave the evidence I have - it is not for the hope of escaping - I do not see that I have been guilty of many more offences -Mr. Busby's ten guineas is one; there are no others, I swear - I know Mr. Hinrich's house; he had no lodger when I first went there - he had one the last time I went there.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you happen to know whether that lodger had a box? A.Conway took me up one night into a room to show me a box; when it was opened by Conway there was some china and glass in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were never guilty of any thing but Mr. Busby's ten guineas? A. I said I had not been guilty of many more; Conway took two pieces of glass out of the box, the rest did not remain there certainly; some of the things were in my possession - Conway gave them to me- and I took them to the pawnbroker's - I left the tickets with the keeper of the coffee-shop - I believe that is all the offences I have committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you include highway-robbery and burglary? A. I believe they have all been enumerated - I know Goodyear, of Holywell-street, Strand - I used to inhabit his house - I was never accused of what happened there- he may have been the owner of beads, and so have I.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the beads he owned the same as you became the owner of? A. They were - he did not give them to me - I never before committed a similar offence to that the prisoners are charged with - I cannot say in what month I became acquainted with Martelly; it was certainly this year; I should think about February - my intimacy with Conway had been renewed about a fortnight or three weeks before that - I was not guilty of any offence like this during that time, nor did I know of any - I redeemed Hinrich's lodger's things - I do not know that that was the reason I was not prosecuted - I pawned the glass, took it out, and it was pledged again; I was not threatened by any one with a prosecution about them - I never had any thing to do with them, except through Conway; I had no intimation that any prosecution was going to take place. Martelly had been in custody a month or five weeks when I made this disclosure; I only knew it by seeing it in the newspapers -I do not know whose hand-writing the cheque is, for I did not see it written; I know Martelly's hand-writing; I did not look at them so minutely, as to say whether they were his writing (looking at one): I cannot say whether it is his or not; I do not believe it is; I thought they all appeared in the same hand-writing, from what I saw of them - I have seen a piece of paper with Mr. Horne's name written several times on it - I do not know where it is; it was never in my possession - I had seen that paper before I knew Martelly. but only once - I was apprehended rather more than five weeks ago - I then lived in Newcastle-court with my cousin, not with Smith - I believe the premises were searched after I was taken - I saw in Mr. Gates' hands a pocket-book, which I believe was found there - I left it there - there was no practising of Mr. Horne's writing there - none could be found, for I never had any, and never did practise the writing; I left none at Mr. Busby's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send to the prosecutor's, or they come to you, on this information being given? A. I gave the information at Bow-street before I was sent to gaol: but I made out a written statement in Newgate - I had been asked to do it before by my sister, at Bow-street, but declined - I was never directly asked by any body else to do it, nor told there was already enough to convict me, and I might as well do it to save myself, or that every thing was known - I heard somebody else had made a statement - I sent a letter to Salmon, the officer, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110119"></xptr>May, before I was in custody, or charged with any thing; I had seen nothing in the newspapers about it except the account of Martelly being in custody - it did not say I was charged as being concerned.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say you did not know you yourself was charged with it? A. I knew Salmon was seeking for me - I heard so, but in what way I really do not know; I wrote the letter before I was in custody.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Then you were apprehended in consequence of a disclosure? A. Yes, and nothing else - Conway was then in custody; I have stated all the charges which were made against me up to the time this business happened - I was never charged with embezzlement by any body but Mr. Busby; I left Mr. Martin on account of rupturing myself; I did not leave without his knowledge - I gave him regular notice; that is more than six years ago - I know a Mr. Hamlet; I never saw any of his writing - I have seen Conway write; I have seen an imitation of it, but never imitated it myself.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You wrote to Salmon - was there an accusation against you about something which happened after the business of Drummond's? A. I did not know it - I heard Salmon was after me about a forgery, and I wrote to him; I believe I was wanted about Mr. Hamletts and Mr. Horne's business - Mr. Hamletts happened after this; Conway shewed me an imitation of Mr. Hamletts hand-writing soon after the forgery on Drummond's was committed - it was before Martelly was in custody; I never practised an imitation of Mr. Horne's signature - Conway produced a paper to me with Mr. Horne's name on it, at Mr. Hinrich's - it was not before I was acquainted with Martelly; but he was not present when it was shewn me - Mr. Busby never charged me with embezzlement before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by joining in this transaction against your will? A. It was against my will that I accepted the money - Martelly seemed unwilling that I should have a share, as he said I had done nothing in it, - that I ought to have presented the cheque, and ought to have none of the money; Conway wished me to accept of it, for fear that I should report it to somebody if I had none - I had left Mr. Busby at the time the cheque was offered at Drummond's.</p>

             Drummond is the principal partner; there are others. Benjamin Worthy Horne, of the Golden-cross, Charing-cross, is a customer of ours - he is a coach-proprietor, and is in in the habit of drawing cheques on us. On the 4th of April this cheque was produced at our counter, and paid by me with four 10l. notes; my information is obtained from my books - I have an extract from them; the book is in my own hand-writing - I have looked at the original book this morning to refresh my memory; I made the extract last Friday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did any body examine the extract with you, or did you do it yourself? A. I did it myself - I made the original entry myself; this cheque(looking at it) has been paid - it has my writing on the back.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a distinct recollection of having paid the cheque, independent of the books? A. I have; I paid it, because my mark is on it, by which I cancelled it at the time of payment.</p>
               <p>Q. Having refreshed your memory this morning, by looking at your books, how was it paid? A. with four 10l. notes, and 60l. in gold; I cannot say whether it was sovereigns, or half-sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Is it the habit of your house to give blank cheque books to any stranger who may come in the name of a customer? A. Yes, it is done so; I am not aware of the circumstance, but we do not always know the servants who come from their masters - we should give cheques to strangers if they asked for them in a customer's name.</p>

            . I am a clerk to Mr. Hoper, a solicitor, of No. 13, Old Burlington-street. I know Martelly, not by that name, but by the name of Gage; I remember his coming to Mr. Hoper's about two months ago, but I made no memorandum, and cannot say when positively - he came about eleven or twelve o'clock in the morning, I think; it might be later - he called to ask me if I could recommend him to any situation, as he was out of employ; I asked where he had been, as I had not seen him for a long time - he said in America; I asked what took him there - he said he had been there keeping books; I asked what he was doing in London - he said,</p>
               <p>"I am travelling about, trying to get orders for copper-plate engravings, shop bills, and such things; that was principally the whole that passed - another person was in the room, I believe, the whole time; I was engaged in business, and did not pay particular attention to him, but am certain he called.</p>

            . In April last I was servant to Mr. Hinrich, No. 9, John-street, Adelphi. I know Coombs and Conway; I remember their being at my master's house - I do not exactly recollect whether it was the beginning of April, or the latter end of March; there was a third person in their company, but I do not know who he was - it was on a Saturday, between twelve and one o'clock, as near as I can recollect; I fetched a pot of ale for them - they were in the front office; my master was out at the time, I believe; I cannot tell whether they went away separately or together, for I went up stairs about my business - they drank the ale; I knew Coombes before, by his calling to see Conway sometimes - he generally came in the evening, when it was Conway's time to leave.</p>

M. Carew," to be his hand-writing, but as to the "Horne," I do not know; I believe the whole to be his hand-wirting, except the name "B. W.

            . I go by the name of Frances Smith, but it is not my right name; I lived at No. 7, William-street, Waterloo-road, for a fortnight, about three weeks ago - I am acquainted with Coombs; I remember his coming to my lodging one afternoon in company with Martelly and Conway - the prisoners are the persons; they came in a coach - they had a bottle of wine there: Coombs gave me some money - he had a few pounds in sovereigns; I do not remember exactly what he gave me - I was in debt for rent at that time; Coombs paid it in Henry-street- I saw him pay it; it was 2l. 16s. - he paid it when I lived in William-street; he paid it on the Monday - he had come with them on the Saturday; he purchased me a dress on the Monday - I do not recollect how much he gave me on the Saturday; it was silver - I do not know who paid for the wine; I cannot recollect how long they remained at my lodging.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had never seen the persons who were with Coombs before? A. No; I see a great many young men - I have been intimate with Coombs since last Vauxhall season; he was not particularly a sweetheart - he used to come to see me; I live by receiving visits from young men.</p>

            , I live in Cornhill. The prisoner, Martelly, was in my employ - I knew him by the name of Edward Gage; he came into my employ in October, 1826, as town traveller - in June 1827 I proposed to add him to several country travellers; it was necessary he should produce me security for 200l. - he produced to me this paper, purporting to be a security; he continued in my employ till the following August - his last letter was dated August, 1827: I did not dismiss him - I heard no more of him after he was at Leeds in August, and saw nothing of him from that time to this; part of his duty was to collect money for me, and for that reason the security was given.(The cheque was here read.)</p>

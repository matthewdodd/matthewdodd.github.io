               <p>Court. Can you tell distinctly what you saw him put into his breeches? - No, I only saw him put some iron in; the prisoner confessed the iron was mine; me and my man know the broad axe; this piece I marked over-night; I can swear to it.</p>

               <p>Court. Did he ask you for a shilling the day before? - I do not recollect.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. That is all false.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he apply to you for a shilling on the Thursday? - I have no recollection of it; they usually have their money in an evening; there is about five shillings and eight pence due to him, which I will pay him; I have been almost ruined by these men; he took the iron first, and asked me afterwards.</p>

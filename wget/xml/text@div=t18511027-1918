                  </hi>. I am single. On 18th Sept., between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I stopped to look into a shop-window in Bishopsgate-street for about two minutes—as I was turning to leave the window, I found the prisoner with my dress in her hand, which was concealed by an empty basket she had got—I am sure she is the woman—I examined my pocket and missed my purse—the prisoner ran away down Angel-alley, which is no thorough-fare; she turned back and went into the second turning, which is no thorough-fare—I</p>

I have not taken your purse"—I sent some one for a policeman, and while they were gone she said if I would go back with her up the alley to her mother's she would give me what I wanted—the officer came and I gave her in charge—I have not got my purse back—it contained 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in shillings and sixpences—this is one of the sixpences (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it by its having three crowns on it.</p>

I was sent for, and found the prisoner and prosecutrix in Angel-alley—the prosecutrix charged the prisoner with robbing her of her purse—I took her to the station, asked her to take her pocket off, and asked what she had in it—at first she said three 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-pieces, then three sixpences, and then 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the sergeant asked the prosecutrix if she could swear to any of the money, and she described the sixpence produced—I found it in the prisoner's pocket, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which she said a gentleman had given her.</p>

                  </hi>. On 10th July I had been working for Mr. Kelk, and, in consequence of a letter I had received, I was going home—I called at a beershop kept by a Mr. Woodbridge, at Great Stanmore, and had a pint of ale—I saw the prisoner there—he was asking for beer, and he asked me if I would stand a pint—I gave it him—he then asked if I was going to a station—I said "Yes"—he said "I am going to Barham Wood Station; we will both go together; I have got a horse outside"—we went outside—he asked me to ride—I said at first I would rather walk—he said "You may as well ride," and he gave me a leg up on the horse—when we had got some little way, he hit the horse and made it trot—I said I would rather walk than ride so, but he hit it the more, and went faster and faster—I said I should fall off, and I dropped my bundle and basket and scythe—he then banged back against me, as if to knock me off—I caught my foot on the ground and fell down—I got up again in a minute—he stopped the horse and got off, and asked me to get on again—I said "No, I would rather walk and carry my things"—I put my things together, and as I stooped down to lift them up, he knocked me down with his fists, and I was blinded in a minute with blood—he struck me on the eye, you may see the scar now—he hit me several blows, and he said "How much money have you got?"—I said "Not much"—he said "I will have it"—I said "You won't"—he said "I will," and he tried to dive his hand into my pocket, but I had my belt buckled round me tight, and he could not get it in—he pulled the front of my trousers up, and pulled one button right off—in trying for my</p>

               <p>money he felt my watch, and said "You have got a watch; I will have it"—he hit me again several times, and got hold of my chain, but I kept hold of my watch and purse—he broke the chain—he then kicked me four or five times on the arm, and I believe once in the eye, but I was in such a state I could hardly tell where I was kicked—he then asked me whether I would give him my purse and watch—I said "No," and begged him not to kill me—I halloaed "Murder" twice, as loud as I could, and he then jumped on the horse and went away—I afterwards gave a description of him to the police.</p>

On 10th July, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was called by the prosecutor—I found him very much injured—he gave me a description of the man that did it—I found the chain in the place where the struggle took place, and also this brass button—there were signs of a very severe struggle, and a great quantity of blood, I should think a quart or three pints—there were no stones about there—it was in a ditch.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman S</hi> 210). On the night of 10th July, in consequence of a description that had been given at the station, I went to Harrow Weal Common, and found the prisoner in a gipsy cart—I told him I should take him into custody for violently assaulting a man in Wood Lane and attempting to rob him that evening—he said "You are mistaken, I am not the man; I have not been near the place"—afterwards, on the way to the station, he said he had been in company with a woman who gave him a pint of beer at the Load of Hay beershop, at Stanmore—he after<lb></lb>wards said "I was in Wood Lane with the man, and gave him a ride, and we both fell off the horse, but I am not the man that committed the assault"—I found blood marks on the front of his shirt, and on the toe and seam of his right boot, which I produce.</p>

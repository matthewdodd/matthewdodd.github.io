I was on duty on Tower-hill on 20th May in plain clothes, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw the two prisoners there—I saw Evans stand by the side of a female, and Wallis a little in front of her—the female stopped to look at a man selling something, and Evans put his left hand into her pocket—he took out something, but I could not see what it was—the prisoners walked away together—I spoke to the female, and followed the prisoners about fifty yards—I saw Evans open this purse—Wallis was standing close up to him—Evans turned out the contents of the purse—I took hold of Evans, and told him he had just picked a female's pocket—I took Wallis as well; Wallis tried to get away—I did not see Evans give anything to Wallis—I had seen the prisoners together, and speaking together, before they went to the prosecutrix, and they were in company with a third one—I watched them three quarters of an hour—the third one was not present when the purse was taken—Wallis stood in front of the female, with his back to her.</p>

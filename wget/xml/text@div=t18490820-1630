                  </hi>. I am a partner, in the firm of the solicitors for the prosecution. In consequence of some communication with Mr. Bevan, I called at the office of the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi> newspaper, in Catherine-street, Strand, on 13th April; and in consequence of information which I received there, I went to No. 7. Bennett-street, Blackfriars, on that same day—I there saw the defendant—I asked him if he was Mr. Hansill, the proprietor and editor of the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi> newspaper—he said he was—before I went my attention had been called to the paragraphs which have been read—I told him that I called on him, in consequence of the notices to correspondents which bad appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi> newspaper relative to Mr. Bevan, and that I was instructed to state, if the publication was continued, proceedings would be taken against him—he replied that nothing libellous had occurred, and he would take care that nothing libellous should appear—he then said he had a great many letters in his possession which would be inserted; that there were as many as would fill about twenty columns in print, and would run over a space of several weeks in the insertion of them—he then produced one of the numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi>, and pointed out to me an article called, "The Life and Adventures of Captain Aaron Smith," and stated that that was the form in which the publication relating to my client would appear—I asked him if the letters to which he alluded had been given to him by a female—he said, no, they were given to him by a male, or a gentleman; but that on 2d April a female had called upon him, wishing to see him on the subject of the notices to corre<lb></lb>spondents which had appeared in the paper on 31st March; but he declined seeing her, as she would not give her name—I then had some conversation with him as to whether it was probable that a compromise might be effected for the delivery up of these letters, and he advised me not to have any com<lb></lb>munication with the parties—I then told him that I was not authorized by my client to state as much, but that I thought he would probably submit to a little extortion, if the letters could be restored to him; and as he advised me not to communicate with the parties, I wished to know if he would be the medium of effecting any compromise, if it was desirable—he said, "No"—I then asked if he could give me the address of Miss Mills—he said he did not know her address—I then requested that he would postpone the publication of the letters, which he stated was to take place on the following day, until I had an opportunity of seeing my client; which he agreed to do—he said they should not appear without a previous communication with us—(<hi rend="italic">the paragraph of 14th April was here read, as in page</hi> 397)—on Monday, 16th April, I received this letter from the defendant—I had at that time made an appoint-ment with Miss Mills: at two o'clock, I went and saw her—I received this letter on Wednesday, 18th—I wrote an answer, declining to go, alleging a private engagement—this other letter I received from Mr. Bevan—(<hi rend="italic">these three last-mentioned letters were proved by Mr. Robert Wilson to be the defendant's writing, and were read, as in page</hi> 398).</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you examined on Saturday last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was—I stated substantially the same facts I have stated to-day—there was no arrangement, to my knowledge, by which Miss Mills should plead guilty to the misdemeanor, and the felony be abandoned as against her—she has not been tried on the indictment for felony: that was not on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184908200113"></xptr>
               <p>the understanding that she should plead guilty to the misdemeanor—she is now suffering her sentence—this trial was postponed from time to time on account of the dangerous illness of Mr. Hansill, as was represented—before I waited on Mr. Hansill I had no communication from him, verbal or written—we are Mr. Bevan's solicitors generally—we have acted for him in other matters—I did not receive instructions from him to compromise this matter, nor from any one on his behalf—I told Mr. Hansill that I thought Mr. Bevan might submit to a little extortion—I had not then consulted with him on the subject—I meant what I said—I believed that be would submit to a little extortion—I asked Mr. Hansill whether he would become the medium of a compromise—I used that expression, and meant it—he said, "Decidedly not," and added, that if any parties attempted to extort money from Mr. Bevan he advised me to indict them—if he had contentad to be the medium of a compromise I should have acted with him after consulting my client—I meant to offer to Mr. Hansill the opportunity of receiving money from Mr. Bevan—I meant to advise him to submit to a little extor<lb></lb>tion to put a stop to any publication in the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi>, and to get the letters,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then if Mr. Hansill had any appetite for extortion you set him on at this interview: you first mentioned the subject of extortion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made use of the term that Mr. Bevan would submit to a little extortion—I was not authorized to do so, but I thought it probable he might—when I asked for Miss Mills' address, Hansill said he did not know it, but would make in<lb></lb>quiries—I said I should be obliged to him if he would—I did not go to Mr. Hansill to entrap him into something for which he might be indicted—I did not begin this negotiation with him for the purpose of afterwards indicting him—I had not consulted Counsel before 1 bad this interview—only one of these publications appeared afterwards, on the 14th—they were in custody before next Sunday—it was about the middle of the day on Friday, the 13th, that I saw him, and the paper was published on Saturday the 14th—Ido not know whether the paper is published on Saturday morning or evening—Mr. Hansill did not say that any lady had complained to him of Mr. Bevan writing a grossly insulting letter to her, calling her a "bore," and threatening to com<lb></lb>municate with her friends—nothing whatever of that kind patted, nor did I make any such communication to Mr. Bevan—Mr. Bevan never saw Mr. Hansill that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked whether you set Mr. Hansill on to endeavour to extort money; I need hardly ask you whether you had anything to do with the two articles that appeared on 31st March and 7th April? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing whatever—it was in consequence of those articles that I was directed to communicate with him—he told me that these letters were all prepared for insertion—it was after I said my client would submit to a little extortion that he consented to postpone the insertion till after I had communicated with him—before the next Friday I consulted Counsel, and from advice I received I determined to have no more communi<lb></lb>cation, or to allow my client to have any, and Miss Mills and Mr. Hansill were summoned to Bow-street and held to bail on this charge—Mr. Bevan lives at Twickenham, and has a house in Hamilton-place.</p>

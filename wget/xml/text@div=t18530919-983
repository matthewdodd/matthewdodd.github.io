I saw the prisoner when he applied to me for some gin on that day—I saw him before, when my daughter served him—I am certain he is the same man—I saw him leave the house after my daughter served him—shortly before that I had been to the till, and taken out the silver—I had cleared the till just before he came in—after he left I went to the till, and found in it one shilling, which turned out to be counterfeit, and no other shilling—within an hour the prisoner came again, and asked for a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gin—I served him—he tendered me a shilling—I detected it to be bad—I said to him. "This is the second you have offered here to-day"—he said he had not been in the house that day—my husband was near, and I threw the shilling on the counter for my husband to look at it—the prisoner snatched it up, put it in his mouth, and pretended to bite it—I do not know what became of it—I had ascertained it was bad by putting, it in the detector; I bent it considerably, and nearly broke it—an officer was brought in—the prisoner then produced a shilling, as the one he had offered to me, and that was a good one—I looked at it—it was not the shilling which I had previously tried and bent—I told the prisoner that could not be the shilling—this is the one that he produced (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>), but it is not the one that he offered first; it cannot be, I am certain of it—I gave the shilling that he had passed to my daughter to the constable.</p>

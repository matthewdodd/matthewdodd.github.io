            . I am a shoemaker, and live facing Mr. Webb's, at Stoke-Newington; I was sitting at my door on Wednesday or Thursday, I believe, the 16th of August, about 3 or 4 in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at the bar bring a mug out of Mr. Webb's house, in her hand; when she had got about half way over the road, she covered it with her apron.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of mug was it?</p>
               <p>Guinnet. It was like this mug here produced; she went in at a chandler's shop facing the house where she was servant; that was the last time I saw her, till she was taken. On the Wednesday following we took her up; I first heard of her in Leather-lane, then in Cold-bath-fields, but I found her at last in Cloth-fair; I took her to the baker-and-basket, and then charged an officer with her, and sent for Mr. Webb; as soon as he came she confessed to have taken the mug, and that she had pawned it in Goodman's-fields.</p>

            . I live at Stoke-Newington, I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. Webb's house with this or such a mug in her hand; she held it cross-ways, not upright, and covered it, and carried it into a chandler's shop: I went to the last witness and said, I am surpriz'd Mr. Webb lets his mugs go out in such a manner.</p>
               <p>Jer. Miller. I live in Goodman's-fields; this is the mug ( taking it into his hand) that I took in pledge of the prisoner at the bar, on the 16th of August; I asked her, if it was her own property? she said it was; and that it was left her by her friends in the country, and some little money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lend her upon it?</p>
               <p>Miller. I lent her 3 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Miller. I knew her very well; she had been servant to our vestry-clerk, in Aylif-street, for some months, and did bear a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>The mug is my own right and property; I had that, and 30 l. and this mourning which I have now on, left me by an aunt.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Webb. Are there any marks on the mug, by which you know it?</p>
               <p>Webb. Here are the initial letters of my own and wife's name on it, and a very particular cypher on the body of it. she is a young girl, out of place, and I hope the court will be as favourable to her as possible.</p>

               <p>eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came with a Greenwich pri<lb></lb>soner to buy a waistcoat—there was a woman in the shop when they came in—there were four handkerchiefs pinned up, and just as the woman left the shop I saw them drop from the gown to which they were pinned—asked the prisoner to pick them up, and when he did so there were only two instead of four—"Bless me. "said I, "there were four—I pinned them up just this minute"—he said the woman that woman that went out of the shop took them—I called my mother from the other side of the way, and went out to fetch the woman—I came back presently, and my mother said she did not believe it was the woman who had the handkerchiefs, but it was this boy, and he had got something else as well—he was just then gone out—the college-man had been trying on waistcoats, and the prisoner had been hold<lb></lb>ing his clothes the while—I looked on the counter and missed a pair of half-boots, marked No. 3—I then went after the prisoner and the college man—I saw the college-man and spoke to him, and he brought the prisoner to my shop the next day—I gave him in charge—he had one of my hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs round his neck, the other in his trowsers, and he had to him the duplicate of my boots.</p>

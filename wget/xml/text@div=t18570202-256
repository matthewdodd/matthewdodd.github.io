                  </hi>. I am a tea dealer and grocer, I carry on business under the name of Pope and Co., at No. 26, Finsbury-pavement The prisoner was my traveller—he had been in my employ about five years—his duties were to obtain orders, to deliver goods, and to receive money—when he received an order, he was to enter it in his order book, and deliver the book to the order man—he then received the goods and the van way bill, with the goods stated—this is one of the van way bills—here is on it, "Left," in the prisoner's writing, which signifies that the goods were left—here is another bill, dated 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Jan., on which is, "Left, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," which signifies, "Left, not paid"—here is another way bill, of 12th Jan.—here is "Cross, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—another bill, of 16th Jan., "Cross, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—here is a way bill of 24th Dec., "Watkins, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—on the prisoner receiving any money, it was his duty to enter it in the cash book the next morning, and to account to me for the money, to pay it over to me, and bring the way bill and cash book to me—he was paid 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month for commission—I have the cash book here—here is not a payment, on 12th</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I entered your situation in 1851, and the agreement was 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound commission on tea, a halfpenny a pound on coffee, and so on. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You were paid by salary and commission till last Feb.—in 1854, when I took stock, I stated that a large quantity of the money I was paying you was on bad debts—you then proposed, that if the bad debts exceeded 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you would share the remainder with me—the amount above 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be divided equally between us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I never made such an agreement with you; you sent me out with your tea cart; you had no connection; I took you to my own custo<lb></lb>mers, and you said you wondered how I could extend your trade as I did; I was in the employ of your predecessor. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes, and I kept you—in Feb., 1855, I deducted 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the commission that was then due to you, but after deducting that, you received 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me for commission and salary—in 1854 I stopped from you 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for bad debts for that year—I paid you for 1855, and from Michaelmas, 1855, I made an arrangement that you should have 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month in lieu of commission, and since that, I am deficient 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in this year alone—the customers out of doors were not yours, certainly not, I paid you for what you did—when a customer came and gave an order, we gave it you to enter it in your book—I do not know whether you had to find whips—I never paid any money for whips, I thought the contract would have done that—I have supplied the covers for the order books when they were required—I paid you 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for commission in January; the other was not due till the end of the month.</p>

            . I am a silver-smith, and live in the parish of Hanwell, at New Brentford in Middlesex. On the 15th of February last the prisoner came to my shop in man's apparel with this hatchet in her hand, (producing one) and asked me if I bought old silver, and pulled out some pieces of a tankard; the appearance of which gave me some suspicion that she had stole it. I asked her several questions, how she came by it, and the like. She said her father died and left it her. She produced the whole of a silver tankard in pieces. I asked her when her father died, she said about half a year ago, and she was persuaded to cut it to pieces, that she might bring it more safely to London, so she cut it to pieces on the stump of a tree. Upon asking her many questions, I found by her voice she was a woman. I charged her with being a woman, and called in women to search her. I took and opened her coat before, and saw a pair of stays. I asked her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050007"></xptr> name, and her father's name. She said her father's name was Pretherew. The constable came, and she was secured, and proved to be a woman.</p>

            . I am constable; I had the prisoner in custody, and carried her before a justice at Hounslow, and she was committed, so I brought her to Newgate. She said she was born in Gloucestershire, and that she was bringing it to London to sell it, and was advised to cut it in pieces, that she might bring it the more secret to London, that she might not be robbed of it.</p>

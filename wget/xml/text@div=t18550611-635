Baxendale's employ—he gave me the receipt for it, and I followed him to Prince's-street, Westminster, and saw the box delivered at Messrs. Baxendale's office—Brown had the van, and he gave me the receipt—that trunk was returned to me again on 18th Nov.—Brown gave me a bill, and I told him I would look over it and pay it—as he went down the steps I went up to my trunk, and the property was missing—I had lost these two waistcoats, and a quantity of plated ware, some plain chessmen, some carved draughtsmen, a dressing case with fittings, an Indian brooch, a native brooch, a gold cross, a pair of undress epaulettes, a great coat, a new black suit, a black waistcoat, a white waistcoat, a pair of pantaloons and a coat, a telescope, a camera lucida, and several other things which I have forgotten—these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine, and were in the trunk.</p>

In the beginning of March, 1854, I received from the last witness a leather trunk and two hampers—I delivered them to Pickford and Co.'s agents in Red Lion-yard, Frince's-street—they were well corded, and in good condition—I saw them stand in the office window a couple or three days, they were then shifted in the office—about Nov. I received directions from Mr. Elliott to take them back—I found them in the stable—I brushed the cobwebs and dust off them, and took them directly to Major Corfield's—he was there—I went down stairs after giving him the paper—I went away with the cart—when I got back to the yard, Major Corfield came to the office and said he had lost some things—I did not notice the boxes particularly; I put them in the cart and away I went—when Major Corfield came John Pegram was in the yard, and was near enough to hear what was said—Major Corfield said he had been robbed, and I said I knew nothing about it—he said, "I have been robbed by wholesale," or some such word as that.</p>

I went on 19th April to the house of the two Pegrams, in Ingleton-street, Brixton—I told John Pegram that we had come to take him into custody, for robbing his masters, Pick-ford and Co., and enumerated the articles to him—he said he knew nothing at all about it—I searched the house, and found some things, which turned out to be his own—on 3rd May I went to the house again, and apprehended his wife—I had taken him on 19th April, and on 3rd May I went and took the wife—I said I came to take her into custody for being concerned with her husband in robbing Messrs. Pickford of the electroplate, and wearing apparel, and other things—she said, "Very well," and that she knew nothing about it—I told her she might say anything she liked to me; I might make use of it as evidence against her, or I might not—she then said, "Conner had the things"—I said, "What things?"—she said, "The plate; and he came to our house one night, and took a bundle away, which I suppose was wearing apparel"—she said she took spoons to his house, about eight of each—I asked her whether she knew what became of the chessmen and draughtsmen—she said, "Yes; Conner had them"—she was asked whether she had ever been stopped at Smithfield station—she denied it, but afterwards she said she was—she said, "Previous to going out of the house, Conner told me, if I was stopped by the police, to say my name was Emma Johnson, which I did"—she said that on the day she was stopped at Smithfield she had a gold cross and two of the electroplate salt spoons with her—from information I received from her, I went to the house of Conner, in John's-row, St. Luke's, the next morning, about 5 o'clock—Conner came to the door—I asked him if his name was Conner—he said, "Yes"—I asked if the whole house belonged to him—he said it did—I said, "You see who I am?"—he said, "I do"—I asked him if he knew any one of the name of Pegram—he said he did—I asked him if he knew where they were, or what they were doing—he said, no, he did not—I asked if he knew in whose employ Pegram was, or who Pegram worked for—he said, "No"—I told him I had come to take him into custody for receiving some things of Pegram, well knowing them to have been stolen from the premises of Messrs. Pickford and Co.—he said, "Pooh, pooh, nonsense"—he went up stairs—I told him I should search the house—he said, "Very well;" and, on searching, I found this white waistcoat in a clothes box—I asked him how he became possessed of this—he said he bought it at Mr. Groves', he believed, with two white slops, and he gave 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I told him I should take it away with me; the other things, the plate and wearing apparel, and chessmen and draughtsmen were named to him, which he said he knew nothing at all about—he said Mr. Groves lived in the New Cut, and he bought the waistcoat and slops about two or three years ago—on the Monday following I received this black waistcoat from a pawnbroker, in Wilderness-row, in presence of Caroline Railton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cow keeper. John Pegram is my brother—he offered me a black figured waistcoat to sell—I took it home, and showed it to my wife—she said, "This is too big for you"—she rolled it up, and I never saw it afterwards—at that time my brother was employed at Pick-ford's—he told me he bought the waistcoat of a Jew—I did not notice it At all; I saw it was black figured.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the White Horse, in Brick-lane, St. Luke's. I have known Conner nearly two years; he is in the employ of a marine-store dealer, in a large way, who occupies premises belonging to me—during the four weeks ending 4th Dec., last year, Conner brought me these chessmen and draughtsmen, or backgammon men and boxes, to sell—I do not think he fixed a price for them; he asked me ten or a dozen times, and I refused to purchase them, having no need of them—he asked me several times, and I told him to bring them, and I would try to sell them for him—he told me he wanted 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, and he told me to go and inquire of any person in London, and if they were not worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would give me them for nothing—I showed them to several private friends, and showed them to a pawnbroker—I, at last, gave him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, the pawnbroker telling me that was a fair price to give for them—after some time. Conner brought me this camera lucida—J did not know what it was; I thought it was part of a mathematical instrument—I bought it, I think, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he offered me a telescope, and told me it was a large, handsome telescope, of great power.</p>

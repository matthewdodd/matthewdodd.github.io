The chamberlain told him he could not call to mind the person. The witness then asked him what man it was that was drinking in the Tap-house, along with the coachman: that then the chamberlain said, that was the person that lay in the room, and he knew him very well. Then the witness went to Mr. Motts, and informed him of the circumstance; and then went to the bank. Upon enquiry at the bank, he was informed that the note had been there and was accepted. He left his direction at the bank, in consequence of which he was sent for when the bill was offered at the bank for payment.</p>

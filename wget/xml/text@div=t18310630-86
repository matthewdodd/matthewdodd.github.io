               <p>MR. LOSCOMBE. This is mine - my initials are on it; when I turned the second time the prisoner was close to me - it was not possible for any one to get between him and me; when I took the prisoner he asked me to let him off, that was all.</p>

I saw two little boys, and a big boy, go and pick the gentleman's pocket - one of them said,"Here is some one coming;" they threw the handkerchief down, and ran down Warwick-street; I took it up, and was going to ask the gentleman if it was his - he turned, and took me.</p>

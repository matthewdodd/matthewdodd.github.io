                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the South London District Post-office, Blackman Street, Borough—Buckworth became the receiver at Lower Road, Rotherhithe, on 30th April, 1873, and was before that in the Dockhead office—Nash was Buckworth's assistant at Lower Road Post-office—they both made the usual statutory declarations (produced) when they were employed—it was part of Buckworth's duty to issue and pay money orders at Lower Road, and he was supplied from the General Pos-Office with blank forms of money orders and advices—they are numbered con<lb></lb>secutively, and bear the printed name of Buckworth's office—persons pay<lb></lb>ing for money orders fill up a printed requisition (<hi rend="italic">Form produced</hi>), stating amount, where payable, name of payee, and name and address of emitter: on receipt of which it was the duty of either of the prisoners to fill up and</p>

               <p>sign the money order, fill up the advice, and enter it in the daily money order account, and give the money order (<hi rend="italic">Form produced</hi>) to the applicant, and the advice would be forwarded to the paying office by the next dispatch—the names of payee and remitter are given in the advice, and on the order being presented at the paying office the postmaster would refer to the advice, and pay the money, on the payee signing the receipt and giving the name of the remitter—the name of remitter is always required—Buckworth should give the payee's, and his own name in orders drawn on his own account, he has no duty beyond a member of the public—postmasters occasionally issue post-office orders on their own account—money orders ought to bear the date-stamp of the issuing-office—it is the duty of the person issuing the orders to so stamp them, and he must receive the money from the remitter—it was the duty of Buckworth or Nash to forward direct to the General Post-office at the close of each day's business a daily summary and money<lb></lb>order account giving a detailed account of the money-order business—when his credit reserve exceeded 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it was his duty to remit the surplus.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi> I have been superintendent of the South Eastern District three years, and was before then in the employ of the Post-office—I have only known Buckworth three years, and do not know how long he was employed at Dockhead Post-office—at Lower Road office he kept a grocery and provision shop—except with regard to the present charge we have had no cause of complaint against him for irregularities of any kind—he had to sell postage and receipt stamps; accept deposits on Savings Bank account; pay Savings Bank warrants, and give out collect<lb></lb>tions of letters posted at his office; to issue gun and dog licences and register letters—there were five collections of letters daily at his office, and there was a box fixed in the wall for the sixth collection, but he had nothing to do with that—he had each day to make out a return of money orders which he debited himself with, and to send forward the advice letters of money orders payable, and a return of Savings Bank deposits; also a return of the amount of unsold stamps—there is a column for that in his daily cash summary—his remuneration was by salary 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and a commisson of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for each 1,000 money orders, or about 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and so much for each savings bank transaction—his total remuneration was 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for one year—on a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. order the office would receive 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., out of which Buck<lb></lb>worth would get something less than 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. commission—on a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. order the commission to the office is 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was not my duty to receive his daily money-order account, it would be sent to the Receiver and Accountant<lb></lb>General at the General Post-office, and the letter of advice of orders payable, goes to the paying office, but circulates through the South-Eastern District—, a separate advice note for each order issued is sent to the office at which orders are payable.</p>

The yellow bundle shows the orders issued by Duckworth, and contains names and amounts other than those which have been read out—the particular names were not pointed out to me till the commencement of this case—the documents were received from the office, and come from the proper custody—that is all I know—they were all issued at the Lower Road, Rotherhithe office, and drawn on different offices and paid, some of them at the chief office, and others at the office on which they were drawn—I only know what appears on the papers.</p>

Mr. Buckworth is now out collecting money which he intended paying into the bank to-day to meet it; we did not think it would be presented until to-morrow"—I produced the money orders to her, those paid through the bank, and those paid through the respective offices, and said "There is a strong suspicion that the money order business transacted here recently is of a fictitious character in great part, and I have ascertained that over 100 of them representing just under 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to various persons on different offices in London, have been paid into the receiver's private account at the Southwark branch of the London and Joint Stock Bank"—she said "Yes, we did issue these, and pay them in, but we did not know it was wrong, as we debited ourselves with the com<lb></lb>mission"—I said "These money orders, 87 of them, have been paid at the offices on which they were drawn in 41 different names, it appears to me that the signature in the majority of instances to the receipt is that of the issuing clerk, S.

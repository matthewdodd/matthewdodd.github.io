                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Tucker, and live in Hert<lb></lb>ford-street, Finsbury-square. I let a lodging to a Mrs. Smith, on the 9th of December—the prisoner came four or five days after—Mrs. Smith said she was her sister, and she resided with her—the last time I saw Mrs. Smith there was on the 21st of January—I did not see her leave—Mrs. Smith wished me to let her stop a few days, till she got her things ready to go to a situation, as she said she had been ill in the Marylebone Infirmary—on the 2nd of February I followed the prisoner up stairs, and she came out of the room and locked the door—I had not seen the things in the room after Mrs. Smith took it—I left them all in the room except the sheet, which I gave the prisoner—that was about three or four days after Smith took the room, that was before the 21st—this is all my property.</p>

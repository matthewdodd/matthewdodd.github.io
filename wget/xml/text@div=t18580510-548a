                  </hi>. I am a labourer; the prisoner is my brother. On 14th April, I was at Mr. Burchet's carpet ground, in Maiden Lane—the prisoner was at work at the other end of the ground—the deceased and I left the ground, and the prisoner asked him what he was going to stand; the deceased said, "I will be a quartern to yours"—I went to the public house, and they were quarrelling—the deceased did not seem to wish to go away, but he was rather wranglesome—the prisoner asked to have the gin, as he had challenged it, and the deceased struck him in the mouth—that was inside the house—they both went out—I went out in two or three minutes afterwards, and the deceased was on the kerb, and he rolled off.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, John Street. On 14th April, I was employed by the deceased—I did not know his name—I assisted him with some carpets, we then returned to the public house near the New Market Inn—the deceased came out first, ready to start off—the prisoner came out, and wanted to be a quartern to a quartern—the prisoner struck the deceased—I think he struck him twice—the deceased fell, and rolled into the gutter, and his face was downwards—he did not move afterwards—he fell off the kerb.</p>

               <p>deceased—he had an extensive bruise immediately behind the right ear, extending backwards, and down on the right side of the neck the skin was slightly bruised; it was not a wound—I rather think it must have been occasioned by the fall on the kerb stone—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and, on turning the bones of the skull, I found several small branches from the temporal artery ruptured—the skull was not broken, the membranes were perfectly healthy, except at the crown of the head, there they were consider<lb></lb>ably matted together—the ruptured vessels corresponded with where the bruise was—there was about three ounces of blood in the base of the brain, pressing on the top of the spinal cord—the cause of death was the pressure of blood on the brain—which I believe was caused by the fall—there was nothing else to account for death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you hear that he met with an accident two years before, and was subject to giddiness; might that have been so great as to cause him to fall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I examined that place, it seemed to be an old injury, and round it there were no symptoms of congestion—undoubtedly a man subject to giddiness might be so excited by drink, as to cause him to fall down—I think in this case the rupture must have been caused by the fall.</p>

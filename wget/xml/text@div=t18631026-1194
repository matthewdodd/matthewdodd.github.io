I am barmaid at the Marquis of Hastings, Somers-town—on Friday, 24th September, between 9 and 10 in the evening, the prisoner came to the bar, and I served her with some gin and beer, which came to sixpence—she gave me a florin—I put it in the till, gave her change, and she left—in about two minutes my sister went to the till and took out a florin, which she showed me—it was bad—there was no other florin there—I put it on a shelf, and later that night a police-sergeant marked it and took it—next day, about half-past 4, the prisoner came again, and she asked for some gin and beer—she had a bottle and a jug—she gave me a half-crown—I put it between my teeth, and found it was bad; my teeth marked it—she took it out of my hand, and put it in her pocket, as I thought—she gave me a good half-crown—I sent for my sister, who bolted the doors, and a policeman was sent for, who asked the prisoner where the half-crown was—she said that she had not got it—he moved her about, and it fell on the floor—he picked it up, and I showed him the marks of my teeth on it—she had a purse on her, with a half-sovereign and eight good half-crowns.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Messrs. Penn—they have a steamer, called the Vestal, which was lying off their premises for the purpose of repair—I had charge of the job—I have seen some of the copper piping which is in possession of the officer—the repairs necessitated the was copper piping, and the removal of old copper piping from the engine tort of the steamer—this piping (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) is, I believe, the property of Mears Penn—there was some missing about 6th September—I think the time when I saw it safe was about two days previous to the time that it was found.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman. R.</hi> 2). In consequence of instructions which were given to me, on 7th September, I followed the prisoner and his cart—he keeps a potato, or vegetable shop, in King-street, Deptford—a person of the name of Whittingham keeps a marine-store shop next door—the cart was at Gibraltar toll-gate when I stopped him, at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I said, "Mr. Grimwood, I am going to see what you have got in your cart—he said, "Mr. Crouch, I have got nothing"—I said, "What have you in that sieve you are sitting on?"—he said, "Can't you lee I have nothing; it is bottom upwards"—seeing the end of a sack pro<lb></lb>jecting from under the sieve I said, "Get up and let's see what's underneath"—he got up—I turned the sieve on one side and found this sack—I took hold of it, and feeling that it was heavy I said, "You have got metal here, where did you get it from it"—he said, "From my next door neighbour"—I said, "You must go with me to the station," which was fifty yards off—he did so—when we got there I took hold of the bottom of the sack, turned the contents out on the floor, and out rolled some pieces of copper pipe that I have since weighed—they weigh twelve pounds—they were loose in the outer sack—there were also two pounds of copper nails—I opened all the bags—I asked him where he got the whole—he said he got it from Mr. Whittingham, his next door neighbour; "We were to meet at St Georges Church, in the Borough"—I then took hold of the sack, seeing it was a potato sack—I said, "Where did you get this from"—he said from his neighbour—I said I should search his house to see if I could not find some more sacks there—he then said that it was his sack, that he had lent it to his neighbour about a quarter of an hour before—he asked the inspector to allow him to go to St. George's Church with me—the inspector refused—I afterwards went to his neighbour, and saw Whittingham, on the Monday morning.</p>

               <p>—I went to his house on the Saturday but he was not there—the prisoner did not tell me at first that he had got all these things from Whittingham; he did not mention Whittingham's name—Whittingham is his next door neighbour on one side—I did not know who he meant when he said next door neighbour; not till he mentioned his name—I swear that—I think it is a butcher's shop on the other side—I knew that Whittingham was his next door neighbour, and that he was a marine-store dealer—I did not know, it war Whittingham, when he said his next door neighbour—at the police<lb></lb>station he asked the inspector to let me go with him to St. George's Church, and the inspector said, No, as he denied having anything in the cart, he should take the charge of unlawful possession—I called at Whittingham's three times on the Saturday—he was not at home—I first saw him on the Monday morning—I did not tell him what I had found in the cart before he said anything to me—he said something to me before I had told him.</p>

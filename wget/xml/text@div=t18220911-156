I asked her to have a pot of beer; she left the house first. When I came out, she followed and asked me to go with her; I said I had no money. I went into a little passage - she held me by my coat, and said I had better stop; she pulled my watch from my pocket, then said,</p>
               <p>"The watchman is coming, I must go." I felt it was gone, and pursued her. I fell down - the watchman took her. I was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You spoke English to her - A. I only understood a little. I did not give it her to hold.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was going down Sharp's-alley, and saw the prosecutor and prisoner talking together. I desired them to go on, and as I returned, she was running towards Chick-lane. I said,</p>
               <p>"What are you running for?" she said,</p>
               <p>"Hush!" the prosecutor came running after her, and said she had taken his watch. I stopped her, and took it out of her pocket; she at last said she would not deliver it before she had her half-crown - he was rather in liquor.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me the watch to hold while he went to his companions for money; he did not return as soon as I expected, and I went away.</p>

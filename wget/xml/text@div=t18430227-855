                  </hi>. I am the son of Joseph Taplin, a farmer, and Natt was in our employ—in consequence of missing a lot of clover-hay, I tied some up on the 14th of Feb., in a particular mode—I have examined the clover-hay now pro<lb></lb>duced, and it is my father's—I can swear to it from some wooden marks which were found in it—I sent Natt to London with some mangel-wursel on the 14th of Feb.—he would have to pass the house where Dodd was—he was allowed to take half a truss of this hay for his horses, but no more—there is about a sack full produced—that is about one-third of a truss.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I received information, in consequence of which I watched Mr. Taplin's cart—on Tuesday, the 14th of Feb., I saw the cart come up, about six o'clock in the morning—it stopped close by the Swan, at Notting-hill—Dodd, with Natt's assistance, took a bag, or sack of corn off the cart—Dodd then took a truss of hay from the cart and took it to the stable—Natt and he had some conversation at the time—I watched the cart back again from town, about twelve o'clock, and Dodd then brought a similar sack out again, and put some more corn in front of the horses, but no more hay—I am sure the horses had none of the hay either in going or returning—I was close by—it appeared a whole truss—I have not weighed it since—it was tied up similar to a truss when I saw it in the morning—I afterwards apprehended Natt—I was in plain clothes—I told him what it was for—he said the horses had eaten all the hay, with the exception of what was in the cart—I afterwards apprehended Dodd, searched the loft, and found the truss of hay there—part of it was put in the rack—I fouud one of these marks in the rack, and two in the truss—he said the truss of hay had been there ever since he was at the place, which was above a month.</p>

               <p>I found in the manger—I took possession of all I could find—I should say there was about a large armful in the manger—I was set to watch—I found no hay at all in the cart—there was some in a sack, under the cart, when it went to town in the morning, and by the appearance of it there was about the same quantity in the sack when it returned from town—it was then in the projecting part of the front of the cart—it was a sack loosely full—Dodd would have the opportunity of knowing whether the horses eat any of the hay—he had the key of the stable at the time I went there and found the hay, and he unlocked it—Natt did not take the horses and put them in the stable, they were fed at a crib in front of the house.</p>

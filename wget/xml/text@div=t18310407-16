               <p>Q.What did you quarrel about? A.She said I had said she was ungrateful - I had told her so before, and she began again about it; she struck me in the face with her hands, and I said, "Mary, you are ungrateful;" she hit me in the face three or four times with her hand - I struck her again when she struck me so many times; I am sure I hit her again - I do not think the Magistrate asked me that question.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, you sat down to breakfast, did you? A. No, I put the frying-pan on the fire to fry some meat - this was immediately after we struck each other; we were good friends, and had made it up, not to quarrel any more; I was standing by the fire, and saw her put her hand into her pocket - this was full ten minutes after she had struck me, and we had become good friends.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you good friends? A. I told her as it was Sunday, I did not wish to have any quarrel, and she said, "Well, I will drop it;" she said we should not quarrel any more - I said very well, I was agreeable, and did not wish to quarrel, as it was Sunday; the frying-pan was on the fire when I said this - I was preparing breakfast, and going to give her breakfast; we both became quite reconciled; I was standing by the fire, frying the meat for breakfast, and saw her put her hand into her pocket without saying any thing to me; she then stooped down without saying any thing, put her hand under my clothes, and when it was done, I said, "Mary you have stabbed me!" I said so instantly - I felt that I was stabbed; I felt the blood come from my right thigh - I exclaimed immediately, "Mary, you have stabbed me!" it was done all in a moment; she said, "No I have not, let me look?" I took up my clothes, and let her look - she said, "Let me tie it up - it will be no worse;" the blood flowed very rapidly, and I called for Mrs. King, who lives in the next room - she came in directly, and I said, in the prisoner's presence, that she had stabbed me; she said she had done it, and would do it again, and spit in my face three times - when I called Mrs. King in, she attempted to go out, but I fastened the door and prevented her; she wanted to go away - I stood before the door - I let Mrs. King in at that door; the neighbours came in, a constable was sent for, and a surgeon looked at my wounds; I had three wounds, one on the thigh, one about my knee, and the largest wound was up in my thigh, that wound bled profusely; the surgeon has attended me ever since it happened - he dressed it on Sunday, but has not seen it since - it is very nearly healed now.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long have you been the wife of William Foulkes - you are only living with him? A. I have been lawfully married to him these eight years - you did not meet me in Shoe-lane, talking to a man on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not take you and the man you live with, and another man who lives in the court, into the Red Lion, in Plumtree-court, and pay for half a pint of spirits for you? A. She did not; she took me in on Sunday morning before eight o'clock, and paid for some liquor; my husband and another man were with me then - it was a little before eight; I cannot say how much liquor she paid for - I did not drink with her on Saturday night - I did not buy any beef on Saturday night, nor did you sleep in my house that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not go into a wine-vaults, at the corner of Bear-alley, and pay for three separate quarterns of spirits, some cheese, and biscuits on Saturday night, for you and the men? A. It is not true, you were not at my house all that night - you slept at my house on Wednesday night, but not afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been in custody for robbing different gentlemen, and obliged to fly from England? A. I never was charged with robbing a gentleman - I do not know Mr. Powell; I was never tried, nor in custody, nor before a Magistrate till I was at the office about her - she is capable of swearing any thing.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you recollect how much you had drank on the Sunday morning? A. I had two glasses of gin with her, and nothing more; I cannot say what she drank, but she had no more in my company than I had - she was perfectly sober when this happened.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at No. 24, Hatton-garden. On Sunday morning, about half-past eight o'clock, the Policeman came to my house - I saw the prosecutrix about half-past eleven, at the house in New-court; my young man had seen her before, and dressed her wounds - I examined her wounds then; there was a hemorrhage which had returned - the wound was opened out and re-dressed; she had three wounds, but one was the principal - it appeared to have been done with a sharp instrument; the upper wound in the thigh was about two inches long, and about a quarter of an inch deep through the skin and integuments - it was over a dangerous part if it had cut deeper, but being superficial there was no danger in the wound itself; the others had been done by a sharp instrument - they were small wounds just cut through the skin; I have attended her ever since - I dressed it last Sunday, and think it well now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I trust you will take my distressed situation into your merciful consideration, and allow me to state a few facts as they happened in this case - I am entirely innocent of the crime, as I expect mercy from the Almighty, who known the secrets of all hearts. On Saturday night, the 26th of March, I went to the lodgings of the prosecutrix for some duplicates I had left there, intending to release them; the prosecutrix was not at home - the man she lives with told me she was just gone out, for she had no money - I asked him to come out and look for her - I proceeded to the pawnbroker's, desiring William Foulkes to try to find her, and come towards Gray's Inn-lane (that being the way I was going), and that I would meet them after I got my things: on my return I met Foulkes, who told me he could not find her, but he did not doubt of meeting her, as she desired him to come out to her about one o'clock - I then walked down Holborn and Farringdon-street with him in search of her; Foulkes met with a person who told us that Ellen, meaning the prosecutrix, went down Shoe-lane about ten minutes before - we accordingly went that way, and saw her standing with a man at the gate of Mr. Pontifex's manufactory; I then took her,

The prosecutrix and myself were going towards her home, but going along Field-lane we met the witness King and another woman - the prosecutrix asked me for 6d. to treat them, saying, with an oath, that many a cold night they had given her a glass - I told her I thought she was making a complete dupe of me, but still I consented to go with them to a house on Saffron hill; I called for a quartern of spirits, which did not suit them; one of them then called for half a pint and paid for it, at the same time calling me scaly, and every other name they could think of - I made them no answer, as I was quite sensible enough to be ashamed of my conduct, being about the streets on a Sunday morning - I begged of the prosecutrix to come home and give me some things of mine, which were at her room, and that I would go to my own room - she came with me, but the moment she got in she began raving like a mad woman, struck me repeatedly, and tore my cap off my head, which I could not bear without retaliating - I told her I was very well served for being a fool. I could not understand any other than that the woman was jealous of me - I came out to look for

             to send him home to pacify her, but could not find him; I went back again, and the man was laying on the bed: the instant I entered the room she screamed out, and accused me of stabbing her, and said she would have her revenge of me now - I was struck with astonishment, and sat down until the two Policemen came in; the witness King stated before the Policeman, and the first time she came before the Magistrate, that she saw me do it, then that I said I had done it, and would do it again: this, if the Policeman speaks the truth, he knows to be false - even the officers at Hatton-garden said on Saturday, when I was committed, that it was a great pity their two former statements had not been taken down, for they never heard stories so widely different - the other Policeman, who is not present, stated before the Magistrate that he took the one particular knife out of my pocket; why did he not take the others? that was taken from me at the station-house - one of those knives I have carried in my pocket these four years, and the other is my husband's: had I been conscious of having done wrong I could have thrown them away, which the Policeman very well knows, while I was going to the station-house. This is all I have to say - I throw myself on your mercy, and trust you will notice the oaths of the prosecutrix and the witness, as they are two of the best known characters in the City, having many times been tried for robberies - there is not an officer or watchman through the City but knows them; the prosecutrix, by the appellation of Yorkshire Ellen, and the witness as Old Suke - there is not a part of England the prosecutrix has not been obliged to run from, in consequence of robbing different men, she was obliged to fly from Manchester, for giving a gentleman drugs to stupify him, while she robbed him of 17l. and his gold watch - the man, who for years has lived on this prostitution and robbery, was taken for it, but as they could not find the woman he was acquitted. These are the characters who are doing their endeavours to swear away the life of your unfortunate petitioner.</p>

            . Q. Did you see the prosecutrix and prisoner together on Saturday night? A.No, not till Sunday morning - I have frequently seen the prisoner in Foulkes' room; I did not see Mr. Foulkes on Saturday night, but I heard them when they went to bed, which was a long time after I went to bed - I cannot be certain of the time, but I dare say it was about eleven o'clock; they were up in the morning, and gone out about seven - they returned about eight, as I heard them; I had heard no men knocking at their window.</p>
               <p>JURY to ELLEN FOULKES. Q. I believe you have said your husband went to bed sober, but went out partly drunk in the morning, how do you reconcile that? A. He had a little beer the night before, but I do not think he had any spirits - he had nothing to drink in the house in the morning, nor was any brought in.</p>

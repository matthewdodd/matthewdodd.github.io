I reply'd, I had a little Business to dispatch in the Town, and then I would wait upon them. I went out to see for a Constable, but could find none. I acquainted the Man of the House with the Affair, and desir'd his Assistance; but he was afraid to venture. By this time the Prisoners were ready to mount; but I resolving that they should not escape, seiz'd on De Vic, just as he had put one Foot in the Stirrup, and oblig'd him to go in again. I search'd them, and found this Box upon Cray, and examining him about it, says he, De Vic has broke open Mr. Elton's Trunk, and stole several of his Goods, and has given me some of them. Among other Things that be took out, there was a Diamond Ring, that was sold to Mr. Dautry (I think he call'd him) in the Strand. De Vic told me, that he, had left his own Cloaths and Sword, and Mr. Elton's Horse Furniture, with a Taylor in the Strand; who, he said, knew that the Furniture was stolen. Cray then took me aside, and said, My dear, I am an Officer in the French Service, and if you'll go over with me I'll procure a Commission for you After this De Vic call'd for a Pen and Ink, and wrote this French Bill, which Cray took up, and gave me. He said it was a Bill of Exchange, drawn on De Vic's Uncle (who was Ambassador in Holland) for a 1000 Livres, and if I would go thither, I might have the Money directly. I kept it, and seem'd to believe 'em, till I could get more Assistance to bring them home.</p>

            . On Monday the 10th of July, about 8 at Night, the Prisoners and a Servant came to my House with a Trunk, and asked if I had any Lodgings to Let? I told them, yes, and so they went up Stairs directly. When Mr. Elton was gone to Tun-bridge, they desir'd to be lodg'd in his Room. I told them I expected first to be paid what they ow'd me; they said, I should have it on Monday. So I let them go in, and on Monday I ask'd them again for the Money, and they desir'd me to stay, but till Mr. Cray went out to fetch it. Then Mr. Cray went out, and when he came in again they paid me. Mr. Elton had left his Trunk in his Dressing-Room; and soon after they had paid me, their Man came, and asked me, if I had got the Key of that Trunk, for, says he, My Masters are packing up some rich lac'd Cloaths, and I know they have none such of their own. So I went and searched the Prisoners Trunk, while they stood by, and there I found these two Suits of lac'd Cloaths that are Mr. Elton's. Lord, bless me, says I, you have ruin'd me; and with that they thrust several Things into their own Trunk, and went away directly, and I was so surpriz'd, and ready to sink with the fright, that I had not power to stop them. They went in a Hackney Coach. P. Cray. Did I not give you the Key of my Trunk as soon as you ask'd for it? Mrs. Gibbons. Yes. P. Cray. And when you open'd the Trunk, and I saw the Cloaths, I said, the Marquis has put up these Cloaths, and they belong to Mr. Elton. Mrs. Gibbons. You said the Marquis had taken care of Mr. Elton's Cloaths, and I said, Yes, finely, in your own Trunk.</p>

            . I was Servant to the Prisoners occasionally. As I came into the Room, Mr. Cray was packing up some Cloaths in the Trunk that belong'd to both the Prisoners; I did not then see what Cloaths they were, because they were in the Trunk, and he was pressing them down to make the Trunk lock, when I came in; but before he had quite done, he was call'd out, and Mr. Maccarty and I were left in the Room. I wonder, says Mr. Maccarty, that Mrs. Gibbons should be so pressing upon these Gentlemen for a little Money, when they must be Persons of Worth by their having such rich Cloaths in their Trunk. I knew they had no such Cloaths of their own, and therefore I acquainted Mrs. Gibbons with it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Maccarty. I knew Mr. Cray at Paris. he came to me on Monday Morning, and told me he was injur'd. I gave him advice as a Surgeon; after which he told me, that the Marquis was in trouble, and wanted to dispose of a Diamond Ring. We went in the Marquis's Chariot to Mr. Darker's, a Jeweller in the Strand; there we were offer'd 34 l. for the Ring, tho' we were told, it would have been worth 60 l. if it had been of a clearer Water. We came back to the Marquis, and Cray told him that he could get but 34l. Then I must take it, says the Marquis, tho' that Ring, and another little one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060035"></xptr> cost me 2000 Livres (which is about 100 l. Sterling) I know the Bailiffs are waiting for me, and that 34 l. may clear me of my present trouble, and serve me till I have Remittances.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is this Ring? Mr. Burrow. I bought it of Mr. Darker. Court. Produce it. Burrow. I forgot to bring it.</p>
               <p>Justice De Veil. I seal'd it up, and gave him strict Orders to bring it to Court; but I suppose they are afraid the right Owner should have it again, for it was 5 or 6 Hours before I could bring 'em to produce it.</p>
               <p>Court to Burrow. Fetch it immediately, or I'll commit you. Burrow. I will, my Lord. [Whispers a Friend.]</p>
               <p>A Witness. Here's the Ring, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Who gave it you? Witness. Mr. Burrow, for fear he should lose it. Court. How long have you had it? Witness. About an Hour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burrow. This is the Ring I bought of Mr. Darker for 40 l. and he has my Note for the Money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Maccarty. This is the Ring that Mr. Cray sold to Mr. Darker's Man for 34 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Elton. This is the Ring 1 lost out of my Trunk. I bought it about 4 Years ago of Mr. Sharack.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharack. I sold this Ring to Mr. Elton for 60 Guineas.</p>
               <p>De Vic. Mr. Maccarty brought me word, that he could get but 32 Guineas for the Ring, and I consented to sell it for that; but I never said that it cost 2000 Livres.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alexander. At Mr. Elton's Desire I went to Paris to enquire of Mr. Cray's Character. I met with his Aunt, Madam Estril, and some of his Acquaintance, who seem'd very much surpriz'd to hear of his Misfortune. They told me, that he had been Page to the Queen of Spain ; in general, I heard no ill of him. The Jury found them both <rs id="t17320906-38-verdict230" type="verdictDescription">

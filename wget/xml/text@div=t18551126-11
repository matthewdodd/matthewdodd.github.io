I live in Elizabeth-street, Chelsea, and keep a chandler's shop—I am sixty-six years old—about a fortnight before 19th Oct. the prisoner threw a stone at me, and struck me on my left shoulder—I went after him, he got down against the railing—I gave him two or three slaps on the head—he threw another stone which struck the bone of my left thigh—I knew him before, but did not know his name on 19th Oct he was coming down and I came out to a truck I had there—my opinion was that he was going to take my truck, and I was to catch him if I could—I told him to go away, and said, "You are a good for nothing"—I went too near him, and he struck me on my right shoulder—I fell down, and two women who were there came and said to him, "Yes are a good for nothing fellow to use an old man like that"—he took a stone and struck me with it—as I was going away I had another stone in tae back of my head, and from that I know no more.</p>

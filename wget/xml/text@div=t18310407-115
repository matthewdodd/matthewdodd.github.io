The prisoner was in my employ - he was not generally entrusted to receive money for me. On the 9th of July, about five or six o'clock in the evening. I sent him with a note to Mr. Early, who was indebted to me 200l., but did not expect he would receive it - the note requested the payment, without stating whether it was to be sent by the prisoner or otherwise - he had lived six or eight months with me; I did not expect him to return that evening - I did not see him again till he was apprehended, which was some months afterwards; he had given no information of his intention to leave - he had 12s. a week; I have received no part of the money: as he did not return I called on Mr. Early next morning, and learnt that he had paid him.</p>

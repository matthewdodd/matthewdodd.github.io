I was surrounded by five men; some of them pulled me violently by the collar of my coat, and struck me a violent blow on the head; while the prisoner snatched my watch from my fob. I immediately seized his arm, with the watch in his hand. He got his hand from me. and put it behind him. I then demanded my watch he said, he had not get it, he knew nothing at all about it. I asked for a constable; I could not find one; a man said he would take him into custody for me, I still kept hold of him by the tail of his coat; he took him, as far as the corner of the Mansion-house, when the man let the prisoner go free; I followed him and never lost sight of him. When he got to the corner of the Mansion-house, he ran against some iron railings, and fell back into a gentlemans arms, the gentleman then took him to the compter; I had got held of his coat until he came there, I am sure the prisoner is the man. I saw his hand take my watch.</p>

             holding the prisoner by the collar of his coat, demanding his watch, he said, give me my watch repeatedly, you have stolen my watch, I can take my oath you are the man. I went into the house then. I had property to leave. I came out again, I found them at the door still. There was a tall man and a short man which I supposed to be companions of the prisoner, one of them undertook to take the prisoner to the compter, my curiosity led me to see the end of it, I got as far as George street by the Mansion house, when the man that pretended to have him in custody, let him go from him, saying off or go it, I immediately run and called stop thief, this man that had him in custody ran along side of me, saying, let me get before you, I will catch him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110010"></xptr>first, I said as I was first I would have the first chance of him; he ran down George-street, as far as the back of the Mansion House, where some iron rails were: I suppose he ran against the iron rails; I was about a pace or two behind him; I made a prisoner of him; I took him to the Compter myself, there was no constable or officer about there.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DENNIMORE. I am a clerk to a tea-dealer, in the Poultry. On Wednesday, the 7th of December, a quarter before seven at night, I saw a crowd of people, and the prosecutor taxing the prisoner with stealing his watch, he said he had stolen his watch, and he could swear it before any magistrate; he called out for an officer to take him into custody; some person laid hold of him with intention to take him to the Compter, and opposite of George-street the prisoner ran off; I ran the other way of the Mansion House, and when I came to the other corner Mr. Pennant had got hold of him. I laid hold of the prisoner likewise, and assisted in taking him to the Compter. I am sure he is the same man that the prosecutor taxed with having stolen his watch.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On Wednesday evening, the 7th of December, being in Cornhill, I was informed there had been a robbery committed in Lombard-street, and the prisoner was taken to the Compter; I directly ran to the Compter, and found the prisoner Oliver there; in one minute a youth came, and brought me the watch, saying that is the watch that I picked up. I locked the prisoner up, and the next day I took him before the Lord Mayor. I took the address of both the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking down Lombard-street by myself; I told the young man I had not got his watch; I then went to the Compter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

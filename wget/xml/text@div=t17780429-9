               <p>I was stopped on the highway by two men, as I was going home from the tabernacle; they demanded my money; I gave them 7 s. and 4 d. and a thimble; they said they thought the thimble which I had given them was of no value to them; they behaved civil; Saul said, I need not be frightened, they would do me no harm; and he pointed the pistol up to the sky; the other man behind said, is here all; and put his hands to my coats, and shook my pockets; there was room to hear if any thing would gingle. I followed them, it being my way home; but I was not over solicitous to follow them quick, not wishing for more of their company. I was desired afterwards to go to the office in Litchfield street; there I saw the prisoners; as soon as I saw them I challenged them; I am sure Saul is one of the men; I am not certain to Hyams; the evening was tolerably light; there was a moon of a week old; and I had an opportunity to observe Saul's face; and therefore I can swear positively to his person.</p>

               <p>I live very near the prosecutor in Hoxton fields; I can be of little utility for or against the prisoner; only the lady said she was robbed of either 7 s. &amp; 3 d. or 7 s. and 4 d.</p>

               <p>Was you at the tabernacle with her? - Yes; and came home a little before her.</p>

               <p>What time did she complain to you of it? - I saw her the next day; I know nothing of the robbery.</p>

               <p>You did not see either of the men on the road that night? - It was moon light, but the moon was intercepted.</p>



               <p>But did you see either of these men that night upon the road? - I could not swear to them, but I have seen them before.</p>

               <p>DENNIS Mc DONALD sworn.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; one Rogers confined in the Savoy Gaol sent up to the office that he could inform us of some robberies in Hoxton fields; I know nothing of the matter, but taking up the prisoners, and bringing them before the justice.</p>

               <p>To the prosecutrix. What kind of a night was it? - So light that I could clearly discern them; the moon was about a week old.</p>

               <p>Was any lamp near? - It was but a few yards to a lamp.</p>

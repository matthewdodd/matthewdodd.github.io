                  </hi>. I am a farmer's labourer, at Tottenham-cross. I knew the deceased, James Brooks, for about two years—he appeared about forty-five years of age—he drove a team for Mr. Smith, of Edmonton—last Saturday fortnight I was going to Covent-garden market with my master's cart, drawn</p>

               <p>by two horses—the deceased had his master's cart, also drawn by two horses—we started from Tottenham about twelve o'clock at night—the prisoner drives for Mr. Thompson, of the same place—he accompanied us—he was also driving his cart—we stopped first at Stamford-hill, about a quarter to one o'clock—the deceased came up to the same place, and had some coffee with us—we left a little before him—at last we got to Great Queen-street, Lin<lb></lb>coln's-inn-fields, on our way to the market—I was then first, the prisoner second, and the deceased last—we were all going to the same salesman—Great Queen-street is a widish street—we were on the near side of the road within about three feet of the curb—that was about three o'clock in the morning—the deceased was going by rather faster than he ought to have done, with a view to pass the prisoner's cart, and get before him—there was no other cart or horse near that I know of—the prisoner spoke to his horses, and they flew off—that was at the time the deceased was endeavouring to pass him—the wheels came in <hi rend="italic">track</hi> of one another—I do not know that there was a collision between the two carts—they were very close together, but it was so dark—I do not know whether the prisoner said "<hi rend="italic">Gee</hi>" to his horses, or what it was exactly—it was to make them go on certainly—I could not tell whether that would have enabled him to get clear of the deceased's cart—they started off not at a very fast rate, walking by—the other came rather furiously, and the pri<lb></lb>soner's horses started off also—I heard Brooks halloa, and make a noise—I stopped my own horses, and ran after his—he had got I should think a hundred yards before I could stop his horses—they were going most rapidly—I did not see the accident happen—we were all very comfortable together, and not an angry word had passed between us—I did not go to Brooks when I heard him make a noise—I stopped to mind the horses while the prisoner went back—I knew he had been run over, but I did not see it—we were all sober—we had had nothing but coffee to drink—the deceased's cart was heavily laden with cabbages and potatoes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 150.) I was in Great Queen-street on this morning, and saw the three carts going along Queen-street on their proper side of the way at the usual pace of market carts—I observed the man driving the latter cart turn off to try to pass the two first carts—as soon as his first horses got opposite the second man's cart, he put his horses over to the off side to stop him from going past, and the man driving the latter cart was driven against the off curb-stone with his cart—he himself was on the near side—the wheel of the cart went against the curb-stone—the middle cart was within about half a yard—the deceased then called out to the other man to keep off, or he would crush him—to the best of my knowledge he used those words—I then called out—he still kept inclining to the off side—the deceased was between the two carts at that time—directly after I called out the carts jumbled together—I ran up, and found the cart had passed over the</p>

               <p>deceased—he was between the two carts—I picked him up, and took him to King's College Hospital—the street there is very wide—there was room for all the carts to have gone abreast—the prisoner gave his name, told me where he lived, and who he worked for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> And you found that statement to be true, I dare say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the moon was nearly at full, and there was gaslight—I heard the deceased say, "Keep off"—they were either those words or words to that effect—it was "Keep off" or "Ease off"—at that very time the deceased was endeavouring to pass by the other man—the prisoner had hold of his horse's head at that time—the deceased was not behind the wheel, he had bold of his horse's head—when the horses came together the deceased gave back towards the hind part of the cart—he was obliged to leave his horse's head, because when his cart was as near to the curb-stone as it could get, and the other coming close to it, he would have been squeezed by the shaft end—he would not have been perfectly safe if he had stayed at the horse's head"—one of Brooks's horses got against the lamp-post—the whole of it arose from endea<lb></lb>vouring to pass by his companion—I think his horses went at a smart walk—I cannot say it was trotting, I believe it was not, while he was at the horse's head—they appeared to get their <hi rend="italic">mettle up</hi> after they had got fast against the curb-stone—when the cart wheel got against the curb-stone the horses would find themselves locked fast, and would turn the other way—the wheel of the cart got to the curb-stone—it could not rise, and it <hi rend="italic">snipped</hi> the curb-stone—the off wheel came against the curb-stone—the prisoner was at his horse's head at the time the off wheel of his cart was near to or touching the wheel of the deceased's cart—he did not remove till after the accident—I did not hear him say anything to any one before the accident, but he went up to his horse's head the moment the deceased sprung his horses to pass by—he tried to pass the first cart—the prisoner then put his horses to the off side, speaking to them, and putting them off—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Gee</hi> "—I have not heard what Watts has said—I cannot say whether the prisoner whipped his horses or not—in the excitement of the moment I could not say whether he did or not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at King's College Hospital. The de<lb></lb>ceased was brought there by the policeman early on the morning in question—he seemed to be suffering from the effect of a compound fracture of the left thigh extending to the knee joint—the pelvis was fractured in seferal places—t ose injuries would be accounted for by his being jammed between the wheels of the two carts—he died at half-past six o'clock the same evening—he died in consequence of the injuries.</p>

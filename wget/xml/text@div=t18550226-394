The prisoner and his wife live in the same house—on 11th Feb. the prisoner was a little the worse for liquor—I heard him fighting his wife in the morning, about ten minutes after 10 o'clock—in the afternoon, about 2 or 3 o'clock, I saw her going up stairs, away from her husband, towards Davies's room—the prisoner was following her, threatening her—I went behind him, and saw a knife in his hand—he was holding it towards her, and said that he would hare her life—I saw Davies get between them—he told the prisoner to be quiet, and sit down and have a drop of tea—afterwards Davies was sitting on a chair, smoking a pipe by the fire<lb></lb>place—the prisoner asked him for a pipe of tobacco—Davies said that he had not got one—a scuffle ensued—he struck Davies on the eye—Davies took his jacket off, turned his sleeves up, gave him a push, and shoved his back through the window; then Evans threw Davies on the bed, and Davies got him by the collar, and then I saw a knife in his hand—he took it from the bread basket, which was on the foot of the bed where Davies was lying, and stuck it into Davies's arm three times—when I saw the blood run I sent for a policeman—the prisoner knew what he was about perfectly When this happened—I was with the prisoner and his wife from 10 o'clock till the end of it—they were quarrelling all the time—he wanted a razor in the morning, and asked his wife for it—she told him she did not know where it was, and then he found it—it was about a quarter of an hour before the prisoner asked Davies for the tobacco that Davies gave the knife to the prisoner's wife—he did not stab Davies while Davies was defending the prisoner's wife.</p>

On Monday, the 17th of June, I made a communication to Plank the officer, at Marlborough-street - and on Thursday morning the prisoner delivered an anonymous note into my hand - (looks at it) this is it, and the envelope; he said he had it from the cook - I told him he had been robbing me.</p>
               <p>(Letter read.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. MEREDITH.</p>
               <p>"Sir, You are suspected of having robbed Messrs. Todd - the writer overheard a conversation between Mr. Todd and one of the Officers of Marlborough-street. One of the housemaids is also implicated."</p>
               <p>This letter was enclosed in an envelope, and directed</p>
               <p>"For the Cook."</p>
               <p>Mr. COPE. The cook is in the shop in the day-time, and sleeps in Castle-street; he said it came from Castle-street, from the area. I told him I was informed he was robbing me - and had appointed two men to come that day and the next with marked money, and I was sorry he had found it out so soon; but as he had I must send for an officer. I sent for Plank, and kept the prisoner in my presence. Plank searched his drawer and trunks - which we opened with his own key; and immediately that it opened, the prisoner took up two parcels and gave them to me - I was going to open them. One contained a piece of ribbon directed to Humphries; he said he had taken that himself down to his sister, that it would not do, and he brought it back; there was a paper inside it with a bill of parcels of his own making. When goods are sent from our house, the bill is made out by one person and examined by a second, and signed with his initials, and the date put to it. The other parcel contained six fans; he said he meant to take them to his sister, for he thought they would suit her trade. I asked if they were entered anywhere, and if any person besides himself<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030029"></xptr>knew it? he said No - they were wrapt in separate papers; there was a paper with writing on it in the ribbon parcel, which appeared to be his own writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. Todd and Co. carry on very extensive business in the City - A. Yes. Mr. Todd has no concern with the house in Oxford-street. I have heard since this, that the prisoner's sister keeps a small shop at Walton on Thames - and he told me three or four weeks before, that a parcel was for his sister at Walton. I did not find fault with him for selling her goods. I often send goods on approbation in town, but not in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Middleton of Tunbridge-wells - A. I understand he is a customer of mine - I received an order from him last week; it was addressed to Meredith. I ordered the goods to be sent.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner could have taken the things out of his box before he brought you the letter - A. Certainly. I have a boy named Wiggins, who has a relation at Walton; the prisoner asked leave for him to go to Walton one Sunday. The prisoner said the ribbon was sent to his sister for a club, but not being the colour, he brought it back himself, and had forgotten to put it back.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. What was the parcel which you knew went to his sister - A. Four parasols. All goods which go out should be entered by the clerk.</p>

            . My parents live at Walton; I dined there on Whit-Sunday. On the 26th of May, I brought one parcel from the prisoner's sister; it contained Norwich crape - her name is Humphries. I had strict orders to keep it from Mr. Cope, or any of the young men; but to return it to him as a secret. I gave it to him on Sunday evening, and told him next day in the shop, that it was spotted, and therefore returned. I have brought nothing else from his sister's.</p>

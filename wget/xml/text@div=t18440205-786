                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Richards, of Union-street. On Saturday the 6th of Jan., before eight o'clock at night, the pri<lb></lb>soner came and asked for the "Illustrated London News," "Bell's Life," and "Parley's Penny Library"—I said, "Bell's Life" was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he said be would only take the two newspapers, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him the two papers—he laid down a counterfeit shilling—I said that would not do, and he ran away—he had not gone out of the shop when I said it was bad—I spoke to a man at the door, who brought him back—I marked the shilling, and gave it to the policeman—I had showed it to my husband, but do not think I lost sight of it.</p>

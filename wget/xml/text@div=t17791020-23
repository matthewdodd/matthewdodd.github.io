               <p>My lord and gentlemen, I hope you will take it into consideration that I am a poor woman, and cannot speak proper English, to let the court know that I am wronged by this notified wicked woman that swears against me, which is Mrs. Hall; this Mrs. Hall lost the clothes five weeks ago, and I only came out of Wales three weeks ago. I never saw this Hall in my life, and did not know any thing about her till I was taken a prisoner, and carried to Clerkenwell Bridewell; and the next day she came to see whether she would know me, and when she was asked if I was the person, she made answer, I was the woman to the best of her knowledge. My lord and gentlemen, my mother died a short time ago, and left me some old-fashioned clothes.

               <p>Q. Was your house broke open, and when? - A. In the night between the 7th and 8th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed that night? - A. About nine o'clock, I myself, and every lodger, were in bed; I left my wife up.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to bed, did you fasten up the premises? - A. Yes; I fastened the windows and the doors as they usually are; the wash-house joins to the house, it is a part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window of the wash-house secure? - A. Yes, to the best of my knowledge, just as it used to be of other nights; I got up about six o'clock in the morning; in the night-time I thought I heard something in the wash-house.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was it you heard this? - A. It might be between two and three o'clock in the morning; I had got some rabbits in the wash-house, I thought it might be them; I called who is there.</p>
               <p>Q. You got no answer, I suppose? - A. No; then I thought I heard the back-door go open.</p>
               <p>Q. The wash-house is under the same roof as your own room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What then? - A. I thought it might be one of the lodgers come down and gone to the necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get up in the morning? - A. About six, or rather before, it was dark; we went to work at Mr. Dance's, the gardener, I returned at breakfast-time, at nine o'clock; I got intelligence, and that led me to my wash-house; I discovered that the frame was taken out, and that I had lost some things, I lost my wife's cloak, a pair of sheets, and some raw pork.</p>
               <p>Q. That was all that you missed of your property - Did Curtis return with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He lost some property too, did he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your son here? - A. Yes, he lost some property; we then went together after this man, but he was taken in a public-house by the Duke of Devonshire's brewer; I went towards Brentford, the first house I went to was Mr. Faulkener's, the Waggon and Horses; then I went to the Seven-stars, at Brentford; where, afterwards, we found the things at the Fox and Hounds; I made inquiry whether any man had been there with a bundle; I found there a pair of shoes belonging to my son.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these shoes been in the house the night before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else there? - A. No; I found nothing more in Brentford, Curtis did.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you come up to the man, and where? - A. At night, at the Seven-stars, at Brentford; it might be seven o'clock in the evening when we found him at the Seven-stars; and we found him with some of the clothes upon him, he was dressed in

               <p>Curtis. They are mine, they were secure in the drawers.</p>
               <p>- CARPENTER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a salesman at Brentford? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I know him now again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the man before he came to you? - A. No; he came about eight o'clock in the morning, on the 9th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Chiswick far from Brentford? - A. About a mile and a half; he came to the door, and asked me if I would buy a coat; I looked at it.</p>
               <p>Q.(The coat shewn the witness.) Is that the same sort of coat? - A. I can swear to the coat by the slit here; I looked at the coat; we did not agree; he had a waistcoat, and I looked at the waistcoat, and I knew it was bought at my shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it bought by that young man, Curtis? - A. Yes, I said to him, this waistcoat was bought at my shop, but you are not the man that bought it; he said no, he was not; he said, the man that belonged to it was at work, they worked together at Mr. Dance's, a gardener, at Chiswick; I said to him, send the man down that owns the waistcoat, and I will buy the waistcoat of him; he said, would I buy the coat on his back; I bought the breeches; these are the same breeches; I gave him half-a-crown for the old coat and waistcoat, and four shillings for the breeches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing to say at all; the things were given to me to sell; I have not a friend in the world.</p>

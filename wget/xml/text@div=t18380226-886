                  </hi>. I am foreman to Thomas Machin, a grocer and cheesemonger. He has a shop at Woolwich, and another at No. 3, High-street, Deptford—I superintend the one at Woolwich—the prisoner was in Mr. Machin's service—he came on the 11th of November—when he came to be hired, I inquired with whom he had lived before—he said he had lived with Mr. Berry, in Strutton-ground, Westminster, for two years, and he was then not out of Mr. Berry's employment—he said Mr. Berry then lived at No. 3, Waterloo-place, Clerkenwell—I asked him where Mr. Berry lived, as a reference for his character—I went to No. 3, Water<lb></lb>loo-place, Clerkenwell—I did not see Mr. Berry—I saw a female, repre<lb></lb>senting herself to be Mrs. Berry.</p>

I had found before, and the addition of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., loose in the bag, in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences—the 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was still in the paper—I gave Mr. Warden four half-crowns, ten shillings, and a sixpence, and he marked them in my presence—on the following morning I again examined the prisoner's box—I found there the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as before, with the addition of 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in a paper, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in another paper—one of the half-crowns, marked the previous night, being part of the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was no more marked money beside the half-crown—I found 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. marked in the till.</p>

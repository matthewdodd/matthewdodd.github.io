               <p>Q. Who was present at that time, and what time of day was it? - A. I had been to see the landlord, Mr. Spencer, he is an intimate acquaintance of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you heard relative to this transaction; was Kirton there? - A. Yes, and some other person, I don't know who; I observed Mr. Kirton ask Notley if he did not know him; and he said he did not; he asked him if he did not recollect felling him a bay little cropt horse; and he denied it, and said he did not know him, and had never sold but one horse in his life, and that belonged to his master, Mr. Catlin, and he sold that in Smithfield, for. I won't be certain which, twenty-five or twenty-four shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe that horse that he sold for Mr. Catlin? - A. I don't know that, I heard him describe it; Kirton went on further, as I thought, to convince himself whether he was the man; he asked him if he did not, when he sold the horse, promise to treat him with sixpennyworth of liquor; and he said, no, he never did any such thing; by the method of his conversation I thought Kirton did not know the man; I then, hearing him so serious in discourse, asked Kirton it he was joking with him; and he said, no, he was not; I asked him if he was an officer; he said, no, he was not; he said, any body could take a thief, and I will take him; then, says I, I have nothing more to say, it is no business of mine; but I thought you were romancing with the man. Notley then got up, and said, he would go any where, just where he pleased; and appeared no way concerned at all.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did any body else interfere besides Kirton? - A. There was a person with Kirton, but I did not know who he was.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any conversation taking place between Kirton and Notley? - A. Yes, I remember some part of it; in the first place, Mr. Kirton came into my house and called for a pot of ale, after sitting there about ten minutes, an acquaintance of his came in and helped him to drink that ale.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you find out who that acquaintance was? - A. Yes, Mr. Burley; and then the prisoner came in, and sat the other side of the table, there were three table, in the room; after sitting about ten minutes. Kirton accused him with selling him a bay cropt horse, and told him he was a treat in his debt, and wished to have it then; Notley told him he was no treat in his debt, that he never had a horse in his life, nor ever saw him before in his life; then Kirton told him he certainly sold him a horse at such a place, in Hart-street, at such a time, and he was to take it the next morning to his house; and that when he went the next morning with it Mr. Kirton was in bed, and his mother was up, and paid two guineas for it, after that, he told him he would take him up for stealing that horse; and the prisoner told him he would go with him any where, whenever he chose, without any constable, or any thing else; that is all I know, except going in the coach with him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the examination at Bow-street? - A. Yes; when we went to Bow-street, we were set down at the Brown-bear, Burley and the prisoner, and Kirton, were in the coach, and one other gentleman that I don't know, a Mr. Dunn; the prisoner was examined at Bow-street.</p>

Because, says he, it you are, if you will give me a guinea and an half, or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110040"></xptr>if it is your friend, I will not swear to him, if not. says he, I will swear his life away, and then I shall have a share of forty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know this fellow before? - A. I never saw him before in my life; I and a coachman were sitting together.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his name? - A. Mr. Blunt; he spoke very low to me these words, and got up and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you did not give him a farthing? - A. No; for I believed the prisoner was thoroughly innocent, for I had known him two years and upwards; he was at work for Mr. Catlin, a stable-keeper, in Gray's-inn-lane, who is now in trouble, and in the King's-Bench prison; and then he came to live with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Summers again? - A. I never saw him till the third examination, when he went over to the bar, he then swore to the man; I was at the first examination, and the Justice told him to look round, and see if he could see the prisoner, there was no other person at the bar; Mr. Kinnard ordered him to look round, he looked round some time, and he scratched his head, and said, no, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he turn round so that he could see the prisoner? - A. I suppose he looked round five moments, quite long enough to have seen him if he had known him; and at the second examination he swore to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Who did you say you originally lived with as servant? - A. Mr. Long, thirteen years; what I saved there, and a lady that I lived with died and left me what she had, I went into business for myself; I said, poor fellow, I would go and say that he had worked for me, and that I had never heard any harm of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You took notice of the tone and voice of Summers, that it was rather low? - A. Yes; he slipped himself close down by me, rather more similiar than I liked, and said, hark'e, I want to speak to you; he appeared to be very drunk afterwards when he came to the Justice, and Mr. Kinnard was very angry with him, and told him to be sure and come very sober next time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. When was this conversation that you have been descrbing-at the first examination? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. I understood you to say, that this conversation took place in the public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that previous to the second examination? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the second examination? - A. This was at the first examination, and then we all went over at the second examination, he swore to him without hesitation.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober then? - A. I did not see much difference in him, he seemed to speak better, and without hesitation before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. You were present when he did swear to him? - A. I was not present all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Kirton's mother being there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her saying any thing, or doing any thing? - A. Yes; that was at the first examination, he was ordered to look round, the Justice was very angry with him for coming so; he came down, and she tapped him on the elbow, and then he said, that is the man, d-n my eyes, that is the man, and he was instantly ordered to be turned out of the room, he made such a noise.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a coach-maker in Bleeding-heart-yard, Charles-street, Hatton-Garden; I have known the prisoner at the bar some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his being taken up? - A. I was told of it the next morning; I was at the second hearing at Bow-street, and at the Brown bear; Summers was there, he said to Mr. Weeks, as near as I can recollect, are you the prisoner, or do you belong to the prisoner; I sat opposite to Weeks and Summers, and Weeks said to me, what do you think this man says, if I will give him a guinea and an half, he will not swear against the man; Summers was sitting by him then.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Must Summers have heard this? - A. Yes, he was close to him; then Summers got up and went away, and I went over before the Justice, and there I saw Summers, and he was asked if he knew the prisoner, this was at the second examination, and he looked about and did not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you are speaking of the second examination? - A. Yes, I was not at the first.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day of the mouth? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He is certainly mistaken, he must mean the first examination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Certainly, My Lord, there is no doubt of it, it must have been the first.</p>
               <p>JOHN GIBBONS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I drive a hackney-coach for Mrs Catlin; I was present at the second hearing, at Bow-street, when Summers swore to his being the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Summers saying any thing about it after the second hearing? - A. Yes; we went from the office into the Brown-bear, and he came in, and asked which was the horse stealer, he says again, which is the horse stealer, and clapped me on the shoulder, and asked me which was him; I said, that is the gentleman that is accused of it, he tapped him on the shoulder, and he said to the prisoner, my lad, I know nothing of you, I cannot swear to you, but give me hold of your hand, and let us have a drop of porter.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179701110041"></xptr>Court. Q. Were there many people in the house at the time? - A. Yes; they were just come out of the office, and they were all in an uproar.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he say this loud? - A. Yes, loud enough for any body to hear him, if they noticed it.</p>

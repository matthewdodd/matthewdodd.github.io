On 21st August about 10 p.m. I was on duty at Old Swan Pier with Lloyd on the arrival, of the excursion boat—as the people were leaving the pier I saw the prisoners and a man not in custody push amongst them in a very suspicious manner; they ran against the people who were coming out, and the prisoners were pushing towards them as though they were going on to the pier—there was a stoppage at the barrier where they take the tickets in consequence of a man not hav<lb></lb>ing his tieket—Ebell placed himself in front of the prosecutor and Lovett on his left side, and the man not in. custody close behind him—Ebell placed his left hand under his right elbow to the prosecutor's left waistcoat pocket—I could not see. his hand, it was under his elbow at that moment—the gate was opened and the people were moving out—the prosecutor said to Ebell "I have lost my watch and you have got it"—Ebell said "I have not"—I got hold of him the same moment—he said "I have not got his watch, I have one of my own"—I said "I shall charge you, with others, with stealing it"—I took him into custody and Lloyd took the other-at the station both the prisoners said they had been to Rotherhithe—the inspector said" You had not passed the barrier, where are your tickets?"——they said "We gave the tickets up on the pier" they do not sometimes give, them up on the pier, but always at the barrier-neither of the prisoners Had passed the barrier, but Ebell passed through in my custody, and he gave up no ticket then, and no ticket was found on him at the station—I found upon him a ring and 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a pipe and case and fusees—Ebell gave his name, but refused his address, saying that he did not like to be disgraced.</p>

Bell"—we were both in plain, clothes, we do not usually appear in uniform—I heard the altercation at the barrier about the man who had not got his ticket—I seized hold of Ebell and held him; that was directly the man said he had lost his watch; I kept him in my custody—we were 4 or 5 yards from the barrier—there were a good many people coming from the boat, it is a large boat coming from Rotherhithe Gardens—the pier is 60 yards long I cannot tell whether the boat had started when 'the man. shouted out that he had lost his watch—the barrier was shut not more than a minute and a half—the inspector in taking the charge asked where we had brought the prisoners from—I said "Swan Pier"—he asked ""Had you passed the barrier"—I said "No."—I. found on. Ebell a silver Geneva watch and this metal chain worn in the usual way.</p>

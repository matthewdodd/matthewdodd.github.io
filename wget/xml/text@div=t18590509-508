I live at 6, John-street, Curtain-road, and am under cellar<lb></lb>man to Mr. Jones—I was not employed as under cellarman till after Mr. Jones had the business—on 21st December I helped my brother Joseph to bottle and pack some brandy and gin—it was directed to Mr. Austin, Can<lb></lb>terbury—Lambe was there when I took it away to the cloak room, London-bridge station, about 9 o'clock in the morning—I do not know whether that was before Mr. Jones came—I took no porter's book to the station—it was usual when I delivered goods to have them entered in the porter's book, and to get the signature in it of the person to whom they are delivered as the receipt for them—I did not take it on this occasion, because as some stations they will not sign for anything, and nothing was said about it—on Monday, 3d January, I remember Seares going with a truck, with some brandy and sherry, to Ely-place—at this time Mr. Jones's van was going up Holborn, past Ely-place—the van came up just as he set off, but it was not put into the van—I assisted in bottling the sherry and brandy on the previous Saturday.</p>

Curtis, of Ely-place, on 3d January, on a truck in baskets, about nine o'clock—it was two dozen of brandy and six dozen of sherry—I took no delivery book with me—it is the custom when I deliver goods to take a delivery book—the porter's book is the same thing—I asked Mr. Lambe if there was a delivery book to go, and he said "No, the goods are paid for"—he gave me a note to take—I took it with the goods to Messrs. James and Curtis—he said that if they said anything to me about the hamper and bottles, I was to bring them back; but, if they said nothing, I was to come away without them and say nothing about it—I told Mr. Selwood, in Mr. Lambe's presence, that the load was too heavy, the truck not being sound, and Mr. Selwood said that the goods should be tied on—I did not notice the van at the door when I started—I afterwards delivered the brandy and sherry to James and Curtis, and the note with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine, spirit, and beer merchant—in November, 1857, the prisoner was taken into my service, at a salary of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week—it was his duty to obtain orders, enter them in the book, and see them properly delivered—I have never sanctioned or known of any goods leaving my vaults without an entry being first made in the porter's book—I have examined the order book and porter's book of 21st December—the order should be entered in both; in the order book when ordered, and in the porter's book when delivered—in the ordinary course the customer would sign the delivery book—it is usually signed by the servant, if the master is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090100"></xptr>
               <p>not at home—from those books I make out my cash book—there is no entry in the books of any gin or brandy for Mr. Austin, of Canterbury—there is no delivery of those goods on 21st December, at the cloak-room at the Brighton Railway—there is no entry in the order book of six dozen of sherry and two dozen of brandy, to James and Curtis, of Ely-place, nor in the porter's book—I remember the prisoner asking my leave to execute an order for James and Curtis; that was before January 4th—I did not give him leave; I positively refused—I first found out on 31st January that that order had been executed—I had no gin in stock on 21st December—the prices put against the account sent to Austin are the regular market prices—I missed an empty sherry hogshead from the cellar about February 1st or 2d—I did not speak to the prisoner about it; I made enquiries of the cellar-man; and in consequence of information I received, I went, on 11th February, to the west vault of the Custom-house quay, and recognised it full of something, which I did not taste—I have searched the porter's book to see if there was any delivery of that cask—the sending an empty cask to the docks would find its way into the porter's book—I adhere to the strict rule, that nothing shall leave the pre<lb></lb>mises without a signature and receipt—I knew the hands I was in originally—Mr. Tucker has been the solicitor to Mr. Lambe—I never heard that Lambe claimed to be a partner till I made a charge against him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Not the slightest pretence for anything of the kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None. When I said that I knew originally the hands I was in, I meant with reference to Lambe,—a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque will be produced pre<lb></lb>sently—I very likely became acquainted with Mr. Lambe about 1853; it was by calling at his place of business—that was at the Exchange; the very vaults that I am in now—I had a business at Pimlico, as licensed victualler, at that time—I called on him, introduced myself to him, and asked him if he was open to entertain terms to admit me as a partner—I introduced myself as a person anxious to become his partner, if I could—at that time the negociation between us went off—I could not find as much capital as he required to admit me as a partner—he had at that time another business in Bond-street, which I ascertained was not only his, but had been his father's, and had been in the family for the last thirty or forty years—he told me in 1853 that I might go there, and stay there for a week or two, and see if I liked it, and he and I could come to terms—I did so, but did not like it, and therefore gave up entering into partnership with him in respect of that business or the other—I did not see much of him between then and November, 1855—I believe I called on him twice between 1853 and 1857, and each time I mooted the subject again, whether the opportunity had arrived for me to enter into partnership with him—in 1857, he called on me at my place in Chelsea, at 7 o'clock in the morning—it was the day of meeting of his creditors—he said that he was in some pecuniary difficulties, in consequence of being obliged to enlarge the premises; that the opportunity had then arrived when I might treat with him for a share in the business; that he had been unfortunate, and his affairs were in the hands of his creditors, who would be meeting that day at 12 o'clock, and would I meet him at his solicitor's that morning to make an offer, that he might make a composition with his creditors?—I agreed to go, and went—I was to produce 520<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I attended the meeting at Messrs. Tuckers'—the difficulty in which Mr. Lambe was, was discussed; and the negotiation was that I should advance a certain sum of money, in order to enable him to compound with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090101"></xptr>
               <p>his creditors—that was proposed, and I agreed to it—that was the first proposition for the purchase; but that all went off, and the establishment was afterwards sold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there not a negotiation between you and Mr. Lambe, in the presence of Mr. Tucker, to the effect that if you would advance a certain sum of money, sufficient to pay the composition, that Mr. Lambe should retain his interest in the vaults, until such time as an agreement could be come to between you, by deed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I bought it out—under the first arrangement I was to produce a small sum; and while I was ascertaining what I was to have for my money, it was sold over my head-the basis of the first arrangement certainly was that he should retain his interest in the vaults; but it went off—a meeting of creditors was held that very day, after which I had an interview with Mr. Tucker, who said that he accepted my offer of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—it was a letter which said that he accepted my offer—Mr. Humphreys has that letter. (Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GIFFARD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated that he could not put the letter in as his evidence.</hi>) I called on Mr. Tucker subse<lb></lb>quently to receiving the letter, and he told that 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be required within a very few days, and I agreed with him at that interview to furnish that amount—Mr. Lambe was present—he was to retain no share in the busi<lb></lb>ness: are you speaking of the first interview, or the second—If the 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced, he was to retain <hi rend="italic">an</hi> interest—the arrangement was that I was to make him a present of half the profits per annum, if I found it answered my purpose—the place was shut up, and an execution put in—I have no recollection of promising him half the profits; I believe I should not have been so foolish; it was that I should make him a present of half the profits per year, after it had produced me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, clear of all expenses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then, for 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you were to have first 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. clear, and then make him a present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You forget the mortgage—some days did not elapse before I could find the money—I was going through the valuation to see how much I was going to have for my money—Mr. Tucker did not apply to me for the money to pay the first instalment to the creditors; the money was ready—I was going through the valuation—no doubt I was asked to pay, and I did not, for the best of all reasons—Mr. Tucker did not tell me that, as I had not found the money, and as Mr. Lambe's creditors were pressing, he should be obliged to conclude the arrangement with a gentle<lb></lb>man named Chambers—that was communicated to me by letter, by Mr. Tucker; on which I complained to Mr. Tucker of an arrangement being made with Mr. Chambers, and requested him to see if that arrangement could not be cancelled, and I get an interest in the business—that was by words—Mr. Tucker did not see me a few days afterwards, and say that it had been arranged, and Mr. Chambers would give up his claim and let me in, in consideration of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being paid him; I heard of it after I had bought the place—Mr. Lambe called on me, and told me that Mr. Chambers had kindly done so, in consideration of Mr. Lambe's large family, in order that he might have a better agreement with me—I told Mr. Tucker I would buy it, but would have nothing to do with the first agreement, that was, the division of profits—the whole of the money, 1,650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was to be found in two months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have told us that that was to buy the business entirely out; I ask you, in Mr. Tucker's presence, was not the arrangement, after Mr. Chambers had been got rid of, that Mr. Lambe should have half the profits, as before arranged, with this variation, that 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the bonding depart<lb></lb>ment, and 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the free, should be take? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on each side</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090102"></xptr>
               <p>made the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I was to have for my capital, and then I should have made him a present, if he had remained an honest man, although I said at first that there must be an end to the first agreement, that was, provided I ran no risk; I should have said, "Well, I am paying you 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week salary," and I should have made him a present then of 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or, if the profits, were double or treble, in proportion—it was not an explicit understanding between me and Mr. Tucker that Lambe was to have half the profits annually; but I should have made him a present—I said that I should make him a present—it was Mr. Tucker's own suggestion that it should be in the shape of salary, so as to avoid partnership—it was not of half the profits; they would have been a quarter; 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; half the profits after the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid, supposing it had produced as much—I mentioned it being in the shape of salary in Mr. Tucker's presence; that I would make him a present; any way to avoid a partnership—he was to have equivalent to one-fourth the surplus profits, after the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in some shape or form, present or salary—I see Mr. Chambers here—he was not present, but I saw him at his office after that conversation; and there was a conversation between us in reference to Mr. Lambe—I told Mr. Chambers that I had come to an agreement with Mr. Lambe that there was to be no deed at present; but that I considered myself more bound in honour than if there had been a deed to give him half the profits, if it produced it; that he was to have a share in the profits of the concern, and an interest in it, subject to my 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which produced it—I did not go into particulars with Mr. Chambers, to tell him about the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—thin was in November, 1857—I found the necessary money, and the name was painted out, and my name painted up—that was not, to my knowledge, in order that the creditors should not know that he had an interest in the business—I told him to be out of town, and that it would be better for him to stay away from the business for two or three months—that was to prevent his being where he is now—I paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. extra to keep him out of Newgate—that was for warrants—I mean to tell my Lord and the jury that there was a charge against him of a criminal nature, about the mortgage—I have mentioned that before; not at the Mansion House—you are to understand that there was a criminal charge against him; a charge of felony, and I gave him permission to be at these vaults three or four months afterwards, day by day, conducting the business—Mr. Tucker can tell you better than I can what offence he was charged with, because I handed the money to Mr. Tucker—the criminal charge was about abstracting warrants from the warrant book of the Royal Exchange, leaving an empty double butt there instead of a full one for the man who had bought it—he was not to my knowledge charged with that offence at any police court or criminal court in the metropolis—he began to draw his 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week on January 11th, and continued to draw all through the year—he did not draw the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. all the time he was away; he went out of town previously—he did not draw it while he was absent, or, when he came back, for the time he was absent, and has never been paid it in any shape or form—he did not draw it till 11th January—I knew his reasons for his absence—I have a wages <hi rend="italic">slip (The</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered that no question could be asked about this, it being the best evidence of its contents</hi>). In November, 1858, when twelve months from the time of this arrange<lb></lb>ment was approaching, Mr. Tucker had an interview with me on the subject of the interview between me and Mr. Lambe—he said nothing about the time having arrived when it should be embraced in a document—he sug<lb></lb>gested that a memorandum should be given by me; and I agreed that any</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090103"></xptr>
               <p>memorandum my solicitor advised, I would give—it was a memorandum to carry out the arrangement between me and Mr. Lambe—it was not my suggestion to Mr. Tucker, that the agreement should not be entered into till 1st January, because it would be more convenient to take stock at the end of the year—that was to ascertain my profit and loss—between 18th November and the beginning of the year I had several interviews with Mr. Tucker, Mr. Lambe, and my own solicitor, it may have been two or three; when drafts of deeds were discussed—I objected to a portion of it and Mr. Lambe to a portion of it—as far as the profits I should have made him a present of a quarter—I should have adhered to my original idea of making him a present—I mean to tell these twelve gentlemen that that deed was being proposed to enable me to make him a present in the shape of salary; anything to avoid a partnership—this was in December, and I first knew of a robbery, by him, on 31st January—I mentioned it at Mr. Tucker's office for the first time, and he asked that he might have a week given to him—I found that Mr. Lambe was robbing me and that he had sent goods to Ely-place—I saw him after I had made that statement to Mr. Tucker—I told him what I thought of him, and that he had robbed others, and told him to be off—I did not mince words—I received a letter a week or ten days after that from Messrs. Wickens and Burton in reference to this very charge which I had made against Mr. Lambe—between that time and the week or ten days afterwards, when I mentioned it to Wickens and Burton, I took steps to prosecute him—I asked him to explain himself, and finding he never kept his appointments, I went to Wickens and Burton, his new solicitors, who he had just brushed up—I do not know now that they had been his solicitors for years, not till this moment; not for years; I knew that they had been for the last month—Mr. Tucker I always knew as his solicitor, but afterwards I went to Mr. Wickens—after I had made that state<lb></lb>ment to Mr. Tucker, Lambe came to the vaults day after day until I forbid him—I was too anxious for his family, to give him in custody, not for him—it is not for his family's sake that I have brought him here to-day—I sent an officer for him to his residence—on the 14th inst. I received a copy of a writ in an action commenced against me for slander—I had then threatened to give him in custody—I received it the day after I gave him in custody—my solicitor received it afterwards—my solicitor may have had notice of it the day before I gave Lambe in custody, but I did not know it, on my oath; nor had I heard a word about it from any person—I had received a letter intimating that I should be proceeded against—I had received an intimation that morning that I should be prosecuted for slander; and I gave him in custody on the evening of that day—he had no right to have private customers of his own—he had none, or he ought to have had none, while I was with him at the Exchange vaults between 1850 and 1859—he was trading indirectly, which I complained about—he had private customers of his own without my sanction—I believe you have Selwood here to day, I saw him here—the prisoner may have had customers of his own for two months, but not during the whole time—I did not know that the had sold since to James and Curtis—I know it now—I did not know that they were customers of his before I joined him—I never saw them till I traced the stolen property to their possession—I cannot tell you whose property the wine at the Docks is, but I understand it belongs to a Mr. Deacon—I do not understand that it belongs to Lambe—there was not an understanding between me and him that whatever wines he might require for his own private customers he should have at cost price from me—he called at the sale and I was quite willing that any lots which his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090104"></xptr>
               <p>auctioneer might sell he should have at a trifle beyond the cost price—there was not an arrangement between us as regards his dealings with his own private customers—after my complaining to his solicitor, Mr. Tucker, he said it was very irregular and wrong, and Mr. Lambe had a sale to clear himself of any little parcels he had of one lot or another—I was quite willing to deliver any lots at a slight margin on the shipping prices; any which the auctioneer might sell at a public sale—Mr. Such was the auctioneer—I had an interview with him and told him I would part with no lots—Mr. Such is one of his bail—I arranged with Lambe that he should have a certain quantity of wine out of the stock to be sold by Mr. Such, the auctioneer; Lambe to bear all the risk, conditionally that Mr. Such saw me paid—I took the precaution to name to Mr. Such that he should see me paid, and if there was any loss consequent on the sale, I was to have nothing to do with it—in the event of its being a profit<lb></lb>able transaction, Lambe was not to have one portion of the profits and I the other portion; there was a fixed price of it of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. beyond the shipping price which Lambe was to pay—my profit was the margin of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was in December, 1858, and January, 1859—those wines were sherries, brandies, and champagnes—the wine which Mr. Lambe took from me on that occa<lb></lb>sion amounted to 135<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., errors excepted—that is the amount they are invoiced at, but there are false entries—this paper is in my clerk's writing—he had wines under that arrangement to the amount of about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Such paid the money to Mr. Lambe in my presence, and Mr. Lambe handed it back to me—I complained that he did not bring enough, and he said that he would send a cheque next day by post—Mr. Such did not tell me that he did not know me in the transaction and would not know me, and that his dealings were with Mr. Lambe only—I sent my invoice to Mr. Lambe—Mr. Such did not upon that come and tell me he would have no dealings except with Mr. Lambe—he handed the money to Mr. Lambe, and as a point of etiquette I allowed it to pass—Lambe did not put it in his pocket—it was not a cheque, it was gold and notes—I complained that it was not enough and he sent me a cheque next day payable to me, which I passed through my bankers—on my oath that cheque was payable to me—it was sent to me by post, and I sent it through my bankers—I rather think Counsel have it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced, and payable to Mr. Lambe</hi>)—it came to me by post.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this envelope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); now on your solemn oath, I ask you whether that cheque was sent to you or to Mr. Lambe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My belief was that it was sent to me by post direct—I know that I got the cheque because I complained of not having enough—I must have been mistaken about its coming by post—it was not dishonoured, it was paid—the sherries and the brandies with Mr. Such were between 2d December, 1858, and 7th January, 1859—I do not know whether the sale Mr. Such had to conduct, was a suc<lb></lb>cessful one—I made no calculation of profit and loss upon it—it was no business of mine—I knew Mr. Such had promised to see me paid—I mean to tell you that Mr. Such promised to pay me himself; that was the first precaution I took—I was walking down the main arch at the time—if there was included in this very transaction with Mr. Such three dozen of brandy, in December, they were delivered to Mr. Such: if you will give me that invoice I will tell you—the wines and spirits were dozens of brandy and dozens of sherry—they were delivered to Mr. Such and the man fetched them and signed for them—I should not let the parcels go without the money, only the samples; the stock remained in the vaults—I have a book in which I enter the wages of my servants—on one occasion the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185905090105"></xptr>
               <p>complained of the word salary being entered, as applied to the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he was receiving; not to me, but I heard at the vaults at the time he was com<lb></lb>plaining to the accountant about it—I was not an instant there—he struck his pen through the word—the conversation was with my book-keeper, not with me nor in my presence, I simply came in at the time he was scolding him for putting it there—I did not say that I would take care that it should never occur again—I did not say such a foolish thing as that; I made no answer at all—I had no wish to degrade him, or make him less in the estimation of the other servants—he took his 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. weekly, not always—it was not sometimes settled in an account—he and I used to take wines and spirits from the stores for our own consumption, and have it entered in a book at cost price—it was entered at the full price and afterwards merely charged at cost, and an allowance made—all articles were booked at the full price.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With regard to this, which you call salary, when the money was taken by him, were not deductions occasionally made in respect of whatever might be debited to him in regard to the wines and spirits he had had for his own consumption? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In regard to the money he has taken without my sanction at any other times, then I have deducted the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. salary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then did not he pay for the wines and spirits that he had? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No: not at all; it is still on the books as a debt.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Deloitte and Greenwood, the eminent accountants who detected Redpath and Robson, to make me out a set of books to check irregularities—the prisoner was away for two months from 11th November to 11th January; it was not after 11th January that he was away for two months—it was not during February and March that he was absent; I swear that without any hesitation—he was not away for three months after January, 1858, not at any period of the year after January—he was away in November and December with my sanction—I knew the dangerous position he was in, and I permitted his absence, but I paid him his 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness (continued</hi>). I forget the particulars of what Mr. Tucker told me—I know it was some serious matter—it was a criminal charge respecting warrants that should have been at the mortgagees, but were not there; I did not go into the particulars; I know there was some irregularity with regard to dock war<lb></lb>rants—I forget exactly what it was Mr. Tucker told me; the substance of it was, that Lambe was in imminent danger, and I gave the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to help him out of it—I knew what I paid the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for; I knew that I placed the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Mr. Tucker's hands to keep him from the Mansion House; Mr. Tucker told me so; I was not anxious to know all the details; it was enough for me to find the money—when Mr. Lambe came back, on 11th January, he told me he had settled the matter, and gave me the I.O.U. and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he handed me five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and gave me the I.O.U. for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I forget exactly the words he said; I knew it was settled, and I was very glad to find that he was out of such a serious difficulty—he said it was settled—when I originally took this business of Mr. Lambe, he assigned me all his licenses—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); this is his signature—about the time that I took possession, there was an agreement in writing between us—possession was given to me, by means of a bottle, in the name of the owner, by Mr. Tucker—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">put in the transfer of the Licenses, dated November,</hi> 1857)—I heard from Lambe that Chambers had agreed to give 1080<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the business—I ultimately agreed to give 1650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received a letter on the 14th; I had not seen my solicitor or that letter until after I had given the prisoner into custody—I had consulted Mr. Humphreys, the attorney conducting this prosecution, to prosecute Mr. Lambe—I had con<lb></lb>sulted Mr. Evans, my private solicitor, on the same subject a fortnight before, and he brought me to Mr. Humphreys on the 12th February—I have mentioned some false entries; they are in Mr. Such's bill; they are in my accountant's handwriting—when I found out that the prisoner had private customers, I complained of it; that was at the beginning of December, 1858—he promised to discontinue them—I have an account with the London and Westminster bank—the cheques referred to were crossed cheques—Lambe had no banker to my knowledge—the money that Mr. Such produced was handed over to me in Lambe's presence—the draft-deed that was pre<lb></lb>pared for the purpose of carrying out my original arrangement was prepared by Messrs. Tucker and New; this is it (<hi rend="italic">this was put in and read—in sub<lb></lb>stance, it was an agreement that Jones, having purchased the business of Lambe, he (Lambe) should assist him in the same as manager, buyer, and assistant, upon receiving an annual salary equal to a moiety of the profits,</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to be paid weekly on account of the said sum, and that Lambe should not be considered or be in fact a partner in the business, or in any manner interested in the capital or profits, or be liable for any of the losses or debts</hi>)—I objected to sign this until a case had been laid before counsel, to see whether it would constitute a partnership—this was drawn by Mr. Tucker—before the Lord Mayor, Mr. Tucker was called as a witness for Mr. Lambe—it was while negotia<lb></lb>tions were going on for the execution of this deed, that I found out the defalcations I have spoken of—it was in consequence of that that the nego<lb></lb>tiations were broken off—I stated that to Mr. Tucker, and also to Messrs. Wickers and Burton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor—in November, 1857, I was consulted by Mr. Jones with reference to the purchase of this business—I had an interview with Mr. Lambe, and his solicitor, Mr. Tucker, separately and together on 10th November, I had seen Mr. Tucker, and very likely Mr. Lambe previously, but I forget; but on 10th November, Lambe called alone, and he then told me that the negotiation which had been previously existing for the purchase of this business, but which had been abandoned in consequence of the sale to Mr. Chambers, had been revived in favour of Mr. Jones; that Mr. Chambers had given up his purchase—he then said that Mr. Jones was to purchase, and we had some discussion about the terms—I have no doubt that he said "purchase"—I have not a perfect recollection of the word, but the subject is so vividly impressed upon my mind, that I have no doubt about it—we then talked of the arrangements that were to be made between them, and he either told me then, or I had known previously, that those arrangements were of a special nature; and as I was apprehensive that it might involve a partnership with Mr. Lambe, I stipulated with him most emphatically that it should not involve a part<lb></lb>nership, and he, very distinctly indeed, assented to that—I have a book here in which I entered the particulars of that interview—it is on 10th November, 1857—I have no doubt this entry was made the next day—it is under the head of 11th November (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Jones, Mr.—10th. Attending Mr. Lambe yesterday, upon his informing me that his treaty with you was intended to be revived; discussing the terms with him, and especially the reason of the intended agreement with him, when he quite agreed they should not be such as to involve a partnership")—that is my entry as a charge against Mr. Jones—I afterwards saw Mr. Lambe and Mr. Tucker together—I do not know whether a discussion took place with regard to this matter again, but the matter was very much discussed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am bookkeeper in the prosecutor's service—I remember Selwood being dismissed; shortly after that I discovered in the Government permit book something about brandy, sent to a person named Austin; the prisoner was not there, but I afterwards called his attention to the entry in the trade books—he first spoke about it—he said to me, that I had not charged his private account with any brandy—I said, "What brandy?"—he said, "the brandy that went to Mr. Austin"—I said that there was no brandy in the books—I had not found a trace of the brand sent to Mr. Austin in the government permit book before this; this was about a week after the conversation—Mr. Jones and I went through the permit book, and found an entry of some brandy to Mr. Austin—I did not know all about it at that time—the conversation that I am speaking of with Lambe was previous to that; I am sure that at the time I went through the books I knew nothing about that brandy; that might be three or four days or a week before Lambe spoke to me—I believe that my going through the book with Mr. Jones, and coming upon an entry of Austin's brandy, was after I had the conversation with Lambe which I have just mentioned—I believe I told Mr. Jones that Mr. Lambe had spoken to me about it, I won't be sure—I do not remember being directed to enter it by Lambe—when I say there was no entry in the books, I mean the order book and the delivery book—I discovered that there was no entry in them—when we found the entry in the permit book, we looked in the delivery book to see if there was any entry, and there was none at all; they were all posted up; and, had it been entered, it must have come into the ledger—I said in that conversa<lb></lb>tion that there was no entry in the books; I looked through them twice—when Mr. Lambe spoke to me about the matter, I believe I asked him whe<lb></lb>ther he had sent any bill to Mr. Austin—the solicitor has taken my evidence down in writing—when the prisoner asked me whether I had sent any bill to Mr. Austin, I said, "No;" it was Lambe that asked me, and he said, "Don't do it"—I do not think he said anything then about Mr. Jones—he did say, "Has Mr. Jones told you to send it;" and I said, "The bill is to go"—he told me that in the event of Mr. Jones telling me to send the bill, that I was not to do it—I gave my evidence to this gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Humphreys</hi>) I remember making up the accounts at Christmas—Selwood was dismissed before Lambe was taken in custody, perhaps three weeks before; I should think it was about the middle of January—this is Mr. Lambe's writing (<hi rend="italic">Looking at some printed bill-heads, filed up in writing, headed, "Bought of John Jones"; and signed, "Received A.

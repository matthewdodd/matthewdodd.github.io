                  </hi>. I am a cadet in the Royal Military Academy, at Woolwich—one day last October I went into the racket-court, and left my gold hunting-watch in my tunic-pocket, in the dressing-room belonging to the racket-ground—upon my return, I missed my watch—I had paid 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it about six months before—I know the boy Meopham, I used to see him about at that time—he was there frequently, and upon that day—after I missed my watch I gave information to the police, and caused inquiries to be made after it—I asked Meopham if he had seen anybody about the court on that evening, and he said, "Nobody, but two bird-catchers;" two people who had been catching birds, as he supposed—I have since seen my watch—it was shown to me at Walworth about a month ago—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

About five weeks ago, in con<lb></lb>sequence of information, I went to Mr. Prosser's shop, Wellington-street, "Woolwich, with another constable, Randall—I saw his Wife and Meopham—I got him away from the shop by telling him something about breaking a window—I then said, "We are police-officers, and we are going to take you in custody for stealing a gold hunting-watch from the racket-court at the Royal Academy, Woolwich, about six months ago, and you sold it to your master for 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said, "That I did not, he only gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a pair of boots for it"—I said," More shame for him, "and I then cautioned him, and told him that whatever he stated to me I should have to give in evidence against him—I then took him to the station—I had left a message with Mrs. Prosser, and about five hours afterwards Prosser came to the station—I said to him, "Mr. Prosser, I believe?—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I suppose you have come about the boy"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "He is charged with stealing a gold watch from the Academy six months ago, and you gave him half a sovereign and a pair of boots for it"—he said, "Yes, I did"—I said, "Where is the watch?"—he said, "I have got it"—I said, "No, you have not, it is pawned; where is the ticket?"—he said, "It is at home"—I said, "Well, I will go with you and get it"—we went to the house, and he told his wife to go up and get the ticket for that watch—I went up with her, and she gave me this ticket, with seven others—the date on the ticket is 29th December, 1862, at Mr. Warry's, 14, Skinner-street—I then returned to the station with Prosser, and confronted the prisoners with one another—I cautioned the boy first, and then said, "Is this your master?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Is this the person that you sold the watch to for half a sovereign and a pair of boots"—he said, "I have said enough, I shall not say any more"—I said to Prosser, "You hare beard what he says"—he said, "Yes; it is all right; I gave him half a sovereign and a pair of boots"—this is the watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there a person examined at the police-court in this matter of the name of Mr. John Purcell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was; I took him there to be examined—I have not brought him here to day—I believe you have got him; he is here—I did not hear him prove that he had seen Mr. Prosser. wearing this watch openly for weeks and weeks—I was present when he was examined—he did not say that to my recollection; I will swear he did not—he told me that he had seen Meopham with the watch—I don't know whether he told the Magistrate so—Purcell told me that Meopham had offered to sell him this very watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Meopham.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Meopham's Defence.</hi> The prosecutor says that I was present when he missed his watch, and he said. "Oh. I thought I had my watch with me,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186306080113"></xptr>
               <p>therefore that would throw a doubt as to whether he brought his watch there or not He mentioned the loss of his watch in my presence, but never noticed any change in me, nor did I shun his company. Crouch did not say when he took me, that he wanted me about the watch I stole, but about the watch I sold to my master. I had sold a watch to my master, but not that one, and I told him directly what he gave me for it. They were both asking me questions going to the station, and I could not answer them satisfactorily: whatever I said, I said before I was cautioned. You, will find nothing to connect me with the watch.</p>

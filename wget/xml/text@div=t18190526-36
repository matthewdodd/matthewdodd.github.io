            . I am constable of Bishopsgate Ward. On Thursday, the 20th of May, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I received information of the two prisoners coming out of a linen-draper's shop. Blakeley was seen by a woman to put something under her apron after she came out. They turned down Catherine-wheel-alley, leading to Petticoat-lane. I immediately went after them, and overtook them in conversation together. Blakeley had a basket before her, and was lifting something up underneath it. I asked her what she had got under her apron? she said she had nothing. I put my hand to her apron, and found the print under it. Brown walked a little forward - I called to a young man who was there to bring her back, which he did. I never lost sight of her, and am sure she is the woman who was with Blakeley. I searched her, and found a piece of cotton on her, which she had bought at the prosecutor's shop. I took her back to Mr. Nott's shop, and asked him if he had lost anything? he said, No, not that he knew of. I produced the piece of cotton to him, with the mark and ticket on it - he claimed it directly, and said he had not sold it. I also produced the piece which I found upon Brown - he said he had sold it to her.</p>

The prisoners came to my shop together on the 20th of May, I sold them a small bit of print for 2 s. - I do not know which bought it, they were together. The officer brought them back in about ten minutes after, with this piece of print, which is my property. It is marked in two places with my private mark, and the number of yards. It is worth 24 s.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were in the shop had you observed any thing - A. I was informed they were suspicious characters while they were in the shop, and came forward to take notice of them, but saw them take nothing, though I was on the watch.</p>

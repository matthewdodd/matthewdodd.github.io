                  </hi>. I am a leather-dresser, and live in West-street, Walworth. On the 24th of Nov., between twelve and one o'clock, I was in the New Kent-road, going home, and met the prisoner—she said, "Where are you going?"—I said, "I am going home"—I was close against a door, and was forced into a house—I think the door was <hi rend="italic">ajar</hi>—I had had a little drink, but was sober enough to know what I was doing—when I got into the house there was another woman there besides the prisoner—I am sure she is one of them—they both began to rummage my pockets—I had a purse containing five or six shillings—I am quite sure I had it safe five minutes before I was pulled into the house—they took the purse out of my pocket, stripped the coat from my back, and forced me into the street—I called "Police!"—a policeman came, and I gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I heard a cry of "Police!" I went to the place, and found Dennis standing in his shirt sleeves—I knocked at the door, but could gain no admission—I forced it open, and found the prisoner in the house—Dennis charged her with having rummaged his pockets, and taken his coat from his back—she said she certainly took the coat, but did not intend to keep it, and denied all knowledge of the money—I found no purse on her—I found the coat folded up on the bed up stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was in the house when he came to the door with a prostitute; he asked if he could have a room? I said, "Yes;" he then threw sixpence on the table; I fetched some gin; when I came back he said he would have us both; we went up into the bed-room with him, and he left his coat with us for half-a-crown a piece, but he went to bed with her; when he came down he said he would have his coat, or he would swear a robbery against us.</p>

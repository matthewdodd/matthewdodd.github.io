I was at that time a serjeant in the police- I was sent for, and found this baize between the bed and the mattress; but, before I found that, I went into the prisoner's bed-room; she took an opportunity and put half-a-crown into my hand, and said it was for me to speak as favourably as I could - I put it down again, and she took it up.[

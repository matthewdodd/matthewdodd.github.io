                  </hi>. I am a furniture remover in Kennington Park Road—on Saturday, 13th November, I received a message, and went to 82, Fentiman Road about 12 in the day—I there saw Henry Simmons, and he asked me to remove an iron bedstead, a palliasse, and a wool mattress to Camberwell Road; he said he was going to sell them—I had a ran with me; the things were put in, and Henry went with me to Mr. Cogs<lb></lb>well and paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for moving the things—I went upstairs and assisted Henry in bringing the things down—I did not see Frederick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Frederick Simmons.</hi> I saw your brother; he helped me move the things—I did not see you; you did not say to me, "Be sure and bring the right one next time;" nothing of the sort occurred—I only went into one room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Cogswell, of 275, Camber well Road, furniture dealer and pawnbroker—on Friday, 12th November, Henry Simmons called and said, "Do you buy furniture?"—I said, "Yes, what have you to sell?"—he said, "An iron bedstead, mattress, and pillows;" he said he would bring them, that they were</p>

               <p>in Queen's Road, Peckham; he said they were his aunt's, that she had furnished a house and was unsuccessful in letting it, and wanted to dispose of some of the furniture—on Saturday, between 12 and 1, he came with the bedstead, mattress, and palliasse, and I bought them for 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; they were quite new, and had never been used; Mr. Sanford has since seen and identified them—when the goods were delivered I said to Henry, "I shan't pay you, I shall pay your aunt," and about 3 that afternoon an elderly female came, and I gave her the 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and she signed this receipt—Henry said if I gave him a good price for these things he would bring some more, in a day or two he would hare a carpet.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective W</hi>). On Monday morning, 15th November, I received the prisoners in custody at Lambeth Police-court on a charge of fraudulently obtaining goods from Messrs. Patterson—I told them that as the offence was committed in the City they would have to go with me to the Mansion House—Frederick said, "It is a shame to detain me in custody, as I have not been seen in the transaction at all"—Henry said, "I have used no false pretence; I shall be able to prove it is a debt."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Henry Simmons, in his defence, stated that he had taken the rooms and ordered the furniture for his aunt, who was an independent lady, and that he had made no false pretence to any of the witnesses. Frederick Simmons urged that there was no proof that he had taken any part in any fraudulent transaction.</hi>

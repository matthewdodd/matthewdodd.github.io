I was coming up Swan-yard - I had been into the Swan, public-house, where I had a glass of liquor. As I came up the yard I met the prisoner and four others - I had seen one of the others before. I did not know the prisoner before. I had been in the public-house about an hour - I had not been to bed all night - I had drank a great deal. but was neither drunk nor sober. I met the prisoner and five others in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q.In that state of intoxication, how can you swear he is the man - A. I had got as far as Brydges-street - they came up, forced me back, and threw me down at the corner of Swan-yard. They took hold of my two arms and legs, and threw me on my back-the prisoner stood before me, with his head in my stomach. When I got up, I found my pocket cut, and my money taken, which amounted to 14s.. In about three weeks the prisoner was taken - I knew him to be the man. I had put my money in my pocket, after paying my reckoning at the public-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you was so drunk that you did not know who robbed you - A. No; I never doubted the prisoner's being one of the men.</p>

            . I am a tailor. On Sunday morning, about a quarter before seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner in White Horse-yard; there was a crowd - I found it was the prosecutor, who was intoxicated, and a woman was trying to get him home. The prisoner, and five others, went up to him, and asked him for some gin - They told him he had no money. He pulled out three half-crowns and two shillings - They took him back with them into Swanyard. The prisoner then pressed his head against his stomach, and two others caught his arms-the prisoner pulled his legs and threw him down. He had a knife, cut his pocket, and took the money out - I saw the money in his hands-he immediately left; two went one way and three the other. I saw the prisoner about a month after, and knew him again immediately.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did you not stop them, when you saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280007"></xptr>them rob him - A. I was afraid - I was going to do it, but a young man told me I should get hurt myself if I did.</p>
               <p>JOHN HAWKES. I am a constable of St. Clement's. I took the prisoner at a coffee-shop in Wych-street. Goy fetched me to take him.</p>

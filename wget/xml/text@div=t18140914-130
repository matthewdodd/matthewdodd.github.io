I lost ten shirts; I was out about ten minutes, about half past eight in the morning, I went out my work; I left my husband's breakfast at the are, and a loaf and butter in the cupboard for him to get his breakfast. I came back at half after nine; I asked my husband if he had breakfasted; he said, no. There was nothing for him to eat; I looked in the cupboard; the loaf and butter was gone. I missed my shirts; a child said, a man had been in my room; he said, he came with something to be washed. Mr. Crocker has got my things.</p>

On the 26th of January, I went to bed between eight and nine o'clock, and fastened the house; about four in the morning I heard a noise - I struck a light, looked at my watch, and it was four o'clock; I opened my bed-room window, and hallooed, Halloo! thinking if there were any thieves, it would send them away - the noise was at the back part of the house, which is only one story high - I then got into bed again, not hearing any more, and left my light burning - I got up at six o'clock; I found my doors open, and about 16lbs. of pork was gone from a pickling pan in the washhouse, the door of which had been locked the night before - I found all the back doors open, and the windows - the lock wrenched off the middle door between the kitchen and wash-house; the catch of the lock had been forced out - it must have been done with an instrument - I came to look about, and missed a basket and a few trifling things; I saw the pork again the same day; it was cut into pieces, and one bit where the leg was cut out there is a hook - I know my own cut well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Was not the prisoner taken up, and set at liberty? A. That was about a hat; he was taken within half a mile of my house - I had seen him about once after the robbery, two or three months before he was taken, but I was not certain about him.</p>

            . I live at Enfield-highway - I have known the prisoner almost all my life; he came on the Saturday night before the robbery into the room of the house I lived in then; John Dearman was in the room - Dearman lived at the house; he called John Dearman out; it was between seven and eight o'clock on Saturday night, and he went out; and on the Monday night I saw him - he came and called

             out again - he called him out twice on the Monday night - the last time was between twelve and one o'clock; I was in bed then - I was sleeping in the same room; he said he knew where the old woman's watch and her money lay - he did not say what old woman - Dearman went out with him, and a little before five o'clock they both came in together, and I brought the pork with them, which Mrs. Roberts afterwards claimed: it was tied up in a blue handkerchief - I have seen the prisoner about afterwards, but not so much as before the pork was put away; Mrs. Roberts saw some of it in a box in the room in which I sleep, the day after it was brought in, and said it was the pork she had lost - I did not at that time tell her what I knew about it; I was examined before the Magistrate on the Wednesday after, and there I gave an account of it - James at that time lodged about a quarter of a mile off; he and Dearman told me, if any thing happened, to take the pork out - I did not take it all out - I took out part of it, and buried it under ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have told us all you know about it? A. No; while James was in prison he wished to see me - I went, and he said he would write to his sister, and I should have a sovereign if I would say he only came in to inquire about Tom Bedford, and that I only knew him by his dress; I was tried here myself for this offence- I did not at first know the pork was stolen; I told several people about it before I was taken up - I saw the prisoner two or three times after of an evening, but I did not know where he was to be found.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not your motive for coming forward now, because the prisoner would not come, and swear falsely for you and Dearman? A. No; I was never in custody before; Dearman sent the prisoner a letter to come and see him, but I never asked him to come forward - I saw him once at the Cock public-house at Hounslow, and at the King's Arms public-house, about three o'clock in the afternoon - I never saw him at any other place, except of an evening; there was no officer to give him in charge - if they had come for me, when Dearman was here, I should have come and spoken the truth; I know nothing of his having been asked to come forward to swear an alibi.</p>

            . I am a constable of Enfield. On Tuesday, the 27th of January, I went to this woman's house; Dearman lived there too - I found about 15 lbs. or 16 lbs. of pork: Lawrence was at home - the pork was in a chest among some clothes in a pan, and about two o'clock I heard Roberts had been robbed of pork; she went there with me, and there were only three pieces left - the pan was gone; she identified one piece in particular - when I first saw the pork it was in three or four pieces; I apprehended Dearman; and through the information of Lawrence I found one small piece of pork buried in the garden - I never could see the prisoner till six weeks or two months after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110160"></xptr>wards; we took him before the Magistrate about a hat, and then Lawrence was not to be found - he was taken upon this charge on the 12th of May; I found him in the house of a Mrs. Roberts, where he lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Perhaps you were not very active in looking for him? A. I knew he had been to several public-houses in our parish - I have been sent for, but he got away before I came - Lawrence cohabited with Dearman, who has been convicted; I never knew of her being with any body else.</p>

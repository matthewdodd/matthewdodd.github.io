            . I dealt with the prosecutor for bread. Some time in June I paid the prisoner 1l., but he has made a memorandum of it and put it down the 13th of May - here is the bill in his writing; I have known him two years, and dealt with him when he was a master.</p>

            . The prisoner never accounted to me for these sums in any way - I did not know they had been paid till after I had discharged him; I then went to him, and told him he was charged with embezzling my money; he said I was liar - he was confused; I gave charge of him- the officer afterwards brought me a bill of sale, saying he would pay by instalments.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Did not he give you notice to quit? A.No, Sir; I discharged him for spoiling the bread - I had lent him some money, and took 1s. or 2s. a week of him, as he could spare it; the security he offered was not for that money - he said it was for the money he had wronged me of; I charged him with embezzling 6l. -I know this bill; (looking at one) it is a bill of last January - my books are not confused; I am the only person to whom the prisoner accounted for money which he received - the prisoner left a sovereign with my wife and one with her mother, but I do not call that accounting to them; I have never said I would give 500l. to send him abroad.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character, and a master promised to employ him.</p>

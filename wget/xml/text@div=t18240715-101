On the 1st of May, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in my stationery shop - he held in his hand a list of numbers and titles of some periodical publications; which were then publishing He said he wished as many looked out for him as that list contained; but I was not to trouble myself to get those which I had not by me. I put the list into my desk, and did not look them out then - he said he would call again for them, but did not say when; he went away and in the evening between seven and eight o'clock, (I think nearer eight), I saw him again in the stationer's shop, his conversation was addressed to my wife - I was not within hearing. I was in the snuff shop, and went into the shop before he left, for Mrs. Dolby came to me and asked if they were looked out - the list was at that time in my desk - she took it out; I said they were not ready, for the gentleman did not say when he should call. I do not think that he heard this conversation. Mrs. Dolby took the list from me and went into the shop to him, as if to explain it - I afterwards walked into the shop - she was then looking out the things, and placing them on the counter before him; I went back to the other shop as a customer came in - but returned to the stationary shop before he left, and had an opportunity of seeing him both then and in the morning; he was not above three minutes in the shop in the morning - when I saw him in the evening I had no doubt of his being the person who left the list. He was under my observation in the evening for ten or fifteen minutes, the things took some time to look out. When I was very much engaged in the tobacco shop, Mrs. Dolby gave an alarm, and the things were gone, and the list was gone. I have not the least doubt whatever of his being the man. My house is about five hundred yards from Great Marlborough-street,</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. You never found any of the property - A. No, Mrs. Dolby looked out the books in the evening, she was in the shop for about a minute in the morning - the books are worth 10 s.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 1st of May, I was at home, and saw the prisoner in the shop about eleven o'clock in the morning - he brought a list of periodical publications; I heard him say he wished for those numbers to be got ready for him; but what numbers we had not got, he did not wish Mr. Dolby to get - I looked at him the whole of the time he was in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the same person in the evening - A. Yes, as near as I can guess it was between seven and eight o'clock - it might be near eight; he came into the shop and asked me if those things were ready which he had ordered in the morning; I said, I believed they were not, but would enquire - I went into the tobacco shop, and asked Mr. Dolby. Mr. Dolby had given me the list in the morning - I returned to the shop and said they were not ready - he said</p>
               <p>"Pray what is the reason they are not ready;" he spoke in rather a raised tone; he then said</p>
               <p>"Well, look them out and I will wait for them" - I looked out all we had, and laid them on the counter before him, and said I believed the principal part of the numbers he had ordered in the morning were there, he then

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. His lodgings were pointed out to you - A. Yes, I searched his trunks but found no property claimed by any one; every facility was given me to search - he told me himself when he was taken where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Gentlemen, in this case as in the former, I shall be enable to clearly prove that the witnesses labour under a mistake; by proving a clear and undeniable alibi.</p>
               <p>MR. FENTON ROBINSON. I am the prisoner's brother, and have been in the army. I reside in Eberry-terrace, Pimlico. I heard of this charge on the day after he was taken; he frequently denied and drank tea with me. On Saturday, the 1st of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I met him in the Park; we parted, and I went home to dinner; he came to me about six, (before I had finished dinner,) and remained with me till nearly eleven: he was not out of my house, or out of my sight all that time; I think I walked part of the way home with him. Cheese-man, my servant was there.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Are you in the army now - A. No, I am on half-pay.</p>
               <p>Q. As he was frequently in the habit of coming to your house, what brings to your mind the transaction of the 1st of May - A. It was the first time he ever drank tea without dining with me; I do not recollect whether I met him accidentally or by appointment; we were together till near five o'clock; he parted with me at the bottom of Grosvenor-place; Eberry-terrace is a quarter of a mile further.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any reason assigned for his parting with you so near your house - A. No; I asked him to come to tea; I have no reason for saying it was on the 1st of May, except from it being the first time he drank tea without dining; I knew he was engaged in business; he wore a blue coat, but what trowsers, neckcloth or waistcoat, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after his apprehension was this charge made - A. At his second examination; I was not at the first examination; he frequently drank tea with me afterwards without dining, but not so often as when he dined; my female servant, Sadler, was also at home; he might have drank tea with me half a dozen times in May.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Was it at Marlborough-street you first considered of his having been with you on any particular occasion - A. I believe it was; I have not the slightest doubt of what I have stated; I cannot be mistaken.</p>

               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. How often in May did he drink tea with your master - A. I dare say half a dozen times; I know it was on the 1st of May, because it was the first time he drank tea there without dining; that is my only reason.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master observe that to you - A. No; he never drank tea there in April without dining; he did after the 1st May; the first time he ever came into the house was on Easter Sunday.</p>

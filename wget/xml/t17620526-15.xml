Last Tuesday was sevennight, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the two prisoners came into my house and called for a tankard of beer. I had known the man upwards of 20 years, the woman I never saw before to my knowlege. I drew it in a silver tankard: they were in the kitchen, and nobody there but themselves. He smoaked a pipe. I went out, and left my daughter

             at home. I was soon sent for by some of my neighbours, and when I came home I found a French plate beilied tankard, with the beer in it, and mine was gone. [She produced the French plate bellied tankard.] This is what they left, it is not like mine: mine was an old-fashioned tankard, not with a belly, but streight, with a wide bottom: it cost me nine guineas. The neighbours went some one way and some another, but could not meet with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been gone out of your house before you was sent for?</p>
               <p>M. Green. I had not been gone a quarter of an hour. I was not got into the house I was going to. The woman was taken in the Minories that very night, and brought to my house about nine o'clock. The man was taken over the water. I never found my tankard again. Soloman said before the Justice, that the woman had a tankard when she came into my house, and another when she went out. The woman denied knowing any thing of it.</p>

            . I am Mrs. Green's daughter: the two prisoners came into our house, and called for a tankard of beer: they came into the room in which I was ironing. They said they would go into a room that was cooler. There was no fire in the room I was in; but there was one in the kitchen where they went. My mother carried them a tankard of beer in a silver tankard, not at all like this French plate one. He called for a pipe: my mother carried him one. After that I went into the room they were talking together in their own language,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176205260010"></xptr> I did not understand them. The tankard was then standing before them. My mother went out to a neighbour's, and they went away about ten minutes after, and sent the reckoning to me by a young man that lodged in the house, and is now gone to sea. He went into the room to fetch a pair of shoes as they were going out: they gave him the money to give to me. I observed the woman had something in her apron that looked like the size of a tankard, with a flat bottom, which I saw through her apron. I went into the room four or five minutes after for a heater, and saw this French plate tankard upon the table. I knew directly it was not our tankard: it was full of beer all but about half a pint. The young man said the Jews have got the tankard, and left this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else go into the kitchen while the prisoners were there?</p>
               <p>E. Halbert. No; only the young man, and he went just within for his shoes.</p>

            . I was going through Mrs. Green's house with some cloaths to hang in the yard. I saw the woman at the bar take up the tankard and drink as I went by her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it this tankard?</p>
               <p>M. Mother. No, it was not this: it was an old-fashioned tankard.</p>

               <p>I drank part of a tankard of beer: I paid my reckoning, and went out.</p>
               <p>Levi's defence.</p>
               <p>We went in and call'd for a tankard of beer: there were more people in the room than us. We paid our reckoning in order to go over the water. I had bread and cheese in my lap to eat. It is a public house where one goes and another comes, and they put it upon us because we are Jews.</p>

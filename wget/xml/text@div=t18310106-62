            . I am a Police-officer. On the 20th of December, about eleven o'clock, I was in Queen's-row, Pimlico - in consequence of what I had heard I stopped the prisoner, and found on him two pairs of shoes and one pair of boots: I told him I understood that property was stolen - he denied it, and then said, if they were he did not steal them, but another lad had given them to him; there was another lad with him, who ran away - these shoes and boots were claimed by Mr. Higgins, who lives two or three hundred yards off.</p>

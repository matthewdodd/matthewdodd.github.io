            . I am a watchman. I was on duty on Sunday morning, the 28th of May, at half-past four o'clock, and saw a coach stop on Snow Hill, about one hundred yards from Mr. Clark's; I afterwards saw it was No. 324 - the coachman got off the box, and let a man out of the coach; I did not see any other person - the man and the coachman had some discourse for a short time; he was about Snow-hill and King-street for about half an hour; I was on the opposite side of the way - the coach moved on to Smithfield, and then down to Holborn-bridge - it remained there some minutes, and then came up again and went on to Smithfield - it then got on towards five o'clock - that enabled me to see the coachman, and I believe the prisoner to be the man - the man who got out of the coach joined him again at Holborn-bridge - the coach was empty as far as I could judge; I am sure it was the same man who got out; he was lame with one foot, and had one shoe down at heel; they conversed two or three minutes - the coach then went up Snow-hill and into Smithfield; I followed it - the man was walking along the pavement, and the coach driving leisurely; when they came to Smithfield they stopped at the corner of Hosier-lane - it was then five o'clock; I thought the coach was waiting to go into the Hospital; I went into the watch-house and mentioned it; two of our watchmen came out directly - the corner of Hosier-lane is about fifty yards from Mr. Clark's - my time was then up; I am on the Snow-hill beat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You had full opportunity of seeing the number? A. Yes; there was no concealment about the coachman; I saw him on the box - he staid there a short time and passed me again; he saw me; if I had thought he was about any thing wrong I should have gone and seized him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you able to say positively that it was the same coach that was driving up and down for above half an hour? A. Yes; I have no doubt it was the same coachman; I believe the prisoner is the man; I have no doubt of it; I will not swear positively to him; I read the number on the coach at a quarter before five o'clock, and put it down; I did not look at the number the first time it passed me, but I am sure it was the same coach; I should have known it without the number.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was coming out of the watch-house, and Rice gave me information - I went to the corner of Hosier-lane with a watchman, named Tilling, about a few minutes after five o'clock; I saw the coach at Mr. Clark's door; I saw a humper put into the coach by two men - it was such a hamper as shoes and boots are put in to come to town - there was one man in the coach, but I did not see him; I am sure the prisoner was the coachman on the box; the coach door was shut, and the two men went on and beckoned the coachman to follow them, which he did - they turned up King-street; the coach continued to follow, about twenty yards behind them, till they came to White Horse-court, Cow-Cross, and there they beckoned very strongly and disappeared; I saw no more of them - the coachman went down Cow-cross, along Ray-street and Back-hill into Gray's Inn-road; I there saw the coachman turning round, and talking to the man in the coach; I went on to just on this side Cromer-street, and saw it turn up, and there I left it, being tired, and went on; I did not know I had authority to stop it; I asked the other watchman if I should do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was broad day-light, and the coachman was sitting on his box at the door? A. Yes; he had as good an opportunity of seeing me as I him; if there had been any one up in the house they might have seen the coachman sitting on his box, if they had looked; he did not get off his box or go into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you dressed as a watchman? A. No; I had not my coat on.</p>

            . I am a constable. I found the owner of this coach; I found it returning, and the prisoner drove it; I took him into custody about half-past eight o'clock that morning; I asked about his being hired - he said he was, in the usual way; he told me he had certainly carried those goods away in his coach to a place in the Edgware-road, just on this side the Red Lion public house, where it was met by two persons, who took out the goods with the assistance of the man who was inside; I asked if he had any idea where they were conveyed - he said No, but he supposed they might be conveyed to some of the wharfs of the Paddington Canal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On your asking him "Do you recollect doing so and so," the man candidly answered Yes? A. Yes; and told me the spot he took them from in Hosier-lane, and where he took them to without the least prevarication; he told me he had been hired by some man to do it; I went to his lodgings, but I found nothing there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you went to watch his coming home, did you tell him what was suspected? A. Yes; I told him that in presence of his master - when I told him of the robbery he never denied it; I mentioned Hosier-lane first.</p>

             re-examined. Q. You have never got any of your property back? A. No; they broke into an empty house adjoining mine, and broke through the wall up stairs into my house - they took the key out of the door, which was double locked, and I ordered the watchman to break in.</p>
               <p>Q. From the outer appearance of the house could the watchman have had any idea of its being broken open? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I go out about six or seven o'clock in the evening, and return about eight or nine in the morning; I was engaged that morning between four and five o'clock by a gentleman, to drive down Holborn-hill - he then asked what would be the fare to take him and three hampers to Paddington Canal from Hosier-lane - I said 3s. - he made some objection, but agreed to give it me - he turned down Hosier-lane, then turned back, and said he should not want me just yet, but if I would turn back to Snow-hill, and get something to drink, he would come to me - there was no house open, but he came to me in about ten minutes, and I went to Hosier-lane - he knocked at Mr. Clark's door, and two men brought out the hampers and put them in - he told me to drive on; I saw no man running before me to beckon me; I drove on to Gray's Inn-lane, down Cromer-street, and on to Paddington Canal, and by the Red Lion two men met me and took the hampers out.</p>

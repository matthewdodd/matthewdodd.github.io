               <p>I lost my watch on Whit-Monday, at near ten o'clock at night. I was with my wife in <placeName id="t17800628-19-crimeloc106">Whitegate-alley, Bishopsgate parish</placeName>

               <p>Did he meet you or follow you? - He met me. With the blow he gave me I reeled. He ran and I ran after him, and cried stop thief! I took him in Half-moon-ally. When I took hold of him, he said to me, he had not got it; I made answer, I know you have not got it because you have dropped it.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him drop it? - It was a moon-light night. When he was under the gateway I had not an opportunity to see him drop it, but I heard it drop; that was just before I took him. The little boy who is here took up the watch. I carried the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner ever out of your sight from the time he took the watch till you secured him? - No, he was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>In what manner did he take the watch out of your pocket? - He struck me with his right hand, and forced the watch out of my pocket with his left-hand. The waist-band of my breeches being rather tight, he was obliged to give it a tug to get it out.</p>
               <p>Could you have prevented his taking the watch out of your pocket? - Perhaps I might.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can you swear I am the person that took the watch? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You saw him shoved off the pavement, was it by a blow or a push? - By a kind of a blow; when the prisoner got to the top of the alley he cried stop thief as well as I.</p>
               <p>Who overtook him first? - Mr. Cradden; we desired the crowd not to come about him, as we thought he had the watch about him; the watch was picked up by a boy.</p>

               <p>How far from the prisoner did you pick up the watch? - Not above a quarter of a yard, it lay close to his leg.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court by the constable, who received it from Bestman in the watch-house, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Bestman. In the crowd the boy said here is the watch. Mr. Cradden bid me take it and take care of it, which I did; this is the watch.</p>

Mr. Ward, to be rebound; I took particular notice of the Plato, but did not look further into the books till Saturday morning, when I took up the Testament, and seeing it was the gift of Dr. Busby, I recollected it belonged to the library when I took the catalogue; I examined the others, and found they all belonged to the library, upon which I went to the Rev. Mr. Ward, and acquainted him with my suspicions; we went to Mr. Mansell's, and saw a book with a private mark, which was Gale's Survey of the West Indies, and several fragments of Greek, Latin, Arabic, and other valuable books; the books are here, (the books produced and identified); I know the prisoner, his wife cleans the school out, and he assists at times, by which means he had access to this room.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You buy a great deal of waste paper? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you went to sleep, did you see the woman in the house? - A. Yes, she was sitting in the same box; I had my jacket buttoned about me, and I got it open; I put my hand in my pocket, I did not get a farthing out of my twenty-two shillings, it was in my jacket pocket in a little purse; there were two half-crowns, two sixpences, and, I think, I had between fourteen and fifteen shillings, and three or four buttons belonging to my regiment; when I woke, I reported to the publican that I was robbed; then the publican told her she must have robbed me; she said, it was not she that robbed me; I told him I had one remarkable shilling, there was something like the figure of a lion, or a dog, I do not know which, and on the other side of it a figure of five or an S, I could not make out which; the publican sent for a constable, and the constable took seventeen shillings and sixpence of the money out of her pocket, and kept it, and the buttons; I have not had any thing to subsist upon from that time, but the publican has subsisted me ever since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Searl, of Stangate-street, Lambeth. The members of the Oxford University Aquatic Club have a room on our premises—it is my duty to superintend the room which the gentlemen use to dress in, when they go out in the boats—they keep their clothing and things in lockers all round the room—on Monday, the 4th of April, at half-past nine o'clock, I locked the place up all safe—I returned on Tuesday morning about ten minutes to six, and found the gate open, also a small counting-house, where other gentlemen dress, and saw some of the clothes lying about, some of which belonged to the Club, and had been brought down to that room—I went up to the Oxford room, and found the door wide open—it had been opened with the key which I always leave there, in case the gentlemen should come while I am away—it is twelve o'clock sometimes before they come home—on the morning of the 4th I missed several articles belonging to the gentlemen—I saw some things afterwards produced by the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Austin, of Whiting-street, Lambeth. I know the prisoner Warren—she came to lodge with me on the 3rd of March, and left on the 5th of April—on the morning of the 5th of April, between ten and eleven o'clock, I went into her room to insist on her leaving it, as she was so noisy, and had so many fol<lb></lb>lowers, and I said I would not leave the room till she was gone—she left the room, and wished me to wait a few minutes till she returned—the prisoner Logden was in the room at the time—she did not lodge with her to my knowledge—Warren left the room to return in ten minutes, as she said, if I would wait, and Logden was to wait till she returned—she did not say what she was to return for, but said she would come back in ten minutes—finding she did not come back, I suspected something! and turned down the bed to see if the bed clothes were all right, and found in the bed twelve gentlemen's coats or jackets, one pair of trowsers, and eleven gentlemen's rowing shirts, tied up in a bundle—Logden was there—there was also a blue silk handkerchief, and a gentleman's cap, and in the drawer I found two drinking horns—there was a pair, of mittens also</p>

               <p>—I called up one of my lodgers, Maria Parker, and in consequence of what passed between us, I sent her for a policeman, who came, and I delivered the articles to him—Logden wished me to take some of the things in the room as security for the rent, and let Warren stop till Thursday, till her week was up—I said no, I should take ill the things—the bedstead folds up, and the things were turned up in the bed—I brought them into my own room, and sent for a policeman—Warren did not return—I saw no more of her till she was at Union-hall—Logden did not lodge with me—I do not know how long she had been in the room—nobody could see the things without turning the bed down—she might not know they were there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Austin's house. On the 5th of April, between three and four o'clock in the morning, before daybreak, I heard a knocking at the street-door—I knew Warren had got a key—Logden was stopping with her, I know, because I have seen her there—she was at home that night, because I heard her there—I did not see her—I could be positive it was her—I heard somebody in the room, and I bad' seen her on the stairs with Warren frequently—I cannot say she ever slept there—I saw her come down stairs next morning after ten, and spoke to her—after I heard the knocking at the door, I heard somebody get over the wall of the yard, and then heard somebody open the street-door within, and let somebody in—I could hear the footsteps of more than one person come in—I heard them go up stairs—I lodge in the parlour—Warren had the front room, over the parlour—I heard them walking about over my head—shortly after ten in the morning I saw the two male prisoners there—they came down stairs by themselves, and went out—I had never seen them before—the females were not with them—the shortest prisoner said, "Good morning"—I said, "Good morning"—they each bad a bundle, or ft coat, or jacket over their arm—my landlady called me up stairs about twenty minutes after that—I went up, and Logden was there—Mrs. Austin went to turn down the bed to see if the bed-clothes were right, and found these things there—I saw them found—next day we found a bag contain<lb></lb>ing some skeleton-keys, in a drawer, which the constable has—there was all sorts of keys.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I took Bromell into custody, on the 5th of April, in the Waterloo-road—I told him I wanted him for a rob<lb></lb>bery at Mr. Lankester's—I searched him, and found this cap on his head—I produce a bunch of skeleton keys, which I received from sergeant Jones at the station—he is not here.</p>

I know this to be my cap, and this jacket is mine, and a comb in the pocket—I lost a comb exactly like it—I had left it in my locker—I went to Searle's room on the Wednesday, and saw a great many of the lockers broken open—the lids were torn up—I did not notice them particularly—I think there were marks of some instrument used to prize them open.</p>

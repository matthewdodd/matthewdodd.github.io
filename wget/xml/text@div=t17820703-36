               <p>MORGAN THOMAS sworn.</p>
               <p>On the night of the first of June, between Surry-street and Norfolk-street, at about one o'clock, or rather after, in the morning, as I was walking home, the prisoner laid hold of my arm, and asked me to go with her; I told her not, and desired her to go away. Then she asked me to lend her a shilling; I told her I had none: I was walking all this time. She laid hold of my arm, and, as I thought, put her hand upon my breeches pocket, and presently ran away; I was not sensible, at the time, that she had taken any thing from me, but, from her running away, I was satisfied she must have taken something. I felt her hand upon my pocket, but was not sensible of its being in my pocket; I had a notion she must have taken my watch, by her running away. I pursued her two or three hundred yards, and overtook her, with my purse in her hand. She opened her hand, and said, there it is, and delivered it to me. Then I took her to the watch-house.</p>

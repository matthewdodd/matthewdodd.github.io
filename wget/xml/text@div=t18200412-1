On the 24th of March, about half-past eight o'clock at night, my wife and I were sitting in the back kitchen, with my little girl - it was quite dark. I thought I heard somebody in the parlour, which was let to Mrs. Williams, who had been out ever since twelve o'clock in the day. I know the window of her room was shut down an hour before. My wife sent the girl up the area steps, she returned, and in consequence of what she said I went up the area steps; the prisoner jumped out of the window and fell into the area - I saw nobody else jump out. I secured him, and asked what business he had there? he said he was not in the parlour, but that a man had shoved him down the steps. I took him to Mount-street watch-house. I saw a bedgown found in his hat, which belonged to Mrs. Williams; she is my sister. He said he lived with his sister in St. Giles's, that his father had forsaken him, and when he came before the Magistrate he said he lived in Cato-street.</p>

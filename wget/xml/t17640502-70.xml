            : they asked the price of a wax-bead necklace: I turned myself round to beckon Mrs. Cowell, and in the mean time, I suppose, the cluster diamond ring was taken. I missed it in about an hour and a half after they were gone, from out of a show-glass, in the window. When the bill was going to be found, Mrs. O-Neal told me, she believed she could help me to the middle stone, if I would not say any thing about it: that was last Wednesday.

             The prisoner at the bar and I went to Mr. Cowell's shop on a Saturday: I believe it is going on two years ago: it was in the year 1762. she went in, and I followed her. Mr. Cowell sent for his wife: I stood looking at Mr. Cowell, and did not see the prisoner take the ring: at night, she gave me a ring, and desired me to sell it for her. I asked her, what I should get for it? she bid me get as much as I could. I sent for a man on the Sunday night, that I thought would buy it, are showed it him: he asked me if it was a diamond ring? I told him she told me it was: he said, if I would trust him with the ring, he would go and shew it to a judge. I said, I could not do that: she took the ring of me, on the Monday night; and on the Tuesday, she sent it to me, by one of the women mentioned in the indictment, desiring me to sell it for her. I sent for the man, and he gave me nine guineas for it; I went up to the prisoner's house, and laid it on the table, and I believe Mrs. M'Cabe, and the other woman, took the money up to themselves; and the day after the installation at Windsor, the man came to my house, and said he had sold it to a Jew, and the middle stone was a false one. I sent one of my children to know if it was good; and word was brought, the stone in the middle was a false stone; but the stones round it, were brilliants. I went to Mrs. M'Cabe, and desired the money again; three guineas were allowed for the middle stone being bad, and he gave six guineas for the ring; that is, I allowed that, without having any recompence for it, as I had delivered the money to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any rings in Mr. Cowell's shop?</p>
               <p>O-Neal. No. I did not; I was looking at Mr. Cowell, at work.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was the stone in the middle a true one?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was; it was a diamond.</p>
               <p>Q. to O Neal. Was you taken up?</p>
               <p>O-Neal. No, I was not.</p>

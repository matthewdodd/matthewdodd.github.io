            . The prisoner at the bar pick'd me up, as the rest of the girls of the town do men sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she pick you up?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. In Church-Lane, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. On the 12th of this instant. In the evening she asked me to go with her home; I said I would not go with her to any bawdy-house; she said she had got a lodging of her own. I agreed to go along with her there; when I came there, she took me into a room on a ground floor; and by and by a woman came and demanded a shilling for the room; I gave it her; the prisoner asked me for another shilling, which I gave her. Then I stripped and went to bed to her, but I did not lie long before I left her. From thence I went to the sign of the two brewers in St. Giles's; there I met with another girl, who wanted me to go along with her; I told her I would not go to a bawdy-house; she said she had a lodging of her own. I went with her after I had had a pot or two of purl. She took me to the same house; then I said I had been there before, and had paid for the room, and I would lie there with the prisoner; she was still in bed where I left her; I went to bed to her, but I looked at my money first; there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280023"></xptr> a thirty-six shilling piece, a half guinea, and some silver. She persuaded me to go to sleep with her, which I did, she lent me her handkerchief to tie about my head, here it is, (producing one ) I was very sleepy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. I was not very sober; when I awak'd she had deserted me, and taken my money out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see you tell it?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. When I went to the window to tell it, she said d - n the money; you are afraid to lie with me, for fear I should take your money; but you are as safe here as if you lay in any house in town. She left her stockings, her bonnet, and her under-petticoat behind her. I got up and went about to the alehouses to look for her, and in about four days I found her, but with no money, only she had cloathed herself with new stockings, shoes, petticoats, and other things.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know but somebody else might take your money?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. I had taken the key, and put it on the inside of the door, and locked the door; and I am sure there were none but she and I in the room, when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say for herself ?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. When the constable examined her, she said I gave her some of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say you gave her?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. A guinea and a shilling; but I had never a guinea; there was found in her pocket a little steel corkscrew, which was my property, but she made away with that in the round-house; there was only a few half pence, and a farthing found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Are you certain that I am the woman?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sensible as to what you did?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. I was sensible as I am now; I saw her twice that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you in liquor the first time you was with her?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you drank between the two times of seeing her?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. I had drank a pot of purl.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other girl that you went to that house with, the second time?</p>
               <p>Bagshaw. She went away, and left me with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>

            . The man came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Stubbs. I deal in rabbit-skins; he came to my house, and said he had a woman at my house, that he had known two years.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this ?</p>
               <p>Stubbs. This was the next morning; he said he had been robbed; I said I did not know her by his description. After that justice Welch sent for me, and desired me to do what I could to get the woman; and in four days after, I saw the prisoner drunk in a cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know the prisoner was the woman?</p>
               <p>Stubbs. By a pawnbroker, saying, she had taken out some things, that she had pawned that morning, and had changed half a guinea; so I took her up on the description the prosecutor gave me, and that of the pawnbroker. I delivered her into the care of the constable, he examined her, she had but a penny about her.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Barnard. I heard the prisoner say, if she had got a little of his money, she had kept him company long enough for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them together ?</p>
               <p>Barnard. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Barnard. I keep a publick house in Monmouth-street; I know nothing of the prisoner; I have seen her before, and that is all I can say.</p>

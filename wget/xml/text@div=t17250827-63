My Business with her was to demand a Debt that was due to me. She told me, that she was then unprovided to answer my Demand; but that however, she had something to propose to me that might be very much to my Advantage. - Sir, (continued she) are you disposed for Matrimony? Do you want a good Wife with a great Fortune? If you do, I can introduce you to a very agreeable young Lady that is lately come from Barbadoes. She has a vast Plantation there, with a Hundred Negroes upon it: Her Estate is worth 1000 or 1100 l. a Year. She likes England so well, that she's resolved to live here and marry, if she can meet with a Gentleman of a suitable Fortune. Why, really Madam, (says I) provided Things are as you represent them, - I can't say that I have any Aversion to Marriage; - I would willingly have an Heir. - But - a - Madam, - are you sure that this Lady is indeed worth so much as you speak of? Am I sure, Sir? (says Mrs. Gregory again) - Yes. I am sure; I had it from Mr. Smith himself, and he manages all her Affairs. - You know Mr. Smith, he lives at my Cousin Tryon's; - He's worth 300 l. a Year; he lives in very good Credit; and you can't think that such a Man as he would impose upon any body. This Discourse was only betwixt me and Mrs. Gregory. It ran very much in my Mind all that Night; and next day I came to Mrs. Eccleton's again, and then I found there not only Mrs. Gregory, but her Daughter Miss Gregory, (the other Defendant) and the aforesaid John Smith. Our chief Talk was upon the same Subject as before; and Mr. Smith assured me, that what Mrs. Gregory had told me of this Lady's Fortune, was all true. I was very desirous of coming into this pretended Lady's Company, and beg'd them to let me know when and where I should enjoy that Favour. They promis'd to make Enquiry, and send me Word. We parted, and the next day, being Sunday, a Letter was brought me, (as I suppose from Miss Gregory) appointing me to come that evening to Mrs. Eales's in Ely-Court in Holborn, where I might see this Berbadias Lady. I want accordingly. and found her drinking Tea with the two Defendants. She was dress'd in a rich Brocade, with a Gold Watch and Diamond Pendants. The Conversation turn'd up on this Lady's Plantation Miss Gregory then said, (as her Mother had said before) that Mrs. Cole was worth at least 1000 l. a Year, and had 100 Negroes. I then mention'd the Name of an Attorney of my Acquaintance, and ask'd the Counterfeit Lady if she knew him? No, Sir, says she, I can't say that I have any Personal Knowledge of the Gentleman, but I have heard of his Name. Then pray, Madam, (says I) how long may you have had this Plantation? About three Years, Sir, said she, And, Dear Madam, if I may be so bold, how - a - might you at first come into the Possession of this Plantation? - Why, Sir, (say she) it was left me by my own Brother. Of all my Relations, I have only one Sister living: She's about 9 Years old; - but such a poor sickly thing - My Uncle left her 1500 l. which will be mine if I survive her. With such like Discourse we pass'd away the Time, till the Company broke up. Next Morning, I went to Miss Gregory, to enquire how the Lady liked me. O! Mr. Cockerell, (says she) you are certainly the most fortunate Man living. - I believe, o'my Conscience, you have bewitched the Lady. - She's so Charm'd! So Captivated! - She no sooner saw you, than she felt your Power. There was something in you so engaging! so irresistible! that you immediately gain'd a perfect Conquest. - Her Heart! her Soul! her Fortune! all is yours! - Look ye, Miss Gregory as to the Lady's Heart, I am under no Apprehensions of being deceived; but me. thinks the Report of her Fortune wants a little Confirmation. Well, says she, you are the strangest Man! so incredulous! - I thought Mr. Smith had satisfy'd you: But if he that has the Management of all her Affairs cannot, I don't know how I should. Well! I went to Mr. Smith to talk with him seriously about it. Sir, says I, let me beg you to be ingenuous, - Has Mrs. Cole really got so good a Fortune as is reported? Why, I'll tell you, Sir, says he, since you press me so closely; she has not quite so much: Fame is apt to be a little extravagant; Eighty Negroes is the outside, and her Annual Income is no more than between 7 and 800 l. Upon this Fall of at least 200 l. a Year, and 20 Negroes, I returns to Miss Gregory, and tells her of it. Laud! says she, don't you perceive the Trick? 'Tis all an Artifice of Mr. Smith: He designs to try for the Lady himself. She told me but this day, that he had really made some Tenders of Service to her; and 'us no wonder then if he endeavours to lessen your Opinion of her. I know indeed that at present she prefers you to him, tho' you are in the Sixty sixth Year of your Age; but yet if she finds you neglect her, Mr. Smith may chance to supplant you. Therefore, if you design to pursue the Amour, be quick! dispatch! the sooner the better. Then I desired Miss Gregory to ask this Lady if she was willing to be marry'd next day; and she brought me Word, Yes: And Preparation was made accordingly. As we were going in the Coach, I said to the Sham Lady, Madam, - don't deceive me; - Have you really such a Plantation? She told me she had. In short, we were marry'd, went to Bed together at Night, and - a - I need say nothing about throwing the Stocking. The next day, after Dinner, I went out, and at my Return I found my Barbadian in Company with another Woman. I think, Sir, (says this pretended Lady of mine) that it's now high time to undeciive you: - I don't question but that you think you have marry'd a rich Lady of Barbadoes; when, indeed, you are quite mistaken. Mistaken! (says I in a great Surprize) Why, pray Madam, what are ye? I am now your Wife, says she; but before you made me so I was Mrs. Eccleton's Maid; and this is my Mother, a good honest Woman, tho' she keeps a Chandler's Shop. Mercy on me! says I, what have I done? Done? says she, Why you have marry'd Abigail Cole. Away went I to Mrs. Gregory: I wonder, Madam, says I, how you could be guilty of so vile an Action, as thus to impose upon a Man that has always been your Friend? What could induce you to so much Wickedness? Lord, Mr. Cockerell, says she, what do you mean? I believe you have got a very suitable Wife: she had no great Fortune indeed; but she may save you one by her good Management: You had Money enough before; you only wanted an Heir to enjoy it, and in due time she may bring you one. Thus far the Plaintiff.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Eccleton thus deposed, Mr.Cockerell has sworn that he came to my Mother on Account of a Debt; I dont know that my Mother owes him a Shilling; but I am sure that he came very Often upon another Account. I believe I may<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172508270007"></xptr> safely swear, that he had teiz'd my Mother 500 times to help him to a Wife: I myself have recommended him to at least 20 Women, all whom he left when he found their fortunes fell short of his Expectation. He was so continually importuning us to introduce him to Ladies, that at last we contrived to get rid of him, by dressing up my Maid in a young Lady's Apparel, and recommending her to him for a Barbadoes fortune, and the Plot succeeded beyond Expectation. I believe she's as modest a Woman as ever lived: Nor is she any thing below him, on account of her Father's being a Soldier, for his Father served in the same Quality under

Well, says he, 'twas my own Fault, I was a rash Old Fool; I can blame nobody but myself. But I should have bit her, if she had been so Rich as I expected; for I have made over all my Estate to my Brother's Son, except 130 l. a Year, a Third of which is all that she can come in for, I can't tell whether he did this before Marriage or since; but he desired both me and my Sister (the Defendant) to persuade his Wife to consent to a Divorce, upon Condition of his allowing her a handsome Reward. I told him I thought no Woman would be so much a Fool, as to swear herself to be a Whore, and so to lose her Husband for a little Money. Sh o, says he, there is no occasion for all that. I can manage it a much better way, if you can but get her to comply; I'll provide a Pre-Contracts betwixt me and another Lady, and get Witnesses to swear it.</p>

She desired a little time to dress herself; but he took her by the Shoulders, and would have thrown her down Stairs, if he had not been prevented. - heard him say, that the Reason why he was in such a Hurry to be married, without making any farther enquiry about the Woman's Estate, was, for fear she should Enquire after his Estate and his Character.</p>

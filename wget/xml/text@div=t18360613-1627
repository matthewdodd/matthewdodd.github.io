                  </hi>. I live in James's-street, Westminster-road. The prisoner came into our service to nurse my wife on the 4th of May, and remained until the 16th, when, in consequence of suspicion, I sent for a policeman who searched her box in my presence—it was a kind of bend-box—she handed it to him to search—he found in it a napkin, a china saucer, two packages of tobacco, and stone-blue, which were articles I sold in my shop—I afterwards went to Eaton-street, Lambeth, and found a shift belonging to my wife, and a towel—I know the towel to he mine—the prisoner said at the station-house, that she lodged at No.18, Eaton-street, and that was where we found things—her husband searched the drawer there, and produced them.</p>

I was sent for on the 16th of May, and the prosecutor charged the prisoner with stealing, a shift—I asked her if she had a box—she said, had a bit of a cap-box up-stairs—I looked her up—Mr. Shaw drew her box from under the bed, and in it I found the saucer, napkin, packages of tobacco, and stone-blue—she gave her address, "No. 18, Eaton-street, New-cut"—we went there—the land<lb></lb>lady said the prisoner husband was out—she sent for him—he came, and</p>

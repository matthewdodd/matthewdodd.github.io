On the morning of the 29th of December, he came in, and asked to see the horse. I permitted him to see the horse. The horse was in a stable at the back of the house, and when the prisoner returned I was in the back parlour with my master's son, and on the prisoner's passing through the shop I observed him put something into a bag. A woman came into the shop; the prisoner then came to me; he said, a woman is in the shop; I think you had better serve her; and while I served the woman, he quitted that part of the shop where he had taken the lasts, and got to the further end of the shop, and after I had served the woman I told the prisoner I did not like his transactions; I was entrusted in Mr. Gotch's shop as a confidential servant, and that he had put some of my master's property into his bag. He said, he had not. I ordered him to empty his bag. At first he hesitated, and afterwards he turned out of his bag these two pieces of leather and five wooden lasts. Three lasts out of the five were thrown among the new lasts. These two I can speak to. And after he turned them out of his bag he denied they had been in the bag. He had these two pieces of leather, five lasts, and a pigs head, and two small-clothes in the bag. The lasts and the pieces of leather came out first.</p>

               <p>Q. You say he denied that - A. Yes, but I saw him turn it out.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you say they are your master's property - A. Only by his taking them from the new lasts by the side of my master's cutting-board, and my master has a great deal of leather like this.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say anything when they were turned out - A. I did not. When he had turned them out of his bag, he said he had not any thing in his bag.</p>

             came out; he said, do not mind that fool, he has lost three or four games at cards, and now he is mad with every one. I took out the hog'd head; I said, is that your master's. The pig's head fell on the lasts and leather, I do not deny, as to say they were in the bag, it is false.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came into the shop, and said he wanted a piece of bacon. He took a piece up, and ran away as fast as he could. It lay on a butter-flat, near the door.

               <p>How did you know the man that was brought back was the man that took the bacon? - I saw his back and his hat: I did not see his face till he was brought back to the shop-door.</p>
               <p>A watchman sworn. I stopped him, running by the Saracen's-head inn. He said, D - n your eyes, do you think I am a thief? The people came up, and said, that was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178109120058"></xptr> man; he had stole some bacon. I desired to look at his hands; he rubbed them on his breeches first, and said, There are my hands: are they greasy? I smelt them; they smelt of the bacon, as plain as could be.</p>

On the 24th of October, I saw two fellows about—I told my father, and he came from behind the counter, and watched them from over a shawl—he sent me for some beer, and as I came back, I saw the prisoner with a roll of flannel—he ran towards St. Mary's Church—I am sure he is the man—he was taken in about three hours.</p>

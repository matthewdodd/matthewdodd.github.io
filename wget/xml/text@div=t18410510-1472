                  </hi>. I am a writing clerk, and live at No 9, Barnsbury-row, Islington. The prisoners lived in a furnished room of mine—the female took the room—I traced some of the stolen property to the pawnbroker's—I then applied at the station, and charged them with robbing me—I missed the articles stated from their room—they lived as husband and wife—I have no reason to believe they are not—their conduct in that respect was, I believe, perfectly correct.</p>

Distress alone forced me to pledge those articles; and as I was in daily expectation of receiving 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had written to a friend for, I bad no other intention than to redeem them. I might also urge my wife's illness, but, however, must throw myself entirely on the mercy of the Court. The only explana<lb></lb>tion that it appears necessary to trouble the Court with, regards the dates on which the articles were <hi rend="italic">actually</hi> pledged, and those on which they <hi rend="italic">appear</hi> by the tickets to have been pledged, which are wholly at variance; for instance, the spoons and a table-cloth were pawned about five weeks ago, and the table-cloth taken out three weeks after, when a fresh ticket was issued for the spoons, by which means it would appear by the tickets that the spoons and sheets were pledged on the same day, whereas they were pawned at intervals of a week and fortnight. The same remark holds good as to several other articles. I have been induced to enter into this explanation from a remark made by the Magistrate's clerk to the effect that the sums received on certain days were more than my absolute wants required, and therefore distress could not have driven me to the commission of the offence."</p>

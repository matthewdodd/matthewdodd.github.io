On Sunday, the 5th of July, I got up and went to the corner of Brick-lane at half-past five, leaving my wife at home; I returned at a quarter before ten - my wife was not at home - she had passed my stand and given me the key; I found the door was on single latch, and on entering I saw a caddy on the floor - it usually stood on the table; and on the left-hand side of the room two cages had been taken down, the birds were gone, and the doors open; I looked over head, and missed sixteen birds out of seven cages - all the cages being in their proper places when I went out; I went up stairs and saw my box open and my wearing apparel gone, which was safe on the Saturday night; I had left it shut but not locked - the three sovereigns were wrapped up in a grocer's bill in my trousers pocket; the bed-clothes were all rolled up together in a bundle in the room - all the other doors were secure; I have known the prisoner as a customer for two years, he always paid me very justly for what he had; on Tuesday the 5th, about seven o'clock, he came to my stand, walked round me, and said, "Where is your old woman?" I said, "If you want water-cresses here are plenty for you;" he said, "Give me my cresses and let me go;" he bought some; I have seen him pass my house several times on Sundays, and have noticed him looking over my curtain - I thought he was looking at the birds.</p>

On Sunday, the 5th of July, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I saw Mrs. Nicholls go out, and about five minutes after I saw two men come to the door together, one of them knocked, and the other walked a little distance from the door - I called out that I did not think there was any body at home - the one at the door said, "Joe, there is no one at home;" they went away; I was looking towards the house in about a quarter of an hour and saw two men come out of the front door and shut it after them - one of them had a black bag and the other a blue handkerchief - I knew both of them by sight; the prisoner is the man who had the black bag - it appeared half full; I have seen him about there before, but did not know his name - he was not one of the men who knocked at the door before; they went away together.</p>

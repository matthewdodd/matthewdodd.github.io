               <p>CHARLES RUBY. I am a coal-porter, and lodge in this house. I went out with Mrs. Brown, about half-past seven o'clock, and believe she shut the door; we returned in about half an hour; I was close behind her; she went in first; the prisoner rushed out, gave her a shove in the breast, and another rushed out at the same time; I pursued the prisoner close, and caught him without losing sight of him, near the end of Redcross-street; when he came back he said, "Let me go;" I said I should take him to the watch-house; the patrol came, and took him; there were good gas-lights in the street, all the way; I passed some clothes, which were dropped in the way; I ran, and called out, "Pick them up;" as I still followed him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say, at the office, that a sailor stopped me? A. No; he is the man, who ran out of the house; whom I followed and took.</p>

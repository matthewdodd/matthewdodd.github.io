            . I am a constable of St. Bride's. The prisoner was brought into the watch-house by two patroles; Mr. Lackey accompanied them. He charged him with having taken from his person, fifty-four guineas and a canvas bag. He was in a good deal of confusion by the rough usage he had received. This was about 12 o'clock at night. We searched the prisoner; he had nothing about him but a few shillings. The prisoner denied the charge very strongly.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. Bride's. On the 18th of August, me and my brother patrol were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181210280062"></xptr> stationed at the corner of Fleet-market, to see if we could take improper persons. We heard the cry of, a robber, stop him. We went up to the place where the sound appeared to come from. We saw Mr. Lackey having hold of the prisoner by the collar. I said to him, what is the matter. He said, this man has robbed me of a deal of money. Me and my brother patrol caught hold of him directly. The prosecutor was an elderly man; he did not like to let him go. I showed him my cutlass; he then let him go. We had a great deal of trouble in taking him to the watch-house. There were a vast many thieves about at that time. The mob hustled me and my brother patrol a good deal, and the prisoner himself, fought with us, and tried to get from us. I went out of the watch-house and brought the prosecutor in; he had lost his hat. As we were going along Cheapside, to the Compter, the mob swore they would have a rescue; they cried out, a rescue. We drew our cutlasses, and said, the first that offered to come nigh us, we would cut them down, and I had like to have the prisoner rescued, as he was coming from Guildhall, after he was committed. I and the constable were desired to take him to prison. Me and Crostick, soon after, went to take him to the Compter. After we had left Guildhall door, I got fast hold of him on one side, and the constable on the other, he slipped his arm from the constable, and said, d - n my eyes, if I go any further with you, if you do not let me go. He pulled me into a public house, the gang hustled me into the parlour, his father was there. I said, Mr. Edwards, if you use me ill, you shall suffer for it. A man said, it is my son, he shall not go any further, if you hold him so. The father sent for a coach, and then he went quietly with me to the Compter.</p>

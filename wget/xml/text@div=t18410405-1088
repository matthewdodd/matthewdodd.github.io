                  </hi>. I am a City policeman. I live at No. 4, Rolls Build<lb></lb>ings, within the Liberty of the Rolls—the prisoner lived on the same floor with his wife. On the 26th of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, I was in bed, and was awoke by hearing cries of murder, and the screams of children proceeding from the prisoner's room—it was his wife's voice—I had often heard it before—I jumped out of bed, dressed myself hastily, and proceeded to their room—I had scarcely opened my own room door, when I saw the wife running as if making her escape from the prisoner's room, with a child in her arms—I went inside the door of his room, and told him to consider himself in custody—I had on my trow<lb></lb>sere and boots at that time, and my arms through my coat, which I was buttoning up—the prisoner was standing in the centre of the room—he said, "Leave the room, sir, you are not on duly"—I told him I was al<lb></lb>ways on duty, and pointed to my uniform—he then ran to the fire-place, while he was going there I called to the parties outside the door to run down and fetch assistance—I had scarcely said the words when the pri<lb></lb>soner ran at me with the poker, striking at me with it—he did not strike me then—I closed with him for the purpose of taking the poker from him, upon which he got one arm round my waist, and struck me on the back of the head four or five times with the poker now produced—it is bent now, but it appeared perfectly straight when he had it in his hand first—I still kept hold of him, and brought him outside the door on the landing—I was there assisted by Mr. Grogan—he then said he would go easily with me—I requested Grogan to come to the station with me to ex<lb></lb>plain his conduct—Grogan went up to put on his coat and shoes—he had no sooner turned his back than the prisoner commenced beating me about the head with his fist—(he had thrown away the poker in the room)—after striking me several times he flung himself down the first flight of stairs and effected his escape—I followed him to Lee's-buildings—I lost sight of him there and returned—I had my head dressed at Mr. Winpenny's, a surgeon, in Fetter-lane—it was cut about two inches, in two or three places, besides a cut on my cheek—I cannot say how that was done—I went to St. Bar<lb></lb>tholomew's Hospital, and saw the house-surgeon, who has been attending me ever since—I am taking medicine now from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in this house. On the 26th of March, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I was disturbed by cries of murder and the screams of a woman and children proceeding from the prisoner's room—I went down stairs, and saw Byrne coming out of his room in the act of putting on his great-coat—I saw the prisoner's wife run out of her room, and run up stairs—Byrne then went inside the door and told the prisoner he must consider himself in custody—the pri<lb></lb>soner ordered him to leave the room, told him he had no right to he there, as he was not on duty, and asked him his authority—Byrne pointed to the number on his coat, held his staff in his hand, and told him that was his authority—he refused to leave the room—the prisoner took up the poker, and asked him again to leave the room, be had no right there—while I was in the act of putting on my things, to go for a policeman at Byrne's request, the prisoner struck at him with the poker—Byrne tried to parry the blow, which he partly succeeded in doing—after the blow was made, there was a simultaneous rush, they closed, and I saw the prisoner strike Byrne three or four times on the back of the head with the poker—I then went for as<lb></lb>sistance, and when I returned I saw Byrne bleeding profusely from the head—the prisoner had escaped.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Bartholomew's hospital. On the 26th of March, from half-past-nine to eleven o'clock, I saw Byrne at the hospital—I examined his head—there was a wound about two inches long on the back and left side of the bead, not extend<lb></lb>ing to the bone—there was a smaller wound very near it, one wound on the cheek, which bad been already dressed, and one slight wound I sub<lb></lb>sequently discovered very near the two other wounds at the back of the head—from the locality and appearance of those wounds they might be at<lb></lb>tended with danger—I have seen fatal consequences ensue from wounds in that situation, and not more severe than them—the skin was divided in two of those wounds—such wounds might be. inflicted by such an instru<lb></lb>ment as this poker—the man is still under my care—he has been cupped once.</p>

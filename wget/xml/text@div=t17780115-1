               <p>I came from Covent-garden Theatre on the 16th of December last in a hackney coach, at about 10 at night, to Henrietta-street; I had a box upon the seat before me, containing a silver hair pin set with diamonds, 14 hair pins set with soil stones, a white sattin jacket, and a gauze veil; it was a large box and filled the seat. I dropped one of my clogs as I was getting out of the coach, and desired my servant to look after it, but forgot to give him charge to take care of the box; I enquired after it the next morning, when my servant told me, that he had forgot to take it out of the coach, but that he knew the person of the driver and the number of the coach.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the person who drove the coach? - I believe so.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Barry. I put the box into the coach. I forgot to take it out of the coach when my mistress was set down. I am certain the prisoner is the coachman, the number was 101. I went to him the next morning: I asked him if he remembered carrying home Mrs. Barry the preceding night, and asked him about the box; he denied knowing any thing about it. I told him when he thrust his whole body into the coach to look for the clogg, he could not help seeing the box. Upon that he grew very angry. I told him he must know of it, and if he would deliver it that afternoon, I would give him half a guinea. I went afterwards by my mistress's order, and offered him 3 guineas; he said I must go to the lost and found office and get bills printed, and he bid me get the three guineas of my mistress; he went with me to the lost and found office to order bills to be printed; when we came out into Chancery-lane, he asked me if it would make any difference if he brought the things? I told him he might send a child with them, or send them to the lost and found office. I saw him again afterwards; he said then, he dared to say the things would come. I went again to him on the 18th of December. He asked me if the bills were out? I told him no. He asked again what reward my mistress would give? I said three guineas, and I would make it four. He said they must be advertised in the Daily Papers, and possibly they might be heard of. But they have never been heard of.</p>

               <p>After I set Mrs. Barry down, I took a fare, a man and a woman, to Basinghall-street; I observed when I set them down that they took a bundle or something out of the coach. The servant says he put the box into the coach. I had no charge of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

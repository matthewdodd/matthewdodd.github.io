            . When I heard of this Misfortune on the 7th Day of June, I carried the Child to Mr. Edmonds the Surgeon, to know whether he had done her any Damage. - I did not know of it till a Week after it was done. - I asked her before I went to Mr. Edmonds how it happened, and what she did there? She said nothing to me about it. - Mr. Edmonds and his Servant both examined the Child: Mr. Edmond's shook his Head, and said it is very proper the Fellow should be secured: - He said the Child had received Damage enough, for he had made a very great Attempt upon her. I carried her down again by his Order, on the Friday following, and he looked upon the Child again, and gave me a Box of Ointment, to anoint the Child in the Place where he said the Child was affected, that is all I can say of the Matter.</p>

I am Apprentice to Mr. Edmonds, and was present when the Child was brought, June the 7th, in the Morning, the Woman complained that the Child had been misused, and desired the Child might be examined; so my Master and I both examined the Child, and externally there were very great Bruises all over the Part; and internally, there was a large Excoriation, and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174207140006"></xptr> great Inflammation attending the Child, and 'twas evident there had been a great Attempt made upon her. - This Excoriation and Inflammation might be occasioned by an external Attempt upon the Body of the Child. - I made an Observation when the Child was brought again on Friday, that by the Application of the Medicines given her, the Child was better. <rs id="t17420714-17-verdict83" type="verdictDescription">

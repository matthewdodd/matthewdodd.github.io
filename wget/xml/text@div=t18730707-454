I am a journalist, and live at Malcolm Lodge, Hammersmith—the prisoner was in my service as general servant—on Wednesday, 11th June, I left her alone in charge of the house—when I returned in the evening she was not there—I found the door locked and the key was not there—I had the occasion to go to my desk when I left, to get some money for my travelling expenses, I took out a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, I left the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note on top of the papers, and locked the desk, locking the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in it—when I unlocked the desk, on Saturday, the bolt did not fall back and it opened very easily—the desk was in the back dining room, and when I took out the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note the prisoner was just outside the dining room door, and she saw</p>

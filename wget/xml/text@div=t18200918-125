            . I work on board a barge, and live at Hammersmith, with my parents. I have known the prisoners two or three years. One night about April I slept on board Gearey's barge - it was two or three days before I heard of this robbery, I was under the boats head - it is a decked boat, but has no tilt; between twelve and one o'clock in the morning, I knew their voices, I laid still, and did not speak; they could not see me. there was a box before me; it was starlight, and I could see them. They brought something large on board - Goodrick said</p>
               <p>"Don't make such a noise, or some one will hear you." And Samuels said</p>
               <p>"How much do you think this copper will fetch?" Burke said,</p>
               <p>"It will fetch 20 s. or 30 s. a piece." They put it in the stern of the boat, under the hatches; their boat laid at anchor a good distance from shore, they put it in the boat I was in. Next morning, about four o'clock, Ledgewood came and put me into Goodrick's boat, and I went to sleep, when I awoke the boat with the copper in it was gone. Goodrick came on board his boat, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180065"></xptr>thought I told you not to sleep in a boat last night. I have a great mind to lay a rope's end about your back." I had been at work for him that day, and had nowhere to sleep. About three o'clock the day before the robbery Thomas broke a window in the pavillion, and at the same time he picked up two pieces of marble, and said they would do to pave his hearth.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first tell about this robbery - A. The next day I told Ford, the bricklayer, that they must mind they did not get taken up. I told my father of it three or four weeks after, when I came from Brentford, where I had been at work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. Was you not put in the workhouse, charged with this robbery yourself - A. Yes; I did not hear of the reward till I came to Hammersmith. I worked for Goodricke, he discharged me the day before the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q, You said nothing about it till you was accused - A. Not till I was fetched.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who sent you to the workhouse - A. Mr. Hanson, the Magistrate. I was taken before him to tell what I knew, I was not charged with being the thief. I went to work at Brentford on the day of the robbery and remained there three or four weeks. I was afraid to mention it.</p>

I found a marble mantle-piece in the cupboard there. I also found a hearth and two other pieces of marble in the house, eight or nine days after the robbery. I had the key of the house.</p>

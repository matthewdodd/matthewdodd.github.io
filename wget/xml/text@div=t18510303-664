                  </hi>. I am cashier to Richard Charrington and another; the prisoner was in their service—it was his duty to go and get orders, receive money, and enter the money he received in his own cash-book, which was kept in the counting-house, on his return home, and pay the money to me—I have his cash-book—here is no entry of 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from the last witness on 30th Oct., nor of 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 11th Dec.—I have never received these sums from him—he has not accounted for them—I have looked through the book; I do not find them entered under any other date.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police inspector</hi>). In consequence of a communication I received, on Saturday morning, 16th Sept., I placed a con<lb></lb>stable at the door of the warehouse of Messrs. Keyte and Co., No. 4, Church-court, Old Jewry—I went with him, and tried the door of the warehouse—it was fast, and everything in its ordinary state—at a quarter to 6 o'clock that constable was relieved by Legg—I gave him instructions, and at about 20 minutes to 7 o'clock the two prisoners were brought to the station—I then went to the warehouse, at about a quarter to 7 o'clock, and found ten skeleton keys on the floor, one of which opens the outer door—I also found this small <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, a large clasp knife, two boxes of lucifers, three large black bags, a gimlet, a bottle containing some gin, and a quantity of paste and paper, used by thieves to put over a square of glass, to prevent any noise when the glass is broken—there was no glass so pasted over—the outer door was open when I went.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 440). I was sent by the inspector to relieve a constable who was watching No 4, Church-court—I got there about a quarter or 10 minutes to 6 o'clock—I tried the door; it was fast—I waited till half past 6 o'clock, when sergeant Whicher came up to visit, it being on his beat—he put his hand against the door, and it went open, and I saw Turton in the passage—(we were both in uniform)—the sergeant sprang in, and I after him—Turton turned to the left in the warehouse, and King ran past me from behind the door on the right—I am quite sure I saw King in the warehouse—I saw that the sergeant had got Turton, and I turned after King, who was pulling the door to—I caught the door within about a foot of its closing, reached into the court, and secured King about four or five yards from the door—he was going away as quickly as he could, and when I caught him he turned round and said, "I am not the man; I have just come</p>

               <p>up this street"—I had not said anything to him then—he resisted very much, and the sergeant, who had brought Turton to the door, ordered me to draw my truncheon, and <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> him down, if he did not keep quiet—I got him back to the door of the warehouse—he still resisted, and the sergeant drew his truncheon, and said he should use it if he did not keep quiet—he then became quiet—I drew my truncheon also, and took him to the station—we left two constables at the warehouse door, and the inspector went and searched the premises—there were no other persons near—I searched King, and found on him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., some tobacco, and part of a pipe.</p>

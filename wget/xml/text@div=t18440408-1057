                  </hi>. I am clerk to the Ratcliff Gaslight and Coke Company, and live in the upper part of the counting-house belonging to the company; the lower part is used as offices; there are two keys, one leading to the counting-house, which is under the same roof as the rest of the premises. On Friday, the 23rd of Feb. I locked up the secretary's office, and left on the table 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of copper money, tied in 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packages—I took the key up to my apartment—I returned to the office at six o'clock in the morning—the outer door had not been broken open—the prisoner was once in the com-pany's service, and about that time the key of the outer door was missing, and another obtained—I found the door of the secretary's office had a pane of glass knocked out, which would enable a person to unfasten the lock inside—I missed 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packages of copper—the secretary's desk was broken open, but nothing missing—my own desk was broken, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., taken from it—I found a desk in the inspector's room broken open, but nothing missing-two iron safes had been attempted—the outer door was not bolted, and could be opened with a key.</p>

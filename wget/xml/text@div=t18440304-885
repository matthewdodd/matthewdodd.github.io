About eight o'clock on the morning of the 17th of Feb., I was in Field-lane, and saw the prisoner come out of George-court, carrying something which appeared very heavy wrapped up in a jacket—I followed—he stopped, and I came up to him—he threw down the bundle, leaving it on the pavement—I followed, and took him—I asked what was in the bundle—he said sometiles, they were his own—he had bought them at Messrs. Poynder and Hobson's, Earl-street, Blackfriars, and was taking them home, to 12, Great Warner-street, and he was going to build an oven—I said, "You don't look much like a baker"—he said, "No, my wife is going to be a baker"—I went with him to 12, Great Warner-street, and found an oven was being built—I then went to Poynder and Hobson's, and saw the principal clerk—he said the prisoner had bought no tiles there—I then went to Mr. Eldred, the prisoner's master, and found he had missed tiles of this description.</p>

I am in the service of John Henry Eldred, a builder, in Hart-yard—the prisoner had been in his service—on the morning of the 10th of Feb., a little before eight o'clock the prisoner knocked at my master's door, gave me a bill, and asked me where my master was—he was not in the way—I asked if he wished to see him—he said no, he was going to his breakfast, he should be back directly—the men have a key to let themselves in and out.</p>

I live at 2, Edward Street, Barnsbury Road—on the 5th September, I was with the last witness and Franklin—I saw the prisoner and his brother come out of the public-house, just below—I did not know them before—there were some persons there selling whelks—we went up to get some—the prisoner and his brother came up—the potato-can was broken, I believe by his brother—the woman asked the prisoner to pay for it—he pushed her down—Franklin said, "If they were anything like gentlemen, they would pay for the can"—Franklin was then knocked down by the prisoner—a struggle took place—Franklin ran down Edward Street, and the prisoner after him—I ran after them both—when they got to the corner of the street, the prisoner fell—he got up, and by that time I was within a dozen yards of him—he came to me and said, "You are one of them;" or, "You are him;" I don't know which—he struck me a severe blow behind the left ear, with his fist—I was squaring up when I felt two sharp terriffic blows—one on the arm, and the other on the left breast—just over the heart—I did not know for a minute that I was stabbed, till my mother caught hold of my arm, and said it was bleeding—I looked down, and saw the blood coming from my arm—I then felt a pain on my breast—I had my coat off and my shirt sleeves tucked up—the knife went through my waistcoat—I did not see anything in the prisoner's hand, but I put up my left hand, and felt a hard substance in his hand, what it was I can't say—I went into a greengrocer's shop, and then to the doctor's—there were plenty of persons round at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to a solicitor, and have been for seventeen years—I am the prisoner's brother—he is waiting for a Government situation—he is in no employ at present—I was with him on the 5th Sep<lb></lb>tember, in the Barnsbury Road, near a whelk stall—there were some boys there—one of them dropped some money—they rushed to get the money, and I was pushed over the potato-can—Franklin then struck me, and ran across the street—I ran after him, Nelson and Cunningham following me, one of them tripped me up—my brother picked me up, and while he was doing so Cunningham struck his hat over his eyes—Nelson was then in his shirtsleeves—they threw my brother's hat into the air, and said, "Now we will have it"—</p>

               <p>they then knocked my brother down, and five or six fell on the top of him—Cunningham said, "Murder the b—"—a policeman came up—Nelson and Franklin then ran into a house—not a word was said about stabbing, then—someone gave my brother in charge—I did not know what the charge was against him—I had seen no knife in his possession that evening—I heard the potato man ask him for a knife, and he said he had not got one—he was given in charge where the scuffle took place—I am sure he had not got a knife when the row occurred.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there a large crowd there when the hat was knocked off? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was in the midst of the crowd—I was down, and when I got up my brother was knocked down.</p>

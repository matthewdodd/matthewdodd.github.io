               <p>I am an apprentice to Mr. Horseley, a brass founder. On Saturday the 16th of December, between six and seven o'clock, coming up <placeName id="t17810110-24-crimeloc138">Fish-street hill</placeName>

Two went on the left hand side; Hodges jumped up behind the cart and rode for the space of half a minute reaching over into the cart; he did not take any thing out; then he jumped down and went to his companions and I followed them till they came almost to Bishopsgate church; then Hodges jumped up again, almost in the same posture he was before, and took out a bundle. I asked a man to assist me to take them, but he would not have any thing to do with it. I then went over the way and told the boy who drove the cart that his cart was robbed; and the boy and I ran down Houndsditch after the prisoner, but could see nothing of him; I described the prisoner to one of Justice Wilmot's men, who said he knew him extremely well; and he was taken by Mr. Wilmot's man on the Sunday morning following.</p>
               <p>Had you opportunity enough that night to observe the person in the cart, so as to be sure it was the prisoner? - Yes. I observed him particularly; I saw him again on the Monday; I am very sure the prisoner is the person. I had seen him at the time of the rioting and knew him again directly.</p>

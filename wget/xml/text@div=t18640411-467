                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live at 8, Orchard-place, Plumstead—on 16th February last I resided at Burridge-road, Plumstead—I have been married to the female prisoner about four years and four months—we lived happily together till Christmas eve last—we had a few little quarrels, but nothing to signify—on Christmas eve my wife mentioned to me that she had a cousin coming to visit us, and asked if I had any objection—I said,</p>

               <p>"No; of course not, if it is your cousin"—the prisoner, John Ogden came on Christmas eve, and spent the evening with us—I accompanied him to the barracks about tattoo time, 9 o'clock, and he said to me on the way there, "Mr. Cox, you are blessed with a good wife"—I said, "I have no reason to complain"—on Christmas day he came again in the afternoon—my wife in<lb></lb>vited him—he came about 2 o'clock, and I went with him to the barrack yard, about 4—I had a birdcage at that time, which I missed some time after that—I don't know exactly the day—I asked my wife where it was gone, and she said she had lent it to a friend, I should get it again—I said she had no business to do so, as it was my property—Ogden came to my house almost every day for a week after that, then he stopped away a few days, and then came again—he said he had volunteered to go with a detachment to Jersey, and he gave me a book which he said he did not want to carry with him, and said, "I dare say I shall not see you again"—that was about eight or nine days after Christmas—on 5th February I went to my work as usual shortly after 5, when I returned at night I missed my wife, and also some of the goods—a chest of drawers, a sofa bedstead, a bed and bedding; some chairs, two tables, two pictures, a stuffed bird, a set of tea-things, and a quantity of crockery—they were not all my property—the sofa bedstead was bought after our marriage; the pictures were my property, and part of the bedding, not the bed—the sofa bedstead was hers previously—the stuffed bird was not bought with my money, or the two tables, or the set of tea-trays—the bird<lb></lb>cage was my property—the crockery was mostly bought after our marriage—I found all those things gone—from information I received, I went to the front parlour of the house 59, William-street, and found them there—the prisoners were in the room—I asked Ogden if he was comfortable there—he made me some sort of answer, which I could not understand—I said, "I shall make you uncomfortable directly"—he then began to dress himself, and said he had some duty to do at the barracks, and wished me to take no more notice of it—the birdcage was found in Ogden's quarters at the barracks—I did not take it there—I was with the policeman when he found it—I was never in those quarters before then.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 116, Bridge-road, Plumstead—my father is the landlord of the house, 117, occupied by Mr. Cox—on Friday morning, 5th February, about 7 o'clock, I saw a van at Mr. Cox's door—another witness, Mrs. Cox, and a lad were in it—after the goods were loaded and ready to go away, I saw Ogden at the bottom of the road, waiting for the van—he joined them there—they were about an hour and a half loading the van—I saw the van go down Bridge-road, and Ogden accompanied Mrs. Cox till they got to the Armstrong Gun public-house—I watched the van to 59, William-street, and saw the goods unloaded—while I was waiting there I saw Mrs. Cox come along with a picture in her hand, and she told me, as I had come so far, I might as well assist in unloading the van—I saw her hand Ogden the picture as they were going into the Armstrong Gun—I left the van at 59, William-street, and at the bottom of the street I met Ogden with another picture under his arm—I watched him, and saw him go in to 59, and then come out and help to unload the van—I afterwards pointed out the house to the prosecutor.</p>

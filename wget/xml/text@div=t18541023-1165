                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Dupree; I reside at the Grove, Hackney. On the afternoon of 3rd Oct. last I was driving to Wood<lb></lb>ford—I had come from Hackney, and passed down the Lea-bridge-road—I saw the prisoner near to Higgin-lane, Walthamstow, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, behind a carriage that was standing—I was driving—he was before me—he came up the road—the carriage was in the road—he took a coat from it, and then walked to the footpath—I kept my eyes upon him—he went into Woodford Forest, before you come to Woodford-green, behind some bushes—as soon as I could I got to the carriage, and said to the coachman, "Is there anything gone belonging to the carriage?"—I thought the man had stolen a coat—I saw the lady beckon to the coachman—that convinced me he had robbed the carriage—I rode over to the lady, and told her I saw the man who had gone into the forest steal the coat—I stopped a little while—some persons went into the forest to see if they could meet the prisoner: the gentleman, I believe, belonging to the carriage; I do not know who else—I saw the prisoner again—after the carriage drove off and all</p>

               <p>were gone, he came out from behind the bushes—the prisoner, after he came out from behind the bushes, walked a little way—when I looked towards him he went behind the bushes again—I afterwards saw him peep from behind the bushes—after he peeped I went onward, but I still kept looking—I was going to Woodford—I looked behind me several times, and I saw him a second time behind a cart, on Woodford-green, talking to a carter—he was then coming behind me—I had my chaise stopped, and said to my man, "You get out," and I kept my eye on the prisoner—after leaving the cart, he passed me on the path—he was following the cart—I kept my eyes upon him all the way—he went to a little public house, called the Travellers Rest, at Woodford Wells—I saw a constable opposite, and pointed out the prisoner—the man came up, and went towards the turnpike—I asked the policeman if he had seen the young man, and said, "That young man has just stolen a coat from a gentleman's carriage"—it was light when I first saw him, and I had a good opportunity of seeing him—I am quite sure that the prisoner is the man that took the coat, and went to the public house—I am sure that he is the man that peeped out, and went to the carter—I have no doubt about it at all.</p>

About 5 o'clock, on 3rd Oct., I was on duty in the Woodford-road, and met the last witness—in consequence of information which she gave me, I found the prisoner, and brought him back to her—she immediately identified him as the man who had stolen a coat from a gentleman's carnage in Lea-bridge-road—I took him to the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Eagle Tavern, City-road. On 3rd Oct. last I drove down to Woodford, in an open carriage—my wife was with me—on my return home, in the afternoon, the carriage was in advance of me—I was walking and my wife was walking with me—I was about 500 yards behind the carriage—I observed a horse and cart in the road—there were two men and two women in it—I have every reason to believe the prisoner was one of them—to the best of my belief, he was; I do not say positively—that was nearly 5 o'clock—I observed a conversation take place between the two men, and the prisoner stepped over the tail of my carriage—my coachman was on the front seat, driving—I saw the man, who I believe to be the prisoner, take a great coat from the seat behind the back of the car<lb></lb>riage, and place it on his arm—he turned back, and walked towards the cart again, which was coming towards me—the cart was between me and the carriage—he then had the coat with him on his arm—on seeing that, I crossed over the road, so as to place myself in opposition to him, to meet him as he was returning to his cart—when I was within about thirty or forty yards of him, I imagine the man who was behind me must have made some signs to him—the cart was behind—when within forty yards he had the coat, and he jumped from the roadway into the wood—it was the coat</p>

On 3rd Oct. last I was with him; he drove himself—Mrs. Conquest was with him—I had two coats with me when I left home to go to Woodford, a box coat, and another over my knees—Mr. Conquest had given me that coat ten or twelve months before—on my return from Woodford, both coats lay behind where I was sitting—I was sitting in the rumble till my master and mistress got out to walk, and I left the coat in the rumble—I then went to sit in front and take the reins—I left the coat in the rumble—it was safe when I got down to go to the front of the carriage—that might be from five to ten minutes before I received information from Mrs. Dupree of what she had seen—the carriage was then standing in the Lea Bridge-road—I walked slowly, and sometimes stopped—my master and mistress were behind walking—Mrs. Dupree was on the Lea Bridge-road at that time—she drew my attention to something she had seen—I did not see the prisoner—in consequence of what she stated, I looked behind to see if the coat was safe—I did not get down—I saw my mistress hold up her hand; I turned my attention to her—she asked if I had missed anything from the carriage; I looked over, and said, "Yes, I have lost my coat"—I just got down to look for the prisoner, but saw nothing of him.</p>

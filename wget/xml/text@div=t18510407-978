On 21st March I saw the prisoners, about nine or half-past nine o'clock in the morning, and saw Shawcross put Pryor into the prosecutor's window—Weller was against the gates, about thirteen yards off, watching—I remained there about a quarter of an hour—I saw Pryor come out again—he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> a bundle out before he came out—Shawcross took it up, and they hid it in the yard—they all three went away together—Weller came across the street, and joined them—when they went away they had the bundle with them—I thought it was wrong—I made no alarm because they would have <hi rend="italic">hit</hi> me—there were no persons passing—I did not call out.</p>

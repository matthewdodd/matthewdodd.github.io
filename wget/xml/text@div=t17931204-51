               <p>I have got a leaden pump here, I took it from the prisoner, it was in his possession, he was in Mountain street, the back of Portman-square; Lord Dynevor lives in <placeName id="t17931204-51-crimeloc282">Portman-square</placeName>

When I came up, I apprehended him, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did he give of having the pump in his possession? - I saw him take it off the stones where it was put, at the back of Mr. Montague's in George-street; but when I brought him to the watch-house, he said, he knew nothing at all about it; there were two of them together.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen that pump near Lord Dynevor's stables? - No, I have not; I have compared it with the place, where a pump was taken from, and it seems to fit the place.</p>

               <p>Q. How far is Lord Dynevor's house from the place where this pump was among the stones at Mr. Montague's? - About a hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not observed any pump at all at Lord Dynevor's, previous to this time? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know nothing more to effect the prisoner at the bar, but that he had this pump in his possession, at the time he was apprehended? - I asked him, what he did with it? he said he knew nothing about it; there was another person along with him, and they and the sack, the same sack that I have now, to put it in, they had the sack, but they did not put it in. I did not see the prisoner in possession of the sack.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you known any horses water<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179312040131"></xptr>at that pump? - I have drawn water from that pump many a time for my lord's horses, and for, the gentleman that lived there, before my lord came there. It was as close to the stable as it could be, near the stable door, as close to the bricks as ever it could be.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first observe it had been taken away? - About half past six that same night, the 19th of last month it was there; there are two parties of watchmen in Mary-le-bone, and I did not find it gone till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been to No. 35, Manchester-street, the overnight, when a gentlewoman told me, I was to come the next morning for the dust; I went, and I was very dry, and I asked for a drop of table beer, and she brought me up a pint and a half, and it was very sour; but I drank a good draught of it, and it gave me the gripes, and I went to ease myself, and that man came and catched hold of me, and said I must go along with him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>

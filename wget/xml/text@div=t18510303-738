                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 248.) On Friday evening, 7th Feb., I was in a marine store-shop in Castle-street, Westminster—the prisoner came in, and he said to the marine store-dealer, "Do you buy old lead?"—he said he did—the prisoner put his basket down on the floor, and said, "I have got two or three old sash-weights"—he took these two weights out of the basket and put them in the scale—he was about taking some more things out, and I said to him, "Where did you get them?"—he made no reply—I said, "Where do you work, or who do you work for?"—I asked him two or three times, and he made no answer—he then said, "Is there anything wrong?"—I said, "l don't know"—he did not tell me where he worked—I told him I was a police-officer, and he roust go with me to the station—I took him to the station, and on the way he begged me to let him go, and said he wished he had dropped dead before he went into the shop—he was asked at the station to give his name and address—he would not give it—I examined the basket he bad, and found another lead weight, a brass box, and some glass.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Charlton-street, Belgrave-road. I was foreman to the works going on at Kensington-palace—this property belongs to Her Majesty, and was under the charge of the Commissioners of Woods and Forests—the prisoner had been employed there five days; he began on the Monday, and the work was completed on the Friday—to was doing various jobs—I know there was a spring precisely similar to this one, on a door frame—I saw it either the day the prisoner was taken, or the day previous—I missed the spring from there, and this spring exactly fits the space made for it—we have precisely similar weights to these in the building—here is one from the building which is marked precisely similar to these—this weight is marked 9 lbs.—we have them as large as 12 lbs. or 14 lbs.—they are generally made of iron or lead—these precisely correspond with the one I have produced—there were eight of these</p>

               <p>missed, but they may have been removed before—this is the one I brought from the palace, and this one was taken from the basket—the narks cor<lb></lb>respond—this is the ordinary mode of marking lead weights—the sashes weigh about 18 lbs.—I should say these weights have been marked by the same person, and with the same tools—the prisoner was employed about the windows, but whether about the windows where these weights were missing, I cannot say; he was easing the sashes, and making them work—I have fitted this plate glass.</p>

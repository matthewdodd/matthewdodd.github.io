                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant, and live at Wandsworth. The prisoner was employed to paint a house of mine—the lead was not taken from there, but from some new building at the Bridge-fields—I saw it safe on Monday morning, the 11th of Aug.—the policeman came to me at eleven o'clock that night, and produced it—I have marks on it—the pri<lb></lb>soner was working 300 vards from those houses.</p>

               <p>—they are Mr. Frost's workmen—Dolling was working where the lead was taken from—he was taken up, till the Magistrate discharged him—after committing him he turned him into a witness—the prisoner had worked there some weeks—he said before the Magistrate that Dolling was present when he moved the lead from the kitchen, and knew where he was going to take it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. On this Monday night I watched the prisoner into a marine-store shop with this lead—I went in directly, and took him—he acknowledged he was going to leave it there—he said he brought it from Dolling, who knew he was bringing it away to sell—I went and took Dolling, who said it was Phillips's lead, and that he had taken it home to take care of.</p>

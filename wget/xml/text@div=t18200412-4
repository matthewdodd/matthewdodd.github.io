About ten o'clock at night I was sitting in the back parlour, and heard a noise at the street-door, which was then fast - I then heard the street-door open. I took up a candle, ran into the passage, and saw the door shut to by some person outside. I threw down the candlestick immediately, ran out, and observed the prisoner on the curb-stone, about five yards from the door - another man was about seventy yards off, who appeared to be looking out; he was standing still.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person have get that distance from your house in that time - A. It is impossible. The prisoner threw down two keys - I was close behind him, and seized him; he said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want with me? it was a man in a white coat." I believe I had said</p>
               <p>"You rascal!" but nothing else. He struggled a good deal, I brought him back to the door; in about ten minutes the patrol came up, and I gave him in charge. I picked up one key and the patrol the other - the first key the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120005"></xptr>threw down opens my uncle's door. I saw him searched at the watch-house - two whole Spermaceti candles, and two nozzles of candlesticks, were found in his pocket; a gold watch-chain and key were also found on him.</p>

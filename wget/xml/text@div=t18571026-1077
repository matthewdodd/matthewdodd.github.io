                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police sergeant, N</hi> 1). I went to No. 11, Dorset Street, on the night of 6th Oct.—I saw the prisoner in the passage there—he was in custody—he did not say anything to me then—I was in the front room, and be sent for me—I went; he asked me if I would shake hands, which I did: he did not say anything at that time—I went into the next room to assist the deceased—he sent for me the second time—he said, "Well, ser<lb></lb>geant, will you shake hands?" I did so—he sent for me the third time, and he said, "Well, sergeant, what am I charged with?"—I said, "You are charged with the wilful murder of your wife"—he said, "I wish I were in India, to kill some of the b—s there"—he then said, "Sergeant, I shall want you to take charge of all my things, as I shall want it for counsel"—he then pointed to a work box—he said, "There is something in there"—I opened the work box, and found a piece of paper which contained a certificate of the marriage—he told me to take care of that—I have got it—on the way to the station he asked me if his wife was dead—I told him yes—he then said, "It is a bad job; it can't be helped now; it was all done in a moment"—he was drunk—I had cautioned him two or three times previous to his saying anything.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police inspector, N</hi>). On Wednesday morning, about ten minutes to 1 o'clock, I was at the station—the prisoner said, "Mr. Langdon, I want to speak to you"—I proceeded to the cell door; seeing the state he was in, I said "Davis, you are not in a fit state to make any state<lb></lb>ment to me; go and lie down; I decline to listen to anything you say?—at half past 3 o'clock he said, "Mr. Langdon, are you there? I want to speak to you"—I then went to his cell again; I then said, "Davis, you had better be careful what you say to me; this is a very serious charge, and whatever you say to me, I might have to use it in evidence against you on your trial"—he said, "I thank you"—he then said, that they had been out all day together, his wife and he, and had spent a comfortable day together; he had been carrying some work home to Peckham Rye, and when they got home to their residence at Ball's Pond, he went out to get a pint of beer, some rum, and a pound of meat for their supper; when he returned home this occurred momentarily; he did not do it—he said, "I did not do it"—he then said, "Is she dead?"—I said, "She is"—he said,</p>

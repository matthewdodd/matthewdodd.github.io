                  </hi>. I was employed by Mr. James Strother. He had a black mare, which I turned out, between five and six o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, on the 7th of October, in a field down in Charlton parish, in Kent, in the Manor-way—I put her into the field—you go down the Manor-way to get to the field—it is a public road, leading to the fields—I locked the gate safe and left her there—there was no other horse there—I went to the field again the same evening, between five and six o'clock, and found the gate broken open, the lock and chain taken off, and the mare gone—I saw her again on Monday, she was brought from London to our premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed horse-slaughterer, and live in Black<lb></lb>friars-road. I know the prisoner Matthews by having a horse from him about ten years ago—I went to his place and killed it—I have seen him since then, and have had transactions in business with him, but that was my first acquaintance with him—on Saturday, the 7th of October, he brought a black mare to my house, near upon seven o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing—he came to my gate with it, and asked me to buy it—I asked him how much—he said 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I got a light and looked round the horse, and asked him where he brought it from—he said he had come from Squire Fuller's, at Beckenham, and had brought it from there—that he came from there—his expression was, "<hi rend="italic">It</hi> came from there"—he said he wanted it killed, and to have the tail cut off, which must go back—he went behind the mare, and said, "You must cut the tail off about here," pointing to the place—he said one of Mr. Fuller's men was coming to his house for the tail, next Sunday week—I looked round the mare—she appeared very fleshy, and had a rowel in the side as if it was under a doctor—it appeared too good to kill, as I thought—I told him I had my suspicion, and should stop the mare, and take her to the station-house, and he had better come too—he said he would—I took the mare to the station-house, and told the Inspector I had suspicion it was stolen—I left it there—I saw her after<lb></lb>wards at Woolwich, in possession of Mr. Strother, and am confident it was the same mare.</p>

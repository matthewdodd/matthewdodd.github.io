            . I am a horse-patrol on the Enfield-station. In consequence of information I waited for the prisoner's coming from his work at Mr. Mellish's, at Bush-hill park, on the 17th of January, between five and six o'clock in the evening; when he had got three hundred yards from the barn, I stopped him - I took off his hat, and found in it a bag of wheat undreased; Mead was with me- we took him to the watch-house, and then went to search his house, where we found about three pecks more of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170042"></xptr>wheat, some wheat ground, and a small mill with some wheat in it.</p>

The prisoner had been threshing wheat on the 17th of January - we never permit the servants to take any corn when they are working for us; this wheat is in the state it is immediately after threshing - I have brought a sample of the wheat the prisoner had been threshing that day, and, I believe, this found on him, and at his house to be the same as this - here is about the same quantity of seed and soil with one as with the other; I have no doubt they are part of the same bulk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never carried a bag - this little bag was laid as a trap to catch me; there was a man caught with some wheat before, and then they suspected me - I have often gone up the lane with these officers before, and they did not stop me; I have threshed near three years for Mr. Brady, and this is done merely out of spite because I would not send Dearman money - this was a trap, and if the officers did not do it they have let somebody else do it, that is the real truth; if I was to be transported for fourteen years to-morrow - I have put up hundreds of quarters of corn for Mr. Brady, and it has been measured out to half a bushel.</p>

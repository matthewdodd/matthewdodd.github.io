I live at 2, Salmon's-lane, Limehouse—on Tuesday, 21st May, about 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening, I came from my master's and went towards Went worth-street, to go to my tailor's—a little dog ran against my leg, and I kicked is—Turner then came and spoke to me, but I did not understand him, and the other two prisoners came, and one gave me a strike in the eye—Martin came and caught hold of me round by the thighs and trousers pockets, and then the other two got hold of me, and we had a wrestle and fell to the ground—I lay on the top of two of them—Martin fell on the top of me—my lips were bleeding and my eyes were Black—as soon as I got up, I missed my watch and chain, and I ran after Turner and collared him—I had seen my watch about a in use or two Before—I am quite sure the prisoners are the men that struck me.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. What time of the day? - A. In the evening; I looked through the stable door, and watched him; he took a measure of corn in the sieve, and put it in the bag; it was a white bag; I saw him put oats in it; I went to my master's house to tell them to come; I saw him take the oats out of the bin; then I told the other boy; I went up to the stable with an excuse, and put some hay under Smiler; I felt the bag, and it felt like oats; I went and watched him after this, in the small-beer cellar; Kemp bid me good night; he went out in about half an hour, and came round the fields to the little shed, and uncovered it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him put any thing in the shed before? - A. No, he fetched the bag out of the shed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to be the same bag you had seen before? - A. Yes, and then he went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner lived a year and half with your master; you were very fond of him? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. The door was shut? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You put your foot on the bag; you felt it was oats; you do not wear dancing pumps in the country; you wear thick shoes? - A. Yes.</p>

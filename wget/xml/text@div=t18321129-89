On Saturday, the 13th of October, we went into the house; we purchased the good-will of the prisoner's father, and the fixtures; my husband gave 35l. for them, which was paid in sovereigns to Mr. Smith, by my husband; I saw him pay it on the 13th of October, about eleven o'clock in the morning - he paid the money in the house; Mr. and Mrs. Smith, me, my husband, and a lady where we lived before were present when it was paid; we had not any furniture in the house at that time - the prisoner was also present when the money was paid; I think she saw it paid - she saw her father have the money afterwards; we brought our things in that evening- Smith did not leave the house; we wanted them to go, but we could not get them out - we used the front room second floor for our sleeping-room - our bed was there, and their bedstead was in the room, and some drawers and a table of theirs, and we had a trunk in the room; we carried on a school - the girl's school is on the same floor, as the bedroom, and the boys' school is on the first floor (the prisoner was to have carried on the school until the Friday, as we gave them all permission to stop in the house without paying rent.) On Monday, the 15th, about eleven o'clock, she and I were in the school-room, and there was a knock at the door - she said, "Shall I go into your room and look out of the window:" I did not object to it, and she went; she called me, and told me the knock was for me - I went into the room, looked out of window, and saw it was for me; I then went down stairs to speak to the person, leaving her there, and when I returned up stairs I missed a purse, containing two shillings and a foreign sixpence, off the mantel-piece - I had seen it when I went out of the room to speak to the person - I told the prisoner I had missed it- she said it was very strange, and she hoped I did not think she had got it; I said I should be sorry to think so- I then went into the school-room, and she also said, before the children, that she hoped I did not think she had got it; I said the same as before, that I should be sorry to think that she had got it; the person I went down to speak to was the broker - I went into my bed-room again, and she followed me into the room, and while the man was bringing the furniture up stairs I told her she had better go and look after the children - she went, and returned almost directly with a piece of work in her hand: I had some money in a box in the same room; I had eighty-two sovereigns in a bag, which I took out of the box - she was sitting in the room at the time; I put the bag on the bed, that she might not see it, but she did, because she came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290043"></xptr>close to me - I opened the bag to pay nine sovereigns to the broker; she came close to me - she said she wished I would let her put her hand into that bag, and take out a thousand- I said nothing to that; I paid the broker, and put the bag into the box again - I know there were eighty-two sovereigns in the bag, because on Saturday, when we paid the thirty-five, my husband counted them - he counted them about two days before the Saturday, at No. 24, Chapel-street, Pentonville, where we lived before; the bag was never out of this box after that - I saw it put into the box: sometimes my husband had the key, and sometimes I had it; it was always in possession of one of us; the box was always in our bed-room at Pentonville, till we moved to Chapel-street, and then it was put into our bed-room; a porter brought it from Pentonville there on a truck - I did not see it delivered to the porter; my son accompanied the porter with it to Chad's-place, but I did not; when I paid the broker the 9l. I took out ten sovereigns; I kept the one sovereign, and put the bag into the box again, and locked it; when the broker was gone I and the prisoner were going into the school-room again, and as we came out of the bedroom door, she told me her mother was calling me - I did not hear her mother call me; I looked over the bannisters, and told her I could neither hear nor see her mother call me - she insisted that her mother was calling me; I went down one flight of stairs, as far as the boy's school-room, and then returned, as I did not think her mother was calling me - she looked over the bannisters, and told me her mother was in the kitchen, and that she was calling me; I went down stairs, and saw her mother in the parlour - she did not want me; I went up stairs - she was then standing just inside the school-room door - I told her her mother had not called me, that I had been down, and spoken to her - she made no reply to that, but said, in a very hurried manner, that she had thought of a key, which would fit my room door, and that the key of the school-room fitted it, (we had enquired for a key to the bed-room door) she put the key into the key-hole herself, and locked the door - she was trying to see if the key fitted it; she left the key in the door, and I tried it myself, to see if it was locked - the key was taken out of the door; I do not recollect which of us took it out, but if she took it out, she gave it to me, for it was in my hand directly; Mr. and Mrs. Smith, the prisoner, my husband, and myself were in the house at this time; Mr. Smith was engaged down stairs in the boys' school-room - nobody was up stairs besides the prisoner and the man who brought the furniture in, and I was there the whole time with him - I should think this took place about eleven o'clock, as near as I can guess; the school hours are from nine till twelve - it was her duty to remain in the school the whole of the day; the moment she gave me the key, she went down stairs; she did not tell me she was going - she returned at ten minutes after twelve o'clock - I asked where she had been - she said she had been out with a friend; I had sent down stairs to inquire for her, but she could not be found - she then told me to dismiss the children, and they all went home - they ought to have gone at twelve o'clock, but I did not know the time; I remained in the school-room with her a few minutes; there was a desk in the room, which I told her was not the one we had bought with the fixtures - she said it was; I heard my husband coming up stairs, and I took the key she had given me off the school-room table, and unlocked the bed-room door - the school-room commands a view of the bed-room - when I sat in the room I could see any body who went into the bedroom - nobody had gone to it from the time she locked it, till I opened it for my husband; the school-room door was open the whole day; when I went into the bedroom, my husband sat down, and my attention was called to the trunk - I found it was shut, the bolt of the lock was turned, but it had not caught - it was like a desk lock; it was my husband called my attention to the box when he sat down - he said I had not locked it, and found the bolt was shot, but it did not go into the lid; I examined the bag, and found that it was open - I had twisted a string round it when I paid the broker, but did not tie it - I found the mouth of the bag open; we counted the sovereigns, and twenty-five were deficient - I found forty-seven in the bag - the prisoner was in the school-room; we went into the school-room, and told her we had been robbed, and that we should like to know where she had been while she was out - she said she would not tell us; we told her we would have a Policeman, and then she ran away down stairs - my husband ran after her, and I went down and found her at the front gate - she still said she would not tell us where she had been; my husband said, if she would, he would take her there himself, and not have a Policeman - she would not tell us, and we sent for a Policeman - she then ran into the kitchen, and fastened the door - we could not get in, we tried to get in repeatedly; I went to the front window of the kitchen, but could not see her; a Policeman came, but she would not let him in - he tried the door and window - she had fastened them both; he at last got in at the window, and let us in at the door - the prisoner slept in the kitchen - her bed was opposite the window, on chairs; she was examined at the office between one and two o'clock, I think, and after that the Magistrate ordered the house to he searched - I went with the Policeman; we searched the kitchen - Mrs. Smith was there, with the Policeman, and myself; both the Policeman and her mother searched the bedding, and I saw the mother find two purses under the bed, either between two beds, or between the bed and mattress - one was a brown purse, and the other a bead purse; I had seen the bead purse frequently in the prisoner's hands - she was in the habit of using it - neither of the purses were mine; there was about 4d. in the bead purse, and in the brown purse there were fifteen sovereigns, and 12s. 6d. in silver - the brown purse has two ends to it - the gold and silver were separate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you and and the family had any disagreement before this? A. No; we wanted them to leave the house, but after the money was paid, it was agreed they should stop till the 19th; I do not know that the prisoner's mother is weak in her intellect; when we paid the father, he handed the money over to the mother, who put it into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290044"></xptr>her pocket - she did not hand it to the prisoner; we did not repent our bargain; I never said I would be revenged on them; I could not get the prisoner out of the bed-room - it would not have been polite to turn her out; she was absent from the house about an hour- it is a large wooden box, and locks like a desk - I thought I had locked it; it stood on another high box, and as my husband sat down he could see that the hasp had not caught; I was flurried at losing the purse, and must have shut it down in that way; I told the prisoner that morning that I missed some rings, but did not know whether I had brought them there or not - she went and found them; when we said we would have a Policeman, she said she defied twenty Policemen - I never wanted to compromise this; the mother said,"I would have given you 50l. if you had not taken my daughter;" I had not asked what she would give me not to appear - I never said I would be revenged about the school; I asked the prisoner about nine o'clock that morning, what she would stop with me for a week for - she said 6l. - I refused to give that - that conversation was in the kitchen; she and her mother were together; I had said before I took the school, that I was rather deficient in fancy work, and would she object to show me - she said she could do that in half an hour, but I found it was not necessary in that school; she gave me the names of fifteen scholars, some at 1s. 6d. a week, and some at 1s. - I found I had but three scholars, but the prisoner said they did not come on Monday morning - two new ones came that morning.</p>

I had a bag of money at Pentonville; I counted it three or four days before the 13th - there were a hundred and twenty sovereigns; I took out, I believe, two, but I will say three, in order to be within the mark; that would make it one hundred and seventeen, and on Saturday I took out thirty-five at Pentonville; I did not count the rest that day, but there were about eighty-two left - I tied the bag up, and put it into the box, locked the box, and corded it; the key was always in possession of either my wife or myself - the box was sent to Chad's-place, in a truck; my son accompanied the porter - he is not here; I did not go with it - I paid the 35l. on Monday; I believe I paid it into Mrs. Smith's hands, but they were all present - to the best of my recollection the prisoner never had it in her hands. On the Monday, I went up into my bed-room, a little after twelve o'clock, and after a little conversation with my wife on other subjects, I discovered that the lid of the box was not shut down - I found the bolt of the lock had been shot, but the staple rested on it; my wife handed me the bag, and previous to counting it, I knew from the weight a very large sum had been abstracted from it - I counted it, and found forty-seven sovereigns; I missed twenty-five - we went into the school-room, and I told the prisoner I had lost twenty-five sovereigns, and I should be much obliged to her if she could tell me where she had been - she refused to tell me; I said if she did not I would put her into the hands of a Policeman - she quite laughed at it, and said, "Do you suppose I am such a fool as to care for a Policeman," and then ran down stairs; I followed her to the front gate, brought her into the passage, and sent for a Policeman, who arrived, but I hesitated at giving her in charge at first, fearing she might bring an action for false imprisonment, but after having gone to the station-house, and got advice of the inspector, I returned and gave her in charge; she had previously threatened to stab the Policeman if he took her, and had barred herself into the kitchen; the Policeman attempted to break the door down with an axe, but not succeeding, he at last got in at the window - I had seen the prisoner before I discovered the lid of the box to be open, in the school-room - I had gone into the bed-room, and returned to the school-room before I discovered the loss, for some money, which she had received of the children for schooling that morning; I was rather in a passion about it, understanding she had spoken to my wife in an improper manner about it, and I said,"Miss Smith, I should thank you for the money you have received this morning;" she replied that she had nothing to do with money matters at all, that she had given the money to her papa, who had gone out - he had left the house about twelve o'clock; I asked her about the desk-there was a very good desk in the room, and that was removed, and another put into its place; she said it was the same desk - I remarked that she behaved very singularly, in fact, like one almost out of her mind or intoxicated; she capered and danced about the room in a manner I could not understand.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then there had been a dispute between her and your wife about money she had received? A. No, I understand something had been said about it; to the best of my recollection I paid the 35l. across the table to Mrs. Smith, because she said she always had the money matters to do, and her husband said so too; I said before I opened the bag, that I was sure a great sum had been taken out - I made a memorandum of what was left in it, in a journal which I keep, within two days of the robbery, but within a few hours I made a memorandum on paper, and transcribed it into my journal, and here is a copy which I took from the journal two or three days ago; the porter who took the box is not here - here is the original memorandum - it is a leaf of the journal.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was Mrs. Humphries below? A.

            . I am a Policeman. I was sent for on the 15th of October; as I entered the passage the prisoner was close to the back parlour door - the prosecutor said he was robbed of twenty-five sovereigns; the prisoner seemed very much flurried, and desired me to take her - she threatened to run a knife into me, or to any Policeman who offered to touch her - Mr. Humphries hesitated what to do - he went to the station-house, and returned to give her in charge - she was then in the kitchen, and had fastened the door; I wished her to open it; she refused - I got in at the window, and found her sitting in a chair, with a small dessert knife in her hand; I secured her - Mrs. Humphries searched her at the station-house, and 2s. were found on her - she was taken before a Magistrate, and by his direction I searched the house; her mother and Mr. Humphries were present-I searched the front kitchen; there are two beds there - it was before three o'clock - the beds appeared to have been slept on; I saw her mother find fifteen sovereigns in a purse, with four half-crowns and five sixpences under her bed - she found two purses in a small pocket handkerchief, rolled up, and put between the two beds, which laid one on the other - I mean there are two beds for two different people to sleep in - I could not say whose bed it was; there was 4d. in coppers in the bead purse, and in the other fifteen sovereigns in one end, and 12s. 6d. in the other - I have them here.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father. I received 35l. from Humphries; my wife has never been very strong in her mind since the birth of my daughter-she lost the use of her limbs by a paralytic stroke; I gave the 35l. to my daughter; I cannot say whether she put it into her pocket, but she took care of it - she was in the habit of taking charge of my money; I received 24s. that day from a pupil named Grove - on the Monday morning I received from my daughter 11l., and then 8l., to pay rent and taxes - some thieves had attempted our house about five weeks before, since which the prisoner slept in the kitchen with us; we could not persuade her to sleep up stairs.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long did you remain in the house?

             the 19th, by agreement - I have a receipt for the rent and taxes; I paid the last quarter's rent on the Monday, the taxes the following morning, and the poor rates the next day.</p>
               <p>- TOMLIN. I am landlord of the house. This is my receipt; I went in between five and six o'clock in the evening for the rent; Mrs. Smith called Mr. Smith on one side, and told him not to pay the rent - I saw they were flurried; I said there was nothing like the present time; they went into my parlour, and then they paid the rent.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. The prisoner drank tea at my house on Sunday, the 14th of October, and paid me 2s. 6d. for repairing shoes; she took it out of a brown purse, which had money at each end.</p>

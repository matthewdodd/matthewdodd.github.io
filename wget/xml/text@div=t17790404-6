I was sent for to the Rotation-office, and saw the tea-chest and writing box; the writing box was in the possession of a pawnbroker, who I understood brought it there.

               <p>I was concerned with the three prisoners in this and several other robberies. I have been connected with them four months. We went out of days to see if we could find any places where we were likely to get any thing. We saw this upholsterer's window broke, and Harris said we could get something there; we all went at night. Harris<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040009"></xptr> and Foster went, and Harris took the glass out of the window, piece after piece, till he had taken the whole out. Potten and I stood on the opposite side of the way. Harris brought the carpeting to us, and then the writing desk and then the tea-chest. He could not reach any thing else. We took them to my house.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Windmill-street, Tottenham-court-road. They fetched all the things away the next morning except the box which was left at my house. I did not think it was safe to have it there. I carried it to a neighbour; when it had been there a little while, I desired him to pawn it which he did for six shillings. Potten and Foster boarded with me at the time. They lodged at a different house in the neighbourhood, to which I recommended them.</p>
               <p>What day was this? - I cannot tell; it was some time in January.</p>

I searched his lodging, and found a tea-chest. I asked him where he got it; he said he bought it. Lyons carried us to Foster's lodgings; we took Foster and Potten together: they both lodged in the same room. I searched the room, but found nothing in it. Harris took us to a house in Petticoat-lane, under a pretence to show us some other people who were concerned with him, and when he had got us into a room among a number of people, he ran away and left us.</p>
               <p>From Harris to Lyons. Whether I did not buy the tea-chest and a coffee-pot of your brother Barnard? - He did not.</p>
               <p>M'Donald. Harris wanted to turn evidence at the Rotation-Office, and again before the Lord Mayor; he said he would fill a person's hat full of diamonds if he might turn evidence respecting a robbery in the city.</p>

               <p>You cannot recollect the day of the month? - No, I cannot; it was about the 22d or 23d of February. The goods were lost out of the shop window; the shop was open. It appeared to me that by some instrument the pane of glass had been snapped off at the corner, and a hole made big enough to put a person's arm in. I knew the pane of glass was whole. The door was shut, it has a spring latch; and the candles were lighted. I was in the back shop with my partner; the servants were both out.</p>
               <p>What time in the evening were they lost? - Between the hours of six and seven.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell how long after six it was? - I believe about half after six; I heard some glass rattle; I went and searched, but did not perceive any pane broke at that time, nor any china gone from the window. I did not look so particularly as I should have done. The next morning, the man taking down the shutters, saw the glass lying down under the place; I was by at the time.</p>

               <p>Are you acquainted with Harris? - Yes, I have been acquainted with him from about a week after Christmas. We have been out a great many times together, and got a great many things with other people. We went by this china shop in the day; at night we went again, and he had a knife which he always cut glass with.</p>
               <p>Was you with him? - I was.</p>
               <p>What time in the night was it when you went out? - About five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you go immediately to this house? - No; we went to a publick-house, drank something, and staid till after six o'clock, before we went to this shop; when we went from the public-house, we walked about the street to see if we could get an opportunity to cut the glass out.</p>
               <p>Was it quite dark then? - Yes. We came to this shop, he had a little knife in his hand, he put it into the putty, and cracked the glass; it made a report, and the gentleman of the shop came out and looked all round the shop-window, but not perceiving a ny thing, he went backwards again, quite to the back part of the shop; then Harris put the knife in again, and loosened the glass.</p>
               <p>You concealed yourselves at the time? - We went on the other side of the way till he went in. After this we crossed the way again to the shop. He put his knife in again and loosened the glass, and took it out piece by piece, till he could get his hand in,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177904040011"></xptr> and then he put his hand in and took out the china mentioned in the indictment (repeating it) and gave them to me, putting them into my apron as he took them out. Then we went home with them to my house in Windmill-street, Tottenham-court-road. He said the china would fetch a guinea, and he gave me half a guinea. As to the three chocolate cups, I said he might keep them himself; he came the next day and took them from my house. I gave information against Harris on Friday night, and he was taken up. I saw the cups and saucers, and chocolate cups at the Rotation-office. Harris told me the next day, that he had taken them to my brother and he had pawned them.</p>

In his lodging I found these three cups (they were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor); he said he bought them at a sale for eighteen-pence; he told us afterwards that he would take us to some persons that were concerned with him, and when we were in Petticoat-lane, he made his escape from us; he went afterwards to the Mansion-house, and wanted to be made an evidence, but his lordship finding he had escaped from us, would not admit him.</p>

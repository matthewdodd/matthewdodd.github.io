The prisoner applied to me on or about the latter end of May, or the beginning of June, in the last year; she and her husband brought me this administration (producing it). [The letters of administration dated the 26th of February 1780, were read]. They came afterwards and brought a certificate of the parish in which they were inhabitants which is required in the office, and desired me to get the wages due to her brother on that administration; accordingly on the 21st of June 1780, they called on me, and I having received the money for the Grafton. I paid them nine pound eighteen shillings, and this is her receipt (producing it) signed with her mark (it was read). The Boyne was then abroad. When I heard she was come home, in the course of business, I sent that administration down to Plymouth. I received advice of the money to be paid.

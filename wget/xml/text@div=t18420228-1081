                  </hi>. I am gardener to Ann Redpath—we have an out-house at the bottom of the garden, which adjoins the house—the door of the house opens into the garden—there is a fence round the garden, part pales and part quickset, which separates it from the road—the dwelling house is inside the fence, and the out-house also—the out-house was locked with a padlock—on Sunday afternoon, the 20th of February, I found the prisoner at the station—he had a hamper containing seven ropes of onions belonging to my mistress, also a hat of my own, which I had locked up in the tool-house, close by the out-house, about six o'clock on Saturday night—I locked the tool-house up and left in it three ropes of onions and the hat—the hamper and four other ropes of onions were in an open shed—I went to the tool-house on Sunday morning, the 20th of February, after seven o'clock, and missed the property—I gave information to the police, and afterwards saw the property at the station—the tool-house was broker open, and the straw thrown out of the hamper—I can swear to the hat now produced, and know my own tying of the onions—I have no doubt they are my mistress's property—I cannot swear to the hamper, but it is similar to the one I lost—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw the prisoner at the corner of Connor-row, High-street, Woolwich, about eight o'clock on the Saturday evening, with a hamper on his shoulder—I asked what he had got there—he said, onions—I asked where he got them from—he said he bought them for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of a man on the other side Plumstead, with a horse and cart, and he was going to Woolwich-market to sell them—there is a mar<lb></lb>ket there on Saturday night—I said I did not believe him, and he must go with me to the station—I found he had a hat over his own—he had two hats on—I asked where he got the two hats from, and nine apples which were in his pocket—he said he had the apples from the man he had the onions from, that the hat was a covering, not a hat, and that it was his own—I took him to the station, and fetched Nicholls—I produce the property.</p>

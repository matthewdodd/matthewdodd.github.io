               <p>GEORGE STROHHECKER. I live in Fore-street, Cripplegate. On the 18th of November, I parted with two gentlemen at the corner of <placeName id="t18241202-86-crimeloc469">St. Martin's-le-Grand</placeName>

I was not quite sober: but knew what I was doing. I had not parted with them half a minute when this woman took hold of me, and asked me to go with her. I said, No; I was going home - she wanted to pull me up a court - she got her hand into my trowsers' pocket, and got all my money. I seized her hand, and part of the money fell on the ground - the watchman came up, and took her into custody. I picked up 3 s. I had 24 s. 6 d. in my pocket.</p>

            . I am a watchman: and was on duty on the night in question. I saw this gentleman come down St. Martin's-le-Grand - this woman met him, and took hold of his arm, and they went up the court. I followed them - when they had been in the court two or three minutes, he charged her with the robbery. I saw him pick up 3 s., and I picked up 3 s. 6 d. I took her to the watch-house.</p>

            . I was the officer of the night - the prisoner was brought in. I searched her, and found in her pocket seven shillings, two half-crowns, and a sixpence; she said, it was the change of a sovereign which she had got from a gentleman the night before - the prosecutor was not sober - he was fresh.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the prosecutor came to the watch-house, he said, he had either two or four half-crowns, he did not know which. - Witness. Yes; he said, he had two or four half-crowns.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He asked me to go with him. I said, I could not, as it was so late; he then went up the court; he said, he would give me some silver, and took his money out of his pocket - he was so drunk that he reeled against the wall, and dropped his money - he then charged me with the robbery.</p>

               <p>Q. You are a locker, under the employment of the Excise office. Were you in the warehouses of Messrs Mashiter, Johnson, Bing; and Platt, on the 8th of September last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it their private warehouse? - It is a warehouse under the survey of the board of excise; I don't know whether it is their private warehouse or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at the bar employed in that warehouse on the 8th of September last? - I believe a labourer there.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time of the day did this matter take place? - About eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the custom of the labourers to leave the warehouse at that time? - Yes, to go to breakfast. About the bottom of the stair case I detected the prisoner with some coffee in his right high breeches or trowsers pocket, I don't know which, I believe he had both on.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other persons going out at that time? - None but him. I observed somethings project on the right side of his breeches, which created my suspicion; I put my hand to him and found it was coffee beans. He was searched immediately in my sight; I saw it turned out of his pockets, it was raw coffee; that in the trowsers or breeches was loose, about a pound, he had got this handkerchief in his hand, and there was a clerk to Mr. Mashiter examined the handkerchief, when I found the coffee in his breeches I see it.</p>

               <p>Q. What was found in it? - Raw coffee. It all amounted, what was found in his breeches and handkerchief together, to upwards of five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other commodity in this warehouse but coffee? - I believe cocoa nuts. The casks were most of them open at the top.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found this coffee on him did he say any thing? - He said something in a foreign language, but I did not at all understand him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160156"></xptr>Q. Have you had that coffee in your custody ever since? - I have. It is West India coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the man speak English at all? - We desired him to, he would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can he speak English? - To my knowledge he cannot, I never heard him speak English.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The sacks were all open up stairs, and some of the bags were broke, and the coffee came out, and I was bringing it down stairs.</p>
               <p>Witness. There were coffee beans laying very thinly all over the floor; you may pick up half a dozen in a foot square.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you clerk to Messrs. Mashiter and Co. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes; he was employed as a <rs id="t17950916-55-deflabel322" type="occupation">labourer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17950916-55-defend626 t17950916-55-deflabel322"></join> in our warehouses; the 8th of September was the first day he was employed; they are at Iron Gate, some of them on the wharf, and some over the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these warehouses from whence the coffee was taken? - Over the wharf.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any coffee deposited in those warehouses? - Yes, a great deal, West India coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose your warehouses are open to any merchant that lodge goods there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the warehouses belong to Messrs. Mashiter, &amp;c? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had this man any authority to carry away any part of the coffee? - He had not.</p>
               <p>- HANCOCK sworn.</p>
               <p>I was employed in these warehouses; I was called to from above stairs, and when I came down I see the prisoner and coffee in the possession of Willgrove, Willgrove had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he been up in these warehouses where this coffee was? - I can hardly say. That morning there were sixty bags for exportation up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any quantity of coffee scattered on the floor? - In different parts of the floor there is coffee scattered about which falls over, and then it is swept up and put into parcels by itself, to be cleaned.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose that is scattered by those that come to look at the coffee? - And by the coopers likewise; it is swept up by itself, and when there is any coffee wanted to make up the weight, then it is sifted and put into the cask to make up the weight; that coffee is taken care of as well as the rest; there was nothing but coffee in the second floor, three or four hundred casks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know on which floor this man worked? - The second floor.</p>
               <p>Q. How many casks may there be there, between two and three hundred? - I don't think there were as many as that; there were sixty bags that were going for exportation that morning, when this man was ordered there to aid and assist in delivering them, and the bags were not open.</p>
               <p>Q. But they may have holes in them? - Not them, when they are delivered, because they employ one man to few them up, and another man to deliver the goods. I spoke to him and he answered, but I did not understand him.</p>
               <p>Q. To Walker. Does the prisoner understand English? - Not that I know of When I employed him that morning I only asked him his name. I never see him before.</p>
               <p>Q. To Hancock. Did you observe that coffee whether it was sweepings? - It did not look like sweepings of the floor, it looked like clean coffee; I went and examined the coffee; there were several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160157"></xptr>parcels opened close by the loop holes, but that might be by other people, and not by him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went with another man in the morning at six o'clock, I went to the warehouse, the second story, to work there, and I picked the coffee up at one place and another, and this is what I spilt, I picked it up and tied it in a pocket handkerchief, and we could not understand one another, and he took me and stopped me with the coffee on me; I brought it down to give it to them, because it was spilt; I had not worked with them any time then, and he took the handkerchief away from me directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dressmaker at 4, Florence Cottages, Park Road, Hounslow—about 11 p.m. on 19th July I was returning home with my supper beer when Evans and Gwillam followed me, spit in my face, and blackguarded me—I had seen Evans before, but never had any conversation with her—Gwillam knocked me down, tore my shawl off, and struck me, and Evans punched me when I was down—they gave me two black eyes and knocked a tooth out—I had a watch attached to a cord round my neck—Gwillam dragged it out of my watch-pocket while I was down—I screamed for help, and the witness George came up and pulled her off me—I said, "She has got my watch," and he took it from her hand—there were seven militiamen there, one was had up at Brentford last Saturday, but I could not swear to him, so he was punished for having my earring in his posses<lb></lb>sion—when George pulled the woman off me Jackson ran at me and kicked me in the side—I was still on the ground—I had not seen him before, he was with the seven when they began the attack—the militiamen stood aside while the girls assaulted me; but there were so many there, and I was so covered with blood and mud I could not recognise the others, and as soon as I got up I ran home—I afterwards gave a description to the police, and the next day George brought me my watch.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On Saturday, the 17th of January, about half past six o'clock, the two prisoners came into Rosemary-lane, and offered two boots for sale; I suspected them, because the boots were odd ones, and seeing the name of Brown inside the boots I took them in custody. Sack Mahomet had the boots, and Mandane offered them to sell. I took them to the watchhouse. Turnbridge; the constable, was in the watchhouse, he has the custody of the boots. I went to Mr. Brown; he informed me he had lost two boots.</p>

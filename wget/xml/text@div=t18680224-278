On 31st January, about half-past seven in the evening, I was on duty in the Barking Road, and saw the prisoner with some lead pipe under his arm—I asked him what he had got—he said "Nothing "—I said "You have got some lead pipe, where did you get it from?"—without making any answer he dropped it, and tripped me up—I got up as soon as I could, and saw him throw something over a fence—he made great resistance, and I had to use my truncheon to keep him from escaping again—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the lead, and I found this ball-cock over the fence—at the station he said he had had it three months.</p>

On 31st January, about half-past seven, I was in the Barking Road—I saw the prisoner come through the Iron Bridge gate over the river Lea—he had a coat under his right arm—I watched him, and saw him shift the coat from his right arm to the left—I told the constable to go after him—I went to the place, and found this ball-cock over the fence—at the station he said he had had it two months—the pipes had some water in them then—it was quite new pipe—the ball was wet from recent use—from information I received I went to 5, Swans<lb></lb>comb Street, Plaistow, on the following Wednesday—a man named Alfred Brown, living next door, went with me—there was a notch in one of the pieces of pipe that was left there, which corresponds with one of the pieces produced—I measured from the ground to the cistern, it is about seven feet six—there was a hold-fast in the wall, near the ground—the pipe could not be pulled through, and it had been broken off by mistake—the pipe produced exactly corresponds in measurement to the pieces gone from the house.</p>

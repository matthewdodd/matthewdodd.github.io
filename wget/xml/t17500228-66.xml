            . I am wife to the prosecutor. Yesterday was seven-night, the prisoner came into my shop, about the time of lighting up candles, to buy a small quantity of Irish for shift sleeves. As she was looking on the cloth by the light of the door, I saw something look bulk under her cloaths. I imagined she had took something; for as I looked hard at her I perceived she turned pale. She went out of the shop, I called our maid, and desired her to watch that woman where she went; for I was very suspicious she had took something, but I could not tell what. Just as the maid was going out of the door, I missed the cheque out of the window; I told the maid what she had got, and desired her to go and call her back, which she did. We searched her, and found she had on a remarkable pocket, but nothing of mi ne upon her; then we went to the place where she was standing when my servant went to her to come back, which was in a little alley, not a stone's cast from my house; we looked over the pales, but could not see the cheque.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor; I saw the prisoner in our shop, and after she was gone my mistress desired me to go and call her back, saying she miss'd a piece of cheque from out of the window. She was in an alley in Newin-yard, standing sloping as though she was buckling her shoe near the pales; I told her my mistress wanted to speak with her. Then I turned my back towards her, and she followed me directly.</p>

            . My pales come into this alley; I heard something about this time come over them, and heard it rustle like paper in the fall. I went into the garden, and found this piece of cheque withinside my pales. From out of this alley<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175002280019"></xptr> I took it up, and brought it into my house; and as I sat, I heard a talking in the alley, and somebody say, has not she throw'd it over the pales? I opened my back door, and there was Mr. Chamberlain and the Constable in search after something. I asked what they wanted, they said a piece a fine cheque ; I said I had found it; it lay near the place where the servant said the prisoner was standing doing something to her shoe.</p>

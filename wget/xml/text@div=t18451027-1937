                  </hi>. I am clerk to Harvey and Co., of the Grand Junction Wharf, Whitefriars. On the 22nd of May I delivered the prisoner a check for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I now produce, on account of William Keep—my employers had an order from a person named Bryant, a timber mer<lb></lb>chant, to pay the amount to Keep—I knew the prisoner, as he had landed goods before at our wharf—he was captain of Keep's barges—I delivered him the check first, and then changed it for him, as he wanted change—I gave him, I believe, sixteen sovereigns, and the rest in silver.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had four sovereigns first. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I gave him four sove<lb></lb>reigns the day before I gave him the check, but gave him the check to have his name for the amount on the back of it, as a receipt for the amount of freight—I changed it, and deducted what I had paid him—I paid him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., instead of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant, and live at Reading. The prisoner was in my employ last May, and had the management of the canal boats as captain—he was in the habit of receiving money for me, by my authority, which he was to account for as soon as he returned home—he never returned after this occurred—I never received the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he never accounted to me for any of the money—he was apprehended last Thursday.</p>

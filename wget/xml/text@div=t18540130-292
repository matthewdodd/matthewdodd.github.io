                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>, 366 <hi rend="italic">N</hi>). On the morning of 24th Jan., I had information of a robbery at Mr. De Berranger's, Old Park-farm, Enfield; in consequence of which I went on the road between Tottenham and Kingsland, the main road, not the Green-lanes—about 8 1/2 o'clock in the morning, I saw a pony and cart in the Kingsland-road, near the Alms-houses; "George Hart, dealer, Edmonton," was on the cart—a man named Joshua Staker was with it—it was going in the direction of London—Miles, another constable, was with me—we followed it down to Mr. Campbell's 200 or 300 yards; he is a marine store dealer—I know the Queen's-head, in the Green-lanes; it is in Tottenham parish, about five miles from where I first saw the cart—that would not be an unusual place for the cart to be in, going from Enfield to London; if you go by the Green-lanes you would pass it—there are two ways—the driver got out at the marine store shop, and stood on the pavement some few minutes—the two prisoners came out of Campbell's shop, and entered into conver<lb></lb>sation with the driver for some few minutes—I then lost sight of the driver, and did not see which way he went, but Clinker took hold of the pony by the head, and moved him from the gutter, where he was drawn up, into the middle of the road—we stopped at Mr. Campbell's, and Miles spoke to him—the prisoners were not there—we followed the cart, and saw it stop at the White Hart; they both went into the house, and before we got to the door Clinker came out, and Miles took him into custody—I went into the house, and apprehended Pinnuck—we searched the cart, and found these two coppers and this lead, with some sacks covered over them, and a quantity of hay sprinkled over—I know the lead by this mark, something like an arrow, which I put on it twelve months ago, when there were a great many robberies—the coppers were fixed to the building, and the lead was placed round them—there is about 170 pounds of lead—I took the coppers back, and they both fitted.</p>

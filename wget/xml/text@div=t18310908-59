            . I live in Kingsland-road. On Sunday, the 24th of July, about one o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to my house with a bundle of clothes, and wished me to lend him 8s. on them - he said he had just received them from his brother, in Bershire; it was a suit of black, and a shirt marked

            - they were tied up in a pocket-handkerchief: as I would not lend any thing on them he offered to sell them for 1l. - he was about half drunk; I put my hand into the coat pocket, and took out the Hymn-book, in which Powell's name was written, and there was a pair of gloves - the prisoner lodged with me, but I did not know he was in Powell's service; I went to Mrs. Powell that afternoon, but she was not at home; I saw her on Monday - he came again on Monday evening, told me he had no money, and gave me the gloves to let him sleep there; he said he had left the clothes at a public-house, and would bring them to me in the morning - my shopman had offered him 15s. for the bundle on Sunday, when I refused to buy them, but he did not buy them; he told me on Tuesday they were at a public-house, and I lent him 8d. to redeem them - I sent for an officer, but he did not come back, and on Wednesday I gave him into custody.</p>

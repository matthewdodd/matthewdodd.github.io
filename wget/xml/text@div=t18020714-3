               <p>PETER PEARSON sworn. - I am nephew of Mrs. Ann Pearson, widow, in Church-lane, Whitechapel: on Tuesday the 21st of June, about five o'clock in the afternoon, a quantity of coffee was put into a bag by our men, and put into a cart; I was coming accidentally through <placeName id="t18020714-3-crimeloc16">Thames-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Is the carman here? - A. No, it was my aunt's cart, he only drove the cart for that day, and he is ill; I saw the two prisoners take some coffee out of a cask, and put it into Tyler's hat, they both held the hat; then they went from the cart down to a gateway, into an area, and I saw Tyler put the coffee into Lucas's shirt; then they came up to the cart again, and I went up to them, and told them to go away; they both laid hold of my arm, and told me to say nothing; I told them, if they did not go away, I would have them taken up; I had seen the street-keeper just before that, and I went to him, and he came and took Lucas opposite the cart; I then went to the cart again, and saw Tyler taking another hat-full of coffee; he imme<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180207140005"></xptr>diately ran away with it, he was taken up about five or six days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure these are the two men? - A. I am sure of it; I know them both well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lucas. Q. Did you not take a guinea from another man you caught stealing coffee? - A. No, I did not; I caught a man before, and was offered a guinea to let him go, and I would not take it.</p>

               <p>ROBERT WRIGHT sworn. - I am one of the gangsmen on Brewer's-quay; I landed part of a cargo; this bag, when it was put into the cart, weighed one hundred and a half; I weighed it after wards, and it weighed only one hundred and a quarter, and ten pounds; there was a deficiency of eight pounds.</p>

            . I and Coleman were desired by Rayner to watch in this house, on the 1st of December; and about half-past eight o'clock at night, there was a ring at the bell and a knock at the door, which we did not answer, and in about ten minutes there was a violent ringing and knocking; I then left the dining-room, and stood by the street door, with the poker in my hand; I had not been there more than a minute, when the door opened, and the prisoner put one foot over the sill of the door; I seized him by the collar, and he said, "What are you going to do with me?" or words to that effect - he tried to make his escape, and pulled me into the street, as far as the curb - he got from my grasp twice, but I secured him in the carriage-way, by the help of Coleman - I could not see whether any body else was outside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not tell you he was going to give information that he had seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060118"></xptr>three men trying to get in? A. I believe he did - he did tell me so - he was searched in my presence; nothing suspicious was found on him except a knife.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he say when you seized him? - A."What are you going to do with me?" he said nothing about giving information, till I gave him in charge of the watchman; and then he said he saw three persons trying to break in, and saw one get over the area - he said there was a key left in the door. I saw no trace of any body else - he did not throw the door wide open, only just to get in; the first ringing was about half-past eight o'clock, and the other about ten minutes after.</p>

            . I was desired to keep watch. I went with Irish, and waited in the dining-room; I heard a ringing and knocking at the door about a quarter or twenty minutes past eight o'clock, and shortly afterwards we heard some one in the area; we sat still, and in about ten minutes there came a severe ringing again; we still kept sitting, and Irish said "There is a key going into the door;" he arose and went to the door - I followed him; I saw the door open, and the prisoner's right foot come into the hall; Irish seized him, and they had a scuffle - he dropped the poker: I took it up, and flourished it over the prisoner's head, who was scuffling with Irish in the road; I told him to make no more resistance, and he was given into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You think there had been a noise in the area after the first ringing? A. Yes; I did not hear the prisoner say there was some people trying the house.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I assisted in taking the prisoner, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock; I went up and saw the scuffle; Irish said."Here is a prisoner for you." I asked what he had been doing; he said he had got into the house - the prisoner did not say any thing - he gave no reason for being there; he asked where we were going to take him; we said to the watch-house; and, when in the watch-house, he said he was watching three men, who were trying to break into the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And did he not say one of those men got into the area? A. I believe he did; he said he saw the key shining in the door - nothing but a large knife was found on him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had the bell rang before the key was heard in the door? A. It was not more than a minute after the last ring - I think it was half a minute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen, I beg your attention to the following statement: - I am a painter by trade, and found it very prejudicial to me, and I found I must get another employ; I then opened a shed in the coal and green-grocery line, which my wife is carrying on. On the night in question, I had occasion to go to Oxford-street to purchase some coals; I went to Lower Berkeley-street, and saw two men, whom I knew well, on the steps of the door; I passed on, and they came down and passed me, and met a third person coming towards me, and I heard the two men say to the third, that it would be of no use, they could not get the door open; I went on to the corner of the street, and stood there eight or ten minutes; that might be twenty minutes after eight o'clock; the men came to the corner, went back, and walked the street two or three times; one of them got over the area-gate, and went down the kitchen steps; he came up in a minute, and I should not then have had time to get to the house; a woman came past, and asked what I was waiting for - I said, "Watching three men;" she said she saw, while she was there, a man come out of the area, and that she was going by them, and hoped they would not touch her; we walked by them, and she, as well as I, saw two of their faces, and could swear to them; we walked on to the corner of the square - she said her husband was in the country, and had a six months' job, and she was going down to him, which is the reason I cannot bring her - if I could have got bail I could have gone to the shop her husband works for, and heard where she was - the persons then came from the door and walked entirely away - I watched a few minutes, and then the watchman came up - I waited still, and found they did not return - I then went on to Duke-street, met the three men coming round again, and going towards the house - I followed them, and when they got to the house, two of them ran up the steps - they had not been up three minutes before they came down, walked a few steps, and then ran off - I crossed and rang the bell to tell what I had seen - I then saw the handle of a bright key in the door - I ran up the steps, rang the bell hard, and put my hand on the key - whether I opened it or not I do not know, but I found the door going from me - whether it was open, or I was the occasion of opening it, I do not know, but I thought the persons inside might have pulled the lock back; but I appeal to that Judge, who alone can judge the heart, that my foot was not in the house - the witnesses rushed out - one had a poker - there were repeated blows levelled at me - they broke my hat, and the poker fell - I then told Irish it was of no use, and to desist - the watchman was called, and I given in charge, and at the office made the same defence I have now, and said I had a friend who would give bail for 200l. or 300l. - that I knew the two men, and could leave their description there, and if an officer was granted me, I could find them - the Magistrate said he thought it a fit case to go before a Jury, but if I had friends who would do what I had said, surely they would come forward on my trial, and prove my innocence - I said if I had bail I could produce the woman who knew the two men - I afterwards sent the officer to ask the Magistrate, to grant me bail, which was denied me.</p>
               <p>ROBERT IRISH re-examined. He did state that he knew the men by sight; he did not give any description of them, or state their names.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When did he tell you he was watching the men? A. After I gave him into the watchman's hands - I did not assist in opening the door - he opened it himself, I can swear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Directly the door was open about eight inches, I felt it suddenly pulled away from me - I had no time to speak to him - I showed no resistance, but to protect myself from his attack - the house had been attempted three Saturdays before; I could have proved I was at home on those occasions.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

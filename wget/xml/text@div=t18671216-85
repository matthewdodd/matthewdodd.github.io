                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman of 2, Pelham Street, Brick Lane—a month last Saturday, about twelve o'clock at night, I was in Black Eagle Street, and went to a wheel for a necessary purpose—Jessop came beside me and appeared to be engaged in the same thing—as I was turning to come past he put his right hand round my neck, I pulled him down with me, and then Broome came up and took my watch and chain from me, and two shirts and a handkerchief which were in a parcel under my arm—they ran away and I ran after them, I picked up this cap (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and they picked up my hat—I called "Stop thief!" but there was. no one in the street beside them—Cooper 121 <hi rend="italic">H</hi> brought them to mo and I found my hat on Broome's head—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I am certain of it—here is a paper inside it which I put in—they have taken the band off—I said that he had got my hat on—my property was worth about 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

The prosecutor came to the station, and I went out and found the prisoners about 100 yards off, and 150 yards from where the robbery was committed, holding an altercation respecting the division of some money—I could not hear what they said or that they mentioned money, but they had got it in their hands—as I took them to the station, Skeggs said, "They are the two," and he identified his hat on Broome's head—Broome said that he picked it up in Shoreditch.</p>

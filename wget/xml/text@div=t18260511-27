The notes were numbered 89,401 to 90,400; I did not take a memorandum of it, but recollect it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. You gave them to Hilton at your banking-house? A. Yes. I put the same notes into the parcel as I received at the Bank. I remember the first note was 89,401; several clerks were in the office when I delivered him the parcel, but no strangers; I should not deliver it to him publicly.</p>

               <p>THOMAS HILTON. I am guard of the Express coach,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110018"></xptr>from London to York. On the 28th of January I received from Mr. Hand a parcel, in the country office at Sir Richard Carr Glynn's; I took charge of it on my own responsibility, independent of the concern; I took it to my lodging in Giltspur-street, and gave it to Mr. French, to take care of while I went to bed. I started from the Saracen's Head, Snow-hill, with the coach, a little before seven o'clock in the morning; I received the parcel from French overnight, put it into a basket, and took it to the Saracen's Head in the morning, and put it into the coach-office, in the book-keeper's charge; I received it back when I loaded the coach, put my hand in, and took the parcel out - I locked it up in the hind boot, and put the key into my pocket. I had occasion to open the hind boot at Ferry-bridge, and immediately saw that the basket had been moved, and the parcel was gone; the bag which had contained it was left, but the parcel gone. We had four outside passengers; and inside was a lady and gentleman, a little girl, and another person. I knew one of the outside passengers particularly; I did not know his name, but his features - that was not the prisoner; three of the four got up at the Saracen's Head, and the other at the Peacock, at Islington - three of them left the coach before I got to Ferry-bridge - the fourth remained - he went to Catterick, about forty miles beyond York; it was Mr. Strappins, a school-master; the one whose features I knew, went off with the other two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where do you think the parcel was stolen? A. I cannot tell - I do not know which was the best place to rob it; we dined at Biggleswade; I left the coach there for a quarter of an hour, but I could see the coach through the window - I only had three passengers behind; I did not leave the coach after dinner. I have carried parcels for Sir Richard Carr Glynn for ten years, and always put them into that place, unless they were small enough to go into my pocket. French gave me the parcel between ten and eleven o'clock, when I went to bed - I did not lock my door; another guard, named Gamble, slept in the same room - he belongs to the Leeds Rockingham coach - I put the parcel at my bed side - he might know it was there, but did not know what was in it. I set it down in the office under where Mountain, the book-keeper, writes, and took it up from the same place in about half an hour; the boot has a common padlock. When I am on my seat my feet are on the flap of the boot - it might have been taken while I was changing horses. When I got seventeen miles from town I left my seat, and sat on the box with the coachman, as I very often do; I rode about forty miles on the box. I looked at the boot at Ferry-bridge, and the lock was safe - it must have been opened by a false key. The clerk told me how many notes it contained; three of the passengers sat on my seat - the first of them got down at Wansford, near Stamford, and the other two at Stamford; one of them got up at the Peacock; he rode in front seventeen miles, then went and sat with them. I looked at the boot, and the lock was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear the prisoner was on the coach that night? A. I could not tell; they were wrapped up in cloaks; I will not swear he was not there; I never swore he was not; I said I could not recollect him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sworn you did not believe that man was one of your outside passengers that night? A. I do not know that he was, or was not. I said I had never seen him before in my life that I knew of. I went on to York after missing the parcel; I told the coachman of the loss about a quarter of a mile on the other side of Ferry-bridge. York is twenty-two miles from Ferry-bridge; every body was a bed at Ferry-bridge, except the hostlers; I went to Sharp's Bank, and told them; I returned to town on my journey, and gave Messrs. Glynn's notice; Sharps had sent them word about it. I have not been called upon to make the loss good.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. Have you always said you could not say whether he was on the coach or not? A. I have. The parties were wrapped up in cloaks and travelling coats, and their persons very little exposed to view. I returned from York two days afterwards.</p>

Bank note (looking at it, No. 90,155 dated December 26, 1825) from the prisoner; he had a glass of liquor, which came to less than 6d.; I applied to one of my young women to write his name on it; he said, "No, give me the pen and ink - I will put it on myself," and he wrote the name of Long, Holborn-bars, March 25, which is now on it - I gave him the change.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was a stranger? A. Yes. I never recollect having an address of that kind before; I am quite sure he is the man; I think it was in the after part of the day; a message was left at my house some weeks ago, and I saw Ellis about it; and told him, when I saw the prisoner, that he was the man. I told Ellis he was a very singular character, and I thought I should know him again, and said he was a short man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, "It is impossible for me to take on myself to say I should recollect the man?" A. I might say so. I now swear positively to him; I saw him at Bow-street, in a large room, with about twenty, and pointed him out myself, at once - Ellis took me into the room to find the man out - I think he had his hat on.</p>

I was examined at Bow-street - it was a month or two before that (looking at two, Nos. 90,307, 90,309, dated December 26, 1825); I took both these from him, and have written on them both, by his direction "10l, Goswell-street," but no name or date. I believe he told me at the time that he was a pawnbroker, but seeing him a few times afterwards, he said he was a broker.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You received a 10l. note from him once? A. Yes; I have known him four or five months; I took these 1l. notes of him, one or probably two months before I went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. How long was it before you were examined? A. Perhaps a month - I have received several 1l. notes from him, but only marked these two.</p>

            . I am a hosier, and live in Oxford-street. I received from the prisoner these two 1l. notes, about the 4th of April (Nos. 90,324, and 90,325, dated the 26th of December, 1825); I wrote my initials on them when I paid them away - he did not write on them in my presence, but I know I took them from him, for I took them myself - he bought one pair of stockings, and I gave him change for one note - he asked if I could change another - I said I did not think I could - he said "I will take another pair of stockings if you can;" I did so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not write on them till you paid them away? A. No; I paid them away the day I received them - I am sure he paid me these notes.</p>
               <p>SMITH re-examined. One of these notes has "Robinson, Old-street, St. Luke's," on it - I have no doubt of its being in the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>

            . I am bar-maid at the Edinburgh Castle, public-house, Strand. I have repeatedly seen the prisoner at the house. I took this 1l. note of him (No. 90,153, dated December 26,1825) - I cannot speak to the date, but I saw Mrs. Heeman write the name and direction on it, from her knowledge of the prisoner - we knew him by the name of Reed, No. 30, Panton-street, Haymarket, which is written on it with her initials - I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you always see your mistress write on notes? A. I do not like to change without her leave; I gave it to her, and asked if she would change it- she said Yes, and inquired his name; I said "Why, it is Mr. Reed;" she said "I beg your pardon, Sir, I had forgotten you;" this was about two months ago, I think - it was five or six weeks before I was examined - he was in the habit of changing notes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BOUQUET re-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. I have been in the Bank some years. I do not know the amount of notes issued in a year - notes are issued of the same numbers, but not the same date and number - there have been no ones issued for the last five years, till the latter end of last year; I never knew before this of 1l. notes being issued with higher numbers than 80,000, but I will not swear that; I am in the habit of examining and posting them daily, and never knew one of a higher number till this last issue.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Would notes issued in 1823 be dated 1825? A. Certainly not - there never were duplicates of any notes.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 5th of April I apprehended the prisoner at the Rose and Crown public-house, Bunbill-row; I told him I took him for passing some notes which had been stolen; he said he had never passed any bad notes; I asked his name and address; he said Henry Lloyd, Golden-lane, Arthur-street - I went and found he did lodge there. On the 6th of April I took him from the watch-house - he asked me who was coming up against him - I shewed him a bit of paper, with the name of Vickress and Smith on it - he made no observation - I asked if he had any account to give of the notes he had paid them - he said Yes, he found them about two months before in Goswell-street; he could not recollect how many he found; there might be between thirty and forty - he did not know the number - that he found them wrapped in a piece of brown paper.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner twelve months last March, and co-habited with him, but am not his wife - we lodged at No. 2, Nag's-head-court, Golden-lane; we lived in Arthur-street when he was taken up; he came home ill on the 23d of January, and was confined on the 23d and 24th with a violent cold in his loins, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110020"></xptr>had a swelling on his hip, which was obliged to be plastered; he kept to the house for sixteen or seventeen days, and was not out of it; he was at home and in bed on the 29th of January - he was not out till the 8th or 9th of February, because the 9th of February was my birth-day, and I know it.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Did you know him long before you lived with him? A. No; I never heard where he came from - he was a very close man and never told me; I had no notion where he came from; I first met him at a young woman's, whom I knew, at No. 2, Play-house-yard - that was twelve months ago last March; we lived together about two months after that, and have continued so ever since; he never told me he came from abroad, nor did I ever hear him tell any one else so, I swear that; I can read but not write.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was taken ill had he a doctor? A. I went to a doctor in Whitecross-street - he did not attend him for we were too poor to pay him; I did not know he was charged with doing any thing on the 29th of January, till he was taken up; I know the day he was taken ill was on a Tuesday; I have no almanack; I know it because he was so bad, and there was no money in the house, we began the new year so bad, - we were all laid up in a fever in the court, the week before, and one died.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What reason have you to say it was January more than February? A. Because of the new year coming in, and we were so badly off, and we were all getting well, and the 9th of February was my birth-day - I have no other reason for remembering it - I fetched a woman to attend on him - she came on Tuesday, the 24th, and staid about a fortnight - her name is Ann Ray.</p>
               <p>Q. How does the prisoner get his livelihood? A. He told me he went out writing and portering; he was never away from me a night; I did not attend at the office to give this account - I was too ill.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Was he a good deal from home in the course of the day? A. A few hours, but never at night; my birth-day was on the 9th of February, and for sixteen or seventeen days before that he was at home ill. We have only the ground floor room; there is only one room; Mrs. Racket lived in the room over us; we were very friendly; she came at times to ask how he was; all the people in the court used to inquire for him, and come to see him; there are only two houses in the court; none of his relations came there, but my sisters and brothers did; one of them lives in Benwell-street, Clerkenwell; my brothers sent us money, and my sisters came to see him; I went to Dr. Reeves about him; he said it was a cold, and gave me some stuff and pills.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Star-court, Barbican. I went to nurse Mr. Lloyd on Tuesday, the 24th of January; he lived in the bottom room; there is only one room on a floor; I did not sleep there, but was not home till twelve o'clock at night, and went at ten in the morning, every day for about a fortnight; he was not absent one day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of any birthday? A. No, but the new year came in very bad with them; I poulticed his wound and attended to him; I have never been paid for it, for they were in so much distress they could hardly afford a cup of tea. Colvin had got out of a fever a week before.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. When did you first hear of his being taken upon a charge of robbery? A. I never heard of it; she said he was put into prison but I never heard what for till this evening; I came here last night but I did not know what for; she called on me last week to tell me to come to say I was attending him.</p>

               <p>Q. And that you began to attend him on the 24th of January? A. No, I knew that; she has mentioned the date to me; I cannot say how long since it was that she came to fetch me; I saw her three or four times about it; we have not talked over what I was to say - I was not going to tell her what I had to say, nor had I any notion of what she was to say; I said I could swear to the time I was nursing him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what makes you certain it was the 24th of January? A. Why the new year coming in - it was just before the new year came in.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Was it before Christmas or after? A. After; Colvin asked me to come to say the time I was nursing him; I recollected that it was the 24th of January myself; I would not take a false oath for an apron full of gold; I have known Lloyd five or six years, and all her friends.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know Mrs. Lloyd's sisters? A. Yes; they came to see him, and I used to go to them for money; the lodgers used to ask how he was.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you remember that it was the 24th; there are other Tuesdays in January? A. I cannot say, but I nursed her in the fever, and she had only got well a week - I can give no other reason - I do not know when she was taken ill, or when she got well, but she had got out a week when he was taken ill; I thought it was the 24th - I cannot say it was not the 17th.</p>

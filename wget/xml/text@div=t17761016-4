I drove off to a public house; I was not much afraid of him; I told the people at the house what had happened; the master of the public house and another man or two went out, and in about ten minutes they brought the prisoner to the public house; I was certain as to his identity immediately; I am certain to his person; it was not dark when he stopped me, it was only dusk.</p>

            . I live in Hatfield-street, and am a shoemaker. On the 24th of January, about half-past one o'clock, I saw the two prisoners following Mr. Keates - Wells put his hand once or twice into his pocket; Mr. Keates then stopped at the corner of a gateway, and Johnson came up, took his handkerchief, and put it into his own breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Are you not an amateur thief taker? A No - I was not here last Session; I had two cases the Session before last, and I have two more this - I do not think that I have had twenty in the last twelve months; I do not recollect whether I was in the case of Warren - I was not charged with making a mistake in any indictment, that the prisoner might escape, in order that I might get money; I never was in any other Court but this - I do not come for the sake of money - I was going home at the time; I saw this take place in <placeName id="t18320216-82-crimeloc455">Aldersgate-street</placeName>

            . I am an officer. I was assisting to take a person to the hospital - Tool told me that the two prisoners had robbed a gentleman of his handkerchief; as soon as I could leave the person I was with, I took hold of the prisoners, and Tool took this handkerchief from Johnson's left-hand pocket - Johnson said he had picked it up.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I met the prisoner in Drury-lane, about seven o'clock in the evening of the 22nd of May - I followed him to Brydges-street, and when I came up to him, I saw a carpenter's plane projecting from his trousers pocket; he said he was going to take it to his father - I felt his other pockets, and found this other property, which I here produce: this saw was concealed under his waistcoat.</p>

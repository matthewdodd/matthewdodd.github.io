                  </hi>. On 23d Dec. I was in the parlour of the Nelson public-house, Trafalgar-road, Greenwich—Carey came in, went to the fire, lighted his pipe, and stood before the fire, which he ought not to have done—he stood there for some time, and I said, "That don't look altogether English fashion for you to stand before the fire in that way; it is a cold night, and there is a good deal of company in the room that want to see the fire if they don't feel it"—nothing more patted between us—he Went out,</p>

               <p>returned in a short time, leaving the door open, went to the fire, lighted his pipe, and stood before the fire again, in the same position as before—he stood there for some time and I said, "This is the second time you have done the like; you ought to have sat down when you were told the first time"—he said he was not going to stop a minute—he went out a second time and returned with Johnson and another whom I do not know—Carey went before the fire again, and stood in the same way—a man on the other side of the room said to him, "Why don't you sit down; you have been told to do it a second time"—Johnson, who stood by the door, replied, "No, if I was him, I would not sit down"—Carey then made use of tome very bad expressions, and said that he would not sit down, and nobody in the room should make him—he then walked from the fire to me—I got up to go out—he seized me by the jacket-collar, and I instantly found blood flowing from my head, in conse<lb></lb>quence of a blow I received, but I do not know from whom—William and Richard Rivers and his wife got up to go—Carey laid hold of William Rivers, and Johnson struck him with a quart pot, twice, I believe, and knocked him down senseless under the table—Richard Rivers and his wife both received several blows from Carey.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Foster-street, Half Moon-street. I have known the prisoner two years—I have been cohabiting with him about eight months—he left me on Thursday, 6th March, and on 8th March I met him in the street—he said he had had no breakfast, and the person he was with had taken his jacket, and gone away—I took my shawl to a leaving shop, and I was with him till 10 o'clock at night—he wanted me to give him his supper—I said I was not prepared to give it him—he was dreadful angry—I called him a murderer, and struck him—he struck me—I called him a murderer because we were quarrelling about a penny pie—he struck me with his hand—I was on the stairs—he said, "Come in," and he took me and struck me, and kicked me, I believe—I became insen<lb></lb>sible, and was taken to the Hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I left you in a public house, and I went to get a jacket, and when I came back you were in company with a man and woman; he called for half a pint of gin, and we both partook of it till it was gone; we went to get a pie; you gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get it, and when I came out you would not believe that I gave 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it; you <hi rend="italic">blowed me up</hi>in the street, and tore the collar of my shirt. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I have no recollection of doing that; he brought the pie out, and gave it to me; I struck him in the room; I had a glass of gin, and the prisoner had several drops; I have no recollection of falling over a box; I might have done so.</p>

                  </hi>. I did live at No. 11, Foster-street, with the last witness—I remember the time she was hurt—I came home about 9 o'clock that evening—Mrs. Brooks and the prisoner were on the landing of the stairs—Mrs. Brooks ran down stairs—I went back with her into the room—I I sat down, and had my tea—there was something wanting—I had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket—I pulled the box out of my pocket—I had just got it out, and this man took the box, and took the lid off—I do not know whether he gave it to Mrs. Brooks—she then sent me for a penny candle—she then said to him, "Why don't you give the boy his money?"—he said, "What is that to you?" and he took her up, and threw her down on the floor, and hit her three times with his fist, and kicked her three times with his shoe while she was down—he kicked her three times in the ribs—he then put on his hat, and ran down stairs—when he threw her down, she did not fall on a box, but on the floor—she fainted—I ran down to fetch a policeman, but I saw the other boy had got one, and he came up stairs—when the prisoner hit her, Mrs. Brooks said, "If you hit me again, this shall be the last time."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 672). I was on duty in Foster-street—I went to the third floor of No. 11—I saw Mrs. Brooks lying on her back on the floor, a large pool of blood was under her head, and blood was running from her mouth and nose—I sent for a doctor, and removed her to the hospital—I took the prisoner into custody, and told him it was for assault<lb></lb>ing a woman at No. 11, Foster-street—he told me he did strike her in the face, but he did not think it was serious.</p>

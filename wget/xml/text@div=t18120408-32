               <p>Q. It was after you had written the will - A. Yes, I was sent to a public-house near Doctor's Commons to meet Dempsey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Dempsey - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that public-house the public-house where Dempsey afterwards was apprehended - A. I do not know where he was apprehended; that public-house was up by St. Paul's near to Doctor's Commons.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Is this your first appearance as a witness in court - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Or upon any case of any kind, or any charge, or any thing else, no matter how often you might have deserved it, but this is the first time you have been here - A. Yes, or any other court.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life are you in - A. I used to work on board a ship when I can get it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been speaking of a transaction transacted not in the country of Middlesex, but in the county of Kent - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This forgery, if it is a forgery, was a forging at Deptford - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said Daley, the man at the bar, called you out of the public-room into the private-room - A. Yes, he called me to the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to persist in that account now - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Your memory has been hurt by being in prison, do you mean to say that it was the prisoner called you out - A. He called me from the tap-room to the bar; Daley was the first man that called me.</p>
               <p>Q. How often were you examined at the Thames police upon the subject of forgery - A. I was down five or six times.</p>
               <p>Q. Often enough to correct yourself if you at first said what was wrong - A. I do not recollect I heard a word wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you imagine that I think you would tell a story. I ask you where not you examined five or six times - A. I was not examined there at no examinations.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did you from first to last before the magistrate say that Dempsey was the person that addressed you and asked you to do the job for him - A. No. Daley was the first that applied and called me to the bar; they both spoke to me at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you come to both - A. I spoke of it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I am to take it from you now that they both called you to the bar - A. Daley spoke to me first, and then they both asked me about this will.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say at the magistrate's that Dempsey was the man that called you - A. I recollect that I said it was Daley that called me to the bar at the first examination, the second examination it was mentioned Dempsey called me to the bar, but Daley was the man that called me to the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I am to understand you, am I, the magistrate first took down Dempsey called you and you afterwards said it was not right - A. I told him in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether you were accurate or the clerk depends upon you - A. I was correct in what I said,

             was the man I said first.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men were in the tap-room or in the private room where you executed the will - A. There was nobody in the room but Dempsey and me, Daley came backwards and forwards, except any children came in I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had three guineas or five guineas promised you but you never had any thing - A. One proposed three guineas, and the other five, but I never got a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. I see the will was dated in May 1809 - A. Yes, three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not know any thing of the supposed testator Rhodes - A. No, I did not at the same time; I was drawn into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known any thing of him since - A. I have heard of him.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you were not much pleased that these men did not keep their promise of giving you the three guineas or the five guineas - A. I never asked for it, nor never required it; I never looked for it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were quite satisfied in your mind about it - A. I was very uneasy in my mind when I heard about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a catholic or a protestant - A. A protestant.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you do not confess to the priest you went and confessed to the magistrate what you had done to take the burthen off your mind - A. After I was taken I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as soon as you were taken it was then your mind began to be uneasy and not before - A. I was uneasy before.</p>
               <p>Q. So I should have thought then as you were uneasy before I take it for granted the first day you were in custody you told the magistrate - A. I was not examined that night; I was locked up that night, it was the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. But the officer took you, and you had an opportunity of telling him, but you did not - A. No, not till I was before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you, so far from telling it did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080026"></xptr> you deny the fact untill it was after you were promised to be a witness, and for to screen yourself you told it - A. I said it was a fair will to be sure at first, I did untill I was admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Why as your mind was uneasy did not you think you should go out of your senses you first said it was a fair will, after that, when they promised to admit you a King's evidence then you said it was a false will - A. Then I told the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of poor Dempsey, your friend - A. He was never no friend of mine; I cannot tell what is become of him now.</p>
               <p>Q. When you made this declaration it was in November last was it not - A. In November.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known him - A. Some years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any application to you in the autumn of last year respecting a seaman of the name of Rhodes - A. He first applied to me at the latter end of August last to enter a caveat respecting the goods of

            , lately belonging to the ship Perseverance.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the object of that caveat - A. I do not recollect he mentioned it then, at a further time I understood the man was indebted to him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what character then did he claim to enter the caveat - A. I do not know; he entered the caveat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you upon what ground - A. It was his wish to enter a caveat; at a future time it was mentioned by him that Rhodes was indebted to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you for what - A. I do not recollect nor the amount. The object was I suppose to prevent any other person having letters of administration, to prevent any other person proving a will, or taking out letters of administration.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect how many interviews you had with him before any relations of Rhodes made any application to you - A. Only one, I believe, or two, I cannot be sure, I think it was but one.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did you enter the caveat - A. I entered the caveat on the 17th or 20th day of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Now down to the time of your entering a caveat or to the time of the deceased's relations coming to you had he mentioned to you that he had any will of Rhodes's - A. No, not previous to the applications of Rhodes's friends.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you had entered the caveat was it that the first application was made to you by some of the relations to Rhodes - A. Some few days.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of their application did you send to Daley - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you - A. Yes, he did; I told him that the person who said she was Rhodes's mother had applied respecting the caveat that he had entered; to which he answered and said it was very wrong, there was no lawful mother living.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him the particulars of the debt which was due from Rhodes - A. No, he said there was no lawful mother living, that he doubted; he had a will, that he would have his papers searched when he went home, and if he had one he would send it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now had he ever till that moment mentioned that he had any will, or talked of any will - A. Never till that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards was the will brought to you - A. In the course of two or three days to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney to Williams. Stand forward.</p>
               <p>Q. to Nicolls. Was that the man by whom the will was brought - A. I cannot positively say, I believe it might be the man, but I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you do you believe it was or was not - A. I believe it might be, but I am not sure; it might be another man somewhat like him, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, do you believe or not believe that he is the man, you know what you believe - A. I believe it might be, and I believe it might not.</p>
               <p>Q. I shall not be put off in that way, you have seen him before now. Do you believe, or do you not believe that he was the man - A. He might be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not talk of might - A. It might be the man. I cannot speak positively.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not ask you to speak positively, I ask you what you believe - A. I cannot say to further than what I have said.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe or not believe that he is the man - A. I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. I did not ask you whether you was certain, I ask you what you believe, look again - A. I believe it was the man, but I cannot speak positively to it.</p>
               <p>Q. After the will was brought to you how long did it remain in your office before you proved it - A. It might be a month; I think it was the 7th of October the will was proved.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your pocket-book here - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were told to bring it with you, I told you at the office. You think it remained about a month with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had it in your possession did Rhodes' relations apply to you again - A. Yes, they called and looked at the will.</p>
               <p>Q. While that will was laying in your office how many times did Daley call upon you - A. Two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you told him what the relations of Rhodes said about the will - A. I told him they had inspected the will, and said they would call again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what they said respecting the genuineness of the will - A. I told him they had looked at it and said they had some doubt it, that they would call again in a few days.</p>

               <p>Q. How many times did you tell Daley that they had called about it - A. I do not know that I told him more than once.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that it was proved on or about the 7th of October - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080027"></xptr> Q. How many offices are there in Doctors Commons in which wills can be proved describe them - A. There are three.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the principal office - A. The Prerogative office, that is the principal; two other offices belonging to the Bishop of London, one called the Consistory; and the Commissary.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is the principal - A. I believe there is done at the Consistory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you prove this in the Prerogative office - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not - A. We usually prove wills at the Bishop of London's office, or at the Commissary or the Consistory.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you proved this in the Commissary did you know that you could not prove it at the Prerogative office - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the Consistory and find a caveat there - A. There was a caveat there I was told by the officer, entered by Townly.</p>
               <p>Q. In that office there was a caveat entered by your neighbour - A. Entered by him.</p>
               <p>Q. And then without going to Townly you went and proved it at the Commissary office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar come with you and go to that office to prove it - A. No, he did not. I accompanied him before the surrogate.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he sworn before the surrogate - A. At his chambers in Doctors Commons.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, sir, did you see him sworn to that will - A. I did, before Dr. Parsons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention to Daley before he was sworn to that, that the relations had entered a caveat at one of the offices - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Nor of course to Dr. Parsons - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What became of the prisoner after he was sworn - A. He went away.</p>
               <p>Q. What, home, and you went to the office - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you obtain the probat - A. Four days after he was sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner get it on that day or soon after you had obtained the probat - A. On the day that the money was obtained, on the 8th.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 2d of October he was sworn - A. Yes, on the 7th the probat was obtained, and on the 8th the prisoner came to town, he met me by appointment in Gracechurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. By his appointment you having the probat in your pocket - A. I had; I accompanied him with it to Mr. Moses's accompting-house for the purpose of receiving the money due upon the will. Moses is the ship agent for the ship Perseverance.</p>
               <p>COURT. You mean the money due to Rhodes - A. Yes, the wages to Rhodes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got there did you produce the probat - A. At Mr. Moses's in his presence, I did; Mr. Moses paid me one hundred and sixteen pounds and a fraction, he paid me in a check, I believe upon his banker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and the prisoner leave Mr. Moses - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave the prisoner - A. At the King's Arms in Leadenhall-street. I went to Robarts and Curtis's banking-house, Lombard-street, with the check; the prisoner requested me to go and get cash for him; I received the money for him at Robarts's, and went back to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the money - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your regular charge for the business that you had done - A.Five pounds for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make out a bill - A. I did not. I put the figures down on a bit of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. You made your charge about five pounds - A. Five pounds; one pound three shillings he owed me before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the debt was six pounds three shillings - A. And ten shillings and sixpence I charged for my trouble going to Mr. Moses, that makes six pounds thirteen shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did he pay you - A. Ten pounds. The probat was left with Mr. Moses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. You are the clerk of Mr. Clarkson - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are now - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you know the prisoner - A. Some years.</p>
               <p>Q. When he first spoke to you respecting the deceased I think it was in last August, and at the time the probat was taken up I think it was in last 
               <persName id="t18120408-32-person324">August. </persName>
            Did not he tell you at the time the deceased was indebted to him - A. I cannot say whether it was at the time, or the time following.</p>
               <p>Q. He desired you to enter a caveat against any will that might be attempted to be proved - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enter a caveat - A. I did, in the three courts; the Prerogative, and in the Bishop of London's two courts, the Consistory and the Commissary.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you upon your oath, it is not very usual in Proctors in your situation in the Commons to enter caveats without desiring to know the reason why - A. It is a case sometimes, not always, it happens now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated to his lordship that when he first made an application to you to enter a caveat for him he did not mention any thing to you of a will - A. I have so stated.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a necessary consequence that a man must have a will in his possession when he enters a caveat - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he might have had a will or might not have had a will for ought you could tell - A. I did not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated to his lordship also notwithstanding you were acquainted with the prisoner 
               <persName id="t18120408-32-person325">Daley</persName>
             the objection made by the relatives of the deceased to the will did you at the time make him acquainted with their objection. Did the prisoner understand from you, or others, the consequence of persisting in it if it was forged - A. I cannot state for that whether I had or no told him the consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, you have stated that the will was a month in the office before a probat was taken out - A. Somewhere thereabouts that was in Mr. Clarkson's office.</p>
               <p>Q. While it was there might not any one who controverted the will have an opportunity of perusing it - A. Yes, if they knew where the will was and applied.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181204080028"></xptr> Q. And pending that time some of the relatives did call - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, I think you said when it was mentioned in Mr. Clarkson's office, something of a doubt was expressed by the relatives of the deceased; Now, sir, is it not a common thing to doubt the genuiness of some of the best of wills that pass through your office.</p>
               <p>COURT. That only goes to the general doubting.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. Q. Now, sir, you have stated that you took out a probat - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner Daley ever in possession of that probat - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. And you got the money at the banker's - A. I did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Williams. Can you fix the time when what you have related passed at Daley's house, all that we got from you before that it was about a fortnight before you were apprehended; can you fix near about when that time was - A. About two months before I was apprehended; I was apprehended on the 7th of November, on or about two months before that.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you for fixing the transaction to be about two months before your apprehension - A. I cannot be positive to the time; I am partly sure it must be before the 1st of October, I was employed to go down to a ship at Gravesend, and on that day to bring her up, and I was nineteen days on board of her. On the 1st of October I went down, it was before I went down to that ship, it was before the 1st of October.</p>

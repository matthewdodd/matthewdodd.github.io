The prisoner came to the shop about four o'clock in the afternoon, on the 7th of March, and asked for some white satin ribbon; I showed her the box, and she bought one yard, at 1 d. she then asked for some bonnet ribbon - I showed her a drawer, but she did not like them; I showed her two other drawers, but she did not buy any - I asked her if she liked any of those in the window; she pointed to one which I took out, but that did not suit her; before I went to the window, I had sorted the drawers on the counter, so that I could miss a piece of ribbon - when I returned from the window, I missed one - I gave her the yard I had first cut off, and told her to walk into the back shop, as we had some new ribbons there; she said, she wanted nothing else - I then got over the counter and stopped her, telling her, I suspected she had taken some ribbon from the drawer; she denied it - a constable was sent for, but she delivered it up from under her shawl.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The Prisoner put in a written Defence; stating, that she took the ribbon to give the shopman to cut her some from it.</p>
               <p>One witness gave her a good character, and engaged to take her into his service.</p>

The prisoner had the moulds in his hand when the officers entered; I only knew Tyrrell by sight - he has searched me before in the street, and might have suspicion of me, but never had a charge against me; I have been an utterer of counterfeit money, and the Mint suspected me, I believe, as Tyrrell stopped and searched me three or four times - I have been twice in custody about counterfeit coin, and went by the name of Pope; the Mint knew I had been convicted - I told the officers what I had been charged with after I had been admitted an evidence at the office, not before; the prisoner and I were both remanded at first, by request of the Magistrate - I told Mr. Powell all I had seen; I told him I had been in custody for these things, and had gone by different names.

            . I am a constable. I went with Drew and Fowler to No.28, St. Ann-street, Westminster, about a quarter-past three o'clock in the afternoon; Drew went into the yard - Fowler and I went up to the back room second floor, looked through the key-hole, saw the door locked, and the key inside; we knocked, received no answer, and instantly broke open the door - the prisoner was in his shirt sleeves; there was a very large fire in the room - as I entered the room I saw the prisoner rubbing these two moulds together, and they dropped into the chamber-pot, which was by him; they appeared to be wet when he was rubbing them - I jumped over the bed, and found them in the pot; they remained there nearly an hour, till Mr. Powell arrived - I asked what he was doing; he said, "I shall make no answer:" his hands were all over whitening and wet - I asked what was on his hands; he said "Pillacotia;" whether that was in derision I do not know; there is a medicine of that sort, but he said it with a smile - a pipkin was on the fire, nearly full of white metal, in a liquid state; Drew took it off - Bradbury was standing by him, with a pipe in his hand, when we entered - we handcuffed them both, and waited the arrival of Mr. Powell; Fowler found a paper on the shelf, with plaster of Paris - there was a pipe on the shelf, with metal in the bowl; the prisoner's breast was open, and the fire was very large - he had his breeches on, and an apron, with part of the white stuff on it, which he had rubbed off his hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have been acquainted with Bradbury for two years and a half? A. I have known him as the prisoner's companion for two years and more, and his wife about the same time - he gave the name of Bradbury when he was taken; I never heard his name before, though I have stopped him in the street and searched him, considering him a passer of counterfeit coin, but never knew him in custody for it; I heard he was in custody for a highway robbery - I only knew him as an acquaintance of the prisoner's; it was a woman who gave me information of this - she told me to go in the afternoon; I had not seen Bradbury for a month before or more - I cannot say whether I would believe him on his oath or not - a bad character may speak the truth.</p>

            .

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin for the Mint.

A.Precisely so, as far as they go; they appear to be impressed by a genuine half-crown; the metal produced is such as is used to counterfeit coin by this process - and a file is frequently used to file the edges, where the channel of the mould went; the other things produced are such as are used in this process of coining.</p>

I was in the shop at the time; I had been out, and returned home; I was standing at the side of my counter, and Mr. Hone, a neighbour, was standing in the shop with me; seeing the prisoner standing outside, I said, "Walk in, Mr. Henigan." - "Yes, I will," said he; when my neighbour was gone, I said to him, "What is your business with me this morning?" (he had come into the shop) he said, "Special;" he was in the shop, standing at my side, at the exterior side of the counter; and when he said,"Special," I felt myself struck on the side of my cheek - I did not know what it was that struck me; he then said,"That is my business." I put my hand to the side of my face; I found myself very much stunned, and saw like a flash of fire when I was struck; the blood trickled down my cheek; I then went towards the back part of the shop as well as I was able - I found myself in very great agitation; some of my neighbours shortly came in, and two persons took me from the shop into the adjoining parlour, and put me into a chair. Mrs. Taylor, as soon as she could, said, "Fetch assistance for my husband - he must have a doctor directly;" the prisoner was then gone: after I was struck, as soon as I could open my eyes a little, I saw a pistol lying on the floor, in the shop, about two feet from my feet.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from where the prisoner had stood? - A. About the same distance, or rather more, nearer towards the shop door. I have known the prisoner for many years; there had been a variety of disputes between us at different times, about the meaning of the articles of a benefit society, which we both belong to.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened on the last occasion? A. About eighteen months ago, a member, named John Wright, had got the situation of beadle of St. George, Bloomsbury; the prisoner considered he had no right to belong to the society any longer, and I considered he was just as good a member as before, he not having broken the articles; the prisoner brought the question before the club - it was put to the club whether he should continue a member, and decided by a show of hands that he should continue; the prisoner then summoned me to Bow-street, before Mr. Halls; I being president of the club, the prisoner said I ought to exclude him; Mr. Halls decided that. I was right in not excluding him; the prisoner expressed himself strongly dissatisfied with me on that occasion, and in a variety of instances; he brought forward a written protest on one occasion, but he took that away the same night, as the president would not receive it.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 17th of December, about five or ten minutes after eleven o'clock, Mr. Henigan came to the shop; I was at the back of the shop; he either stamped with his foot, or knocked with the umbrella that was in his hand - he was at the door, which was open. I went forward immediately; he asked me if Mr. Taylor was within;" I said, "No, he is not - did you wish to see him?" he said, "Yes; tell him my name is Henigan - I will call again." I said, "Very well, Sir; he will be in, in the course of half an hour." He went away, and in about twenty minutes my husband came in; I was behind the counter when the prisoner came again, which was in about an hour; my husband was at the exterior of the counter, talking to Mr. Hone; I heard my husband say,"Walk in, Sir - walk in, Mr. Henigan;" he said, "Yes, I will," and immediately walked in; he passed my husband, and went a little backward in the shop, towards the window - Hone was then standing in the door way of the shop - he went away in five or ten minutes after Henigan came in; as Hone went out of the shop door, I turned from behind the counter, to go into the parlour, behind the shop, and, as I turned, I heard my husband say, "Well, Henigan, what is your business with me this morning?" I heard no answer from Henigan, but instantly heard the report of a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it very loud? A. Very loud; I turned round, and saw the smoke ascend towards the ceiling - my husband stood with his hands to his face, leaning towards the counter - his side was to the counter, leaning on it; he endeavoured to call out, but could not - he generally calls me mother; he said, "Mo - mo -</p>
               <p>"twice, but could not get the rest out. I was very much frightened, and could not immediately go round the counter, but did as soon as I could; finding my husband could not speak, I ran up to Mr. Henigan (not thinking it was him), and said, "Oh, Sir, what is the matter?" he said, "I have done it - there it is; I came on purpose." I looked down, and saw a pistol lying on the floor, and, in my agitation, I said, "Good God! Sir, what has induced you to do this? What has he done? Why did you do it? Will he die? will he die?" I do not know what his answer was, but I think it was No; in my hurry I picked up the pistol, and went to my husband; I gave the pistol to Mr. Feldwick, who came in.</p>

            . I am a parish constable. I was going by Mr. Taylor's, and was attracted by a crowd at the door; I went in, and found Mr. Taylor had been wounded- the blood was running down his face; I saw the prisoner there in custody of Feldwick, who had gone in before me, and had hold of him; I asked Feldwick what had been done; he said the prisoner had shot Mr. Taylor - he must have heard that; I then asked the prisoner how he came to do it; he said it was an old grudge; that he was willing to go any where with me, but he should answer me no other questions; I did not hear him say any thing more - I believe he said something to Charles Wright, as I was walking behind them, going to Mary-le-bone Office.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not know whether his manner was as usual, or whether it was wild and extravagant? A. As I could judge, the only expression of his countenance was personal sorrow; the prosecutor did not go with me to the office - I saw him there on the Wednesday - it happened on Monday; I only know Taylor as a neighbour - I do not belong to the United Britons.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he said it was for an old grudge? A. I am certain, from the best consideration I have given it, that that expression was from him; I am certain he made me that answer, because I could not have heard it from any one else; I swear I did hear it.</p>

            . I am a constable of Mary-le-bone. On Monday, the 17th of December, I was sent for, and took the prisoner into custody; I found him in custody of two others, in the shop; as I was taking him to the office I looked at him, and asked how he came to do it; I made him neither threat nor promise; he said he should answer the Magistrate when he got there; I asked him no other question then, but when we got nearly to the office, (I had been looking at him for some time, and he asked what I was looking at) - I said it was a pity for a man of his years to do such a thing as that; he said a man that was born to be hung must be hung, and it could not be helped: some further conversation passed, when we got close up to the office - I almost forget what, for I have fallen from a two pair of stairs window since, and forget a good deal that passed; he said there was no ball in the pistol - that he had only fired with wadding and powder; he said he knew he had forfeited his life, but there was no ball in the pistol - he had only fired it with powder and wadding; this was in going to the office: when I got to the office, I found a ball in his waistcoat pocket; I recollect the conversation perfectly well, and swear to it. On searching him I found the visiting-committee book of the club, and a tin case, a comb, a knife, and the bullet, which was tried to the pistol, and fitted exactly; he had an umbrella.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you the bullet here? - A. I was taking something out of my pocket in the other Court this morning, and have unfortunately lost it; but I tried it - it was a perfectly new bullet, and had never been fired - he told Mr. Rawlinson, the Magistrate, that he had had it cast on purpose to shoot Mr. Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that he used that expression? A. That is what he said in the office; I believe it was taken down in writing; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to you to be a man of sound understanding? A. Perfectly so; he was perfectly collected.</p>

            . I lodge at No. 48, Upper Rathbone-place. I am a cobler, and have a stall under Taylor's window. On the 17th of December I heard the report of a pistol; I got out of my stall; went into Taylor's shop, and there saw Mrs. Taylor picking up a pistol from the floor - she gave it to me - I have had it ever since, and produce it- it is a new pistol - I saw Mr. Taylor in the shop, holding the prisoner; the blood was running down his face, and his eye was very black.</p>
               <p>Q. He was holding the prisoner, was he? A. Yes; Mr. Taylor said, "This man has been and tried to blow out my brains" - the prisoner must have heard that; I asked Taylor, who had tried to blow out his brains; he said,"This man," (the prisoner;) I immediately seized and held him till Patten came; Wright afterwards came - he and I took him to Mary-le-bone Office - I saw the tin-case and book found on him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and saw Mr. Taylor about ten minutes after the accident happened; his right cheek was scorched, there was a small portion of the skin grazed, and a slight inflammation of the eye on that side - I suppose that inflammation to have been occasioned by the explosion having taken place so near - there was some little congealed blood on the cheek, and a few grains of powder in the skin, about an inch from the wound, I think.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How often did you attend him? A. Three or four days - it might be a day or two more - it was less than a week - he was then perfectly cured.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the skin have been grazed by the muzzle or cock of the pistol striking against his cheek? A. I should rather think it might be occasioned by that - it was nothing more than a skin wound; I live in Berner-street.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TAYLOR re-examined. No ball was found in my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. In the position in which the prisoner and you stood when the pistol was fired, if there had been a ball, and it missed you, would it have struck on a wall, or gone out of the shop? A. It would have struck on the wall; no search has been made to see if a ball had struck there - no ball has been found, nor has search been made for one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the wall papered, or what, where the ball must have struck? A. There is paper on it - I have not looked for any mark on the paper, but if there had been one no doubt I should have observed it - my wife sweeps the shop - she has never produced any ball or shot to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this paper your hand-writing? A. (Looking at it) A friend wrote it for me - I have signed it; the body of it is not my writing - it was written by my direction, about two hours after the accident.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately had there been any difference between you and the prisoner? A. On the 3d of December - I had not seen him after the 3d - this happened a fortnight afterwards - I continued on the books of the society for a fortnight all but three days, in consequence of this accident.</p>
               <p>The paper produced was here read, as follows:- I, Robert Taylor, being a member of the United Britons' Benefit Society, declare on the funds of the same, being confined from a wound received from Nicholas Henigan, by a pistol, at half-past eleven o'clock. ROBERT TAYLOR.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am accused of having acted with a malicious and felonious intent to disfigure or inflict bodily injury on the prosecutor, Robert Taylor. The malicious and felonious intent I solemnly disclaim: it is this that constitutes, in my humble opinion, the essence of my imputed offence: it is this, Gentlemen, to which I pray your attention: if this intent be not found, which I trust I shall be able completely to disprove, I humbly submit that I shall be entitled to your verdict. That malice or felonious intention I solemnly disclaim, as I hope for mercy at a superior tribunal. I never thought or dreamt of injuring the person of the prosecutor; the slight scratch on his face was purely accidental and unpremeditated, never intended or thought of as a possible occurrence. It must be perfectly clear to you, from the evidence, that no injury was contemplated to his life; and it must, I submit, be equally evident that no serious injury whatever to his person could have been intended. The alarm occasioned to Mrs. Taylor certainly never entered my thoughts either at the moment or before, or after, and I most humbly ask her pardon,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100019"></xptr>and hope that no serious consequences may follow. My only object, in my attack, if it can be so named, on Mr. Taylor, was to afford a lesson to him and to others, how dangerous it might possibley prove, wantonly to trifle and sport with men's characters in such serious matters; much more from malice or revenge of real or supposed injuries, to invent or circulate atrocious calumnies. I see here some gentlemen of the highest respectability, who attend for the purpose of speaking to my character, who have known me, some of them from fifteen to thirty years; and I think I may say, with confidence, that not one of them, from their knowledge of me, could ever have imagined that I ever could be capable of acting as it is said I have now done, from motives of malice or revenge. Those members of the benefit society to which the prosecutor and defendant in this case both have belonged for seventeen years, will also, I have no doubt, in their minds acquit me of such motives. Gentlemen, after calling a few witnesses in explanation of circumstances deducted from the evidences produced against me, and a few others relating to matters, perhaps, of small advantage to me, and hoping your kind attention, I shall leave my case with confidence in your hands.</p>
               <p>Eight witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

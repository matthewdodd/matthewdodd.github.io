Thorpe and Groves in Holborn, and I must answer for them; on Saturday the 10th of June, between two and three in the afternoon, as I was going down the king's high road, I passed the prisoner, she was standing against the pales; I saw no person with her; and as I was coming up from the Red-lion, near Moorfields, she came up to me and drove away my bundle from under my arm by main force; I was in the middle of the road, and she laid hold of my bundle, and swore an oath, and by main strength took it away, and crept under the pales; I strove, but her strength was twice as much as mine; I struggled as much as I could to save my bundle, it was all I had in the world; I cried out for help; there were several people came up, but nobody followed her, till one young man came up; I had seen her before at Bow, but I never had any conversation with her; at night a young man took me to her lodgings, but they were locked up, and as I was looking out of my window in Holborn, I saw the same person that robbed me, on the Monday following with a young man, I ran down stairs and cried out. and at the top of Saffron-hill I got an officer to take her; I begged her to tell me where my property was, she said, if I would put the officer out of the room she would; and the young man that was with her called her bitch, and said, she knew nothing about it, I said, if I could get my property again, I should be very happy.</p>

            . I am headborough of the precinct of St. Catherine's. I met with the woman at the bar near our watch-house, and I saw she had got something. I took her to the watch house, and there I found 26 pounds weight of sugar. We took her before justice Scott, where she said she bought it of a man in trowsers, like a sailor.</p>

            . I am a wharsinger, and had many hogsheads of sugar under the care of Dailey. I paid him a guinea a week. On the Monday morning a servant of mine came and told me a woman had been stop'd by the watchman in St. Catherine's, with some sugar upon her, and that she had sent to my watchman Dailey, who had offered them a guinea to let her go, and that she was at liberty, and my watchman had absconded. The woman used to come to bring him clean linen, so I knew her before. I found her, and she told me the same as has been mentioned, that she bought it of a sailor on Tower-Hill. I went and found that a hogshead of sugar under his care had been plundered, which was of the same sort. On weighing it, I missed forty-five pounds.</p>

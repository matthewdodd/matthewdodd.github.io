            . I am a farmer, and live at Welburn, in Lincolnshire. On the 23d of March, Wilkinson, of Grantham, got me to write a letter for him to Gibson, in town, as he cannot write well - a 10 l. Bank post-bill was inclosed in the letter. I took an account of it before I inclosed it - Wilkinson has the memorandum - (looking at it) - this is it - it was No. 914. dated the 19th of September, 1823, and I made a private mark on the bill - (looking at it) - this is the bill. I put the letter W. on it by desire of Wilkinson, and that is on the back of it now. I directed the letter to

            . I am daughter of the last witness, and remember the prisoner coming for change of a Bank post-bill. I saw him write on the back of it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner to BARNET. Q. Was Benjamin present when I wrote on the bill - A. No; he went out to fetch the watch while his daughter brought the pen and ink - neither he nor his daughter were present, nor was I, for I went out at the same time as Benjamin.</p>
               <p>Q. Then none of you were present - A. No; I will take a solemn oath that nobody was present - the daughter was not present - she brought the pen and ink, and then went into the back kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not present - how do you know whether she did not go into the room again - A. That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the Bank post-bill in Albemarle-street on Sunday evening, and took it to the Bank next morning to be accepted - they told me to bring it on that day week, and it would be paid.</p>

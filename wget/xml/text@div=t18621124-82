                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the Royal Marines, quartered at Woolwich—the prisoner is a private in the same corps—on Thursday, the 30th October, he came to my house, No. 4, Bowling-green-row, Woolwich—it was a quarter-past 9 as near as possible—I heard him ask if I was at home—I know his voice well, being acquainted with him for a considerable time—I immediately rose from my seat, and told him I should take him to the Barracks, as I knew he had no business there, and he had broken the Bar<lb></lb>racks' confinement—I had had him confined that morning for some military offence—he said he would see me b—d, and he advanced to me with his right hand in his pocket, and asked me why I had been talking about him—I told him I had not—he said I was a liar—he then, in a very cool manner, seated himself on a chair for a minute or two, and said he had a word to say; one or two words would be quite sufficient—I objected to his sitting down, and he said, "You b—, you shall have it"—he then struck me a blow on the mouth with his left fist—the landlady, Mrs. Norton, interposed—he caught me by the hair—I got away, and went up stairs and locked myself in—that is all I saw of him; we were not together again that night, except at the police-station.</p>

I am the wife of John Norton, of Bowling-green-row, Woolwich—the prisoner came to the house on the evening of the 30th October, about a quarter-past 9—he asked for Sergeant Povis—the sergeant saw him, and there was some discussion, and the prisoner struck him on the mouth slightly—I urged the sergeant to go upstairs, and he did so—the pri<lb></lb>soner went away in a few minutes, and came back again—he had a knife in one hand and a bottle in the other, containing liquid—the knife was not open—he said the knife was for the sergeant and the contents of the bottle for himself—the sergeant had then gone to barracks, but I told the prisoner he was up<lb></lb>stairs—he then went away, and came back again—he came two or three times—I could not say whether he had anything in his hands after the first time—shortly after, the police-constable Sykes came to the house—he asked the prisoner what he had got in his hand—he said a bottle—then he asked him what he had got in his hand behind him, and he said, "Would you not like to have it?" and ran away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Huard, a surgeon—I attended the last witness for some time after the 30th October—he had a wound on the top of the shoulder—the knife produced would cause such a wound—I ob<lb></lb>served the cape, coats, and brace, they had been cut through, corresponding to the wound in the shoulder—it would require considerable force to inflict such a wound—I examined the contents of the bottle marked "Laudanum"—they consist of laudanum and sulphuric ether, not sufficient to destroy life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What was the depth of the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was superficial—more than an eighth of an inch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the night of the 30th October, I went out with a few comrades to a public-horse. I was sitting there, when one of the men told me that Sergeant Povis had been talking about me. I wanted to find out what he said, but they would not tell me. Then I got up to go to Ser<lb></lb>geant Povis to find out from him. I went there. He knowing I was absent from barracks wanted me to go to the guard room. I told him I wanted to talk with him first. I made a blow at him and struck him; I do not think I hurt him at all, but as for getting him by the hair I could not possibly get at him, for this woman was standing between him and me. Then he went out, whether to barracks or up stairs, I do not know. I came back two or three times. I might have had a knife in my hand; I do not know whether I did or not. I was standing at the top of the street, when a man named Fish came by and told me to go away. I was going towards Bowling-green-row, when I met the constable Sykes; he got in front of me to stop me. I struck at him with my left hand, then he struck me across the wrist with his <hi rend="italic">buton.</hi> He closed with me, and struck me across the head and made a serious wound. He raised his staff again. When I saw him raising his staff again, I put my hand in my pocket and drew my knife, and closed with him, and somehow he got a wound. It was not done with any in<lb></lb>tention, because I had nothing against the constable. If it had been the sergeant who closed with me, I would not have said what the consequence might have been, but I had no intention to injure the constable. That is all I have to say.</p>

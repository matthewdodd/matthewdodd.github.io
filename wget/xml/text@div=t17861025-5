               <p>I had been to Islington on Monday the 22d of September; I was returning home between seven and eight; it was not later than that; I was coming from Islington to Shoreditch, in the <placeName id="t17861025-5-crimeloc29">City-road</placeName>

               <p>Court. Is it a fish-skin case? - It is a species of fish, that they make spectacle cases of; I lost nothing more.</p>
               <p>What was your chain? - A steel chain; I have the likeness of Cowdery perfectly, and the other by his height, and by the habit he was in.</p>
               <p>Do you mean by the word perfectly, that you have no doubt of him? - I have not a doubt of him; the robbery might take up in all about two minutes and a half.</p>
               <p>With respect to Wood, what do you found your belief of his person on? - By his height, and by his size, and by the habit he appeared in at the time of the robbery; I saw him at Sir Sampson's on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Was you particular in your description in the information? - Sir, they were apprehended according to the description I gave of them at Sir Sampson's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. What sort of an evening was it? - It was a cloudy evening; it was between twenty minutes and half an hour after seven.</p>
               <p>Was there any moon? - No.</p>
               <p>So that you had nothing but the light of the evening, and the atmosphere a good deal obscured? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you anybody with you but Mrs. Chilcott? - No, she ran away and screamed.</p>
               <p>I have no doubt but you was most alarmed for her? - I was.</p>
               <p>This transaction did not occupy above two minutes and a half? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you always as certain of Cowdery as you are now? - Yes, I described him before the magistrate, as having the greater knowledge of him of the two.</p>
               <p>I wish you to recollect yourself; I am sure you will not suspect I am questioning you with a view to entrap you; only to know how the case is? - I did not swear to either of them positively before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>You expressed before the Magistrate a belief as to Cowdery, and spoke more dubiously as to the other? - Yes, he was closer to me, and I paid the greater attention to him.</p>
               <p>What circumstance has induced you to be rather more positive to Cowdery now than you was then? - The matter I considered there was upon committment; and for that reason I thought it was not necessary for me to be so positive as I might be at another time.</p>
               <p>Was not the question put to you whether you knew them? - It was.</p>
               <p>And there you distinguished as to your degree of knowledge, you was sworn before the magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>You was sworn to tell all the truth relative to the prisoners? - Certainly I was.</p>
               <p>At that time was your watch produced? Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the examination of Chant and East? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After all these circumstances together, the boys being produced to you within three or four days after your watch was produced, as you still spoke dubiously, I want to know how your memory comes to be improved now? - I thought the committment was all that was requisite at that time.</p>
               <p>But you know the Magistrate must have the information upon oath, which bound you to tell the whole truth upon the subject; now, as on that oath, you spoke dubiously, what has improved your recollection? - My recollection is not improved.</p>
               <p>It is wonderfully altered! and I want to know what are those circumstances that have been hatched into positiveness, matured into positiveness, which some time ago were nothing like positiveness?</p>
               <p>Court. The question is a very plain one whether you have had any occasion to confirm<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250013"></xptr> your doubts, or to make you more positive? - I can give no other answer, but that I thought it was not necessary for the committment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was not you asked, and repeatedly asked by the magistrate, whether you could speak positively to this man? - I was asked.</p>
               <p>Recollect your answer? - I cannot not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Here are two men that are to be committed to take their trial upon a capital offence, you admit the magistrate asked you, not once or twice, but repeatedly, whether you knew them; now you can recollect his question? - He asked me whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath, what was your answer? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean that the Court and the Jury should seriously believe you? - I most probably gave him some answer, but what it was I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was it not, that you did not mean to swear positively? - No, it was not, in my opinion; I cannot swear positively that it was not.</p>
               <p>Court. You have told us, that you have said you was not positive, now what was your answer? - I cannot be positive to the answer I made to Sir Sampson; I cannot recollect the answer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. However, you recollect it was repeatedly asked of you by the magistrate? - I do not know it was repeatedly asked.</p>
               <p>Was not you pressed upon it? - I was not pressed.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in company with Mr. Chilcott on this night of the robbery; as we were coming along the city road, about a hundred yards from the Toll-gate, I observed two men go on the other side of the way, and they had sticks in their hands, short sticks about the length of my arm; I was not apprehensive of any danger at that time, not thinking they would make such a public shew of their sticks; presently I observed footsteps running after us; Mr. Chilcott turned round, and so did I, and presently came two chaps, one I did not take particular notice of, that was him that came on the side of Mr. Chilcott; the shortest came to me on my right hand side, I made way for him to come by me, which to all appearance I believe to be Wood; in the mean time he held a stick in his right hand; he lifted up the right hand side of his great coat; he took the pistol in the same hand he had the stick; it was a drab coat; he held up the pistol, and bid me stop; I cried out pretty loud, O Lord! and slipped by; he came after me, it might be the space of two or three yards, then he turned back; then I went on, I run on as fast as I could near the toll, and I saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>What kind of hats had these young men? - A round hat, rather done up a little; Wood had a round hat, and a drab coloured great coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I shall trouble you with but one or two questions; you used the expression, if I heard you rightly, that to all appearance, Wood was the person you saw? - Yes, Sir, so far as to his person, the features of his face, the lower part of his face; but as to his eyes, and the upper part of his face I could not see.</p>
               <p>The man that came to you, had a drab colour coat, and a slouched hat? - I am pretty positive I said the same to Sir Sampson Wright, that I verily believed that he was the man.</p>
               <p>I was just while he was pursuing you about two yards, that you had an opportunity of observing him? - His height and his person I had an opportunity of observing.</p>
               <p>Was not you frightened a little for your husband? - I was in a great deal of fear for myself.</p>
               <p>Court. I understood you, that these men came behind you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Was any body else in company but these two young men? - Yes, another, but I do not know his name, but he is not taken; I knew Wood before; I am sure the prisoners are the two men that came that evening.</p>

               <p>Did they talk together? - Yes, Wood and the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I observed when my friend asked you what you was, you said, I keep the Rodney's Head, that is, I did do? - I kept the house two years.</p>
               <p>Had you a license? - License! yes.</p>
               <p>Who keeps the house now; to whom have you sold it? - Why, to a widow woman, but I do not know her name.</p>
               <p>So you sold your house last week to a widow woman whose name you do not know? - I never enquired much into her since I let the house.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire a little before? - No, Sir, she paid me for what things she had, and it did not matter to me.</p>
               <p>What are you now, where do you live? - In the same house, but up stairs.</p>
               <p>You have assigned your lease? - Yes.</p>
               <p>To this widow lady, and do not know her name; I hope they have had the goodness to take your old housekeeper; she continues perhaps to be your housekeeper still, though you have only a room? - I do not know, she is in the house still.</p>
               <p>Perhaps she goes partners with the people that have taken it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then I am afraid she is with you still? - Why I do not know she is.</p>
               <p>What other name does Mrs. Anderson use besides that of Anderson? - I never heard her go by any other name.</p>
               <p>Did not you really! why for the last two years, has not she gone by the name of Chant? - Some people might call her Chant, because they did not know any other name.</p>
               <p>How long have you been a dealer in watches? - No, longer than then; or else I should have been a better judge of watches.</p>
               <p>Why was the bargain against you? - I never bought one before.</p>
               <p>What was the value of this watch now? - I think I gave above the value of it.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath, did not Francis sell it to you? - No, Sir, he did not.</p>
               <p>That you swear positively? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who else was present besides Mrs. Anderson otherwise called Mrs. Chant? - Nobody but she; I had some money from her to pay for it.</p>
               <p>What trade do you carry on now? - I kept a public house; I am going into another; I am by trade a buckle maker; I never was here in my life; I never was in this place before.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with a Mr. East? - He lived in Old-street at this time; my house is in Golden-lane, it goes out of Whitecross-street, into Bunhill-row.</p>
               <p>Where did you find Mr. East when you sold him the watch? - At his own house;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250015"></xptr> I carried it to sell the next day; I never bought any thing before.</p>
               <p>Attend to this question, and recollect that Mr. East is coming and does not know your answer; upon your oath, did not you buy this by the desire of East? - No, Sir, he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Had he never desired you to lay a trap to get forty pounds of somebody? - No such conversation passed; I wanted such a thing at that time; I never wound it up.</p>
               <p>Did it chance to you to go to any gaol to Wood, since he has been committed? - No, yes, Sir; on the Sunday morning; I say nothing but what I know to be the truth.</p>
               <p>So on the Friday you bought it, on the Saturday you sold it, and on the Sunday morning you went to gaol to see Wood; what did you go there for? - I only went to ask him how he did.</p>
               <p>Did you go for any other purpose? - To ask him questions.</p>
               <p>That was all, was it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him you had been taken up yourself about this watch? - Yes; I do not know whether I might not; I was taken up on Saturday night; I was not in custody when I went to him.</p>
               <p>Who took you up on the Saturday night? - Mr. Townshend.</p>

               <p>What on the information of East? - I cannot resolve you that question.</p>
               <p>So they let you go again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon what condition? - I was taken up on the Saturday, and I went home, and they went home.</p>
               <p>Was not you let out in order that you might get these two men; had you been to Wood before they took you up on Sunday morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did neither Townshend nor East, nor any other person desire you to go to Wood? - Yes, I can say so.</p>
               <p>What else did you tell Wood? - Several affairs between ourselves; several little things</p>
               <p>Why you never had any little things but this watch; now, upon your oath, did not you tell him if he could give you a direction to Cowdery, you would keep Cowdery out of the way? - I said, I would go and tell Cowdery, in order he might get away; when I went from Wood's I went home, and Townshend was waiting at my house for me; and they took me to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Was not he waiting there by your appointment? - No, Sir; I did not go to Wood by his desire.</p>
               <p>One question more; would you have said any thing about this if you yourself had not been taken up? - I certainly would, if I could have left my house; I would have gone to Sir Sampson Wright's people; I did not like to leave my business to every body.</p>
               <p>Did you voluntarily tell them? - Yes, I told Townshend in my skettle ground.</p>
               <p>Why did not he come to take you up? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>What did he come for? - I did not ask him his business.</p>
               <p>May be he came to play a game of skettles with you? - I do not know what he came for; he did not take me up when he first came in; he was in half an hour before he took me up.</p>
               <p>Is not Townshend a thieftaker? - Yes, he is.</p>
               <p>Townshend was used to come to the house? - He never apprehended a man out of the house in his life.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you paid them, whom do you mean by them: - I paid two pounds to Wood; I was left at large to produce the watch, and how it was come by.</p>
               <p>Did Wood, when you went to see him in gaol, say any thing respecting himself? - Wood said, he had sent a letter to tell Cowdery to go out of the way himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Had you any other conversation respecting this business about Wood? - No, no more than he said, he could not think what he was there for, and he sent a letter to Cowdery.</p>

               <p>Court. What is Chant? - He kept Lord Rodney's Head at that time, I looked round the tap-room and saw nobody there that I wanted; I called Chant backwards into the tap-room, and asked him if he had not heard there was a robbery in the City Road; he said he had; and I got out of him that he bought a watch; I asked him if he had it by him, he said no, but it might be at Mrs. Harris's.</p>
               <p>What is Mrs. Harris. - A pawn-broker.</p>
               <p>Where does she live? - In Old-street; I thought it right to leave one of our people with Chant, and to go and see whether the watch was there or no, I went, and found what he had told me was true; I then went back to Chant, and then he went to shew me where to find Wood; I went to Wood's master's, I found he was an apprentice; I knocked at the door, and with some difficulty got admittance, I went up stairs and took the prisoner out of bed; then I searched about the room to see if I could find any thing, I found nothing of any material consequence but a light coloured great coat with white buttons, which the gentleman described to be worn by one of the persons that robbed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250018"></xptr> him; I desired the prisoner to get up and dress himself; he asked me what I wanted with him; I told him he must go with me; says he, you are not going to take that great coat? I said, yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you had any account at this time of the coat? - Yes, my Lord, I then took him to the Compter; I then asked Chant if he knew where the other lodged, and he told me he did not; we let Chant go home that night, in order to go to

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you search the pockets of it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Where you have a suspicion you always do? - Always.</p>
               <p>Did you find any pistols or any bludgeons on either of these young men? - No, Sir, in the lodgings of Cowdery there was nothing but the bare bed.</p>
               <p>The first place you went to, or that you have mentioned to us, was at Chant's? - Yes, after taking a regular round.</p>
               <p>Was that the first house you went to of this sort, positively the first house? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Chant? - I believe these two or three years.</p>
               <p>Have you had frequent occasions to go to his house? - Several times since he kept the Rodney's Head, because people, which I am very sorry to say, under the description of that kind of people, used to use that house.</p>
               <p>Have you occasionally found any people there that you have wanted. - We have found people there that we have wanted, but it has so turned out that the evidence would not bring them to public justice.</p>
               <p>Did Chant know that? - He could not be ignorant of that; I know Mrs. Harris and Mr. East, I have known East about two years.</p>
               <p>How long has he been what you call a private trap? - Why, upon my word, Sir, that is a very unfair question, and I shall apply to the Court; for my own part, I do not know what a private trap is; I know a good many things, I know I am a public trap, but I really do not know what a private trap is.</p>
               <p>No! my Lord and I seem to know it pretty well, and you seem to know it because you decline to answer it; I certainly must not ask you what quantity of ill you have known of him, but I may ask you if you have known any sort of good of him? - Upon my word and upon my oath I never knew any ill of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Mr. Chilcott. You saw this great coat produced? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you made any observation on that coat before? - No particular observation, it looked the same as other people's coats.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any thing about that coat that made you think you had seen it before; suppose that coat had been produced to you at any other place, should you have known it? - Had it been upon the same person's back I should.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was taken to Bow-street to see these people? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You went with Mr. Chant. - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who fetched you? - Townshend.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250019"></xptr>For what purpose was you taken? - To see the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Then you was told they were taken up for your robbery? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>When did you hear it? - About two days afterwards; I worked that night till about half after eight, I was returning home, about half after ten as I believe, and coming over Black-friar's-bridge, the prisoner Wood overtook me, and told me he had been to Astley's, we drank a pint of beer, and I paid for it, we came across Snow-hill, and crossed Smithfield, and along Barbican, and at the end of Barbican next Red-cross-street I left him.</p>

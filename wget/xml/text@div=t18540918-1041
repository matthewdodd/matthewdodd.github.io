                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 177). I know the prisoner—he lives in One Tun-alley, Old Brentford. On 10th Sept. I went to his house—I found some things in some cupboards, and in a Cellar—amongst them were this syringe, this chopper, and paint brush, and fork and net—they were in a cellar under a trap door, over which there was a Back—the prisoner was at the station when I searched his house—I told him I had found these things—he made no answer—he did not say who they belonged to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am gardener to Mr. William Laurence, of Ealing Park. I know the prisoner well—he worked for Mr. Laurence as a carman—I identify this syringe and chopper as belonging to Mr. Laurence—there had been a mark on this chopper, which has been partly erased—the prisoner had been in the habit of using the chopper, but not the syringe—I only know this paint brush, by its having "W. L." on it—we had nets similar to this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This paint brush is an ordinary one? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I know this syringe by this mark upon it, where it has been mended—any syringe being mended would be mended where this is—I believe this has been missed about eight months—I had never suspected the prisoner—he would have the chopper in use, and if he had been working out he might take it home.</p>

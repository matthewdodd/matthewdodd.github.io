When I dress myself of a morning, I am in the habit of leaving such loose silver, as I may have in my pockets, on my dressing-table. I had very frequently missed some of it. I marked some on the 25th; I also marked some on the 26th, and 27th; some of them had such accidental marks on them, as I might know again; and the others I marked. On the morning of the 25th, I missed a three-shilling piece; on the morning of the 26th, I missed two shillings; and on the morning of the 27th, I missed another three-shilling piece. The officer, Foy, arrived on the Wednesday morning, after I had sent for him two or three days before; I mentioned to him generally the circumstances of the robbery, and told him to proceed in his own manner, in order to discover it. He first called up

She further said, that she had received a three-shilling token from Mrs. Sibley the same morning. We sent down for Mrs. Sibley, and she came up.

I had Mr. Blackford's butler's leave for letting her be there; she was just then out of place, and had been a gentleman's house-keeper. I gave two shillings to the groom on the morning of the 27th; they were part of five shillings which I borrowed of Mrs. Sibley. The three-shilling piece I understand was also marked.

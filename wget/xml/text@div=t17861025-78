             broke into my house the 14th of October; it was three in the morning; I was in bed; I heard a noise of iron pulling about in the cellar, which waked me; I slept over the cellar where he was; I got up and opened my window; I had a pistol in my hand, and I called my neighbour at next door, and he came to my assistance; and hearing a noise in the cellar, says he, come out, and let us see who you are, and the prisoner came out; I opened the back door, and he offered to come up the steps; I saw him come out; the prisoner wanted to come into the house when I opened the door; I told him to keep out, or I would shoot him; then the prisoner went down into the cellar again; then my neighbour at the next door came, and we secured him.</p>
               <p>Did you go in after him? - Yes; when he came out of the cellar the first time, he came up the steps into my garden.</p>
               <p>Do you know him? - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Do you know his business? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know what he came into your house for? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How had he got in? - He got the cellar window open; the padlock was off entirely, and hung to the staple when I saw it.</p>
               <p>Then no violence had been used? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you always lock that door? - Yes, always of a night.</p>
               <p>Do you never happen to forget it? - No.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you locked it over night? - I am not positive of that, I think I locked it; I never forget it as I know of; when we got him to the watch-house, we searched him; we found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Justice asked him, how did he get into your cellar? he answered, I am not sure whether I locked the door, Sir, or not.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am not sure whether I did or no; I will not be positive.</p>

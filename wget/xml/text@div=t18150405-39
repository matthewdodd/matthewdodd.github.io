On the 1st of March, the patrole alarmed me, and said there was some person in the cellar, a little before six in the morning. I jumped up, took the poker, and went to the cellar door; at the top of the cellar stairs I struck against the boards, I did not strike the man, I thought I heard him come up the stairs, the man ran down the stairs, and began to cry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the patrol accompany you - A. No, he was not in the shop; I called my brother up; he got up, and opened the door, and let the watchman in; the watchman brought his lanthorn in the shop; I opened the cellar door; the man came up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man coming up stairs or going down when you first let him in - A. He came up from the cellar; he had been in the cellar and in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen him there - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You only found him on the stairs - A. Yes, and when he came in the shop I gave him to the patrole.</p>

               <p>Q. You keep the house do you - A. Yes; I have no partner.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181504050029"></xptr>Q. How do you know that he was in the shop or in the cellar - A. I saw him in the shop; he came up stairs without my fetching him, and delivered himself up to the patrole, and me. He had packed up these things in the shop, and took them into the cellar; they were all in the shop at one o'clock when I went to bed. The basket that now contains the things, is mine; the things were not in the basket when I found them in the cellar, the loose copper he had tied up in my apron, with other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any copper money tied up in the apron - A. Yes; all this four pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any butter - A. Yes, four pounds three pounds of bacon, and five pounds of pork, they were all in my cellar; the copper that was tied up in the apron was left under the counter when I went to bed, the butter was on the board, it was a full tub of butter turned out, he had taken one slice off, it weighed four pounds; the bacon was in the shop when I went to bed; it was in the cellar when I saw it again; the pork was in the cellar, it had been in the shop when I went to bed, at one o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your cellar secured - A. Yes; the door that led to the shop was bolted; he had got a knife and cut it, and got the bolt back; I found the knife on him that he cut the cellar door, and a piece of cheese in his pocket. The cellar flap he broke into and made an entrance into the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else of your family that had access to this shop - A. No, I have buried my wife; I had no servant lived with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that apron in which the money and things were wrapped in - A. I am positive it is mine; I had worn it the day before; there is no particular mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any account of himself - A. All that he said was a person pushed him down the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see how the flap had been opened - A. He had opened the cellar flap, after that was open, he could not go down unless he had ripped up a board at the bottom, he had taken one board up. There is no particular mark of mine on the butter, bacon, or cheese; I know where he had taken them from; this handkerchief was on a horse in the cellar; he took the handkerchief, and tied the bacon up in it; the handkerchief is mine; he had this piece of cheese in his pocket; I had such a piece of cheese in the shop very much like it; the halfpence are all new, and the penny pieces.</p>

            . I am a patrole of St. Mathew, Bethnal Green. On the 1st of March, in the morning, I observed a board of the cellar flap of the prosecutor's house was taken up; I laid hold of the door, it came open; I put my ear to listen if any body was there; I heard the sound of feet walking, I hallooed out, who is there; the prisoner said, the master of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner that said that - A. There was no other person in the cellar; I took him coming up out of the cellar; I alarmed Mr. Reynolds, and ordered him to open the celler door that leads into the shop that there was some person in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before you laid hold of the prisoner - A. Yes, Mr. Reynold's brother opened the shop door then it was, that I found the prisoner; I secured the prisoner. I searched him in the prisoner's right hand coat pocket, I found this piece of cheese, in another pocket I found this knife; the prisoner acknowledged that he cut the cellar door, and unbolted it. I then ordered Mr. Reynolds to go down into the cellar to see if any of his property was there; he went there, and found a quantity of copper tied up in a cloth, he found a piece of bacon in another cloth. I took the prisoner to the watchhouse. I neither promissed or threatened him; he said, this was the knife that he cut the cellar door to come into the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say; I trust to the mercy of the court.</p>

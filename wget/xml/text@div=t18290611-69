On the 19th of May I saw the prisoner in Davies-street, carrying a cann; I watched him - a little girl came up to him: I then lost sight of him, but when I got to Grosvenor-square, I saw them again - the little girl had then got the cann; I followed her, and asked her several questions- I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

            . About half-past twelve o'clock, on the 19th of May, I was at the corner of Davies-street; Bramston said that girl had got stolen property, and told me to take her - I found it was a cann of oil; I took her down to Mr. Smethurst's with it, and the foreman ordered the men all up, the prisoner was one - we asked him how he came by it; he said it was a little oil he had taken for his own use, he did not think there was so much.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was said to him before he said this? A. The foreman asked how he came by it - he said he was sent with four gallons of oil to Square Thomas', and he took this little oil out; the foreman said he had better say how he came by it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DOUGLAS. I am foreman to Mr. James Smethurst; the prisoner was his porter for about a month. I measured the oil, and asked the prisoner how he came by it - he said he took it out of the cann at Mr. Thomas'; there had been such oil as this sent there - I believe this to be Mr. Smethurst's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Except from what he said you cannot tell that that was Mr. Smethurst's? A. Certainly not; it is sperm oil - I did not say it would be better or worse for him to tell the truth; the last witness must have misunderstood me.</p>

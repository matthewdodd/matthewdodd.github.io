               <p>out at 11 o'clock with her other child, a boy about eight months old—I was sweeping my stairs down about half-past 11, and heard the noise of the baby—I told my landlady, and in consequence of what passed between us, I went to the back parlour window, put my hand through a broken pane, and pulled the blind on one side, but could not see anything, though I could hear the baby—I pushed the window up, got into the room, and heard the same noise much plainer—it was a stifling, moaning noise, and proceeded from the bed—I pulled the bed-clothes down a little way, and could not see the baby—I pulled them down further, and found it lying on its face, with this old dirty shirt sleeve (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in its mouth, near the middle of the bed, and nearer to one side than the other—the clothes were tucked tightly over at the sides—the rag might have been two inches inside the mouth—I lifted the child up and pulled out the rag—the ends of the rag fell over its face—it was black in the face, and its eyes started from its head—my landlady got in at the window after me, and was with me—the door was locked all this while—she did not do anything to the child—she fetched a person to suckle it, after it recovered—the eyelids were lifted up, and a skin of corruption had formed over the eyes—the woman who was sent for, wrapped it in a shawl and took it over to her place to wash it—she suckled it in the prisoner's room, and it seemed very ravenous—it was wrapped in an old dirty frock.</p>

I am the wife of William Cannon, of 10, Paynestreet—we keep the house—the last witness and the prisoner both lodged with us—the prisoner and her husband lodged in the back-parlour—on 1st July, about a quarter or twenty minutes past 11, Mrs. Manley tapped at the door, and after we had talked in the kitchen, I told her to go and look through the back-parlour window—she got in at the window first, and I after her—the bed was closely tucked up, and I saw her take out the child, with a rag in its mouth, which she took out—it was almost suffocated—it was under the bed-clothes half-way down, and rather towards the side—the bed-clothes were tucked up at top and bottom, and the sides tucked in all round—I called the neighbours, and asked one of them to suckle it—the prisoner returned about I o'clock—there was a policeman there, but I did not give her in custody—I know the young woman who took the child to be christened when it was a week old—they called it Kate Connor, after the father—I did not hear the prisoner call it any name, it was too young.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 22, Brunswick-place, Barnsbury-road—on 1st July, about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I was sent for to the police-station, and examined the prisoner's child—it was very much emaciated, and suffering from inflammation of both eyelids, from which a great amount of matter issued—there was a sore in the right groin, evidently from neglect; and lividity of the countenance, showing that air had been shut off from the lungs for some period, and it was slightly convulsed—I examined the prisoner at the station, both her breasts were very much distended with milk, painfully so—she could not have given the child the breast for some time—from the appearance of the child's strength it is quite impossible that it could have put the rag into its mouth itself—it might have lived from five to eight minutes more in the position in which it was lying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it possible that the child could have been covered up under the clothes, with a rag in its mouth, and live for a quarter of an hour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the stoppage of the air not being perfect—the child being hungry could not have sucked the rag into its mouth, without poking it in with its hand; not to that distance; not to have produced the effect it did, because there was lividity of the countenance; therefore it must have been further than just inside the lips—that is the child (<hi rend="italic">In the prisoner's arms</hi>)—I have not examined it.</p>

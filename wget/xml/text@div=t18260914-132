             is my foreman, and had charge of the premises; there is one piece of this property which I can swear to - I believe all the pieces are mine - this, which I know, is partly maple and part pine - it does not often happen that these woods are united - it was fixed in one of the windows.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. How many houses were you building? A. Four; I have twenty altogether - any body might have gone there - the wood might have been sold to the prisoner for fire-wood - I have known him a many years, and always believed him to be honest and industrious.</p>
               <p>JOHN GELSTHORPE. I was foreman to the work going on at Turnham-green. Several pieces of wood were taken away at different times; I know part of those produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Some of the workmen lodged at the prisoner's house? A. Yes; and cooked their victuals there - I have caught these men stealing small pieces of wood - I think it is more likely than not that these were so taken.</p>

            . I went to the prisoner's house - I asked him whether he had any wood of the kind I described - he said he did not know, but he shewed me what he had got - Gelsthorpe was with me, and owned this.</p>

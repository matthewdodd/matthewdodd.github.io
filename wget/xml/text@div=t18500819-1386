                  </hi>. I keep the European Tavern, in Mansion-house-street. The prisoner was in my service twelve months—I went with the officer to his lodging", and saw these articles, which have the mark of my house on them—no articles with my name on, have been parted with by me—the prisoner was not allowed to take them away—there were a great many articles at his lodging, on which the marks had been obliterated, but I desired the officers not to take any but what had the name on—these dishes produced are mine—they are made on purpose for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at Lambeth. On the 20th of April 1 was at Greenwich fair—an officer came, and told me I had been robbed, he desired me to follow him, and be would point out the person—we went and found the prisoner with my handkerchief in his hand—the officer took it from him, this is it—it has my mark on it.</p>

I was at the fair, and saw the prisoner there, about nine o'clock in the evening—I followed him till half past ten o'clock at night—he tried several gentlemen's pockets, and then he went behind the prosecutor, and took his handkerchief out—I told the gentleman of it, and we went and took the prisoner, with it in his hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was going from the fair between nine and ten o'clock, and saw two boys drop the handkerchief; I took it up, and before I had got two yards, the policeman came and said I had stolen it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I swear I saw him put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket and take it—I found on him a snuff-box, with some scented snuff in it.</p>

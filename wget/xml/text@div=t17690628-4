On the 11th of June, as I was lying in bed in a lower room, I heard the sash move gently. I got up and looked, and saw a man in the area at the window. I said, So-ho! what do you want there? He had got his arm is at the window. He said, Do you, are you there? He drew back. I jumped up, and called Watch! I awoke my fellow-servant. The watch came in a little time. We went to the door just as the prisoner got out of the area: then the watchman was taking him. The shutter is an inside shutter, but it was not shut; we always leaving the middle leaf open. The sash was up about fourteen inches, and I saw his hand within side very plain.</p>
               <p>John Parish. I am footman to 'Squire Coppinger. My fellow-servant called to me, and said there was a man coming in at the window. I got up, and went up stairs to assist the watchman, who had hold of the prisoner. We asked him his intent in coming there at that time of the night; he said there were two or three drunken men had taken his hat, and thrown it into the area, and he got over for it. I said, Why did you attempt to come in at the window? He said the window was open. The watchman said he had seen it shut; and I know it was shut when I went to bed.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I thought I heard somebody drop down the area in the King's Road. I heard a voice call Watch! Watch! There are thieves in the house! I came and saw the prisoner in the area. I took hold of him as he was coming over the rails, and threw him flat on his back and secured him. As we were going to prison with him, I desired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280005"></xptr> him to send for his friends. He said he would not trouble his friends with any such dirty action. It was about ten minutes after two when I laid hold of him. I saw the sash was shut that night.</p>

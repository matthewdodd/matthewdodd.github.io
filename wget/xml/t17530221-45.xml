               <p>William Hall. I have known the prisoner at the bar 12 years, and was on board the ship when he came on board to be transported, but did not take notice of the time; I was glad to see him there, he having been very troublesome to me; he married a sister of mine; I saw him amongst the transports with a collar about his neck. I saw him put on board with the rest before they were put down into the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him tried?</p>

               <p>Hall. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. When I married that man's sister he got my wife to execute a wrong judgement, by antidating it, against me, and he was put into my house, so he kept me out. The case was tried before my lord chief justice Lee . This is all Spight.</p>
               <p>Hall. The woman never confessed a judgment to me; she found soon that he had a wife and five children living at the time he married her, which was on the Saturday, and on the Monday following he put a bond and judgment into the house. The things were appraised and sold; I bought them of 'Squire Buckley .</p>

            . I have known the prisoner 12 years, he once was a tenant of mine. I remember about four or five years ago, I believe it was, I saw him come down from Newgate linked with a chain, amongst other transports, to Black Friers Stairs; I went on purpose to see him; I said to him, Mr. Jettea, I am sorry to see you transported; then he went to shake hands with me, but I said, not so familiar as that, I think it is ten thousand pities you was not hanged; then he threw a bottle of girl at me with violence, and swore, if I came near him, he'd stick me. I saw him put into the close lighter, and saw him go down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the court at his trial?</p>
               <p>Boulton. I was not, but I knew he was tried and convicted for robbing a person of a guinea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That man, after I had given in a receipt to buy some houses, arrested me, and put me into goal, and so got my houses from me, and broke into my house.</p>
               <p>Boulton. I never owed him any discourse in my life; he would neither pay me my rent, nor go out of my house.</p>

             lost a Cow, which the Prisoner used to drive from the Chase and own to be his. General Pepper's Servant deposed, that hearing the Prisoner was suspected, and knowing that the General had lost two Cows, which were among his Cattle when he came to him about 6 Months ago, and had been since lost, he went to see the Prisoners Cattle, and found the two Cows, but the Marks seemed to be cut or filed out of their Horns; but he knew the Beasts to be General Pepper's. The Prisoner in his defence said that the Cows were all his own, and that he had had them ever since Bartholo-tide last; that he had bought them at the Welsh-Fair at Clerkenwell at that time; he brought an Evidence to prove he bought two such Beasts at that time, which very near or altogether answered the Description: He produced several Persons who gave him a very good Character, that he was a very honest and industrious Man, that he used to keep Cows, succle Calves, sell Milk, &amp;c. for a Living: That he had before he removed to Enfield lived very honestly at Kentish-Town, but meeting with Misfortunes, was obliged to leave that Place, and go by the Name of Doulton: but that he always behav'd himself very honestly and industriously.

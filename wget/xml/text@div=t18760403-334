I live in Essex and was treasurer for three or four years up to June, 1875, for the London district of this society; the defendant acted as secretary—(<hi rend="italic">looking at three-papers marked F. E. and K., and referring to three sums of money</hi>), he has never given me these sums of money—he used to see me at my place of business when I did not attend the meetings to hand over to me the monies he had—I believe I miscalled all the counterfoils for monies received—(<hi rend="italic">treasurer's cash book produced</hi>) this book has not always been compared with the check-book—the entries were made by my clerk always in my presence—I never entered them myself—even at the district meeting I put them on a sheet if paper and took it home for my clerk to enter—I compared the sheet if paper with the book and checked the amounts—this will enable me to ay positively that he did not account for these three sums.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I attended to the business as treasurer like most others I did not attend regularly—it is my duty to attend every district meeting—I do not know that in my absence he acted for me—when I was at the meetings I signed every counterfoil—when I was not there I signed them other night. (<hi rend="italic">The witness' depositions, being read, stated;</hi> "I have not received from the prisoner those monies. I used to attend the meetings, at I did not attend regularly.

I day it is my duty to receive monies, but only from the secretary—that is my perpetration of the <hi rend="italic">rule</hi> with regard to the monies he received on behalf of the society—the entries were made by either my clerk, daughter, or myself—I do not know that the prisoner after I had made entries saw them in deer to know if I had them down all right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Jury stated that the whole difficulty in the case arose from the loose and tersely bad way of keeping the books. The prisoner was charged on two other documents on which no evidence was offered.</hi>

            . Q. In the month of August 1809 did you purchase a table of the prisoner - A. I did. My wife is a midwife, she attended the prisoners wife. The prisoner brought the table to me, I was to give him two pound for the table; he owed me a pair of smallclothes, and I gave him another table for it; he brought it to my house about seven or eight o'clock in the evening; it was quite light; he was seen publicly to bring it by the neighbours.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was not put on his defence.</p>

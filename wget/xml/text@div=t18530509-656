                  </hi>. I manage the business of Henry and Edward Fownes, glove manufacturers, of No. 41, Cheapside; their factory is at Battersea—I have been in their employment sit or seven years—the prisoner was employed by them as a glove cutter—he worked for no other firm, that we knew of—I do not believe there was any special arrangement with him about serving other firms; it is not the custom—nothing was said to him about not serving other firms, but those in our employment are decidedly not permitted to work for other firms; if such a thing was discovered, the person would be discharged—I have been in the habit of delivering work to the prisoner—on 9th April I delivered some skins to him to cut into nine dozen tranks; tranks are unmade gloves—my attention was particularly directed, in consequence of some circumstances, to the skins which I delivered to him for some months back—this memorandum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was made at the time I gave him the skins; it is a copy of the written instructions I gave him—the kid was what we call bottle-green colour—I either gave the skins to him or to the person who took them for him—if I gave any verbal instructions, it would be, "Cut these to these sizes"—I gave a copy of the sizes on a piece of paper; there was no mark on the skins themselves, merely the quantity—the paper and skins were given either to the prisoner or his daughter—his daughter was the person who ordinarily received the skins for him—I wrote</p>

Fownes, at Cheapside, and the tranks were identified—we then went to the prisoner's house, searched, and found a quantity of leather and gloves—I said to the prisoner, "You must consider yourself my prisoner for stealing a quantity of kid leather, the property of the Messrs. Fownes Brothers"—he said, "I am very sorry, it is a bad job"—he pointed out a small quantity of leather in different parts of the room; he had got a large quantity before him, and said, "This belongs to Messrs.

Fownes—these tranks found on Mary Groves are Messrs. Fownes' property—the skins are the best which we can pick out among ten thousand, and they are our own dye, which I can speak to by the regularity of the colour; it is a dye which is difficult to match—there would always be variations in it—this small sample has been cut from the shank of the skin—comparing it with the tranks, I am sure that they have both come from the same skin—I recollect some little green skins being given out on 9th April.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable, attached to the Post Office. I apprehended the prisoner on the 19th of Feb., at the Vauxhall-railway) station—I told him he must consider himself in my custody on a charge of felony—I took him to a tap opposite the railway station, and searched him, but found only a few shillings on him—I cautioned him that any<lb></lb>thing he might say might be used against him at a future day—I then asked him if he had a brother living near St. Katherine's—he said, "Yes, a brother-in-law keeping the Crown"—I asked if he had given his brother anything—he said, "No"—he afterwards said, "Yes, he gave me change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—I asked if he knew the person from whom he received the note—he said a person of the name of Murray or Morris, he did not know which, at Southampton—he said, when at Southampton, that he saw a gentleman get off the Weymouth coach, and go into the railway-station, that he came out, and said he could not go, as they could not give him change for a note, that he (the prisoner) then made answer, he could give him change, and he gave him ten sovereigns for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said he brought eleven sovereigns out with him for the purpose of paying his rent—I asked him the description of the person he received the note of—he said he was a seafaring-man, but he did not know where he lived.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable attached to the Post-office. I went down to Southampton on the 19th of Feb., and went to No. 3, Anglesea-terrace there—I found a female there who said she was Mrs. Spicer—what passed between her and me was afterwards stated to the prisoner at the solicitor's office next day—I received from her this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—"No. 51092, <hi rend="italic">dated Nov.</hi> 2,1844")—I told the prisoner that I had been to Southampton, and to No. 3, Anglesea-terrace, that I saw a person there who said she was Mrs. Spicer; that I said to her, "Your husband has</p>

               <p>sent to you for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note which you have got;" that she said she had not got one, that I said, "Then I must commence searching the house," which I did, that I afterwards came into the parlour with her, and she gave me this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which I then produced—I then said, "I asked your wife where she got it from, and she said she received it from you, and that you told her when you gave it her, that you won it at cards at Willis's beer-shop"—the prisoner said, "I did give it my wife, and told her as you have stated"—he was afterwards asked in my presence where he got the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said he had it from the same gentleman as he had the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was asked who the gentleman was, and he said his name was either Morris or Murray—he was asked the reason why he did not state that he gave the gentleman change for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note when he said he gave him change for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he was not asked about the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note.</p>

            . Last Sunday night I had been in company, and drinking pretty much, and was so much out of order that I was willing to set myself down any where; so I sat down either upon a bench or a stone by <placeName id="t17440912-26-crimeloc135">Exeter-Exchange</placeName>

               <p>Hobdell. I cannot say he did: I struggled for my cane because it was a cane that I valued, and if the watch had not come to my assistance, I verily believe I should have been murdered. - I can't say the Prisoner did any thing to me; the watchman pursued them, and I followed the watchman, but only the Prisoner was taken: then he said he had got into bad company, and did not know they were going upon that work.</p>

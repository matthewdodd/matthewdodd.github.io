               <p>Q. Did you miss it after you perceived the boy hanging about - A. Yes. I did not see the prisoner take the property from the shop. In consequence of information, I gave a strict look nut. Soon after, the officer brought the piece of cotton which we had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you had seen him before you missed the cotton - A. I suppose ten minutes. The boy was absent when I found the cotton was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. The question I asked is this: how long before you missed the cotton had you seen the boy - A. About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you saw him hang about the shop - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By which, I understand, you had seen him for some time; how long a time had you seen him about the shop door - A. He was about the shop door five times.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I saw the prisoner at the door about half past six; I saw him at the shop door, and the shop window; he was loitering about the door about five minutes; he proceeded from there towards the City. I pursued him; I saw him through Middle-row, Holborn; I got in the street opposite Middle-row; I saw him come out of Middle-row, Holborn; he went behind the stone pillar; he took something off the heap of rubbish; he shook it. I said to my brother officer that he had got something that he had taken from behind the stone pillar. We asked him what he had got; he said, nothing, at first. We unbuttoned his coat; these was the cotton. He then said it was a piece of stuff he had found.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this stone pillar from the house of the prosecutor - A. One hundred and fifty or two hundred yards. I never lost sight of him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you saw him he had not taken the linen - A. No; he must have taken it before, and there have hid it. He went out of the foot way.</p>
               <p>Q. to Stock. How long after you saw the prisoner was it that he was brought back - A. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the prisoner at your house after you missed the cotton, did you - A. Yes; I saw him loitering about the door after I missed the cotton.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any suspicion of him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you seize him - A. I was not certain that he had taken any thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120023"></xptr>Q. Then after you had missed the cotton you saw the prisoner loitering about the door, and you had seen the prisoner loitering about the door before you had missed the cotton - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw him again after you missed the cotton - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any time during which it appeared he was absent from the door - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you missed the cotton had you seen him; you told me just now five or ten minutes - A. Yes, I saw him about ten minutes before I missed it. I was gone upon some other business; I had turned my back.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have been at the window when you missed it; did you see him there at that time - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Holborn is your house in - A. Between Chancery-lane and Southampton-buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. to Godfrey. He went up towards the city, you said - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He went behind the stone pillar and pulled out something from some rubbish - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did he give you of it - A. He said he had found it, and he would take us to the place where he found it. The place he took us to was the place where I saw him take it from. I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards carried him to the door - A. Yes, and my brother officer produced the linen there. Before it was produced, they said they had lost a gown piece. The linen is here.</p>

            . This is the linen that I found under the prisoner's great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. to Godfrey. Is that the linen that was found on the boy - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. to Stock. Is that the linen that you lost - A. Yes, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Godfrey. Do you know any thing more of the matter - A. No, more than what I have stated.</p>
               <p>Mentz. I know no more than what Godfrey has stated; what he has stated, passed. I did not see the boy go behind the stone pillar. I was going through Middle-row; Godfrey called me, and told me he took something from behind the stone pillar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming down Holborn, I picked it up; that gentleman saw me pick it up. I threw the snow off it, and put it under my coat. I thought of giving it to my mother.</p>
               <p>Q. to Stock. What is the value of that linen - A. Eleven shillings; that is what we gave for it; it is worth more now.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say with certainty that it is worth more than five shillings - A. Yes; I would give more than five shillings for it to sell again.</p>

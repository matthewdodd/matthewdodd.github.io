On the 23d of February, at seven o'clock in the evening, I was up stairs at tea - it was dark. When I came down, the patrol brought some clothes into the shop. I then looked at my window and found a square of glass taken entirely out. I had observed it before on that day, it was sound and whole. - about 20 l. worth of clothes were taken out. I went round to the pawnbrokers, and found part of them at Balfour's, Chandos-street, and some more at Lazarus's shop. The prisoner was taken about a month after, and a waistcoat taken off his back which was mine.</p>

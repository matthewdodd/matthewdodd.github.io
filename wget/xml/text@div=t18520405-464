                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the Two Brewers public-house, in Stoney-lane, South wark. About the middle of Nov. the prisoner called on me and said he wished to know if I should like to have the "Atlas" bound, as he came from Mr. Tallis, who was going to bind a quantity, and he should be able to do it cheap—I had seen the prisoner eighteen or twenty months before, he had brought books from Mr. Tallis: numbers of "Montgomery's illustrated Atlas," published by Mr. Tallis—he said they would be done in a fortnight, or three weeks at the farthest—I believed he came from Mr. Tallis, and I gave him the books—I would not have given them him if I had not believed he came from there—I gave him forty-four numbers—they were worth 44<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not see the prisoner again till I saw him in the House of Detention with the officer.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the interval between your seeing him with the officer and your giving him the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About three months—I was examined at the Mansion-house—the gentleman behind you was there—I did not hear him state that the defence of the prisoner was that he was not the man—he said he was not the person—I had a female friend with me—I did not say at first the prisoner was not the man—I did not express doubts about it—I do not remember that my friend told me that if I expressed any doubt I should lose my books—I did not express a doubt about his being the man—I never had any doubt—I never made a mistake about a person's identity—I did not afterwards tell a gentleman that called on me that I did not recollect the person of the man—I never said that I did not recollect whether he mentioned Tallis's name or not—I am quite sure I did not—nobody called on me on the subject of this case—I never said to any gentleman that I was not sure that the prisoner was the person—nor that I was not sure that the person whoever he was, mentioned Tallis's name—I am quite sure no one came to me after the prisoner had been at the Mansion house—I saw no one but the officer, and the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mrs. Cook, at the Two Brewers—I was at Mrs. Cook's when the prisoner came about some numbers of the "Atlas"—he got the numbers—that was not the first time he had called—he called before, and saw me—I told him Mrs. Cook was not in the way, and he called again—I</p>

               <p>had seen him before, and taken in numbers of him—I cannot say how long before, I think about twenty months back—I think he came the day before he took the numbers away, and I told him Mrs. Cook was not in the way—he called, I believe, next morning, and I told him if he stopped a short time he could see Mrs. Cook, which he did.</p>

Q.</hi> You live with Mrs. Cook, who keeps a public-house, are you a good deal engaged in the business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it is a well-accustomed house—there is plenty to do—I remember a person coming to Mrs. Cook's when I was present, after this inquiry had taken place before the Lord Mayor, to ask her some questions about it—it was a man—Mrs. Cook did not say in my hearing that she was not sure that the prisoner was the man—she did not say that she did not recollect whether the man, whoever he was that came for the books, mentioned the name of Tallis or not—I did not hear her say that whoever the man was that came for the books she was not sure whether he mentioned the name of Tallis or not—I do not recollect her saying that I pulled her by the sleeve and said, "Don't talk any more with him"—I might have said so—I cannot say that I recollect it—the man called at Mrs. Cook's between the first time I went to the Mansion-house and the second—I went out of the bar when he and Mrs. Cook were in conversation—I might have been near enough to have pulled Mrs. Cook by the sleeve—I might have pulled her by the sleeve, or I might not—I did not tell her if she did not know the man she would not get her books—I did not say anything about her not getting her books—I do not recollect saying any<lb></lb>thing about the books while the man was there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is your memory so infirm that you may have pulled her by the sleeve and forgot it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Persons are in and out of a public house—I know that a person called about the books, and that is all I know about them—I might have pulled her by the sleeve, but I do not recollect it.</p>

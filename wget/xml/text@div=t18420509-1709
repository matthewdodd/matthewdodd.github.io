                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Bromfield, a brush-maker, of 87, Bridge-house-place, Southwark. The prisoner was our porter for about eleven months. On the 15th of April, about a quarter after eight o'clock at night, I was in the warehouse, and in consequence of what Holi<lb></lb>day said to me I sent the prisoner out of the warehouse—he had a coat hanging on a nail in the warehouse—I saw this brush taken from the pocket by Ann Holiday when I had sent him out—I had desired him to leave and not return till Mr. Bromfield came back, but not coming back as soon as I expected, I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Mr. Bromfield was out of town. Mrs. Bromfield had some words with me on Friday; she did not charge me with taking the brush then, but on Friday night ordered me to come for my wages on Saturday night, which I did; but she would not give them to me; I did not leave till she did; she sent for two policeman to take me out of the premises; she said she discharged me because I took half-an-hour for breakfast in the morning. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not say so—up to two months ago we had the greatest confidence in him, but on Good Friday we went out to dinner, and the ser<lb></lb>vant told us he had taken some things out, a quantity of brushes—I men<lb></lb>tioned it to him, he said they had been gone out for orders; I looked at the day-book, and found it was not so—when he came on Saturday my husband had not returned, and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was not out of the warehouse all night. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes, I sent him out—he staid out about half-a-minute, just while we took the brush out—he returned in an instant—I did not charge him with it then, but</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Bromfield—I held a candle while mistress went round the warehouse on Friday night, about a quarter to nine o'clock—I passed the prisoner's coat, hanging on a nail, and it hit my arm—I spoke to mistress—she told the prisoner to go over to Mrs. White's and see what o'clock it was, and while he was gone I had only time to take this brush out of his coat pocket—I took it down to the kitchen-drawer—mistress told me to keep it—the prisoner came back di<lb></lb>rectly—mistress said, "Shut up the house directly, and get out of my house, and never come near till Saturday night, when your master will be at home"—she did not explain why—he came next morning, and wassent away again—he put on the coat the brush was found in that Friday night—I gave the brush to the policeman on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> That girl is bribed to say what she does; Mrs. Bromfield has bad so many servants; the policeman has got a strap which I was ordered to thrash her with to make her comply with Mrs. Bromfield's request; because I would not do it, she would frequently throw water over her; I said I would not thrash her; I would rather thrash her mistress. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She sent him down to frighten me because I would not take my medicine—she did not order him to strap me on the back—he came with a strap in his hand—he did not say anything—he said he was going to hit me with the strap because I would not take my medicine—I took it, and he did not strap me—master's brother never offered to strap me—it is true that I found this brush in his pocket—I did not put it in, and do not believe that mistress did—the coat hung behind the door—when the door opened the coat was against the wall—I have been in the service going on for four months.</p>

               <p>altogether from their running to Union-hall instead of attending to business—I was out of town when the examination took place, and my wife unpro<lb></lb>tected—Benjamin Bromfield, instead of appearing there for me, left her to manage it herself—I thought they might be concerned with him and discharged them—they were valuable men to me, but still I thought it proper, and the prisoner was a valuable servant—I know of no dispute between him and Mrs. Bromfield—I told her to mark the brushes, as we have been missing them—she marked them <hi rend="italic">B,</hi> and we found this one corresponding with that—it is now very faint, as it has been handled a good deal—Benjamin Bromfield was my brother—about twelve months ago I was enticed by my father to become his partner, but he became bankrupt—there was property con<lb></lb>cealed, and I sent two officers with the prisoner to take possession of it—since this Benjamin Bromfield comes forward to give this man character—I cannot swear the brush is my make only from the mark which I saw this minute.</p>

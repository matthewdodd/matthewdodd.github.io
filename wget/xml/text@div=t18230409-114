There was a 5 l. note, two sovereigns, and fourteen shillings. On the following day, about two o'clock, I missed it - he was often left in the house when I was out. I have got the number of the note from the bankers' since. I had left one of my workmen at home to pay a bill with it, if it should come while I was out (he is not here). I did not see the prisoner after I missed the money, until his apprehension, which was last Thursday. I had given him warning to leave on the next Saturday; the 20th was Thursday. He bore a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I apprehended the prisoner last Friday morning at his house in Willer-street, Tothill-fields - I told him he was charged with robbing his master, and asked what he had done with the money - he said he had spent it; I asked him how much it was; he said 7 l. 14 s. I asked him where he had been since he committed the robbery; he said he walked to Bath to see a relation, and had been absent till the day before I took him. I found no money on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master did not use me well; he kept me short of victuals. I heard he was going to send me away, and not knowing what for, I did this. I always did my best to serve him - this is the first crime I was ever guilty of.</p>

             we are seal engravers, I and my family live in the house, my brother does not live there, but he pays half the rent, we hold the house by a lease in our joint names, I sleep in the back room up two pair of stairs.

(Produces it.) I was last in the room, and bolted the door myself, as I do every night, and take up the keys of the house; I locked the parlour door, which is next the passage, and took up the key.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the door next the yard unbolted? - No.</p>
               <p>Was that hole near one of the bolts? - It was, if they had been two minutes longer, they would have been in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I believe there is an end of the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. Were the pieces of this door on the outside or inside? - I picked up this piece within the parlour.</p>
               <p>Court. We are upon very nice ground, here is a clear breaking, but in order to constitute this offence of burglary, there must be an entering as well as breaking; if there be any evidence of these people putting in their hand, there would be an entering:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080190"></xptr> as for the entry, any, the least degree of it, with any part of the body, or an instrument held in his hand is sufficient, so as to step over the threshold, to put in a hand, or hook, or a pistol, to demand one's money, are all of them burglarious entries; but here they might cut these pieces out of the door without these pieces being in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Jury. The centre bit must go through, and so must the hand go through.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I fancy, my Lord, we have now got far enough for me to trouble your Lordship with an objection.</p>
               <p>Court. Go on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I take it to be a principle, and it is the practice of the law of England, that all points may be used in order to save the lives of prisoners; but I am perfectly convinced, that by your Lordship and by the Jury, many of whom are known to me to be men of good sense, and great humanity, no point will be pressed against the lives of the prisoners, I am perfectly convinced, that if this case depends on the question, whether half an inch or a quarter of an inch of the point of an instrument, has penetrated through the door, the lives of the prisoners are perfectly secure; but, I am to address myself to the question of law, and I will endeavour to confine myself very strictly to that question: I take the liberty of stating with great submission, that according to the ancient common law notion of burglary, it was indispensibly necessary that there should be a breaking, accompanied by an actual entry, that I take to be the ancient common law of England; the reason that burglary is considered as an offence highly criminal is, that it is an invasion of the security of the subject in his castle; I am aware that there have been some determinations, in which that ancient principle has certainly been considered with a degree of latitude in the construction, that is not always to be found in the determinations of the Judges, in questions of life; I am aware of those decisions which hold, that where a pane of glass is broken, and an instrument introduced noctanter, that that is a burglary; but, I may say without offence, that there are very great authorities, who wish it was a new question, and had not been so held; but, I take it the principle of all these new determinations is this, there is such a breaking of the castle of the proprietor, that his property may be taken out through the aperture; and I take the principle of those determinations, which speaks of an instrument introduced, to mean not the instrument by which the breaking is made, but an instrument by which the property of the proprietor is removed, introduced subsequent to the act of breaking, and after it is complete; here the introduction of the instrument is part of the act of breaking, and no man living can say, that this centre bit was introduced for the purpose of taking out the property of the proprietor, no, it was for the purpose of breaking into the domicile of the proprietor; and I admit that, as to that branch of the crime it is complete, but the Court will not say, that the introduction of the instrument for breaking, was for the purpose of taking out the property; if there had been the least property of Mr. Brown near this hole, that the hand or a hook could have removed if introduced, subsequent to the breaking, I do admit I could have had nothing to say on the subject; as to all the cases that have been mentioned of the introduction of a hand, a foot over the threshold, or a pistol, they all seem to proceed on the idea, that the breaking is precedently complete, and this is considered as an act of dominion over the property of the owner, acquired by the breaking; as where a pistol is introduced, by which terror is applied to the true man to compel him to part with his goods; but there is no case which has said, that the introduction of an instrument in the act of breaking, shall satisfy both the distinct requisites of the offence, namely breaking and entry to steal; suppose instead of being the case of a door, which is pierced with the centre bit, this had been a brick wall, broken with a pick-ax, and it had appeared that the pick-ax had necessarily been within the wall, would the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080191"></xptr> Court have held, that this, besides being a breaking, was an entry into the dwelling house to steal? I assure myself that however imperfectly, I have on the sudden, stated the argument, the Court will not in a case of life, extend the law one iota beyond the letter of former determinations, and will not think themselves warranted to construe this case upon the evidence to come within the definition of a burglary.</p>

               <p>The Judges concurred with the Council, and directed the Jury to acquit the prisoners on this indictment; and ordered another indictment to be preferred against them, for breaking the door in the night time, with intention to commit a felony.</p>

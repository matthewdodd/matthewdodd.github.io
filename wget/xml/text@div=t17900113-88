               <p>I keep a book-shop opposite; I saw Mr. Burnett in a struggle; I came over to the breeches-maker's, and he and the prisoner were there; and I took a pair of shoes out of the prisoner's pocket; the prisoner seemed rather to hinder me from searching; I do not recollect what he said; I have had the shoes in my possession ever since: he said he bought them in Holborn; and he wanted sadly to pay for them, and to go about his business.</p>

               <p>I wanted to buy two pair of shoes; I went to a friend's to receive a little money to buy some shoes and other things, and I met with a man who said he came from the Yorkshire shoe-warehouse in Middle-row; and I bought a pair of shoes of him for three shillings; from thence I went to St. Giles's, into this man's shop, and asked him what he asked a pair for shoes; he pulled down several, and I tried on some; I asked him what he would charge me for making a pair? he said, five shillings and six-pence; I said, that is too much; and just as I was going out of the shop, he said, you have a pair of shoes of mine in your pocket; yes, says I, I have shoes, but none of yours, let me go: I was taken to the justice: the magistrate asked him how he knew they were his shoes? he said they were, but he had no mark: the magistrate told him that was not sufficient; that would not do: I bought the shoes.</p>

I defended myself, and told him not to molest me. The prisoner turned round, and spoke to his companions. He and his companions, made a second attempt to take hold of me, and I having some property about me which had been paid me by some merchants in the City, I was determined I would not be robbed. The prisoner made a strong hustle, and go my gold watch out of my fob; he actually took the watch out of my pocket; I collared him with one hand, and seized hold of the watch with the other, and insisted upon his delivering my property up to me again; a scuffle ensued, in which the prisoner was assisted by his companions. The prisoner and I both fell down on the pavement, in which situation, I was very ill used by the prisoner's companions. my head suffered and my body; my coat was torn in pieces. I got up again, and succeeded in wrenching the watch from him; the chain broke, the watch fell; the body of the watch got seperated by the fall on the pavement. I held the prisoner fast, although I received the ill treatment from the others, until assistance came. The body of the watch was picked up, and gave to me. No constable being near. the gentleman who assisted me, helped me to take the prisoner to the watch-house, a Mr. Shearman; he held the prisoner requesting some person to go for a Constable; that constable did not come; some more assistance came of the neighbours; a desperate effort was made by the party to rescue him from the people who had him in possession; the attempt to rescue him, by bludgeons, and sticks, and desperate blows were received by those who held him; the prisoner made a desperate resistance himself to get away, by fighting and beating those about him. He was taken at last to the watchhouse, and there the property was delivered to the headborough.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the case and the body of the watch were separated - A Yes, it is still altogether but in a divided state. The person who robbed me took the watch and chain altogether; he had full possession of it. I seized him by the collar, and fought for my watch. In the course of the scuffle, I said, give me my watch;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260013"></xptr>the case and chain did not fall out of his hand, it was the body that fell out of his hand. Mr. Shearman gave it me again; I did not see him pick it up.</p>
               <p>JAMES SHEARMAN. I live in Church-street, Bethnel Green. On last Saturday night, about half past eight in the evening, I heard the cry of give me my watch; about ten yards from my house; I went out; I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner struggling together. I immediately laid hold of the prisoner, and sent some one to Mr. Jackson, the constable. I heard something drop on the stones.</p>
               <p>Q. On seeing these persons, did you observe the prisoner - A. Yes; I knew the prisoner well before. I never let him go until he was taken to the watch-house. I heard something drop on the stones directly I said the words go to Mr. Jackson, the constable; it fell from the prisoner, as I supposed. I did not see it fall from the prisoner. Mr. Jackson, the constable, would not come and take the charge. I sent a woman for Mr. Hichman, the headborough, and while that woman was gone, another woman picked up the inside of the watch, and gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the case, chain, and seal - 
               <persName id="t18141026-10-person158">A. </persName>
            Yes; I observed it when the prosecutor was wrenching it out of the prisoner's hand. I saw the case, chain and seals, fastened together; I saw them in the hands of the prisoner. I assisted in taking him to the watchhouse; in turning round the corner where the robbery took place, several unknown persons to me made an attempt to rescue the prisoner. I felt them push to endeavour to throw us down. The prisoner would not walk, he made us carry him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any blows pass - A. I did not see any. The prisoner endeavoured to rescue himself by biting my finger; I thought he would have bit it off. I received no blows; there were a great many people about us. I was inside, holding of the prisoner. I cannot say whether there were any blows or no. The prosecutor was walking by the side. My attention was taking up in holding the prisoner, in case he might get away. In going along to the watch-house, we were pushed into an entry; we pulled the prisoner out of there, and succeeded in taking the prisoner to the watchhouse.</p>

             I live at No. 19, Church-street. On last Saturday night, about half past eight, I heard the prosecutor cry out give me my watch, or words to that effect. I immediately ran to the spot, about thirty yards off. I then saw the prisoner struggling with the prosecutor and Mr. Shearman. I immediately laid hold of the prisoner. Mr. Shearman sent for Mr. Jackson; he did not come. My attention was particular taken up with the prisoner. I saw the watch first in the prosecutor's hand; I saw the body of the watch when we got to the watchhouse, not before. I was with them in the watchhouse. The prisoner would not walk to the watchhouse, he cried out as if we were murdering of him. He bit my hand as soon as I laid hold of him. There were a great mob; we were completely pushed about, out of the path at times. I did not observe any blows. The prosecutor received a blow-by the side of his head; I saw the marks of it when he came to the watch-house; who gave it him, I don't know. He said, he had been badley beat when he came to the watch-house.</p>

            . On my road home, on Saturday evening, in Church-street, Bethnel Green, I saw the prisoner make a violent struggle to get away from the prosecutor and witnesses; the crowd made a great struggle to get the prisoner from them, and particularly they had great sticks, which I saw them make use of. I can only corroberate the testimony of the other witnesses.</p>

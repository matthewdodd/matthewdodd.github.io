             was the tenent; it was his goods that were seized for distress of rent. I paid Mr. Ing three pounds two shillings and sixpence, and then I gave the prisoner twelve shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner dispute this - A. Not to me. I settled with Mr. Ing in his presence; the prisoner made no objection. I agreed to let the prisoner have the horse and cart again for the same money; provided he would refund me the money, I would let him have it back again at any time. The horse and cart was delivered to my servant. I told the prisoner he might work for me at three shillings per day, until he could raise the money for the horse and cart. He continued to work for me until the 25th of December, in carting of bricks. He took the horse and cart away an the 25th of December, and sold it. I had overpaid him for his labour according to my books; I desired my man not to advance him no more money for his labour, and then he took the horse and cart away on Christmas day morning. I sent for the prisoner to come to me at the King's Head public-house; he came. I asked him the reason he took the horse and cart away; he said, Mr. Collins would not advance him any more money. I told him to bring the horse and cart back, and if there was any money due to him I would pay him; he said, he would see me b - r first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hat-maker, of 231, High-street, in the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell—on Saturday, 14th May, in consequence of some<lb></lb>thing which was told me, I looked at my premises at a little after 7 o'clock, and found that somebody had got in through the roof and had forced open a window between the workshop and the premises, and de<lb></lb>scended into the workshop—I missed four coats, a pair of trousers, between forty and fifty caps, nine felt hats, two silk hats, an apprentice's stamped indenture, a gold band for a navy cap, a pocket-book, and about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—I had gone to bed about 1 o'clock the night before, leaving that window quite safe, and this property on the premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 34, Angel-gardens, Shadwell—I know the prosecutor's premises; there is a wall between that part and the Irish-court—on Saturday, 14th May, early in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man who has escaped; one was about twenty yards in front of the other—the prisoner was about twenty or thirty yards from the prosecutor's, going towards it—I did not see him go in—the other man got over the wall, and got down inside, and then I lost sight of him—that was twenty or thirty, yards from the prosecutor's house—I had seen them together the night before, drinking at the Gunboat beer-shop.</p>

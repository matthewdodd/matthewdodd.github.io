                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Hunt Burgess, a lighter<lb></lb>man, of Grange-walk, Bermondsey. On Saturday, the 15th of January, I went out about six o'clock in the evening—nobody was left in the house—the windows and door were fastened—I returned in about an hour and a quarter by myself, unlocked the door, and fell over a candlestick in the passage—I got a light, and found the front-parlour very much disordered—I missed a table-cover and a brown mantle out of the front parlour, and from other parts of the house a gold watch, a coat, a pair of trowsers, a waistcoat, a shirt, seven shifts, two petticoats, three night-gowns, two toi<lb></lb>let-covers, one black mantle, and an Orleans cloth dress—on Tuesday, the 18th, I saw them again at the police-office—I had seen them all in the house at six o'clock on Saturday night.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 15th of January I came home shortly after eight o'clock, and missed the things—I had some bills left at Mr. Marchant's, the pawnbroker—on Monday evening I received a communi<lb></lb>cation from him, went there, and saw my watch—while I was there the female prisoner came in to pledge a coat—I did not bear what she said, nor see what she brought—a policeman was sent for—I went to the station with her, and thence to her residence, with a policeman, (leaving her at the station)—we there found the male prisoner—it is a general dealer's shop—we searched the house—I found up stairs, in a drawer in a bed-room, a shift, a petticoat, a shirt, and a toilet-cover of mine, and on the drawers another toilet-cover—the male prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Thomas Marchant, a pawnbroker. On Saturday, the 15th of January, the female prisoner came about eight o'clock in the evening, and pawned a suit of clothes—about an hour after my employer took a gold watch in pawn from her, in my presence—on the 17th we received a printed bill respecting the property stolen, and finding the watch described, I sent our boy to inform Burgess, who came; and while I was showing him the watch, the female prisoner came to pawn a coat and handkerchief—I was told the prisoner was in the shop while I was speaking to Burgess, and I gave her into custody—I left the watch in the care of Mr. Marchant—I have brought it here.</p>

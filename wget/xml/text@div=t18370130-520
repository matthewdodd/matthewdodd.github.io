                  </hi>. I am a bookseller, and live in New-street, Covent<lb></lb>garden. On the 5th of January, about five or six o'clock in the evening, I was serving in the shop, and observed the prisoner at the window, looking at the books—I turned my head, and observed him take two books—one he put under his arm, and the other he held in his hand, and looked at it—I was talking to a person in the shop, and he put the book he had in his hand, down, and said, "You observe I have put your book down"—he then went from my window at a hasty pace—I left the shop and pursued him 500 or 600 yards—he was exhausted with running—I came up with him, and he said, "Here is your book—I am a respectable man, let me go"—I said, "I shall not," and brought him back.</p>

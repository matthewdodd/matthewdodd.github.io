               <p>WILLIAM BIRD. In May, 1829, I lived at No. 3, <placeName id="t18300708-10-crimeloc61">Greville-street, Hatton-garden</placeName>

On the 5th of May, at five o'clock in the afternoon, I placed a trunk, containing seven dozen pairs of shoes, at the end of my passage, fifteen or eighteen feet from the street door, and within the house; the trunk was matted, ready for exportation - I missed it about six o'clock; fifteen pairs of shoes were afterwards found - they were produced here fifteen months ago; I have since sent them to India - I knew them to be part of what I had lost; they were not of my own manufacture - we have a particular way of dressing them up for exportation, and marking them on the toes - I found that fifteen pairs the same evening, at a house in Hole-in-the-Wall-passage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Are any of the shoes here? A. No - I have been twenty-two years in the trade; I knew them to be what I lost when I saw them - I never saw the prisoner in my house; we number our shoes, beginning with the commencement of the year, from Nos. 1 to 20,000 - there was also the manufacturer's stamp on them, but no other mark of my own, except that the silk strings were in them, and I have a particular way of cutting them; the manufacturer is not here - he lives at Northampton.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When the articles were produced, did you immediately recognize them as part of what you packed for exportation? A. I did - I had not the least doubt of them; I could swear to the numbers.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BURGESS. I am a book-binder, and lived at No. 25, New Compton-street - I knew the prisoner by the name of Rushlight Tom, for about six months before this happened, and I had seen Jones. On a Tuesday, about the middle of May, 1829, (I heard of this robbery the same week,) I was sitting in the Swan and Sugar Loaf, about five o'clock - the prisoner came and asked me to carry a box; I said, "Who for?" he said, "Come and see;" I said should I be paid for it - he said Yes; I went down to Bartlett's-buildings, and saw Jones - I said,"Is this the box?" Jones said Yes - I said, "Is it all right?" he said Yes - the prisoner was present, and within hearing; Jones lifted the box up, and told me to take it to White's-alley, which I did, and received 6d. -I was to have 1s.; Jones sent me 5d. afterwards - Jones accompanied me; I rested on the road, and he helped me up with the box - the prisoner also went with me to the house in White's-alley; we separated there - I do not know the contents of the box; it was about five feet long, covered with a matting, and corded - I do not know what became of it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Had not the prisoner been in the habit of occasionally giving you jobs in the way of messages? A. Yes - he has recommended me to a job to carry things; Jones paid me for this - I cannot remember that I ever expressed an opinion that the prisoner was innocent of this.</p>

             DAVIE. I am a widow. On a Tuesday in May, 1829, I lived in Hole-in-the-Wall-passage, and saw the prisoner at jones' - (I had seen him there before, backwards and forwards, bringing different parcels, for two or three years) - this was about five o'clock in the evening; I saw him go to Jones' house - he lived at No. 1 and 1 at No. 7; I was at my own street door - he was alone when he went into Jones'house; I saw him come out, and Jones followed - I saw Jones return with a bundle of shoes, and then I heard of the robbery; the shoes were in a white apron, tied up so tight that I could see the shape of the soles - the passage is narrow, and he passed me; I could see the marks of the heels and toes through the apron - it was a projection of what appeared to be shoes; I heard of Bird's being robbed, and told him I had seen Jones go into the house with a bundle of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080017"></xptr>shoes - this was at a quarter before seven o'clock that evening; Bird went and found them - Jones was taken about half-past eight or nine o'clock that evening, and I saw the prisoner about ten minutes to nine; he just came into Jones' house after he was taken, and went out directly -I heard no conversation between him and any body.</p>
               <p>SARAH IVES. I am the wife of William Ives. In May, 1829, I lived in Kingsbury-place, Gwyn's-buildings, Chancery-lane - the prisoner and Hawkins took an apartment at my house - he went by the name of Thomas Gall; they lived together there as man and wife - I saw them there in company together in the early part of May, and I believe the early part of the week; I saw a tall and a short man take a box out of our house, but I cannot say it was the prisoner, for I was a long distance from them.</p>
               <p>MARIA BROWN. I live at No. 12, Portpool-lane. I believe the prisoner to be the man who came into my shop in May, 1829 - I had never seen him before; Jones came in, and asked if I would purchase some shoes - he had about six pairs in his hand; I said No, they would not suit me, they were a deal too light - he asked if I could tell him where to dispose of them; there was another man in the shop, who I believe to be the prisoner, but I did not know he was with him till he was gone out, and did not see him again till now; I cannot exactly swear to him, as I did not notice him particularly - my boy was in the shop, and called me; Jones came towards me, the other man stood at the back part of the shop within hearing; Jones said he had some shoes to dispose of - I said they would not suit me; he said he had a great many, and asked if I knew where he could dispose of them; I said No, and turned into my room immediately - I never noticed the other person.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TOOK. I apprehended Jones, and I found fifteen pairs of shoes in his house on the 5th of May, 1829, for which he was prosecuted; I know nothing of the prisoner in this case.</p>

On the 9th of July the prisoner came to my house in the afternoon, and called for a pint of beer. The boy went and took a pint silver-mug, and drawed him a pint in it. After that I did not go into the room where the prisoner was for some time, business coming on. There was but one person in that room besides the prisoner. Some time after the prisoner was gone a gentleman came in for a pint of beer. There was in the room a pewter pint-pot, left half full of beer. The prisoner went away, I do not know when, or how. Then I missed the silver mug. About the middle of the next week, a neighbour told me he saw the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street. My son ran, and soon came back again, and said he had watched him in at the Green Dragon. We got an officer, and went and took him. It being late, we put him in the Compter, and he was examined the next morning. He would not own any thing of the matter. We have not heard of the mug since.</p>

               <p>Cardell. I am servant to Mr. Thornton; on the 9th of July the prisoner came into my master's house, and called for a pint of beer; I took a silver pint mug out of the bar, and served him. He took it out of my hand. Then I went out of the house with beer, and to get in pots; when I returned the prisoner was gone. There was only one man in the tap-room when I gave him the beer</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you out?</p>
               <p>Cardell. I was out I believe two hours.</p>

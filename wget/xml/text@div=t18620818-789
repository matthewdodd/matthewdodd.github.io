                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Acorn public-house, Great Cambridge-street, Hackney-road—about 5 o'clock on the afternoon of 9th July, the three prisoners, and another one named Collins, came in together—I refused to serve them, and requested them to go away—the two Collins's and Hamilton left—Pickard remained and became very abusive, he used very bad language; I went round and remonstrated with him, and requested him to leave—I took hold of him by the arm, and he seized me by the collar and bit my arm—I called my man Brent to my assistance—the other prisoners immediately returned together, and Hamilton came and put her arm round me, and then I found Pickard pulling my chain—I still held him back and caught hold of my watch—Hamilton endeavoured to get hold of my watch, with her arm round my waist—her hand was at my watch-pocket, and then a policeman came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman to the last witness—on 9th July, in the afternoon, I went to his assistance when he called me, and saw Pickard holding him, and he holding Pickard—I had hardly made my appearance before the prisoner Collins and his son attacked me very violently, and struck me on the back of the head—that was just as I reached my master, before I had an opportunity of doing anything—they also gave me a black eye—they would not allow me to assist my master, until the policeman came—my master's waistcoat and shirt were torn.</p>

About half-past 5, on the night of 9th July, I was called to the house of Mr. Hodges and found Pickard and Hamilton in there—Pickard had hold of Mr. Hodges' pocket with one hand, and the other hand on his watch chain, close to the bow of the chain, trying to take the watch from his pocket—Hamilton had her left arm round Mr. Hodges, having hold of the pocket as though she was trying to move the watch with the assistance of Pickard—Mr. Hodges' hand was on his watch keeping the pocket close—I immediately arrested both Pickard's hands, and dragged him into the street, followed by Hamilton—I was assaulted and knocked down by Pickard—Hamilton also struck me—they were secured; Collins was secured by Brent—I called another constable to take the woman and he held her till I returned.</p>

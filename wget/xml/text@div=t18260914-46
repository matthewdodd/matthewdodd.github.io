               <p>SUSANNAH LANGFORD. I am the wife of Arthur William Langford - we live in Bateman-street, Bethnal-green. I have known the two Kings eleven years, and Carter three. On Sunday, the 3d of September, about a quarter to one o'clock in the day; I saw them in Shoreditch, coming towards me, and tried to shun them - they caught hold of me, and asked if I would have any thing to drink; I said No, but Mary Ann said, "Oh, come in, and have something;" I went, and we had a glass of gin each by the turnpike - Mary Ann then asked me to walk home with her - we went into the Green Man public-house, but drank nothing; we then went to the <placeName id="t18260914-46-crimeloc273">Salmon and Ball public-house, Chequer-alley</placeName>

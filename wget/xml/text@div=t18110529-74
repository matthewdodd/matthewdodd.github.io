On Easter Monday, in the morning, the prisoner came to my shop, accompanied by another woman; the other woman came first, and then she went and brought this one; she offered some clothes for sale, and by their appearance I had no doubt they came honestly by them; they gave me a sufficient account as I thought that they came honestly by them, after that I purchased them.</p>

            . I am a watchman at the Seven-dials. Between nine and ten o'clock, on the evening of the 25th of February, I took the prisoner with this tea-pot under his coat - he was going down to a house where they buy such things - I took him into custody, and charged him with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up Earl-street, and a boy asked me to take the tea-pot and sell it for him - the watchman took me - I turned round and shewed him another boy; he sent another watchman after him, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FOXALL. He did point out a lad without a cap, who ran away - he said he (the prisoner) was going to sell it for him - he was taken but was discharged by the Magistrate.</p>

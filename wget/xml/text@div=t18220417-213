I was quite sober - I suppose a man robbed me, for about two hundred yards from where I missed it, a man came out of a dark passage, and ran against me, as if by accident; he fell down, begged my pardon, and ran off. Before that two woman accosted me just as I left Tower-hill, and asked for something to drink; one of them was much taller than either of the prisoners - they both went away in less then a minute.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Brick-lane. On the 23d of March, about eight o'clock in the morning, Barrett offered this watch in pawn; seeing it was a valuable one, and the papers being taken out; I asked her whose it was; she said,</p>
               <p>"I am sent with it;" immediately after a man came in and said it was his watch, and that he bought it of a friend; he immediately went out and never returned. I detained Barrett. About an hour after Sullivan looked into the shop; I was told she was connected with her, and so I took her.</p>

I went to bed last on the night of the 10th; my windows were all secure when I went to bed, and the door on the spring lock. I was alarmed between three and four in the morning; I heard the footsteps coming cautiously up stairs; it was rather day-light. I always sleep with my bed-room door a little open. Hearing footsteps, I pretended to be sleep. The prisoner came and looked at me, as I was in bed. My bed-room was on the first floor. I saw it was a tall dark man. He then went into the front room; and then returned again, as there was nothing there worth his taking; he then came and looked into my room again, and seemed to hesitate a long time; he did not come into the room, but went down stairs into the shop. I then got up cautiously, and went into the balcony, and beckoned to people in the street, telling them to come and surround the house, as there was a thief in it; I saw a young man, and asked him to go round the corner, which way the prisoner got in. When the prisoner found the house was surrounded, he went into the back parlour. threw up the window, unfastened the shutters, and jumped into the court; and in a minute he was brought in custody. When I had leisure to observe, I saw marks on the door-post as if a crow had been used, and the screws were loosened in the lock. After he was in custody, I found that two table-spoons were gone, which had been on the sideboard in the back parlour; and six tea-spoons, which had been in the same place; the table-spoons were old, and were worth about eighteen shillings; the tea-spoons might be worth three or four shillings each; and the pepper caster tops worth two or three shillings.</p>

I perceived that there had been force used to the door; I pulled it to, and held it; in about two or three minutes, I heard the window in Castle court open; I saw the prisoner come out of the window; he got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130068"></xptr>about one hundred yards before I caught him.

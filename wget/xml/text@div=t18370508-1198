                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Royal Academy. I saw the prisoner; and perceiving she was rather differently dressed to the other people, I watched her for an hour—there was a man with her, who shortly after left—she went from one room to another, apparently look<lb></lb>ing at the pictures, when, all at once, she made a dead set on the prosecu<lb></lb>tor—wherever he moved she moved with him—she attempted several times to put her hand into his coat-pocket—in the middle room I saw her put her hand into his pocket, and then take from it a purse—she put her hand into his left pocket first, and then took the purse from the right—she was about to move away—I said, "What have you taken from that gentle man?"—she said, "Nothing"—I moved her round, and saw the purse at her feet—I said to the gentleman, "You are robbed, Sir"—he said, "Yes, I hare lost my purse"—this is the purse—the first place I saw it was in her hand, when she drew it from his pocket.</p>

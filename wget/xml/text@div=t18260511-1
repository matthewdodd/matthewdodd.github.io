I called to the horses to stop, and the man who asked me the way ran and stuck my fore horse through the nostrils, with a pen-knife or something - I ran to the tail of the waggon; two of the men jumped out, and just as I got to the tail the prisoner jumped out; I knew him before, by his frequently following my waggon of a night, but did not know his name. I went to seize him, but he knocked me down; when I got up my horses were running round, in confusion; the men were running away - one of them called out, "We will serve you out - you know Sam Morris;" I got into the waggon, and found a cord, which fastened the sugars, cut in six places. My hat had fallen off when I was knocked down - I looked about, but could not find it - I have not seen it since; I cannot say who took it - if it had been left on the ground I must have found it. I described the prisoner's dress and features to Mills, and on the 13th I went with Mills to a public-house in Grub-street, and saw him sitting on a bench in the skittle-ground - when he saw me he turned his back towards me; I went and looked him in the face, for about a minute, then came to Mills, and said I could swear to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BARRY. Q. On which side of the road was your waggon? A. On the near side, against the rails - it is the darkest side of the road. I had two horses - I did not see the man cut the horse, but I found its nose bleeding; the watch was not set at the time. I told Mills I had frequently seen the prisoner lurking about the carts. My master had hand-bills printed, offering a reward. I said nothing about the man being deformed - I never noticed that he was deformed.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 13th of April I went to the Weavers' Arms public-house, Grub-street; Bettridge came out of the skittle-ground, and said the man was there, and he could swear to him. I then went to the prisoner, and said I wanted him; he said he knew nothing about it. As we went along he said, "Sam has got a heavy sentence" - I said, "Yes - I wonder he had not more." Samuel Morris had been transported for seven years, for robbing the prosecutor's employers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he introduce the subject of Morris' conviction? A. Yes. The prosecutor described the prisoner's dress and countenance - I had my doubts; I knew the prisoner, and should have taken him from that description.</p>
               <p>Q. What were your doubts about? A. I did not doubt - if I said so I did not mean it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I frequent the Weavers' Arms; and about six weeks ago Mills apprehended a man there with a chest of tea - it was the subject of conversation in the house, as Mills resorts there; I asked him how the young man got on - he said he was transported for seven years; I said, was it not a heavy sentence. On the 8th of April I went home between six and seven o'clock, and never went out till ten next morning; any one who has seen me once could recognise me again, on account of a deformity in my hand. I cannot cut my victuals, much more knock a man down.</p>

            . I work for Mr. Mitchell, a typefounder, and live in Mitchell-street, St. Luke's. The prisoner has lodged five years with me. On Saturday, the 8th of April he came home between six and seven o'clock, and never went out till next morning - I am sure of it. I lock the street door every night, and must have known if he had gone out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did you lock the door? A. About eleven o'clock - he sits with me - I was at home all the evening; we drank our beer together. I do not know where he was on the 1st of April - I remember the 8th of April, but cannot tell why, except that I stopped at home that Saturday night, which I am not in the habit of doing; my sister fetched the porter - the prisoner went to bed about eleven o'clock; we supped about a half-past ten. He brought in some bullocks' sweet-breads, and we had them for tea.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What makes you remember the 8th of April? A. I had to pay the interest of a duplicate at Mr. Sowerby's, in Finsbury-square - I did that about twelve o'clock in the morning; my husband and a young woman were with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the young woman? [hesitating] A. It was the prisoner's sister,

               <p>JURY to RICHARD BETTERIDGE. Q. Did you say you knew the prisoner before? A. Yes - I have repeatedly seen him lurking about my waggon, and he generally had his hand in his pocket, so that I did not notice its being deformed. I am positive he is the man.</p>

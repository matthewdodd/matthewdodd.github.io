I met the prisoner; we both met one another: we were both coming contrary ways. He made a rush towards me, and at the same instant he seized my watch seals. My watch being tight in my pocket the chain broke; the prisoner went off with the seals, and I followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. He went off with the chain and seals did he - A. Yes, he crossed towards Middle-row, and I followed. He seeing that I was pursuing him, he crossed over again; he turned down Gray's Inn Lane; when he had got down Gray's Inn Lane, he made a stop between two or three people. At that instant, I came up and seized hold of him, and I held him until a watchman came up. He was taken to Eagle-street watch-house. The constable did not search him there. He sent him down to St. Andrew's watch-house, and in that time there was an hour and a half elapsed.</p>
               <p>Q. Hand over your watch; so the other part of your chain you lost - A. Yes. I had two seals to it, and a watch key. I never lost sight of the prisoner. When I laid hold of him, he said I was going to rob him; he was perfectly innocent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Did not you say that the man who run against you you lost sight of him, and you only saw his hat when he turned the corner of Gray's Inn Lane - A. I think I did say so to the officer as we were conversing together.</p>

            . I had been up to Oxford-street with Price, to see his sister home; and on our returning home, in Holborn, a man made a snatch at his watch. I did not see the man snatch the watch. I heard the chain break; he ran away, and Price after him. I lost sight of him. I could not keep up with them. I saw him turn the corner of Gray's Inn Lane, and when I came up, Price had got hold of him.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I saw the prisoner examined at St. Andrew's watch-house, Holborn Hill. The prisoner was given into my charge to take him to the Compter; in going along he endeavoured to make his escape. He was stopped by a watchman in St. Paul's Church-yard; I came up to him, and took him to the Compter. At the watch-house, the prosecutor said the prisoner had made a charge against him in Gray's Inn Lane; and if he had not done that, he would not have given himself so much trouble. He said, they had charged each other.</p>
               <p>Q. to Price. When you stopped this man in Gray's Inn Lane, what did he say - A. He said, what do you mean by this behaviour, by laying hold of me. I said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181209160044"></xptr> you have robbed me of my watch chain. He called me a villain, and said, I will charge the watchman with you; and after I had made the charge, he made a charge; and the watchman took one in one hand, and the other with the other.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Sunday afternoon, I took a walk to Houndsditch. I met some friends; I walked with my friends to Holborn, where we separated, and just as I turned down Gray's Inn Lane, I was stopped by this man. I was going up to Mr. Perkin's, in Gray's Inn Lane, to receive twenty-four shillings. I gave charge of the prosecutor for stopping me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called ten witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

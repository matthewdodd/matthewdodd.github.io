            , lives with me. On the night before the robbery, which was on the 26th of January, I remember going to bed, about ten o'clock; my sister was the last person up - we went to bed much about the same time, and left the doors and windows all secure; I had a watch in my possession, which I left over night in the table drawer in the parlour below stairs; I found it gone in the morning when I went to look for it; I got up about nine o'clock - when I first came down we found every-thing as we had left it the night before, as we thought, and I had my breakfast; I missed the watch as soon as I came down, about nine o'clock, and looking about afterwards I found the bricks had been taken out at the end of the house, and an opening made large enough for a man to get in at - I have since had my watch shown to me, and know it again; (looking at it) - this is it; there was the word "Aberdeen" on it, and I find that there now.</p>
               <p>AMELIA POND. I am sister to the last witness, and stop at her house sometimes. We went to bed nearly together on the 26th of January - I fastened the house up myself; there was no hole in the brick-work then - when I got up in the morning, after some time, my sister's watch was missing - on examination a hole was found in the brick-work; I had gone to town, and it was bricked up before I returned - I had not seen it before I went; I had left some milk in a jug in the back kitchen, and when I got up in the morning the milk was gone, and I found beer in the jug - I know my sister's watch; I had taken it to Ogston, the watch-maker, to offer to sell it to him, and he was to come to the house to look at it.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody in February, and while he was in my custody this watch was delivered to me; I afterwards attended before Dr. Creswell, the Magistrate, and heard the depositions given by the witnesses, in the prisoner's hearing - nothing whatever was said to induce him to make a confession; I heard what he said before the justice, saw it taken down, and saw Dr. Creswell put his name to it -(read.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time lose any thing out of your shop - A. On the 4th of June, there was a piece of floor-cloth in the shop, in the morning part; I saw it there myself; I cannot tell the hour; there was no one but me there I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards is this piece of floor-cloth - A. Eighteen yards; it is of the value of between three and four pounds; it is worth upwards of three pounds. We did not miss it at all. I went out of town as I usually do, and when I came to town on the Sunday morning, my servant, who was left in the care of the house, gave me some information.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday you saw it in the shop - A. Yes. I came to town on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it at any time on the Monday - A. Yes; I saw it at the office in Queen-square, on Monday morning; it was then in the possession of the constable, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, before you went out of town on Saturday had you sold it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the floor-cloth that you saw in the possession of the constable the same that you saw in your shop on Saturday - A. Yes, I am certain of that; I know the floor-cloth to be the only piece, from the maker; in the next place, it is a pattern of my own. I do not know that we had cut a yard off, and it is the usual practice of my foreman to put a chalk mark inside of the number; it has that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060004"></xptr>chalk mark on it now. This is the chalk mark, that the foreman always puts on; it corresponds with our stock-book. There was a ticket upon it; that is torn off. and here is the King's mark, 168, the Excise mark. We only had one piece of this pattern. By the chalk mark and the Excise mark I am certain this is the piece.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in Princes-street, Westminster. I have known the prisoner about nine or ten years; he was a respectable man, a publican I have known him in two public-houses. He kept a public-house since I have been in my house. On Saturday evening, the 4th of June, between eight and nine o'clock, he came to my house; he had this piece of floor cloths. I am sure it is the same, because I put a mark upon it myself. He opened the door, and said, how do you do, Mr. Swan. I said, how do you do, Mr. Payne; what have you got there, and where are you going to take it. As I understood him, he said, over the way. He asked for a pint of half and half. He asked me to roll it up to the bar, as I supposed, while he drank it. My servant brought him the pint of half and half. I went to get a poundsworth of change; during this time he drank the pint of half and half, and was gone, but had left the cloth. I looked at the goods; seeing it was not tied, I thought it was not honestly come by. I informed the officer of it. Green was the officer that came round. It was in my custody from that time until the next morning, and then I delivered it to Green. I put my name upon it, and I cut this piece out of it. I am sure it is the same. I delivered it to the officer, and said, for God's sake, do not take any body up until he knew it was stolen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is not your bar a conspicuous part of your house - A. It is very public; if any body came in they must have seen it perfectly.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday the 4th of June, I was going with the picquet between ten and eleven at night; I called at Mr. Swan's. Mr. Swan said, here is a piece of oil-cloth, Green; Mr. Payne brought it here. The floor-cloth remained until Sunday morning, the 5th, then I took it away. I watched the house on Saturday night until Mr. Swan shut up. On Sunday morning, I got up, and went to the house before Mr. Swan opened the house. I saw Payne go into the house; he called for a glass of gin; he said, I have called for the oil-cloth. I said, Mr. Payne, I want you and the oil-cloth too; this oil-cloth is stolen. He turned white, and trembled, and could hardly drink the glass of gin. I took him into custody, and took him to Tothill-fields. I came back, and took the oil-cloth away to my own house. This is the oil-cloth.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am satisfied that the oil-cloth is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the oil-cloth; it was leaning against the back of the Sessions House. I took it, on the Saturday night, to the first public-house; that is Mr. Swan's. I left it there until Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>JURY, to Prosecutor. Do you place these things outside of the door - A. Never.</p>

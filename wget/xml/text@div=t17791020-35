I told her I was very well; she asked me if I would go with her a little way up the alley, for she wanted to speak with me; I went with her, and she took me into a house in <placeName id="t17791020-35-crimeloc183">Gravel-lane</placeName>

               <p>Are you sure of the person? - Yes; I was as sober as I am now. I asked her what she wanted with me; she said she wanted to be concerned with me; I told her I had no desire for a woman, though I was weak enough to go with her; every man is fallible and liable to be drawn in, as they lie so in wait. I went into a room with her but had no connexion with her when I was in there with her, as I told her I had no desire of any connexion with her; she said I must give her something; I gave her sixpence in silver, and five or six pennyworth of half-pence; I then told her as I had no desire of any such kind of person, I would go about my business; she told me I must pay for the use of the room; I told her I had no more, or no more to spare, I am not certain which; she immediately called out to somebody by name, but I do not recollect the name; upon which the other two prisoners rushed in.</p>
               <p>Are you certain as to their persons? - Yes, as sure as day-light; when they came in they said, so you will not pay her for the use of the room, blast your bloody eyes! you shall pay, and instantly seised me and threw me down upon the bedstead that was in the room; I do not know whether there was a bed on it or not, and threatened to murder me several times.

As soon as they got my money, they all ran out at the door in the back part of the house that goes into Pump-alley; in their hurry they dropped a shilling, which I picked up; I pursued them and never lost sight of Davis, excepting while she turned the corner of a wall; I took her in a house at the bottom of the stairs; there was a passage through the house, but the person who belonged to it had stopped it up the day before; the other two ran up stairs. Some assistance came, and they were all taken and carried to the publick-house; they wanted me to take my money again and make it up; I would not, but sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>From Davis. Whether he did not take me into a publick-house and search me where it was not proper for any man to search? - She was not searched.</p>

I was sent for to assist Withers, the constable, in taking the prisoners; we searched them, but found nothing upon them; we took them to the Mansion-house; after the hearing was over, they offered the prosecutor a guinea and a half if he would not prosecute them; he said before the hearing, if they would give him a guinea and a half there should be no more of it; they said after the hearing, they would give him a guinea and half, but they would not before.</p>

               <p>This man took me into a publick-house and used me very indecently; I pulled my things off, and he searched me all over; he said she has not the money, but I think I can swear to her. I asked him if I had been in company with him; he said no, but I was concerned and had never been out of his sight; now if I had never been out of his sight, and had taken the money, I must have had it about me.</p>

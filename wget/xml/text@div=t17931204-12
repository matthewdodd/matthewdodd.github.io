               <p>Q. Where did you leave them then? - In the building.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a new building, or a house repairing? - A new building.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them all immediately before you left the house? - I cannot say immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you within an hour? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. The door, I take it for granted, was not fastened? - I cannot say for all the day, we keep the door shut.</p>
               <p>Q. But it is usual for persons to come in and out? - It is, but we are so strict, that we shut the door.</p>

               <p>Q. I have not a doubt but you think so. Do you think if you had left these tools and gone into the country for a few days, or for a few hours, that you could have picked them out from amongst others? - Yes, I could; I have got a mark on them that I know them by.</p>

               <p>I took these three planes of that lad Bowyer, on Saturday the 17th of November, about eight o'clock at night, in Cherry Tree-alley, it leads into Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe them to be the same? - I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. You said, I think, that they are in the same kind of cloth that you bound them up in, you did not make any particular observation of the kind of knot you made in the cloth? - I tied it a seaman's knot.</p>
               <p>Q. In contradiction to what they call a grandmother's knot. You know that a great number of people can tie a seaman's knot as well as an old woman's knot; therefore you cannot take on yourself to say on your oath that that is the cloth from the knot you tied in it; it might for ought you know to the contrary, be untied and tied up again.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know the jack plane, I can swear to it, here is a mark on it, I run it against the bench hook, and took a piece from one side of it; the raising plane is mine, I am sure of it, here are some shavings underneath the fence, besides I have had it a number of years; I know the plow plane, I made the wedges to it, and the stop likewise.</p>
               <p>Peat. Mr. Blackburn you are a journeyman? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently you are not connected with any body in business at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they not the most common of all sizes for planes of that sort? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And I suppose two or three thousand workmen may all have planes of that size; you have seen a great number yourself? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very possible any other workman might have run his plane against the iron as you have described? - It is</p>
               <p>Q. The one you know, because it has got a parcel of shavings underneath the fence; you might as well have said, that you knew it as well from the taste? - I know it also from the wedges.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the wedges made of, that you know them so particularly? - Of Beech.</p>
               <p>You did not cut it out of a particular tree, that there is a particular grain in it? - No, it is a common beech wedge.</p>
               <p>Q. It is rather a singular way of knowing wedges of your own making, it is a common size wedge? - No, it is not; it is rather larger than common.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bowyer. I found them as I came from Hackney, along with this young man under a dead wall.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Bowyer called three witnesses to his character.</p>

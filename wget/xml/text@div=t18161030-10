Then he came out of the shop with it. There was a person in the shop writing at a desk; that person could not have seen the prisoner come in, because his back was turned. When he came out, he fell down wiht it, by the weight of it; it was a very large roll. He was in the act of taking it up again; in the mean time, I went into the shop to acquaint the person of it; he came out, and we took the prisoner into custody; he was taken to Mary-le-bone watchhouse, and the cloth was taken away at the same time.</p>

            . I was in Bond street on the 27th of September, As I was coming up Bond-street, I saw the prisoner at the bar with his hand upon the oil-cloth; it stood on the curb-stone. With that the prisoner went into the shop of Mr. Hare; the old gentleman who had been writing took him in. with the assistance of the last witness. With that I picked up the oil-cloth, and took it into the shop.</p>

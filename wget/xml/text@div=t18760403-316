                  </hi>. I am a metal turner, living at Cottage Road, City Road—I know the prisoner—I remember her coming about ten weeks before my being stabbed—there was a quarrel between some of us and she was sent to prison—when she came out of prison she came again to the house—I attempted to turn her out—I recollect her coming about 1.30 on the morn<lb></lb>ing on which I was stabbed; she was half sober—I was in bed—she knocked at the parlour door and my mother told her to go away—she burst open the door—I spoke to a policeman—I laid hold of her for the purpose of turning her out and she stabbed me—I did not know it was a stab until the next morning—I put her outside on the door step and she hit me on the face—I saw the blood on my arm and found it was a stab—my lip was out—the policeman was there at the time—she was taken into custody, and the doctor afterwards attended me—I saw something glitter in her hand, but could not sec exactly.</p>

The prosecutor has been out of employment and he and his mother have been living on my means. He asked me to live with him. My case is to be pitied. I did draw ray knife in the excitement of the moment and cut him.</p>

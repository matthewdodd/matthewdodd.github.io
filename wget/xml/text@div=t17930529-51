             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a journeyman to Mr. Sherwood. On the 1st of May I was informed that we had got a thief supposed to be taking the property belonging to my master, I was alarmed and I went according to the information given me, and found him in my master's shop; I says to him you have got something here I think that don't belong to you; he made for answer, never mind, being very much intoxicated in liquor; I said, that will not do, we have been accused several times of thefts that we have not been guilty of, and my master has cautioned us, if we could find out the thief, he would make an example of him; my shopmate said let us take it out of his pocket; I said, no, let charge be given of him; I then left him in the situation he was in, with several more shopmates, and ran over to this gentleman Mr. Feild and brought him in, and told him to take charge of him; I did not see the hobbing taken out of his pocket; I gave charge to the constable; the prisoner was a journeyman to Mr. Sherwood, and had been three or four months.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had information; how many might there be at work in your shop at this time? - Sixteen or eighteen; we are not exact as to number.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me you had information; was it given in the hearing of the prisoner? - It was not, it was given by our own people; they are not here.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no more of your people here? - No more.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290102"></xptr>Q. How do you know that to be the property of your master? - This hobbing I have noticed several times, being a particular thing for the purpose we had used it for; I cannot tell how long we have had it; I know it from the levelness of it, and the goodness of the steel and iron.</p>
               <p>Q. When that was taken from the man's pocket, can you say there was one missing? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why did you take it to be your master's? - By the knowledge of it, in the account I have given to your lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. Had this man been at work that day? - I don't think he had.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him in the shop, how came he in the shop if he had not been at work? - That is out of my power to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass except that which you have mentioned? - When I brought him to the door he said, don't hurt me; I said I am afraid you are hurting yourself.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that to be your master's? - I cannot positively say any more than this; I have seen the tool in my master's shop; I was not at the buying of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, do you know that tool by its weight? - Yes, I believe I do.</p>

               <p>Q. Tell me why you think so? - Because it is reckoned the best tool in the trade.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom? - By them that are judges in workmanship.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are they? - I myself for one.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not other tools of the same description used by other gunsmiths? - There are</p>
               <p>Q. Of the same size? - I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever weigh it? - It is thirteen pounds as nigh as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever weigh it? - I have heard the weight of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever weigh it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290103"></xptr>Q. Did you ever measure it? - I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there the same kind of tools made of the same materials for other gunsmiths? - I believe there are.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know it by the taste, smell or colour? - I can tell it by two out of the three, by the smell for it is oily, and also by the colour.</p>
               <p>Q. You admit you do not know it by the weight nor the measure; is the colour peculiar? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it whiter, blacker or browner? - It is rather whiter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not tools as white as that? - I never saw one more clearer, or more whiter.</p>
               <p>Q But there are many tools as white as that, and as you are a very good judge of grammar, iron that smells as sweet and as sour, which ever you please; you may scratch your head you will find nothing there; let us know in what manner you know that tool to be your master's; I admit your master might have a very good tool of that sort, but tell me how you know that tool in your hand; tell the jury how and why? - In the first place I know it by the end of it, for I made remark of this end at the first.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us know how you know it, you have such a flippant tongue; you tell me you don't know it by weight, nor measure, nor the smell, nor taste, nor colour; tell us what you do know it by? - I do know it by the smell.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ever work at it yourself? - No, not myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Tell us what you know it by in plain language? - I have told his lordship all that I know about it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When you came home did you find any hobbing had been missed? - I did; I looked directly as I came home at the bench where this hobbing should have been.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen it any where should you have known it to be your's? - I should by the sight; I am satisfied it is mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Will you permit me to ask how you know it by the sight; that wants some explanation; let me know how you know this; give me some better reason for this? - Just the same as I should know you from some other gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. That will not do, and I will have a better reason before I have done with you? - I know it by the sight of it, the same as I should know you.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very true, that every man has got a nose, and eyes, and chin, and therefore you may know him to be a man; there are other tools used of this description by gunsmiths? - Not many.</p>
               <p>Q Then you are the only gunsmith that uses these kind of tools? - I am not a gunsmith, I am a gun lock maker, and there is only me and Mr. Nock on Ludgate-hill.</p>
               <p>Q Do you know its weight? - I see it weighed when I bought it; I think it is thirteen pounds and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you weighed it since this man was charged with this fact? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this tool a peculiar little size, or a peculiar large size for the purpose for which it is used? - It is a large size.</p>
               <p>Q And you take on you to say on your oath that this tool is your's? - If there were five thousand and that was put amongst them I would pick it out.</p>
               <p>Q How would you pick it out? - By knowledge of it; it is impossible for any man living to make a fellow to it.</p>
               <p>Q Then I would be glad to know why they cannot make a fellow to it? - That has been worked upon for many years, and without damage which very few have.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179305290104"></xptr>Q. Then it is impossible that an instrument of that weight, dimensions and every thing the same as this can be worked upon without damage, and you know this tool it is impossible there should be such another in the three kingdoms, or perhaps in the world except in France, and that we know nothing about? - There cannot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, I was in the shop at work, I had been drinking in the morning it is true, we had been paying for beer towards birth days, I had had my coat off it is true, with presence to go to work, I did do a little and but a little; when I went to put my coat on I found it very heavy, and while I was putting my coat on the gentleman's apprentice seized me and put his hand into my pocket to see what was there, and found my master's property in my pocket it is true, and it is not the first time I have found things in my pocket, and who the person was that put these things in my pocket I cannot tell, and what I am challanged with I am innocent of.</p>

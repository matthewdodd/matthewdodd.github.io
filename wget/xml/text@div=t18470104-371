                  </hi> I am a greengrocer, and live in Bush-lane, Cannon-street—I take care of Mr. Gibbs' office, in Scots'-yard—the prisoner came to me the first week in December—he asked if he could see Mr. Gibbs—I told him he could not, as Mr. Gibbs was very ill, and had not been at the office for some weeks—I told him there was a gentleman named Meery, who was in the habit of coming to take Mr. Gibbs' letters and messages, and he would see him shortly if he would wait—he said he was going to the West-end, and he would look in the next morning at eleven o'clock, or one—he came about eleven, and asked me if the gentleman had been—I told him no—he said he would go to the Bell public-house, and I saw him accompany Mr. Merry from the public-house.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to William Spears and Co., of Great Win<lb></lb>chester-street, but I was acting as clerk to Mr. Edward Gibbs, my uncle, at Scots'-yard—I have been in the habit of going there once or twice a day to get letters—I went there on 2nd Dec., and received some information form Mr. Spicer—I saw the prisoner the next day at the public-house—he said, as we walked along from thence, that he had come from Messrs, Harpers' for some wire—I asked him if he had brought an order from Messrs. Harpers—he said he had no order, that they had sent him for some wire, being in a hurry for it, and they would send the order in the morning for that, and also for a further quantity—I asked him who the Messrs. Harpers were—he said at the Jerusalem Coffee-house—I looked at my uncle's papers, and found there were receipts from them—I was making out the invoice for the wire, and I made it 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the prisoner said, Messrs. Harpers only pay 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said I would send the invoice in the morning—that was 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a bundle of wire—I gave him a bundle of wire, and he said Messrs. Harpers wished to have samples of some iron wire—he took samples of iron wire with him, and a bundle of fourteen pounds of cop<lb></lb>per wire—I delivered that to him in consequence of his representing that he came from Messrs. Harpers, and in consequence of that only.</p>

                  </hi> I have one partner, we keep the Jerusalem Coffee-house—the prisoner was in my service, he left me on 28th Nov.—I had sent to Mr. Gibbs for wire—I don't think I ever sent the prisoner, but I was in the habit of having, wire, and he would be acquainted with that—I did not give him any authority to go for any wire on the 3rd Dec.—he had no such authority from our house at all at the time—I was in town on the 3rd of Dec.—no order could have been given him to fetch this wire without my knowing it—I did not receive any wire.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever, in point of fact, give him any order to fetch wire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot recollect—we carry on the business of wine-merchants, and want the wire for corking down the beer—the head cellarman superintends that part of our business—he and the men under him would use the wire—the order to any person to fetch wire would not come from the head cellarman—it comes directly from the clerks, and is given by myself—it is a printed order, signed by myself—I have given the order to any of the men who might be at liberty at the time—I may have given it to the cellarman, and he might have sent the prisoner for the wire if he was disengaged—I did not hear the prisoner tell the policeman that the cellarman gave him the order.</p>

On the 23rd Dec, about twelve o'clock at night, I was in the high road, near Edmonton—I saw Baldwin drive a cart, loaded with cabbages, of Mr. William Walker's, and three horses, up to the door of the Horse and Groom, and stop—in a short time, Castle, who is ostler there, came out of the house, and Baldwin said to him, as he got on the top of the load, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, will you have</p>

               <p>some cabbages?"—Castle made some reply, which I did not hear, and at the same time Baldwin commenced throwing cabbages from the top, one at a time, till he had thrown nineteen—Castle placed them carefully against the stable door—Baldwin came down from the top of the load and went towards the door, and as he went in, he said, "Jack, have them boiled against I come back"—I went up to Castle, who stood by the cabbages, and asked him what he was going to do with them—he said he was going to throw them up again—he said, "The carter is inside, I will go to him"—I said, "No, you shall wait till he comes out; did not he throw them down, and you take them up?"—he said, "Yes, it is but a small thing; look over it, and have, a drop of gin, or anything"—I waited till Baldwin came out, and he said he threw them off to put them behind the cart, as the cart bore down—I said that could not be—I took him to the station—he begged very hard to be let off, as it was the first time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you secure the nineteen cabbages? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I put them on the hind part of the cart, and carried them to the station—there were three horses to the cart, not two, as stated in the deposition—I do not affect to tell all the words that passed, when Baldwin was joking about having the cabbages boiled—Baldwin went into the house to get some refreshment—there was another wagon there, but it went away before tbii commenced.</p>

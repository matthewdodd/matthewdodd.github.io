            . I am a rope-maker, and live in Leonard-street, Shoreditch. On the 10th of December, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I met Gleed, Handly, and Patrick, at the Angel, public-house, in Whitechapel; Gleed searched me and King, and found nothing on us; he gave me six shillings, a sixpence, and two-pence, which he marked under the head; we all proceeded to a public-house, in White Lion-street, while King went to the prisoner's lodging, and returned with her; she said,</p>
               <p>"I have got what you want;" I had seen her on the Saturday before, and agreed to meet her on the Monday; I came out of the house; she gave me twenty counterfeit shillings in a paper, and held her hand out; I gave her 6 s. 8 d. for them, and put the twenty shillings in my pocket without opening them; she said, she had seen King before, and spoken to him about some half-crowns; and she would get them for me in a moment, if I would stop; Gleed was on the opposite side of the way; he came up and took her in charge; Patrick took the shillings out of my pocket; the prisoner was searched, and the marked money I gave her, found on her.</p>

I did not miss the grater till an hour after, I thought I had put it in my pocket; there had been nobody in the bar but my mother; my husband came in very soon after, and I told him of it. I never found the grater, nor I should not know the notes.</p>

               <p>Q. When were they before the Justice? - A. A fortnight and three days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband went to Mrs. Hester the same evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had put the grater upon the table? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought you had put it in your pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And it might have dropped out? - A. Yes, but that it certainly never did.</p>

I have a seat in the front; I got down, and saw the prisoner with two pieces of stuff he had taken out of my master's cart; it is a covered cart, and locked behind; he had got the cart open; the cart was going along. I made a blow at him with my whip; he threw them down in the kennel, and ran away; there were three of them. I pursued the prisoner, and never lost sight of him till I took him.</p>

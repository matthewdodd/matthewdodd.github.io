                  </hi>. I am a porter at the Bricklayers' Arms station. On 20th Dec. I saw the prisoner Waghorn there with a van—he came for twenty-four sacks of wheat—I helped to load the wheat—the distance between the wheat and the beans might be three or four yards; they were on the same platform which was continued between them, bat there was other grain between them—when Waghorn came with his van, he backed it up to the platform, so that we run the sacks with what we call a hand truck—I did not assist to put the whole twenty-four sacks in, I helped to put four sacks in—my fellow servant said, "What do you want to make four <hi rend="italic">riders</hi> for? why do you leave this space at the back of the van? why do you not put one more sack in behind, instead of making four <hi rend="italic">riders?</hi>" (<hi rend="italic">riders</hi> are sacks that lie on the top of the sacks that stand up)—Waghorn said that his van load would be too heavy behind, or words to that effect—when they were all loaded, the space behind was still left—I went to sign for delivering them, and Cormack went to his work—I went to No. 10 platform, which is, very likely, fifty yards from the van—Waghorn came shortly after me, he signed for receiving them—he went away—I saw no more of him.</p>

I received some information about Waghorn, and on that evening my father spoke to him in my presence—he asked him where the sack of beans was that he had to dispose of—Waghorn said he had had no beans—my father said he knew he had a sack of beans to dispose of, and he must tell him where they were—Waghorn said, "They are at Mr. Baker's"—he then said, "I will tell you the whole truth about it; I found them on my waggon on Thurs<lb></lb>day last, as I was coming home from the Willow-walk (the Bricklayers' Arms station)"—he said he made the discovery as he was coming down the Mile End-road—he said he did not know how they came on his waggon, but he believed they must have been put on at the station—my father said he must know whether they were put on at the station or not—he said he did not know—my father asked him whether they were in the body of the waggon, or thrown on the top—he said they were in the body of hie waggon—my father said he must see the beans; and my father, and I, and Waghorn, then went over to Baker's—my father asked him to show us the sack of beans that Waghorn had left there on Thursday—Baker said he had not got them—my father asked him where they were—Baker said, "I do not know"—Mrs. Baker, Baker's mother, then came in, and said that Wag<lb></lb>horn had left the sack of beans there on Thursday, stating that Mr. Baker had asked him to bring them for him from London, and that they were left in Baker's absence—my father then asked Baker whether he had sold them—he said that he had not—my father asked him whether he had removed them, or ordered them to be removed—he said, "No"—my father then said he must know what had become of them—Baker then said, "Mr. Samuels has them, of Robin Hood-lane, Poplar;" and he said that he would accompany my father over to Mr. Samuel's to see the beans—we left the shop, and shortly after Baker came over to my father—as we were leaving the shop, I heard some conversation, and Baker said to Waghorn, "Did you not say you would take 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the beans?"</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the R division, and am attached to the Brighton Railway. On the night of 26th Dec. I went to Mr. Wood<lb></lb>ham's premises—I found Waghorn there—I told him I was a police officer, and had come from the Brighton Railway respecting a sack of beans he had stolen from there, when he was over there on Thursday last—he said that he knew nothing about them, and did not know they were on his waggon until he was in Mile End-road—I said, "It is no use your saying that; if you found them on your waggon by accident you would have brought them home to your master, and not have taken them and sold them to Mr. Baker, who has since sold them to Mr. Samuels, of Poplar"—he made no reply—I said that he must go with me to Mr. Baker's, and I and Richards and Waghorn went to Baker's—I did not find Baker there—I went in search of him, and found him at the Five Bells public house, at Bromley—I called him out, and told him I was a police officer, and that he must con<lb></lb>sider himself in custody for receiving a sack of beans from Mr. Wood<lb></lb>ham's carman, Waghorn—Baker said, "He left them at my house when I was not at home"—I said, "But you have since sold them to Mr. Samuels; if you had done as you ought to have done, knowing that Wag horn was in Mr. Woodham's employ, you would have communicated with Mr. Woodham directly"—he made no reply—I took him to his own house, where Waghorn was—I told Waghorn he was charged with stealing, and Baker with receiving, and they must go to the station with me—Baker said, "Yery well, come along"—I got this sack of beans from Mr. Samuels, and produce them, and also a sample of the beans in the other nineteen sacks at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police constable at the railway station. I took Waghorn, with the last witness, on 26th Dec.—on the way to the station Waghorn said he should like to see his wife—I told him I was going to search his house—he said "What for?"—I told him, to look for the sack the beans were in—he said, "It is no use for you to go there, it is not there; I either took it back to the Bricklayers' Arms station or it is in the van at Mr. Woodham's"—he said, "It is the van that is under the shed, with the wheel off"—he said it was the one that was at the Brick<lb></lb>layers' Arms, and had broken down—I went there, and found this sack, which has Mr. Hoadley's name on it—it was on the seat of the van—he said that it was the railway porter's place to count the sacks as they shot out, and said, "I don't know whether I put it on or they put it on, and that is the truth."</p>

On the 18th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I was returning from work, and was going for a bason of soup, to a cook's shop close by, and saw the prisoner plainly by the glass lamp; he struck me a severe blow in the stomach, and used very vulgar expressions and oaths, took my bonnet off my head, a shilling from my hand, and my handkerchief off, which was pinned round my neck - he said nothing to me, he was quite a stranger - I could not cry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240041"></xptr>out, the blow was so violent, but I ran to the watch-box, which was ten yards from the spot - he continued beating me all the way, had hold of my arm, and almost broke it, he held it so tight - the watchman got him from me with difficulty, my arm has been in a mortified state ever since. The watchman could not manage him, he did not get from him; three more watchmen came and secured him - I have not been well since it happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the watchman get the bonnet and handkerchief from him - A. No; there was a number of them there, who threatened what they would do if he was not let go - one of them came up, and the bonnet was found in the passage of the house where I live, with the ribbons torn off; I did not see what the prisoner did with it - the blows I received prevented my observing what he did with it - The handkerchief has never been found.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the man who came up and threatened what he would do - A. It was a woman; she came up as the watchman was taking him away - I am sure of the prisoner's person.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Whitechapel, my box is about 300 yards from Alderson's house. On the 18th of October, about half-past eleven o'clock, she came running down crying out Watch! Watch! and the prisoner was running after her - she ran up to me, and said I am in danger of my life, she had neither bonnet or handkerchief on; he ran up to her, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, I will kill you;" and hit her two or three times, he caught hold of her arm, and if I had not hindered him, I think he would have broken it - he said "D - n your eyes, I will knock your brains out;" I secured him, he was never out of my sight. She said he had robbed her of a shilling, her bonnet and her handkerchief off her neck - I sprung my rattle, got more assistance, and took him to Whitechapel watch-house, which is about 150 yards off - he was then taken to a more secure place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any persons interfere with you - A. He was so very outrageous, I could only attend to him, it was as much as I could do to hold him; when he was taken to the watch-house, he was obliged to be handcuffed, or he would have torn the place to pieces. Alderson seemed very much frightened, and said she was much hurt - I think the prisoner had been drinking, but he knew well what he was doing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came home at twelve o'clock from Hyde-park corner, where I had been to carry a box, I came into Rosemary-lane, this woman came up, and asked me to go home with her, I said, "No, I do not want you;" she followed me to Red Lion-street, and then sung out for a watchman, and said I took her bonnet away - I said I knew nothing of her bonnet; I told the watchman she wanted me to go home with her. The watchman hauled me about, and struck me over the eye, with a stick - they took me to the watch-house, and tied my hands together. I know nothing of her things.</p>

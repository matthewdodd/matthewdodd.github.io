There were nothing found upon her, I had never a lodger at my house when my things were taken away.</p>

               <p>Hankin. In a back parlour. I went to her in New-Prison, and asked her how she could serve me so to ruin me thus; the answer was, I can't bear to hear you talk of ruin, if you will have patience till my father comes up, all shall be made up; she told me she had a cozen on the other side of the water, if I'd go and fetch him, she would down of her knees to me, and say something that shall give you both satisfaction.</p>

I saw her pull out of the buroe, one or two of the drawers, where I was I could see every corner of the room she was in, there is no blinds to the windows, I did not acquaint any body with this, till I heard Mr. Hankin was robbed; she went out that day and back again in about an hour, and after that out and in again, all after this affair.</p>

I saw her take nothing out; but the flap was down: she was searched in mr. Hankin's parlour by her own desire, on the 16th in the evening; she and I had some talk together, I said, I'll shew you the posture you stood in.

I went to the justice's house, but the prisoner was not brought there; he there shewed me the buroe and the place; the witness out of a pork-shop saw her at the buroe; then the sun shone, it was about three o'clock; but I think nobody could distinguish a person at that buroe from that place. I heard the prosecutor say then, he'd hang her right or wrong.</p>

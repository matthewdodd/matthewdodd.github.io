            's house - I occupied the garret. On the 24th of January, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I heard a noise over-head, got up, opened the window, got out, and observed a man on the roof - I called to him to know his business, but got no answer. I saw the lead which covered the window ripped up from the gutter; the tiles were moved - the lead was not taken away. I saw two men running over the adjoining roof, I pursued them along Warwick-street, over ten houses, to the corner of Berwick-street; I there lost sight of them. I returned, dressed myself, and went and told the watchman. I went on the roof again and met Parker. A man ran from the window, which had been broken open after I was first on the roof - we pursued, but lost sight of him, but found a watchman on the roof had taken him. The nails were taken out of the lead; it was completely separated.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. How long before had you seen the lead safe - A. Not for six months. It was ripped up. I found a ripping chisel on the roof next morning.</p>

            . I am a private watchman at the corner of Berwick-street. I heard a noise about a quarter past twelve o'clock, as if something was falling, and ran immediately to see what it was. I found a man lying flat on his back, groaning, as if he had fell, it was the prisoner, Bywater - he had dropped from the scaffold of a house, which is partly built, at the corner of Berwick-street. I secured him, and asked what he did there? he made no answer.</p>

After Bywater was secured I went up the scaffold, put my head through the trap-door of the house, and called to the man to surrender, or I would run him through the body - Windsor was there; he said he would surrender rather than be killed. As we came down the ladder he pushed my comrade down and escaped, I pursued and secured him.</p>

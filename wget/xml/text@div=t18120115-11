               <p>Q. What is the prisoner, do you know him - A. No. I was standing at the kitchen window washing, a pistol was fired at the window, had I been standing forward I must have been shot in the head; I heard a whizzing on the top of my head, I thought it was on fire.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this - A. Half past nine at night.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark of course - A. Yes. I went to my neighbour,

               <p>Q. What reason have you to suppose that he did this on this particular day - A. He owned himself to me in my kitchen, he said he was very sorry, and he was very glad no further accident happened, he was firing at the cats.</p>
               <p>Q. What degree of light was there on this day could any body see to shoot a cat at that time - A. It was very dark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. What sort of a kitchen was it you were in - A. It was paved with brick. The kitchen door was open at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. And the window were the pistol shot came in was shut and the door was open did you ever find any bullet - A. No. I did not search, I was too much frightened; my neighbours came in and searched about, they found no bullet.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us you heard a whizzing, was that the case - A. I heard a noise; two squares of glass were broke, one had a round hole in it, and the other a hole, and it was cracked; I am sure the hole was not there before.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any quarrel with this man, had you - A. No, I never spoke to him; I once spoke to his wife concerning the firing.</p>
               <p>Q. How far does he live from you - A. Sixteen yards. I have measured it since; the back of his house comes to mine; he is a housekeeper in the neighbourhood.</p>

            . I live opposite of Mrs. Earle. On the 10th of September, after I heard the pistol go off, Mrs. Earle came in, I went over and saw the windows broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner do anything - A. No. I heard him say afterwards that he was glad he had done no more injury.</p>
               <p>- WOOD. I am an officer. It was half past ten when I went to the prisoner's house, I knocked at the door, the prisoner's wife opened the door; I told her I wanted to speak to Mr. Dixon; she said he was in bed. I broke the door open and found Dixon undressing himself, he told me he would blow my brains out; I told him to fire away. I apprehended him; I took him to Mrs. Earle's house; I shewed the prisoner the window and the situation in which Mrs. Earle stood; he said he was sorry, and was very glad no more harm was done, or else his life must have suffered for it. I produce the window. This is a round hole, and there was another round hole in another pane of glass; it must have been done by the shot or the wadding. I found the pistol in his own house, loaded; I drawed the wadding the next day, there was an ounce and three quarters of small shot, and paper wadding, it was rolled up hard at the time; it might have made the hole with the wadding.</p>

               <p>Q. Would the wadding have done any injury - A. It might, if it was close to Mrs. Earle, if she was so close as she says she was to the window, if it had struck upon the head or the body not covered it might have done hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. I need not ask you whether small shot would make such a hole as that it must be either ball or wadding - A. Yes, it must.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I received no answer - he was not at home, but came home after us; I went into the parlour first, found a chest of drawers with all the locks forced open, and out of one of the drawers I missed a sovereign, a half-sovereign, a gown, two table-cloths, I also missed a coat, a waistcoat, two pairs of trousers, a pair of glass salts, four pairs of stockings, one pair of which I had seen safe that day, three silk handkerchiefs, one cotton handkerchief, two lace caps, a purse, and a bag - I had seven keys in the bag, which was in the back parlour; I had not seen them that day - there was about 23s. in silver in the bag with the keys, and a few halfpence; the rooms were all ransacked, and the things all thrown about - a Pembroke table, the drawer of which was locked, was turned over and broken all to pieces, and up stairs all Reed's drawers and things were pulled about in the same manner; in the back kitchen I found all the things pulled out of the drawers, the cupboard, and every place- an old hat was found on the bed I sleep in, with hay in the crown of it; a Police-officer, of the T. division, has the hat; an old pair of boots were left in the front kitchen, which Reed occupies.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 30th of January I saw both the prisoners in company and conversing together - they passed me about half-past nine o'clock in the evening; I turned round, thinking I knew Kelly's face - I followed and stopped them near the Pontefract Castle, in Chapel-street; I felt Ringrose's coat-pocket, and said, "What have you got here?" - he said, "I will show you;" he immediately made a bob, and began running - I called to my brother-officer, and told him to follow him: (I had met my brother-officer, and told him I was watching them;) he caught hold of him - they struggled together; I took hold of Kelly - We brought them down to the station-house; as we went along Kelly said to Ringrose,"You have brought me into this - if I had known this, I would not have come out with you;" on arriving at the station-house, I searched Ringrose, and found three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170009"></xptr>tea-spoons, and a caddy-spoon in his coat-pocket, a butter-knife, and thirteen keys in a silk bag; one is a street-door key, five are skeletons, the others are common ones - there is a bunch of small keys; the skeleton keys are to unlock doors - they have no wards; I found a phosphorus-box and matches on him - he said, "I suppose, Thompson, the less I say now, the better;" I told him I wanted him to say nothing to me - I searched Kelly, and found a skeleton-key in his pocket, also a pair of stockings, and a silk handkerchief I took from him - that was at Harcourt-street station-house, where I first took them to - when I took the key from Kelly, I said,"This is all wrong;" he said, "You had better take my head off" - I locked them up in the cells at that station, while some supper was brought for them, and while they were there I had forgot to search the arm of Kelly's great coat - I brought them out again, and took them to Marylebone station, and there I took off Kelly a brown great coat; he was wearing it, also a new black waistcoat, this duster, and a silk handkerchief, and a pair of new boots off his feet; the inspector found in the brown coat a blue cotton handkerchief - I did not see that found; I afterwards went back to Harcourt-street, recollecting I had not searched his arms - I looked down the privy where I had locked them up by themselves, and found a crow-bar there; I went and compared it with the impressions on the doors and places at the prosecutor's house - they had been done with this crow, or one exactly the same size; the street door had been splintered a great deal, but one mark I compared with it- I then compared it with the impressions on the parlour door; it fitted them - it is called a jemmy, but I never saw one like it; I never saw one wider, and I think not so wide without having a claw to it - all the marks in the house appeared to be made with that instrument; there was not only the impression of the sharp point, but of the round part in the door - I believe that to be the instrument that made the marks.</p>

               <p>Ringrose. At the office he said there had been a person in the lock-up place before us, and he did not search that man, and could not say which left the crow there. Witness. I did not; I had seen a drunken man carried there - he was quite a gentleman; he was taken into the cell - I went in directly after and found the crow-bar; the gentleman was searched before he was put in there, and all his property taken from him, because he was so drunk.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you make a practice to search the place after every prisoner? A. No; there was no soil on it - it was quite clean; the privy is made on a descent, so that it stuck, and if it had been there any time there must have been soil on it.</p>

On the day mentioned, being on my return from Hampstead, where I had been to look after work at a master's that I was in the habit of working for, coming through James-street, on my road home, I found a bag, in a hollow part of the road, near Chapel-street; about five minutes afterwards, Mr. Thompson, a Policeman, came up, and asked what I had got - I instantly told him I would show him what I had got, and, without waiting for an explanation, he took me into custody to the Police-station; I instantly produced the bag, and the contents being produced was found to be the property mentioned in the indictment, of which I was entirely ignorant of: with respect to this most serious charge, as it affects mylife, I most solemnly declare I am innocent of it- I have always maintained an unimpeachable character for honesty, and never been before this or any other Court of Justice in my life, on any charge of this nature before; I have, besides, an aged mother, entirely dependant on me for support, likewise a wife and two children in the utmost state of destitution at present, therefore I humbly hope you will take my case into your consideration, and not consign an innocent man to an ignominious fate, for I am totally innocent of the crime imputed to me - I leave my case entirely in your hands, fortified in the innocence of my cause.</p>

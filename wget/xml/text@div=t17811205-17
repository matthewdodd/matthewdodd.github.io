               <p>My husband's name is Thomas.</p>
               <p>What have you to say? - I let her the ready furnished lodging.</p>
               <p>When? - I don't know the day of the day of the month; she had been in them three weeks; I gave her some work to do a fortnight before; she had it, and did not return it, and I asked her what was become of it; she said she had pawned it; she is a mantua-maker; I went to seek further into the room, and the goods were gone. </p>
               <p>Did you lose any thing else? - I lost most part of the property out of the room; an officer was fetched about this being pawned; he went up stairs, and found the things entirely gone out of the room where she lodged.</p>
               <p>What things? - There was a pair of blankets; the pawn-broker has returned them.</p>
               <p>What else? - One pair of sheets.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not in this indictment?</p>
               <p>Clerk of the Arraigns. There are two indictments.</p>
               <p>Court. Why were there two indictments drawn upon the precise same offence?</p>
               <p>Clerk of the Arraigns. The offence was repeated upon two different days; the one on the third, the other the fourth.</p>
               <p>Court. Confine yourself to what is in this indictment.</p>
               <p>Witness. One window curtain.</p>
               <p>Any thing else? - One copper saucepan, one copper tea-kettle, and one flat iron.</p>
               <p>Do you know from your own knowledge all those things had been in her lodgings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see those things? - I had not been in the room some time, before she was taken up and carried to the Round-house.</p>
               <p>When was she taken up? - The same night.</p>
               <p>You have not told us when it was.</p>
               <p>In this case you must fix the day, for there are two indictments upon separate days, the days become material. You can't fix the day? - No, the officer can.</p>
               <p>Were they found again? - Not till brought to the justice's the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Who were they brought by? - By the pawn-brokers.</p>
               <p>Were you present? - She gave an account where the things were, and what they laid for.</p>
               <p>Before she gave that account, was any thing said to induce her to confess, that it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050040"></xptr> would be better for her? - It was mentioned, but she did not seem to take much notice of that.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing before that was mentioned? - No.</p>
               <p>All you know, except from her confession is, these things were missing from her lodgings? - Yes; she was not gone out of the house.</p>

               <p>Have you brought the things? - Yes; a copper saucepan, a copper kettle, a flat-iron, and a curtain; I took them in of the prisoner at the bar at different times.</p>
               <p>You must specify the times? - I took in the saucepan the 3d. of October, and the kettle the 15th, the curtain and flat-iron another person took in.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the things you took in yourself? - The things are valued at 2 s. in the indictment that I took in.</p>
               <p>Are they of that value? - They are worth more than that.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was of the prisoner you took those things? - Yes; I am very certain of it.</p>
               <p>Whose did she say they were when she pawned them? - She said they were her own.</p>
               <p>Did you know her before? - Yes, she has frequently pledged them at our house.</p>
               <p>What did you lend upon them? - I lent 2 s. 3 d. upon them.</p>
               <p>Have you no doubt it was the prisoner here who brought them? - No.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I would have got all the things the next day. I had no work to do. I told her she should have all the things upon Saturday. As they took me up on Saturday night, I had not time to take them out of pawn, or I should have returned them to her.</p>
               <p>Court. This is an indictment for stealing several articles mentioned in the indictment to be of small value, about 3 s. 6 d. stealing in her lodging room let to her by

            ; and this offence is made felony by a particular act of parliament. It was doubted before at common law whether it was more than a breach of trust, because of the things being lent to a person, and they lawfully in possession, but to prevent this mischief of people stripping ready furnished lodgings, this act made it felony. - The question is, whether she took them out of the lodging with an intent to purloin or steal them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn-dealer, and live in Winchester-place, Gray's Inn-road. On the morning of the 7th of October I was passing from the stable-yard, by the side of my house, and saw the prisoner run<lb></lb>ning away from the door—he was close to the step when I first saw him—he had a bag of oats on his shoulder—he ran round Manchester-street—I followed him right across the street, behind Zion-house, into a doorway—I went back, and afterwards saw him run again—I stopped him, and brought him back—he said he had bought three pecks of oats at my house—I gave him in charge, and measured the oats, there was 2 1/2 pecks—I had such oats in the first bin from the shop-door—I called the woman down who attended to my shop—she said, in his presence, she had not sold any all the morning—he said he had paid a half-crown and sixpence for them—that is the price of three pecks.</p>

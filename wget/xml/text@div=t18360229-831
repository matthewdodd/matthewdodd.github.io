                  </hi> I am shopman to Mr. Moginie. On the 18th of Fe<lb></lb>bruary, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and asked for change for sixpence—I saw it was bad—I put it to my teeth, and bent it nearly double—I said, "If you wish six pennyworth of halfpence, You must bring me a good sixpence"—he took it and went away—I saw an officer and told him of it—he followed the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman C</hi> 18.) I saw May; and in consequence of what he said I went after the prisoner, And overtook him—when I came to him he was bending the sixpence straight upon the sheep peas, and he said, "I'll be d—d if I won't pass it yet"—I took him to the station—I searched him, and found one sixpence in his hand and another in his right hand trowsers pocket—the one in his hand was the one he was straightening.</p>

I got possession of the money at the station, and have it now—I asked the prisoner if he had any more about him—he said no, he had flung them all away—I asked where he got them—he said he found about a pound's worth in a little bag—I asked him where he had thrown them—he said, in Smithfield, among some hurdles—I went there and found a bag, but no money.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I and two more were walking towards London bridge—I said to one of them, there is a little bag and something in it—he took it up, and there was two half-crowns and some sixpence, about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all, and we divided it among us—I did not know it was bad till I went to this person to change sixpence, and we were all three taken—the other two got acquitted.</p>

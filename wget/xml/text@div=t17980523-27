               <p>Q. How does the sand-bin stand? - A. It is like a bench, and he fell with his left side against it; the prisoner then said, d-n your eyes, you old b-r, I will jump upon your breast-bone; and then we got him into the bar as soon as we could.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he die of that accident? - A. His breathing was very bad; I bled him, in hopes that might relieve him; in the morning I found it had not relieved him; I suppose, from his age, his lungs were unsound; he had had a cough sometime before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you clear that he died of that accident? - A. I have great reason to suppose he died from that accident.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he then sensible that his last hour was approaching? - A. Yes, very sensible; I asked him how it happened, and he said, the prisoner had got a pint of beer, and had drank part of it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230023"></xptr>filled his pot out of another man's pot that was standing by his; the deceased said, you have taken another man's beer, that is not your beer; upon that, the deceased went to lay hold of the pot, to fill the other man's pot up again, they spilled part of the beer in the scuffle to get it away, and the prisoner threw the remainder at him, he pushed him over the breast, and he fell upon the sand-bin upon his side, and that he had broke two or three of his ribs, he believed, which will be the occasion of my death, says he, that I shall never be able to come down stairs any more; that is all that I know.</p>

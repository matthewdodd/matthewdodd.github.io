               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner at the bar - A. Ten years. He was a <rs id="t18130714-19-deflabel117" type="occupation">stock-broker</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you employ him in the year 1809 to purchase stock for you - A. I did, in November I believe, 1809; he was to purchase stock in the Long Annuities, at ten pound a year, more or less. I gave him the money to buy that. I gave him between one and two hundred pounds. I cannot exactly remember the sum. He undertook to make the purchase.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did he give you any paper printed receipt - A. Yes. I gave him the money in the morning; he came in the evening, and gave me this paper either that day or the next day. This is the paper he gave to me. There is my mark upon the paper, at the back. I put this mark to it after I had been to the Bank. It was never out of my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you find that any thing was wrong - A. Not until he was gone. I applied in the April following. I got my dividend at the Bank. In October following, when I came to compare my receipt with the Bank book I found I was wrong, but I am not the loser by it; he had placed the money there.</p>
               <p>COURT. You went in April and received your dividend, did you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you receive your dividend in October - A. Yes, and ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the sum of ten pounds four shillings was properly transferred into your name - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that sum was properly transferred into your name before you made any enquiry about that money - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge when the prisoner left town - A. I cannot say to a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave town before April - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. During that long acquaintance have you been acquainted with his hand-writing - A. I have seen his writing repeatedly. I do not recollect that I have seen him write his name. I think I know it, I have seen it so often.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that receipt, and tell me whose writing you believe the body of the receipt to be - A. I cannot say. I believe the word, Hucknall, stock-broker, to be his writing.

I know his hand-writing perfectly; he is proprietor of stock in the Long Annuities, and was so at this time. I have seen him write many times.

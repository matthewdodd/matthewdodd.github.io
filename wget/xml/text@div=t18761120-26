               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SAMUEL</hi>; Behrexd I am a solicitor of Bucklersbury—I knew the prisoner intimately in business when I was an articledclerk—my engage ment necessitated my seeing him from day to day—I was admitted in 1812 <hi rend="italic">from May</hi>, 1868, to July,1870, I saw him continually—when I first joined him—his practice was small. but he developed it by his own efforts and energy, and when our connection terminated it was an exceed ingly good one—possibly over 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he was remarkably fond of his children—he used to bring them to the office on satruday mornings continualy, and frequently took them out with his wife on the satruday afternoon after business hours—up to the time of his going abroad I belive he lived on the best trems with his wife—in those days my experience of him was eminently favourable—I ceased to see him in july 1870, and hardly saw him again till the spring of 1874—I cannot say I noticed then any tokens of his indulgence in situlants—Inoticed a very great change indeed, and was very much grive to observe it—I was staying with him in the country for a couple of days in the spring of 1874 and noticed a very great change—I do not know that I saw him tipsy, but there was something strange about him—he was not what he used to be—his mental capacity was very much inferior to what it had been—at the time of his wife's judicial separation he asked me to look after his interests, which I thought had been much neglected by him—I did so—after the decree had been pronounced he called upon me occasionally—he continually referred to his children—whenever they were spoken of he seemed to get into a state of frenzy, and in conversion on other subjects he seemed unable to pursue a correct train of thought and said all sorts of extra-ordinary things not at all likely to be true—I do not think he was capable of understanding matters of business—as to the particular act for which he is charged I cannot say very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew him intimately from 1868 to 1870 daily—his intellect was then perfectly right-he—must have been elever to develop his business—I do not recollect in 1874 how often I saw him;. in the Spring I saw him for a short time, about a month, frequently; he was altogether changed—he did not seem to be as acute" or clever——altogether a changed man; changed in his notions on morality for one thing—when I knew him before in 1868, I considered him. a particularly moral man—his ideas on morality seemed to have changed—to some extent, he understood matters of business—I believe he was doing business; he was in-partnership with another gentleman; he perfectly understood what I said to him and also, I should say, what he read——if in 1874 he read a letter from the manager of a bank telling him to draw no—more cheques he could have understood that—in the condition he called at my office shortly before</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187611200035"></xptr>
               <p>being arrested he could not have understood anything—shortly before his arrest he used to come to me in the evenings——I never had' occasion: to discuss with him matters of right and wrong—I am quite aware he did not understand the difference between moral right and: moral wrong—he did not seem in his right mind, within a week of his apprehension—he called several times, within three weeks of his apprehension—I have heard the case to-day; I should hardly like to say he was not aware he was doing wrong at the. particular time of the offence, but I am quite sure that at the interviews he had with me about that time he was not capable of understanding, the difference between moral right and moral wrong.</p>

               <p>capable of exercising discretion as to right and wrong in reference to commercial affairs—that would he in March, 1876—I have had corres<lb></lb>pondence with him since but do not think I have seen him—his correspon<lb></lb>dence was most incoherent—he made appointments to meet me at places he knew I never went to, and which he knew I could not keep—at considerable inconvenience I have been to meet him at places, and he never kept the appointments he had made, and when I have mentioned it to him he seemed to have forgotten it—I offered to pay the expense of sending him out to New Zealand and of bringing him back, for the purpose of restoring him to health—I persuaded his wife's friends to agree to suspend the Divorce pro<lb></lb>ceedings during his absence—when I made this offer to 'him he appeared deeply affected, and I hoped it would have had the effect we wished—he led me so to understand and I told his wife—when I saw him again, in two or three days he appeared to have forgotten that I had ever made the offer and I had to recall it to him——for more than twelve months I never could get him to a decision on any subject—I saw him in Newgate once, after he had been under the care of the doctors.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Before then I saw him probably two or three months previously—at the time he was drawing these cheques I was in correspon<lb></lb>dence. with him, but did not see him—I have heard the trial and have heard the letters read—I have heard the letter he wrote about the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—it is intelligible—I should say if I had not known the man it was the letter of a man who knew what he was about—I think he has not been responsi<lb></lb>ble for his actions—my judgment is that he was not aware he was doing wrong, and that in the many similar instances that have come to my knowledge he has had no consciousness a few hours afterwards of acts he has per<lb></lb>formed—in May, 1874, I insisted he should have a managing clerk with full control—in October, 1874 I thought that not a desirable arrangment; because bis name appeared—in May, 1874, I thought he was no longer capable of conducting business and I insisted on having a clerk—in October I sent for him and endeavoured, knowing a solicitor of eminence in his profession, to get him to make some arrangement; but it was absolutely impossible to get him to any terms or to discuss terms—I' therefore, upon my own responsibility asked a solicitor to act as his representative—he did so until February, 1876, when I found that the prisoner had got into such a state he was no longer a credit to anybody, and I then desired him to cease his connection with us altogether, which he did—I must have seen him about April or May, 1876, and had one very long interview—I did not see Mm frequently since we corresponded—two years ago, October, 1874,1 went to his father and begged him to put him under restraint—I have seen in the papers that he has passed in the name of "Colonel Scudamore "—I did not know it in any other way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale shoemaker at Uxbridge. The prisoner was employed to work on leather at my house, but not to take it home—I went with my foreman to the prisoner's house, and saw some lea<lb></lb>ther found there—some in the back attic, some in the back bed-room under the bed, and some in the cupboard in the front room.</p>

Some of these pieces of leather are piece soles, some liftings, and a pair of uppers which are for women's boots, not for shoes—this leather is worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I cut the pieces out myself—I know them to be my master's—they have my own handwriting on part of them—I went with the prosecutor and con<lb></lb>stable to the prisoner's house, which is about two hundred yards from my master's—I knew he lived there.</p>

On the 10th of October I took the prisoner and searched his house—I found the leather produced and a quantity more—he said Mr. Milton could not swear to it—he had brought a great quantity from Hemel Hempstead—he did not say whether he brought this—I saw his wife—she said that one of the rooms in which we found the leather was let to a lodger—I know the room which is oc<lb></lb>cupied by the prisoner and his wife—I found some leather there.</p>

The Prosecutor came back, and said he had been robbed, &amp;c.

They had dropp'd in the house a bag of leaden square balls, and some gun-powder; we also found a pistol charged with slugs under the place where Savage had sat, but they had at that time taken him into another room to search him. There were five guineas and one shilling taken from Savage.</p>

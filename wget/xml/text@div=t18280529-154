Between the 26th of August and the 1st or 2d of September, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked for a pair of trousers; I showed him thirty or forty pairs - none of which he approved of; he said, "I want a very good pair;" I went and borrowed some; he said they would not do; he at last left me a shilling earnest on a pair which he had looked at at first, and went away; the moment he was gone I missed a pair which I had borrowed; there was no other person in the shop, and no customer for two or three hours.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Then I take it for granted, you had some doubts about the man? A. None in the least; I said my son was in the shop, passing and repassing; but I am certain he was the man; I know it was about that time, because in July I sent for my son from America, and in August he arrived, and was at home; I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

On Sunday, the 27th of April, myself, and Carter and Robertson, agreed to go to Mrs. Pead's in Whitechapel-road, which we did between the hours of twelve and one in the night, and with an iron-crow we forced the corner window shutter, that corner next Mile-end turnpike; we took down the shutters and broke a square of glass; then Carter got half-way into the window and could get no farther; he said there was a parcel of wires before him that he could get no further; then he came out again, and Robertson, and me and Carter put our hands in as far as we could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300004"></xptr>reach, and took out several papers of stockings, and a small sample of sewing silk of various colours and some thread, which we conveyed to the house of Mrs. Starr the same morning; me and Robertson went in, and Carter stopped outside the door; Mr. Pauling was in the shop, and Mrs. Starr sitting backwards; she desired me to come to her, we had the property in a bag, and she took it backwards into the wash-house; we shook them out upon the bricks, there were children's black stockings, and children's white cotton stockings, and other colours; I asked her four guineas for them, she gave me three; me and Robertson came out, and told Carter, that we got but fifteen shillings for them; he was standing over the way, in an Alley; we gave Carter five shillings, and Robertson and I divided the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any stockings amongst them like these? - A. There were some of them of the same sort, I cannot say that these are the same.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you taken up? - A. In June; and then I gave information against Robertson and Carter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You got three guineas from Mrs. Starr? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought there had been some honour among thieves, but you gave Carter but five shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been in this Court? - A. I was here twice last Sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. Those are the only times? - A. This is the third time.</p>
               <p>Q. That is all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you here before? - A. It is so long since that I cannot recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. You can recollect whether you were a prisoner at the bar, or a witness? - A. To the best of my knowledge I was a prisoner then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you tried here then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What for? - A. They told me I had stole a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Jury believe it? - A. Yes; it seemed so.</p>
               <p>Q. You were convicted, were not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And imprisoned for it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - A. I believe it was two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you whipped too? - A. Yes, I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only time you have been in Newgate? - A. That was the only time.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say, the moment this robbery was committed your conscience smote you, and you gave information? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, perhaps, that by giving evidence to-day, you save yourself from being tried? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had a country jaunt - you were never tried at any Assizes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Pead. There were three pair of stockings that I lost, exactly corresponding with these in size, and in the clocks, but there are no marks upon them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first mention to anybody that you had seen him on the Monday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We were talking about the case in our shop, and about his saying he had not been near the place, and so on, and I mentioned to our foreman that I met him at the top of the alley—I do not know whether is was on the Monday or Tuesday that we spoke about it, or Wednesday; it was before the Thursday—that is all I can say positively—I did not mention it at all to the police; our foreman mentioned it to them—6 was the proper time to go in to work, but I was too late for 6 that morning, and could not go in till 7—if you do not go in at 6 they do not let you in till 7—I do not think that there were any other men who were late that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at No. 1, Jewry-street, Aldgate; that is about twenty minutes' walk from Northumberland-alley—I have known the prisoner for about six years—I knew his wife as well—I have attended her for over six years—I have seen Mrs. Humbler at the house, but did not know her by any name, only as the servant of Mrs. Gardner—on Monday morning, 15th September, Humbler came to my surgery a few minutes before 8 o'clock—she had with her a child of between two and three</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270047"></xptr>
               <p>years of age—she seemed in an agitated state, and said, "Oh, do come directly, Mrs. Gardner has cut her throat"—I immediately went with her to Northumberland-alley—I followed her upstairs to the room on the first-floor—there is only one room there—when I went into the room I saw the body of Mrs. Gardner lying straight on the ground, parallel with the bedstead—the windows of that room faced the door; on the right-hand side, immediately as you enter, there is a little space of about twelve inches, and in that small space Mrs. Gardner was lying; beyond that small space there is a recess in which stood a four-post bedstead; the bedstead goes backwards towards the wall, and the foot of the bed faces the window; the right-hand side of the bed is against the wall—the deceased's head was close against the door-post, the feet were lying perfectly straight and parallel with the legs of the bed<lb></lb>stead—she had only a flannel vest on and a chemise—I placed my hand immediately on the body—I placed my hand first on the thigh, and found that it was quite cold—part of the body was warm, just the lower part of the trunk; the upper part, the shoulders, was quite cold.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, how long had life been extinct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said I thought she had been dead four hours—I did not examine the throat at the time—I noticed the position of the hands; the left hand was on the chest, the fin<lb></lb>gers towards the throat, and the fingers were a little contracted—the right hand was also on the chest, and held a knife—the body lay perfectly straight—I did not notice the elbow at the time; I afterwards noticed that there was an impression, a sooty impression on the left elbow, and also on the left wrist, on the inside; it was plainly, as I mentioned to the Coroner, a digital impression, finger marks, sooty—the mark on the elbow was an irregular mark—the throat was cut, and there was a pool of blood under both sides of the throat—there was no blood below the upper part of the body, none below the collar-bone—there was a good deal of blood on the floor on each side of the throat, and it had run under the back; the wound on the throat was about two inches and a quarter in length, from the apple of the throat down<lb></lb>wards to the shoulder on the left side; it was about an inch and a half in depth—I considered that it commenced from the front of the throat, and went downwards and inwards towards the spine—it was deepest externally near the shoulder—such a wound might have been inflicted by the knife I saw.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment was it such a wound as the woman could have in<lb></lb>flicted herself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She could not have done it with her right hand.</p>

               <p>hand, would the hand have been contracted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would have been firmly grasped round the knife—the hand was clenched up to a certain point, but not so as to make it difficult to get the knife away—when the prisoner took the knife, I am not certain whether he passed it to me or put it on the table—he immediately looked across to the woman Humbler, and said, "You wretch, you have done this"—Humbler then fell down upon her knees, and called God to witness that she knew nothing about it—I did not notice the prisoner's taking the child—I said I would not have anything moved till a constable was fetched—the prisoner said nothing, but left to fetch a constable—he took the child with him—there were several chairs in the room, but one particularly attracted my attention at the foot of the bed—there was on that chair a wedding-ring, a brooch, with the likeness of Mr. Gardner, also some valentines, and some other letters unopened—there was a table in the room opposite the door—the things in the room were quite orderly.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see any marks of any kind upon Humbler, any marks of blood on her clothes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw her hands examined by the policeman in my presence, and I did not see anything upon her hands, except dirt—they did not appear to have been washed for some time—there was no blood on the bed clothes that were covering the bed—the sheet appeared to have been pulled or dragged down, and a portion of it was lying underneath the body of the deceased—after the prisoner left, Mrs. Spencer came in, and the policeman soon after—the policeman took charge of the things on the chair, the valentines, letters, the ring, and the likeness—I had previously examined the walls of the room; I did not examine them thoroughly—several marks were pointed out to me afterwards that were not there when I first examined—those marks were pointed out to me on the Friday morning; several of them I am quite sure were not the room previously—one of those marks was on the wall on the other side of the bedstead, the right-hand side; and there were some marks on the wall at the head of the bedstead—I after<lb></lb>wards examined the hands of the deceased; I found cuts across the fingers of the left hand, there were two on the middle finger, one had gone com<lb></lb>pletely through the hone; those on the other fingers were slighter, they only grazed the external cuticle.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you a physician? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and a Licentiate of the Apothe<lb></lb>caries' Company—I have been so since 1852—I say the body had been dead about four hours; it is impossible for any one to say—it may have been longer than that, but I should say it was quite as long—I think it could not have been shorter—I will not swear that it may not have been half an hour shorter, but I should think it was more likely to be rather more than four hours than under, very much more likely—I will say that it could not have been an hour under; it is quite impossible that it could have been three instead of four; that is my opinion—I swear it is impos<lb></lb>sible that it could have been three hours instead of four—I won't swear as to the impossibility of three hours and a half—I think it is impossible it could only have been three hours.</p>

death, and then they wish to say how long the patient has been dead</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270050"></xptr>
               <p>he went out in the morning—he did not tell me the time—he told me the time he went out in the morning, but I forget now what time it was—I neither recollect the time he told me, nor the time I was called in to see her—I recollect it was in the morning—my opinion was proved to be correct by the man's own statement—I cannot recollect any other instances.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you found what you are pleased to call sooty marks on the elbow and wrist; did you find those marks before the prisoner had arrived? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—I did not see the knife in the hand of the deceased before the prisoner came in—I am certain of that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long was it before he came in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two minutes—the body was so shaded by the bedstead that it was almost impossible to see.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you did not see it because it was shaded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> it was shaded by the bedstead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then I suppose the first you saw of the knife was as it left the hand of the woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I saw it before it left her hand, because I saw the prisoner stoop down, and I bent in that direction to see what he was about, and I saw him distinctly take the knife out of her hand—I saw the knife in her hand before he touched it—the hand was closed—the handle was not grasped firmly in her hand, because if it had been grasped firmly, in taking the knife he would have carried the hand with it; he could not have taken it out so easily—I have not described it as having the knife clutched in her hand—I said "clenched "—I never used the expression clutched—I did not say so before the Coroner—I swear I did not say it was "clutched"—if it is put down so, it is a misunderstanding; I said "clenched"—(<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being referred to, the expression "clutched" appeared to be used in one instance, and "clenched" in another</hi>)—I did not use the word clutched; I swear that—the woman Humbler was on the other side of me at the time the prisoner took the knife out of the deceased's hand—he was standing jnst at the doorway—I was standing next to the woman, and then Humbler.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose I may take it as a fact, although you say you saw the knife in her hand before he touched it, that you had but a momentary glance at it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only a momentary view—he stooped down and immediately put his hand upon it—it was merely while he was in the act of passing his hand downwards that I saw it before he touched it—immediately on taking the knife out of the hand he looked across to the woman Humbler, and said, "You wretch, you have done this"—when she made the exclamations, calling God to witness that she knew nothing about it, the prisoner said, "Well, we will see about it"—I do not recollect his using the words, "She has never done it herself"—he may have done so—that may have been in my recollection before the Coroner, but it is not now—my memory will not serve me whether he did say it—I cannot recollect now—I may have stated it before the Coroner; if I did, I have no doubt that he did say so—the wound on the throat could not have been inflicted with the right hand—it is not impossible that it may have been inflicted with the left, but it is very improbable—I say it is impossible that it could have been inflicted with the right—I swear that—the first incision appeared to have been made just at the apple of the throat; I cannot say positively—I cannot say whether it was at that extremity of the wound or the other—I can only form an opinion upon that—I formed an opinion that it was</p>

               <p>commenced at the apple of the throat, and passed down towards the shoulder, but I cannot say it may not have been commenced at the other extremity—the wound was deepest at the further extremity—I say it is impossible that the wound could have been inflicted with the right hand, whether it had been begun on the one side or the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why do you say it is impossible? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because she could not have done it under any circumstances, not in any position, whether the knife was turned one way or the other—in my judgment, the wound could not have been inflicted with her right hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Dismiss for the present the position in which the knife was in her hand; do you mean to say that, under any circumstances, a person having a knife in her hand in the proper way, could not have out from the shoulder to the apple of the throat with the right hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider it impossible—I am sure she could not have got the hand suffi<lb></lb>ciently over, in order to carry the knife inwards as it was, and cut through the bone, and the cartilage of the larynx—the extreme end of the wound was about two inches from the apple of the throat—it commenced over the apple of the throat (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>), and went two inches backwards, downwards towards the left side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to tell me that the right hand of a person would not reach to that extremity of the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> But the direction of the wound was downwards, backwards and inwards towards the spinal column.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the edge of the knife was in the ordinary way in the hand of a person, do you mean to swear that the right hand could not have been got back far enough to reach the other extremity of the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the condition she was it was impossible, because her hand would be pre<lb></lb>vented by the rail of the bedstead, and had she turned over, she would have been impeded by the ground—even supposing she was not lying under the bedstead, and that her arm was not interfered with by any obstacle, I still consider that she could not have reached to the extent the wound went, with her right hand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Although you with your hand easily reach it now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With a knife I could not—I have not had much experience in examining wounds on the throat—this was the first I have examined myself—that was the reason I called in an older practitioner, in order to confirm my opinion—it is not im<lb></lb>possible that the wound might have been inflicted with the left hand—I have heard of persons who are called ambi-dexterous, who can use the left hand equally with the right—the cause of 
death was suffocation—the carotid artery was not divided—when the carotid artery is divided, death is instan<lb></lb>taneous—it is not so in cases of suffocation—there would be some convulsive strugging—the time of that struggling would depend upon circumstances—if she was exhausted and fainted, blood would go on trickling into the larynx, and would suffocate the moment the came to, without any struggling; but there might be convulsive struggling accompanying the suffocation)—she might have been able to scream.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the wound had been inflicted with the left hand, do you think it possible that, in the agony of suffocation, or in the convulsive motions accompanying suffocation, she might have grouped the blade of the knife in her left hand, and then, that it might have passed on to the right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would have been impossible to out through the bone of the finger.</p>

               <p>would be impossible, supposing she inflicted the wound with her left hand in the convulsive struggles accompanying the suffocation, she could have grasped or clutched the blade in the left hand, and then passed it to the right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite impossible—because no one could possibly clutch or clench the fist sufficiently to cut through the bone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you get rid of the bone for the present? suppose the bone was not cut; I repeat the question; is it impossible that a person in the agony of suffocation, in the convulsive struggles accompanying suffocation, might have clutched the blade of the knife in the left hand, and then seized it, and pulled it out by the right? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it is not impossible—I think it impossible that that would have divided the finger in the way it was cut, because it is a thing almost without parallel for a person to commit an act of that sort lying down on the floor, in the condition she was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said it was not impossible for her to have clutched the blade in the left hand, and then passed it to the right, in the agonies of suffocation; do you assert that it is impossible that the bone of the finger could have been cut in the way you found it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not impossible, but most improbable—blood was on the sheet—I am certain it was on the sheek that was pulled down by the side of the bed, and lying underneath her, because I pulled it out myself—the table was almost close to the foot of the bed—the letters were not on the table, they were on the chair—thering was on the chair at the foot of the bed—the ring, letters, and brooch, were all on the chair—the feet of the body came a little beyond the bedstead—there was about three-quarters of a yard between the door and the feet of the body.</p>

I am a surgeon, and live at 71, High street, Whitechapel—I have been in practice about thirty-two years—on Tuesday evening, 16th September, I accompanied Mr. Sequiera to Northumberland-alley—I was present when he made a post-mortem examination of the body of Mrs. Gardner—I have heard his description of the wound—I concur in that description—I heard his account of the cuts on the hands—that is quite correct—I noticed a mark on the right thigh—it was the mark of a left hand, made with the fingers and thumb—it was made with blood—I noticed the palms of the hands, they were just stained with blood, as if it had been wiped off—Mr. Sequiera told me that the woman was pregnant—I did not know it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is your reason for saying it was not self<lb></lb>inflicted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The nature of the wound was deep backwards, and turned inwards, going to divide the thyroid artery, muscle, and cartilage, into the larynx, which could not have been done by a person's own hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I think it could not, neither by the right hand or the left—I do not think the left hand could have done it—it is possible the left hand might, but the right hand, I am sure, could not—the left hand might have done it, but it was a sort of edging wound, not a regular clear cut—the right hand could not have done it, from this circumstance, it went digging downwards and inwards—it was an incised wound—it came down, and went backwards, and then inwards—I say, the left hand might have done it, because it could have turned in so easily, whereas the right could</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186210270053"></xptr>
               <p>not—she could not have got the right hand round to as to make the would—that is my opinion—I think it is most improbable; hardly anything it im<lb></lb>possible at the present day—the palms of the hands were stained with blood, as if they had been wiped—I say "as if they had been wiped" from the smeared appearance—there was just a sort of half red appearance about them—the palm of the hand, with fresh blood on it, grasping the handle of the knife, would not have caused that smeared appearance, because then the hand would have been full of blood, and it was perfectly discoloured—I should say the blood would have flowed into the hand—supposing the hand was slightly stained with fresh blood, and then grasped the handle of the knife, that cer<lb></lb>tainly might have caused a smeared appearance.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it any part of a medical man's scientific, or medical, or physiological learning, if a body is shown to him with a certain degree of warmth in it, to form an opinion how long that body has been dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is—I think, from the nature of the case, as described, and the woman being with child, which would keep up partial heat, that the body would not have got cold so quickly as it would otherwise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The woman was found at 8 o'clock with her feet and shoulders cold, and the lower part of the trunk warm; can you form any opinion from that, according to your experience, how long she had been dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say about four or five hours—I have been called in to a number of 
deaths at the police-station—it is sometimes of importance to ascertain from the state of a body how long the person has been dead—it is a matter of ordi<lb></lb>nary surgical and medical skill to be acquainted with that, and to form an opinion upon it.</p>

               <p>doctor's, and then I saw it was blood—I saw the blood on the stockings—they were damp from the blood—I do not know whether they were stained—I gave them to Sergeant Mobbs—I did not examine them when I gave then to the sergeant—I wore them three days before the sergeant had them—I trod on the blood in passing through the door to go for Mr. Sequiera—I knew it that morning—I did not examine my stockings then to see if there was blood upon them—I mentioned at the Coroner's inquest that I had trod in blood—I did not say anything about it on the Monday or Tuesday, not to anybody—it was on the Wednesday that I gave up the stockings to the sergeant—I did not say anything about my having trod in blood until I was asked at the inquest—when the sergeant asked me for my stockings he was going to take me to Mr. Gardner's house, to go and get a pair of white stockings to put on—there were a great many persons outside, and I went to Mrs. Spencer's and took them off and gave them to him, and he gave me a pair of white stockings—I did not examine them when I gave them to the sergeant—I gave them to him the moment he asked for them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, after you had trod in the blood, ever see blood on your stockings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never noticed my stockings; I never looked—I put on my old shoes—I know that I trod in something wet and cold—and when I returned with Mr. Sequiers, I thought it was blood I had trod in, by the blood being at the door—I never looked at my stockings to see if there was blood on them—I gave them to Sergeant Mobbs.</p>

death—I do not know whether that was a letter of the same kind that had been read three or four weeks before—Mr. Gardner never let me or Mrs. Gardner see that letter—He would not read it to Mrs. Gardner or me either.</p>

On Monday morning, 15th September, I was on duty in Fenchurch-street—I received some information from a constable of the name of Temple—from what he said to me, I at once proceeded to No. 1, Northumberland-alley—I went up-stairs, to the first-floor, and there found the surgeon, Mr. Sequiera, Pallet, the ward beadle, Gardner, and Humbler—I saw Mrs. Gardner on the floor—Dr. Sequiera handed this knife to me, saying that the prisoner had taken it from the right hand of the deceased—the prisoner turned round to Humbler, and said, "You wretch; you are the cause of this; you done it"—I told the prisoner to be careful what he was saying; that he was charging the girl with a very serious offence—I asked him his reasons for suspecting the girl—he said because he had been in the habit of having intercourse with the girl, and she knew she had got to leave the house on that day—I asked Humbler to go upstairs and show me her clothes that she had there—she accompanied me and Pallet—we inspected the whole of her clothes—she then lifted up her clothes that she had on, one by one—I saw no marks of blood them—her hands and face were begrimed with dirt, apparently as if they had not been washed for a long time—this was in bar bedroom—I</p>

               <p>examined the whole of the clothes in the room; bedding and everything—there were no appearances of blood whatever—on a chair in the bedroom, on the first-floor, I saw a night-gown, chemise, and drawers, these two valen<lb></lb>tines, and this wedding-ring, and brooch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is a likeness of the prisoner—I saw the room and examined it minutely—it was the first floor room; the bedroom; where the body was—I found no marks of blood on the wall; none whatever, with the exception of just where the head of the deceased lay, about a foot up, there was a little splash—I saw no marks on the table in the centre of the room—there was a thick woollen cloth on it—we took it off and examined the table—there was a cornice which formed part of the bed—I brought it to the window, and examined it in the presence of the beadle and another officer—there was no blood on it what ever—that was the cornice leaning against the wall—a piece of it was broken from the top—it was one of those old-fashioned four-post bedsteads—this was a piece of the cornice that had not been put up, or if it was put up, it had been broken off—the window, opposite the foot of the bed, was without a blind—the other blind was drawn down—there were no marks of blood on the bed—I looked at the fire, on the ground-floor—it was alight, but the bars were cold; it had not been alight a sufficient time to warn the bars; I could hold them in my hand—I felt them with my hand—the sticks were remaining in the fire, and a portion of the paper it had been lighted with—it was burning but very slow; it was not out, but it was not properly alight—I examined the room on the ground-floor minutely—there were no marks of blood there—there was a short curtain to the bottom part—the window shuts with shutters outside—there were no marks of blood on the curtain, nor on the shutters, nor any part of the room—I searched in the cellar, the sink, and the closet, that morning; and six or seven days afterwards, I pulled them up—I found no traces of any blood, nor yet any wet cloth in the house that would be sufficient for any person to wipe their hands on; not so much as a damp cloth—I looked at the prisoner's clothes as he wore them, and his flesh—I did not see any appearances of blood on him—he had evidently been at work, and was in his sweep's dress; in fact, it was sooty—I afterwards searched his clothes in the house, but not that day—on the Thursday everything was minutely searched—I found one black and of his, a brown suit, a corduroy suit, and two canvas jackets, which had been used for sweeping chimneys—there were no marks on those—the inquest was on Wednesday, the 17th—I know that Dr. Sequiera was examined there—I went on the Thursday to the prisoner's house with a constable of the name of Monger, and minutely searched the place again—the prisoner was there—after we had been upstairs and made the whole of the search and came downstairs again, he said he was sure that his poor wife had been murdered—I asked him what made him think that—he said because the girl Humbler knew she had to leave on that day; and, not only that, he had heard her more than once threatening her own life, and his too—he said that on one occasion he went up to her bedroom before she was up in the morning and saw a knife sticking in the ledge of her door, that he asked her what that meant, and she said she did not intend that he should have found her alive; and at other times he had seen her sharpening knives on the step of the door, and on the sink-stone in the cellar, and when he asked her what she was doing it for, she sometimes said for herself, and at other times for him—the prisoner said his poor wife's hands were cut about so, because he had seen them after she had been washed and put into the coffin—he said that at the same time that he said he thought she had been murdered—on the following day,</p>

I am ward-beadle of the Ward of Aldgate, in which the house, No. 1, Northumberland-alley, is situated—I went to the prisoner's house on Monday, 15th September, about half-past 8 in the morning—I found Mr. Sequiera there, with his assistant, the prisoner, and the woman Humbler, together with another woman in the room—I afterwards went up-stairs with Mobbs—Humbler came upstairs into the room with Mobbs and myself—I was not present when her under-clothing was examined, only her outer-clothing—I examined all the clothing in her box—I found not the least mark of blood on any of them—her bands appeared to be dirty, and not to have been freshly washed, as I should have expected—in their avocation as chimney-sweeps the hands would necessarily be dirty—I was present when the interior of the room, on the first-floor, was examined by Mobbs on the Tuesday, and again on the Thursday after the inquest had taken place—I did not examine the wall of the room on the first-floor—there were spots on the wall which the sergeant cut out with his pen-knife—that was on Thursday, 18th September—I had not examined the wall parti<lb></lb>cularly on the Tuesday, my attention not having been at all called to it—I was present when the room below was examined by Mobbs on that Thursday, the 18th—the prisoner was there—I looked at the short curtain at the window on the ground-floor—the prisoner said, "Look here; here are some marks of blood here"—that was on the curtain; and he also remarked, "And here appears like the marks of a bloody hand"—that was across the outside window shutter, on the inside of the outer window shutter—that was the same day that the paper was cut off the</p>

I am a detective officer of the City police—I went to the prisoner's house on Thursday, 18th September—I went up to the room on the first-floor, and made a search there in company with Sergeant Mobbs and Mr. Pallet—I saw some blood on the wall, some at the head of the bed, some at the side, and some by the foot—Sergeant Mobbs left me to cut the paper out while I was speaking to Gardner—I said, "Gardner, I should very much like to see the deceased"—he said, "very well"—I took the lid off the coffin and looked at the body—it was in the first-floor room—the face of the deceased was quite black—the prisoner began to cry—he said, "My wife has been murdered"—I cautioned him, and asked him what made him think so, or if he suspected any one—he said, "I suspect Elizabeth Humbler"—I asked him for what reason he suspected her—he said, "I have seen her several times sharpening knives on the step of the door, and on the stone of the sink downstairs"—he said, "I have found knives up in her bedroom behind the door on several occasions; I have spoken to her about it, and asked her what it meant, and she has told me, 'It was to take your life, and then to take my own;' at another time she told me it was to take my life, some one's eke, and then her own"—after that we proceeded downstairs, and Gardner showed us a mark on the curtain of the window, something like a thumb or finger mark, and also on the shutter—he also told me, which I have never given in evidence before, that, three days after Humbler got married, he went to his club-house in Brick-lane; that he did not wish to stay there, and he came out; that he heard some one call after him, "Sam, Sam;" he said he turned round and saw Mrs. Humbler; he spoke to her, and they went and had something to drink; she said, "Sam, I thought you never intended speaking to me again; if you had not made it up, I meant this for you, and then for myself," at the same time drawing a large knife from beneath her mantle—he said, "I took her to a certain place, I need not tell you where, you can guess; I mean a brothel; she left me and went home, and I went home"—on the Saturday afterwards I went down to Gravesend in company with Mobbs—I saw Humbler there, and had some conversation with her.</p>

               <p>and duly cautioned, says: "I am willing to tell all I know about the matter. Deceased has been my wife for seven years. We lived together before marriage. We lived comfortably together for some years after marriage. Elizabeth Clark first came to my house five or six years ago, at servant. Three years after that we cohabited together. When the deceased found it out she was very disagreeable to it, and Clark had to leave the house. She has been away several times. She lived with me and the deceased. Clark then married a man named Humbler. I knew that she was married to Humbler. Deceased said the girl was worse after marriage than before. On Sunday morning I went out at 11 o'clock, and returned at 2 o'clock. Elizabeth Humbler and my wife were both there. I did not go out again after 2 o'clock. On Sunday evening, from 5 to 7, I and the girl had words together; deceased was there also. The girl was annoying and teasing my wife, and I spoke to her about it. She kept on laughing and singing. Deceased said to me, "When your back is turned it is worse than that" I then said, "There shall be an end to it." I then spoke to the girl, and said that next day I should have a few words to settle the matter; that I should not put up with such nonsense. The girl went to bed at 7 o'clock. I and deceased remained up. We slept together. We were friends then. At half-past 3 on Monday morning the police called me, as I wished. I looked at my watch, and found it was too early to get up, and I went to bed again. Deceased then said to me, "Did you hear that creature up and down in the night?" I said, "No." Deceased said, "I heard her at one o'clock come down from the top room, go to the bottom room, and then come into this room and take the candle off the table, and go down into the kitchen, and then up to the top room, and then come back and place the candle on the table where she took it from." I said, "Oh! well, don't bother, it will be decided to-day; we will have no more of it." I meant the girl's nonsense. That was all that passed between us. I got up at twenty minutes to 4, left the room at a quarter to 4, and dressed myself downstairs, and left the house at 4 o'clock. When I left the room, deceased was lying in bed, on her right side. She was awake. She had our child, three years old, with her. I covered deceased up with the bedclothes. I did not see the girl Humbler before I left. I went to sweep chimneys at Pope's Head-alley, Change-alley, and Purssell's. I went home at 8 o'clock, and then I found the doctor there. I never heard the girl threaten the deceased. The brooch found on the chair contains my likeness. It was locked up in the desk on Sunday. The key of the desk was kept in my trousers' pocket. Deceased had her wedding-ring on on Sunday night when we went to bed. I can't tell who wrote the letters produced. Deceased often spoke about them. They were kept in the top drawer. When I got up on Monday morning I saw them and the brooch, and the ring, on the chair. I swear that I took the knife out of deceased's right hand. I did not put it there. I have not spoken to the girl since about it. I did say to her on the Mon<lb></lb>day morning, "You've done this." I thought they had been quarrelling, and that she had done it; that she had killed her. I fancy I heard the knife drawer rattle on the Sunday night; I am almost certain that I did. I never had any quarrel with Humbler's husband. When I left home on Monday morning I pulled the door to, and no one could have got in without a key. It is a lock, not a mere latch. I washed the floor of the room next day. Deceased was not left-handed.—S. Gardner."</p>

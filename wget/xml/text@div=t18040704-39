               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. How many pair of stockings had the prisoner at the bar purchased of you? - A. Eight pair at one time, and one at another.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he purchase any black ones? - A. He purchased black ones for a family, which he paid me for the next day, and one pair of brown cotton, which he had on the next day.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When did he buy the black ones? - A. In January.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. And he bought mottled ones? - A. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Q. You found three pair of his stockings at his lodgings? - A. A great many more.</p>
               <p>Q. He had kept a shop, and sold stockings himself? - A. Yes; but I understood he had given them up to his creditors.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know that of your own knowledge? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pair can you swear to? - A. Here are two pair of drawers that I can positively swear to; one pair has not only my private mark, but is my own manufacture, and here is another pair of stockings with my private mark.</p>

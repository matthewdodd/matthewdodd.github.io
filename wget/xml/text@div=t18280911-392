            . I am a watchman. On the 9th of July. I was called at a quarter before ten o'clock to take the prisoner at a public-house in Ratcliff-highway; I asked if he had any silver, he said, Yes - I asked if he had any gold, he said, No; I took him to the watch-house, and found two sovereigns on him - a man named Hogg gave charge of him, but I do not know his Christian name; he said, he had lost two sovereigns, and he swore to the piece of paper they were in - he is not here.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the sovereigns from the prisoner in the piece of paper - the prosecutor said he had been out all day, and the prisoner took them from him; the prisoner said they were his own, and he had received them from his master by the Dog and Duck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came from Sunderland with one sovereign and eight shillings in my pocket, which was to pay the ship; instead of which, I worked my passage; the prosecutor came to my house at Deptford, and asked me to go out drinking with him; we went to several public-houses and drank, and then came to Ratcliff-highway - we went to a public-house, and I went to sleep, and so did Hogg - I was taken sick, and went out and came in again, and laid my head down to go to sleep; when I awoke, my hat was gone, and a handkerchief in it - Hogg then awoke up, and said he had lost two sovereigns; I said, "Charles, I know nothing about it."</p>

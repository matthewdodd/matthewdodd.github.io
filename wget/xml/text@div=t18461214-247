                  </hi> I am mate of the brig <hi rend="italic">Ariel</hi>, lying in St. Katharine's Docks; the prisoner was employed on board, and was paid off on the Satur<lb></lb>day previous. On the 7th of Dec, between four and five o'clock, he came ashore with me—before we got to the dock-gate he said he had left his jacket on board—(he had been working on board, but had left the ship for good)—I told him to go back and he did—I waited for him in a house outside the dock-gates—he came in about half an hour—about six o'clock I went on board the ship, and about eight I missed a jacket and trowsers of mine, and a jacket of another man—this jacket, trowsers, boots, and hat are mine—I had seen them safe about four o'clock the same day—I went after the prisoner, found him, and told him to give me the clothes he had taken—he said he had not taken them; he knew nothing about it—I gave him in charge.</p>

On Monday night, the 7th of Dec, the prisoner came to me—I am quite certain it was him—I did not know him before—he said he was going to Liverpool, and asked me to let him leave a few things there—I said I had no objection—he bad a jacket on over his other things—he pulled the things produced off in the shop, and left them with me—I delivered them to the officer.</p>

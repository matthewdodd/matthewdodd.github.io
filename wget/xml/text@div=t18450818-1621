                  </hi>. I keep the Marshal Keate public-house, Poplar. The prisoner has been in my employ two years—he was to take beer to the docks, and sell it among the labourers—I required security from him previous to coming into my employ—he told me he had been at Mr. Thomas Wenham's, and he would become his security—I drew up this paper for him, to get Mr. Wenham to sign—he went away with it, and brought it to me the next day—I have since seen Mr. Wenham, but not in the prisoner's presence—I went on letting him have beer till it amounted to 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I would not go on any longer—he said he could get his brother or mother to be security, if I would accept of a bill—I said I would take his brother's bill at two months, if he would accept it—he brought me a letter, purporting to be from his brother—I then drew a bill, which I was going to send by post; but he said he was going to see his mother, and he should see his brother, and would get it accepted—I gave it to him, and he brought it to me accepted—it was not paid when due—I spoke to him about it—he said his brother had lost two horses, and it was very inconvenient to him, if I would wait a bit—I waited—I after<lb></lb>wards received a letter from his brother—I then told the prisoner that his brother said he did not accept it, that it was a forgery, but he declared to the contrary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Johnson, a fish<lb></lb>erman, and live at Barking—I left Barking about the latter part of April last, and came to Hackney—I was acquainted with the prisoner at that time—she lived at Barking—when I left Barking, I left with her a box containing some clothes—it was not locked, but there was a till in the box which was locked—the till contained a pair of coral drops, a brooch, some pawn tickets,</p>

               <p>two fans, and three small pictures—I bad the key of the till—I left the articles in the box with the prisoner to send to me when I sent for them—she was to put some clean linen in the box, and send it to me—I asked her to do so, and she said she would—I sent for it in May, and received a letter from her, which I destroyed, stating that the box was to be left at the Hackney turnpike—I went there and found it—I cannot say the date—I took it home—it was locked—I unlocked it, and found all that I required except the articles stated in the indictment, viz., a looking glass, three sheets, a bolster case, a tin tea-pot, a coffee biggin, a pair of pillow cases, a bread tray, and five small trays, a shawl, a tablecloth, a pair of trowsers, two waistcoats, a silk handkerchief, a worsted frock, a coloured print shirt, a pincushion, a pair of long curtains, half a dozen women's collars, and half a yard of satin; I cannot remember the whole—they had all been in the box—I found the till locked, but missed from it the things I have mentioned before—upon missing the things, I went down to Barking, and saw the prisoner on 16th May at her house—I accused her of taking the things I have mentioned; she said she had not got them—words passed between us—a policeman was present, and he took her in custody—he had to take her away from me—she had her arms round my neck—I have since seen the articles and identified them—they are the property of my husband.</p>

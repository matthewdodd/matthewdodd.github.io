                  </hi>. I am collector to George Brown, of Gloucester-terrace, Whitechapel—he keeps a general linen-draper's and furniture shop—th prisoner dealt there nearly two months. In March she ordered a carpet, and desired that her room might be measured for it—I measured it, and on 22nd March I took a carpet for her approval to the direction she gave, 17, Chapel-place, Vere-street, Oxford-street—I saw her there on the day I measured for the carpet—a female opened the door, and I left the carpet in the hall with her, and did not see the prisoner—it was in a roll, not made up—I called for it on the Monday morning at ten o'clock, and found the house empty; it was furnished when I went there on Saturday—I went again next morning and received this address from Darlow, who lived on the second-floor—it is "17, Southampton-street, Pentonville"—I went there, and found the house occupied by respectable people, who had occupied it some time, and who did not know the prisoner—on 14th April I went with a policeman and found the prisoner living at 72, Harrison-street, Clerkenwell, in the name of Ready—I told her I had called to fetch away the carpet; she said she had not got it—I gave her in charge—she then said it was in the back room, and the constable then fetched it out—I measured it at the station and found rather better than twenty-one yards—there had been twenty-four and</p>

               <p>a quarter—I had not measured it first, but the warehouse mark, 24 1/4, was on it—the week before the carpet was ordered I applied to the prisoner for money on her account, and she paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and she paid me some after that—if the carpet had been made up I should not have left it without some of the money being paid, but it was left for approval.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Vere-street, Cavendish-square. A few days before Christmas I let a house to a person named Gwynn—a few days after Christmas I found the prisoner in possession—the rent was to be paid quarterly—I did not go inside it, but could see that the first-floor was furnished—I could not see the second—I went on 29th March and found it empty—I got no rent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor. In March last I took the second-floor of the house in Chapel-place of the prisoner—she occupied the ground-floor—I never went into her room—I have seen some furniture in it from the door. On 24th March, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner called me down-stairs and told me she was going to leave the house—there was a gentleman in the passage, Mr. Gwynn, who said he was the landlord, and was coming to live there in the course of a week—I did not see the things moved; I heard the van come, and afterwards saw the rooms empty—the prisoner gave me three pieces of paper with her address on them; I gave one of them to Mr. Scales—she left, and I did not see her again—Gwynn did not come to take possession; a man came next morning for some coals belonging to the prisoner—I left the house a fortnight afterwards.</p>

I saw the prisoner come down out of the Buildings on the 31st of March, about four o'clock in the afternoon, with a handkerchief in his hand tied up; I stopped him, and asked him what he was going to do with it; he said it was a little rice for his own use; I charged the constable with him; I did not see him take it; I believe he got it out of the garret; our people were at work there; he is a cooper; he used to be employed about the rice-casks; he desired I would forgive him, and he would do so no more; I delivered him to the custody of Ward.</p>

Have you any distinct recollection of all the facts to which you have spoken to, or are you speaking under some degree of uncertainty - A. I speak from the letters; I recollect the application to the Bank for the power and so on. It is by looking at the letters that I speak with positiveness. I transact a good deal of business, but am not employed to obtain many powers of attorney; I supply the broker with what he wants to buy or sell; I recollect obtaining the power from the Bank, which I sent to Bristol, whether the one I sent was returned to me I cannot swear. I sent it by post, most likely I did not put the letter into the post myself. Mr. Wait is a stranger to me, I am certain the power of Attorney produced is that I received from Bristol, for my writing is at the back of it. I cannot swear that I received it on the 17th of September, as I might misdate it. I applied at the Bank, to act upon it myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. When you applied to obtain it in 1821, what did you do at the Bank - A. I wrote instructions for it on paper, which I put on the box, which is in the usual mode, (looking at a paper,) these are the instructions I delivered at the Bank, on the 24th of September 1821, and in consequence of which I got the power and forwarded it to Bristol.</p>

             re-examined. (Looking at the instructions and power,) I filled up this power of attorney from this ticket of instruction, on the 24th of September 1821. There is a memorandum on the power, which enables me to speak to the date. I have no recollection of filling up any other of the same sort on that day. I know the power by the figures on it; a folio of the account from which it is taken is put on the instructions; and if I had made out two from the same account, they would have that folio. We make a memorandum on the account of having made a power. If a second application was made to me for a power to sell the same stock, I should object to it, if I recollected it. It would entirely depend upon my recollection.</p>
               <p>MR. UNDERHILL re-examined. I do not recollect that I received instructions for more than one power of attorney for this stock.</p>

            . I live at Birmingham; I went into Mr. Wait's service on the 26th of June 1818, and left him the latter end of May, 1819. He was a grocer. I was in the habit of seeing him write. (Looks at a letter, dated 16th September, 1822.) I believe this to correspond with his writing - I believe it to be his writing. (Looking at another, dated 23d September, 1821.) I believe this to be his, but I cannot say so much for this as the first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERJEANT PELL. Q. You are carrying on business on your own account new? - A. No; I am assistant at a grocer and cheese-factor's. I was never in Bristol. I became acquainted with Mr. Wait at Birmingham; he left some time after I left him. The last I knew of him was in May 1819, he carried on business at Birmingham as grocer; my business was to serve behind the counter: he had two assistants besides me, and a porter.

             was one. I do not recollect the other; he was also employed behind the counter. I did not keep the books; I have written in them occasionally; he kept the books himself. I can speak with greater certainty to one letter than the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe the whole of both the letters to be the hand-writing of Mr. Wait - A. Yes. I look to the signatures. I believe the body of both to be his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not the characters of the two very unlike each other - A. Not very. My belief is formed more upon the signatures. There is a likeness in the bodies.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasioned you to leave Mr. Wait - I don't exactly know. I don't recollect any dispute with him, it is so long ago. He dismissed me - I inquired the reason, he would not give me a satisfactory one. I cannot exactly recollect what reason he assigned; I have no recollection that he gave any reason.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. While you were with him, how many opportunities had you of seeing him write - A. I was in the habit of seeing him write most days; he has made out invoices to the customers.</p>
               <p>Q. In the body of one of the letters his name is set out, what is your belief as to that - A. I believe it to be his writing.</p>

            . I live at Birmingham. I was in Mr. Wait's service eight or nine months; I left before Drury. I had opportunities of learning the character of his hand-writing (looking at the letters;) they appear to correspond with Mr. Wait's hand-writing; but that dated 16th September, 1822, corresponds more than the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CAMPBELL. Q. You do not think the signatures of both to be so much like his - A. The signatures of both correspond more than the body; the signature of that dated 1821, corresponds more than the body. I think the whole of both are his writing, but one is more like it than the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear disguised at all - A. It does not correspond so much. I was principally behind the counter, and went out collecting a little.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave him - A. I gave him notice; I had no dispute in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, had you any dispute with him before you left - A. I never had any particular dispute. He was rather afflicted at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any charge made against you of any thing that happened during his illness - I do not recollect any thing particular; I cannot recollect when it was, but I was behind the counter, and had taken a note, and Mr. Wait said he had looked into the drawer at night, and it was not there; but it was on the following morning, I do not recollect how long it was before I left. When I left him, I went to live with Mr. Bishop. Mr. Wait wished me to continue if I chose, and offered to get me a situation at Worcester, but I preferred going to Mr. Bishop. I have since been in business as a tobacconist at Birmingham, for two or three months, and then came to live in London.</p>

               <p>Q. You ran away from Birmingham - A. I had an error with the Excise, and left in consequence of that, but returned again, and settled the fine with the Excise.</p>
               <p>Mr. BOLLAND. Q. What was this transaction of the note - A. It was a local note payable some distance from Birmingham. I took it of a customer, Mr. Wait recollected my taking it and looked into the till at night, and said it was not there, and on the following morning he went to look and said he had found it there, this was cleared up and he wanted me to continue with him if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040028"></xptr>choose; he had said nothing to me about the note till he found it in the till, and after that he wished me to continue and gave me a character to Mr. Bishop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How soon after you took the note did you put it into the till - A. Immediately that I took it, that I swear, he said nothing to me about it till morning, I had no quarrel with him except about this.</p>

            . I am a glass-merchant at Bristol, and have known Mr. Wait, forty or fifty years. In the the spring of 1821, he called on me to ask the name of my broker, it was about a year and three quarters ago; to the best of my recollection, he said he had twelve or fourteen hundred pounds of stock to sell; I understood him to say, it stood in the joint names of himself and another person whom he named.

Mr. Wait and Mr. Nash were appointed trustees: Nash never acted, and this was communicated to Mr. Wait, and in consequence of which I and him went in October 1815, to the Castle Bank, Bristol, to invest the stock. I mentioned in Mr. Wait's presence to Mr. Courtney the banker that Mr. Wait wished to invest this sum in the three per cent. consols, there being a deficiency of assets, the money did not amount to 2000 l. I told Mr. Courtney that Nash declined to act. that Mrs. Fitcho was likely to live many years, and as the money came ultimately to my brother and myself, and as Mr. Wait was the only gentleman named, we might all die before the old lady, and as the money might come to my brother's children, there should be another trustee. Mr. Courtney suggested to me to put my name in the stock, I said if Wait had no objection I would; and the stock was purchased in our joint names, no other stock was bought in our joint names (looking at the power of attorney).

               <p>"Cox" is in the same state now as when you saw it at Wrington - A. No, it is not, the letter C was then of a different character to what it is now, it was the same shape as a small c is usually made, with a dot, it has now a loop added to it. The dot is still visible, and the bottom of the C passed immediately into the o without a turn to it, but now there is a complete turn.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not your usual mode of writing your name with a C of a similar description to what this now is - A. Yes, Mr. Day gave the instrument into my hands, it was with me an hour. I had it repeatedly in my hands during that time, when I returned it; the C was in the same state as at first. I stated to several people that it was no imitation of my hand-writing, as the C was of a different character, and it was very remarkable that the C in the attestation and in the execution was of the same character. It is clear that the fine stroke in the C has been written since, for there is the appearance of two strokes where it joins the dot; there has been an attempt to make it, and the first stroke did not meet the dot in the regular form, and so a second is made.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever received a dividend on the stock yourself - A. Never. I very seldom receive dividends on any stocks. I have executed powers.</p>

In the beginning of October a person hired my boat to go to Clovelly, about eighteen miles from Bristol, on the coast of Devon, to bring a gentleman, and put him on board the brig Aurora. I got to Clovelly on Friday evening, the 4th of October. I found the prisoner there; he came on board. I had no conversation with him. I was only in the boat two days. The person who hired us told us he was going on board the Aurora, which I knew was bound for Philadelphia. We ran up the Canif on the Welch coast out of the bad weather to wait till the brig came down. I asked him no questions, nor did any body in my hearing. I came away on Sunday night, leaving him on board the vessel.</p>

               <p>In your letter you do not state in what way I shall send the proceeds. Our usual method is, by a Bank post bill.</p>

            . I am a wine and brandy merchant, and live in Mark-lane. I was in partnership with Mr. Wait from September 1811, to September 1816, and had frequent opportunities of seeing him write; for the last three years of that time I saw his writing three or four times a week. (looks at the letter dated September 1822.) I have seen this before, somebody on the part of the Bank produced it, and asked if I thought it was Mr. Wait's hand writing, or whether I knew it was his. I have been subpoened here on the part of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. (Looking at the letter) Tell me whether you believe it to be his hand-writing or not - A. The two letters</p>
               <p>"it" at the end of the name, I think resemble it in a small degree, but every other part of it I think very unlike Mr. Wait's writing; at least very unlike any of his writing that I ever saw. I stated this to the gentleman who applied to me, and that I did not believe it to be his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. After having intimated that, had you any message from the Bank - A. I had a letter on the 3d of December, stating, that it would not be necessary for me to attend the prosecution. I have known Mr. Wait, eleven years; every<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040030"></xptr>transaction of his with me was of the most honourable kind, his general character was an upright honourable man.</p>
               <p>MR. SERJEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Did you not when applied to on the part of the Bank, desire you might not be called, because it would be unpleasant - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you not at the same time state that there were many other persons much more able to speak to his writing than you, because you had not seen it lately. - A. Exactly so, and the gentleman said it was probable they should have sufficient evidence. It is six years since I saw him write, I said the</p>
               <p>"it" at the end of the name bore a resemblance.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT PELL. Q. Was it after you said it would be painful for you to be called as a witness, and that you did not think it to be his writing, that you were subpoened - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You applied to the Bank that you might not be called upon - A. I requested I might not at the moment I saw the writing. I had seen it at the time I wished to be excused from attending, but upon reflection, I considered it my duty to appear after forming my opinion on it.</p>
               <p>MR. MOORE. I am a wholesale wine and brandy merchant, of Bristol. I was in partnership with Mr. Wait, about five years, at Bristol, and had an opportunity of frequently seeing him write; he did not take an active part in the business (looks at the letter dated September, 1822.) I believe I have seen this before - the magistrate's clerk at Bristol shewed it to me. I was subpoened on the part of the Bank, and afterwards had notice that I need not attend. I had not expressed any opinion on the letter - I told them I did not conceive myself called upon to give an opinion, and I should decline it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, do you believe that to be Mr. Wait's handwriting - A. From the opportunities I had of seeing his writing, (which was certainly very frequently) this is certainly very different indeed from what I recollect of the character of his writing. I always considered him a gentleman of the highest propriety, and that was his general character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did your partnership with him cease - A. I think six years ago, but I have seen his writing since.</p>
               <p>Q. If you received a letter in that hand-writing what would be the impression on your mind - A. I should have doubted its authenticity. Mr. Jones was in partnership with us.</p>

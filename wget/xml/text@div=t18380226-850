I saw the prisoner at the Police-office when he was apprehended—he asked to speak to me—be had been formerly in our force, and was discharged about ten weeks ago, to the best of my recollection—the first thing he said was, "Here is a go"—I said, "What are you in for?"—he said, "I hardly know"—I said, "The two letters you sent will go against you"—he said, "I shall contradict that; would not you if you were me?"—I said, "No, I should speak the truth"—I came out, and when I came out, he said, "Do what you can for me"—I said, "It is not in my power"—I have seen the prisoner write pretty often.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in High Holborn. On the 6th of April the prisoner came to my shop with a child—she said she wished to purchase a dress and a shawl—the young man showed her some dresses—she selected two dresses, a shawl, and three pairs of stockings, for which he had a bill made out—she said she was going further to receive some money, and would call and pay for them on her return—she took the bill with her—she was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour in the shop—from her manner I suspected her—I went out, and overtook her about a hundred yards from the shop—I saw her take the bill out of her bosom and tear it to pieces, which increased my suspicion—I went up to her, and said she had just left my shop, and I believed she had brought more out than she took in—she asked why I suspected her—I took hold of her cloak—she began crying, and hoped I would forgive her—I brought her back—she threw the dress into the shop, and attempted to run away—this is the dress.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a starch-manufacturer at West Ham—on 13th May I received this letter—(<hi rend="italic">Read: "Memorandum</hi>, March 12, 1864. From James Dickson, 2, Devonshire-square, Bishopsgate. To Messrs. Harvey and Nevill, Rice Starch Works, Stratford. All cheques crossed 'East London Bank. 'Gentlemen: Please favour, per return, prices of first and second cases of rice-starch per ton.")—we sent an answer to that letter—we then received this, dated March 17th—("Gentlemen: Will you oblige by forwarding on Thursday next, the 24th, without fail, half a ton of rice-starch, No. 1 Blue, in 561b. bags, prompt to date, please")—we did not execute that order—on the 8th April we received this document—("Gentlemen: Having several orders on my books for your starch, I should feel obliged if you could let me have half a ton, No. 1, to-day, as I am very much pressed for it. I am going to send to West Ham this afternoon. If you can oblige by sparing me some to go on with, please state how much, and I will forward cheque by carman. It does not matter about being in boxes, so long as the papers and labels are clean")—we replied to that—on the 9th April I received this—("Gentlemen: Please to deliver to bearer 5 cwt. of blue starch, and receipt invoice, and state when I can have some more, and oblige yours, J.D. ")—with that letter I also received this cheque—("No. 13,371, London, April 9th, 1864. East London Bank, Limited. Pay Harvey and Nevill, or order, seven pounds five: 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. James Dickson. ")—the cheque was passed through our bank, the London and Westminster—it came back, and I after<lb></lb>wards made inquiries about it—upon receipt of the last memorandum we had delivered 5 cwt. of starch to the carman—I should not have deli<lb></lb>vered that had I not received the cheque—I had never had any trans<lb></lb>action before with the prisoner—I would not have delivered the starch with<lb></lb>out money, or the expectation of money's worth.</p>

               <p>some goods and to take them where I was ordered—I delivered the letter and got some starch—I took it where I was ordered, to Monk and Sewell's, by Mr. Dickson's orders—he paid for the carting—on 9th April his office was in Devonshire-square—I do not know where his residence was.</p>

I am a clerk in the East London Bank—I know the prisoner, and am acquainted with his handwriting—the signature to these documents produced is all I can speak to positively—I mean the signature to the cheque, the others are not signed; they are only signed with initials—I was present when the prisoner signed his name at the bank—to the best of ray belief the documents are in his handwriting, the filling up of the cheque was always in his handwriting—I believe I know the writing suffi<lb></lb>ciently to swear to it; for the ordinary purposes of life, I could act upon my conviction—the prisoner first opened an account at the bank on the 22d of January with 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the last cheque was drawn on the 30th of March for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which left a balance of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to his credit—it is impossible for the bank to spare the books, they are wanted every moment in the day—we had notice to bring the books, but I have not brought them.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The Court was of opinion that in the absence of the books there was no legal evidence of the false pretence; they were sent for, but after some delay, as they were not forthcoming, the Jury were directed to acquit the prisoner.</hi>)</p>

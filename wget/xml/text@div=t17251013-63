             thus deposed: In January last, the Prisoner sold 2 lb. of Candy'd Orange-Peel for 3 s. and he and Morrison shared the Money betwixt them. On April 25, he sold 6 lb. of Biskets, and another time 4 lb. and put but half the Money into the Till, and parted the other half betwixt himself and Morrison. At another time, he sold 4 lb. of Citron for 10 s. kept Half a Crown of it himself, and gave another Half Crown to Morrison. I believe I can reckon up about 15 s. that he has taken in this manner. One Day, when they had done so, they brought a Shilling to me, and shew'd me a naked Knife, and swore I should have one of them; and so I took the Shilling. One Saturday Night they both went out; and when they came in again, they told me they had been to rob an Orchard. I ask'd them where the Apples were? D - ye, says Morrison, I'll tell ye where they are; and was going to rip me up with his Knife; but the Prisoner prevented him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Allen thus deposed: The Prisoner ask'd me Leave to go to Bartholomew Fair, and we not being very busy, I gave him Leave; but I saw him no more till next Week, when his Father brought him home. I sent him backwards, and went with his Father to the Tavern, and there his Father told me that he believ'd his Son had wrong'd me. We sent for him over; he seem'd very much concern'd, and confess'd that Morrison had drawn him into such a Combination, as he was afraid would be the utter Ruin of him. That they had made a Practice of sending out Sugar in Boxes, to the Quantity of about Eight Hundred Weight, which they sold for 4 d. a Pound, tho' it was worth 7 d. His Confession was read in Court, and the Jury found him <rs id="t17251013-63-verdict303" type="verdictDescription">

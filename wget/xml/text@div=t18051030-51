             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I live at Isleworth.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the son of the prosecutor? - A. Yes; my father is a master gardener; I manage the business for him; he has no partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Some time before the 5th of October had you lost as many as nine baskets and six half-sieve cloths? - A. I lost a great many at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday, the 5th of October, were you near the nine mile-stone on the Twickenham road? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in any cart? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300049"></xptr>No; he had made his escape; I saw a cart detained on suspicion, in the care of Holt, the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the cart? - A. I did; I found nine baskets and six half-sieve cloths in that cart, belonging to my father, and more of other people's.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after was the prisoner taken up? - A. On the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner's mother carries on the gardening business also? - A. Yes, in the neighbourhood of Twickenham.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my learned friend that you lost a great many baskets - when you come to market it is usual to accommodate one another with baskets? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you so uncivil - when you sell your fruit you part with the baskets, or let them go with the fruit? - A. Yes, but we expect them back again from the fruiterer.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You do not sell your baskets? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you often have baskets of others by accident? - A. We once had a little basket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Is that at all likely to happen with baskets of this description? - A. It cannot happen without the knowledge of themselves with large baskets.</p>
               <p>Q. Why may it happen with respect to small baskets and not to large ones? - A. The little ones go into the large ones, whereby we cannot see them till they are taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. But large baskets not going into each other the marks remain outward? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Q. If by accident a little basket of another person's came into your hands, it is not, of course, the practice of you, taking out their names and putting on your own? - A. By no means.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he gave you any account whatever of what he had in his cart? - A. He did not; Mr. Wilmott was there when the baskets were being taken out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the baskets that were taken out of the cart the same as the prisoner left in the cart when he went away? - A. They were.</p>

               <p>Q. You directed Holt to do something, what did you do after you had given Holt these directions? - A. I went down Twickenham town to procure a constable; he did not come; I went on half a mile on the London road; the prisoner passed me in a cart, he was going on towards London; when he came out of Twickenham, towards London, there was a younger brother of his in the cart; and when he came on the road the prisoner then came and jumped into the cart with him; I told him I should go along with him and see what he had in the cart; his answer was, what they were pears and medlars; I went on a little forwarder, my two fellow-servants passed me with three horses; I told the coachman to keep near the cart; I took a horse and rode before it, and went on to get a constable.</p>
               <p>A. Did you afterwards come back? A. Yes, and I saw the nine baskets, large and small, and and twelve pounds of grapes in a half-sieve, and a few mulberries; there were neither pears nor medlars.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the sieve-cloths likewise? - A. I did; when I came back the prisoner was gone; I charged a constable with the cart; I have had the baskets and the sieve-cloths ever since; I produce them.</p>

            (To Mr. Wilmott.) Are these your father's sieve-cloths? - A. They are, there are six; the mark of R. M. W. for Richard and Mary Wilmott.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, with respect to the baskets, has any of the initials of the name been altered? - A. The initials have been painted out of the large basket; when they were lost there were R. M. W. upon them; it is painted over now, and V. is put under it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do not you leave your baskets with the fruiterer when you sell your goods? - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180510300050"></xptr>Yes. sometimes we leave the basket with the purchaser; we call for them the same day, and sometimes the next day, according as they can empty them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the purchasers of your fruit having any baskets, and they not returning them? - A. We frequently have that.</p>
               <p>Q. What becomes of those baskets, you cannot tell into whose hands they may pass? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say exactly at what time they were in his possession? - A. I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you fix it in any way on the 5th of October? - A. No, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You have several score probably belonging to you? - A. We have; we lose a number of little ones, and but a few of the large ones.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Very possibly these baskets might belong to my father before he died; he has been dead a year and three quarters; I do not know by what means I came by the baskets, nor how they were marked.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Wilmott.) Is this young man's mother in the gardening line? - A. I believe they are.</p>

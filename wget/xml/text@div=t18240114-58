On the 6th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, or rather earlier, I was at tea in my parlour, with my door open, and heard glass break. I went into the shop, and found a pane of glass broken in the window, and two men standing outside, at the broken pane. I pursued into the street, and seized them both at the window. I struggled with them, and one escaped; the other, who was the prisoner, I secured. During the struggle with the prisoner a watch fell from him, which I produce - I picked it up, called</p>
               <p>"Watch," and after a short time the constable came and took him. I examined my window, and found a piece broken out of the glass, and a watch gone, which had laid within an inch of the glass - a man could not get it without putting his hand through the broken pane. He said,</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken, I am not the man." I am sure the watch fell from him - it is mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was it not light enough to discern a man's features - A. Certainly not - it was more than half-past five o'clock - my street door was open, but the inner door was shut - the watch was within an inch of the glass - a person's elbow could not knock it out; it fell from the prisoner after the other man escaped - it fell from the prisoner I am certain. The other man could not have dropped it, and the prisoner picked it up, for when I came out, I saw a hand come from the window, with the watch in it - I am confident that it was the prisoner's hand - the hole was hardly large enough for the hand to come out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw two people at your window, and on going out found two there - A. Yes, my Lord.</p>

            . I was returning home, about half-past five o'clock, or later, with a long plane under my arm; I heard a cry of Watch; I was within a yard and a half of Payne's shop, and saw him scuffling with two others; I seized them both by the collar, one in each hand - one gave me a kick, and got from me, I kept fast hold of the other, which was the prisoner; a constable came up in a few minutes, and at that moment I saw a watch laying at my feet. I said,</p>
               <p>"There is a watch, Mr. Payne, pick it up." The prisoner said, as he went along, that he would go with us, for he was innocent.</p>

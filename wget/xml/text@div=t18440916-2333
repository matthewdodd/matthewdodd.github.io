                  </hi>. I am the son of Thomas Hayward; he is a butcher. On the 12th of Sept. I was in his shop—I saw the prisoner and another man come in front of the shop—they stood there about a mi<lb></lb>nute, and I heard the prisoner say, "I will take it"—I did not know what he meant—he then said something else to the other man—tbe prisoner then took a shoulder of mutton from inside the shop, put it under his coat, and walked away—the other man ran in a different direction—I ran and took the prisoner, and found the mutton under his coat—the policeman came up directly and took him.</p>

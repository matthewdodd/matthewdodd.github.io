            . On Sunday, the 5th of June, as I was coming down Holborn-Bridge, I met a young Woman, who took me to Mrs Ballard's House; we went up one Pair of Stairs, and the young Woman called for some Liquor, which I suppose to be Gin; they had it and drank it, I never tasted it: I gave them Two-pence half-penny for it, they said it was not enough, so I gave them another Half-penny, and was for going away; says Ballard. You must not go till you make us a Present of something else, and I said, I would not give them any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174306290008"></xptr> thing else, and I would go about my Business. I was sitting at the Bed's Feet, and Harris and another Woman pushed me backward upon the Bed; and, as soon as they had done that, in rushes 2 or 3 more; they got my Shoes off instantly, to get my Buckles; after they had got my Buckles, they got to my Fob, and they took a Silver Cross, they took a Handkerchief out of my Pocket, and a Note of Hand of 3 l. 3 s. which I did not lay in the Indictment. - The Gentlemen of the Jury did not put that down, because I did not know the Date of it. - They used me in a very vile Manner; and if the Watchman had not come to my Assistance, I believe I should have been dead; for I could not have held it out a Quarter of an Hour longer - they stopped my Mouth, leaned upon my Breast, and strove to stifle me as much as they could; I believe I cried out Murder for the Space of a Quarter of an Hour; and when they found the Watchman came to the Door, they run down Stairs - I had not Strength to keep any of them in Custody; as soon as I could I came down Stairs, and saw one of them standing at the Door, with a Poker in her Hand; and, she said, if I came any nearer she would knock me down.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Ballard say, that she was, or was not concerned in the Robbery?</p>

               <p>Price. When she pulled the Bedstead down the Bed tumbled down, and there they lay - she did not take them up; she said, here they are.</p>
               <p>Harris. I was a little in Liquor, it being Sunday Night; and my Husband beat me, and cut my Mouth, and made me in a Gore-Blood; and I went into the Closet to hide myself, and Ballard said, stay there, and he shall not hurt you.</p>
               <p>Ballard. I was very ill, and had taken a Sweat, and I laid myself down upon the Bed - though the Bed turns up, there is room for any Body to lie behind it.</p>

               <p>come to-morrow night"—I said, "Very well, you know best, it is in your hands, I will keep away," therefore, I did not go to the meeting on the Tuesday; then, on the Friday, Jennings told me that he had met Archer on the Thursday, at the Waterloo Station, with Clifford—that Archer had agreed to go to Lady Murray's, and to enter the house, and speak to the servants, but that Clifford was not satisfied with Archer's statement that he had lived there, and would not do the job unless he could see Archer go to the' house and speak to his old fellow-servants, which, he said, he could do if he really had lived there—he said "At first Archer agreed to go, but afterwards refused, in consequence of his clothing not being so good as he wished, but," he said, "We are going to build him up; we will find him some clothes; in<lb></lb>deed, I have brought a coat with me" (he had got a loose coat on at the time) "he can have this coat, and to-morrow he can have a hat, a neck wrapper, some boots, and other things, and he can have some money to go down to Wimbledon; Clifford will be there; and if he sees him go in and speak to the servants, he will be satisfied that he has lived there, and that what he has told him is right about the property, and the job will be done—we then went to Archer's lodging—he was in bed, and refused to get up—Jennings and I then walked as far as Victoria Street again, and Jennings said to me, "Win you see Archer in the morning T—I said, "Yes, I Will"—he said, "Take care to see him; tell him to be at Waterloo Station at 12.50 to-morrow, and we will be there, and we will have some clothes there for him; he can go into a public-house and put them on; we will give him the money, and he can go down to Wimbledon, and we will go down, too"—I afterwards saw Hasten; and in consequence of something he said to me, gave information to Sergeant Meikle john, and since last January I have been in constant communication with him.</p>

               <p>business—he closed hit house about the middle of last summer—I was at one time in the employment of Mr. Fitch, the lawyer—that was soon after I left Regent Street, nearly four years back—I was in his employ, on and off, twelve months, not continually—I had an agreement with him, to try to recover moneys on overdue bills which he held—I was a writ server, and did other things as well—I left in consequence of a dispute we had about some payments—he thought he had paid me too much, and I thought he had not paid me enough—since January 7th, this year, I wrote a little song—I had it printed—I have sold a considerable number of copies to gentlemen, and I will give you one—I was in very bad health at Christmas, so bad that I was compelled to apply to the parish for relief, as I was not able to go to work—I thought it was my right to do so—that was where I met Archer—there were two objects in Masters and I going to Lady Murray's—my object was to bring Masters himself within reach of the law; and Masters' object was to take an inside view of the building—we sent in some papers to Lady Murray—that was an excuse for getting in—it was in reference to an emigration movement, asking for assistance—it was all a sham—all that I did was in the interests of justice—Masters proposed to me a robbery in January last, in which he said it would be necessary to murder one man; I instantly refused, and that hour wrote to the police—I have been paid by the police since the prisoners have been in custody—nobody ever told me to suggest robberies to the prisoners or to Masters; Masters suggested robberies to me—I have known him since about September last—I never knew he was connected with anything in the way of thieving till Christmas last, when he told me himself—he told me of many robberies that he was concocting, and of one in which he said it would be necessary to kill one man—I swear distinctly that I did not suggest this robbery to Archer—I did not tell him to represent himself as Lady Murray's servant; he told me that he had lived with Lady Murray.</p>

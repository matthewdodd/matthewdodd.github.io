               <p>Mrs Waring. The Prisoner lodged in the House with me. On the 16th Instant I missed the Things, and the Prisoner perceiving me out of Humour came up to me the next Morning, and asked me, What made me so much out of Temper the Night before, I told her I had lost two laced Handkerchiefs; she bid me not be frightened, for she said, she had Occasion for a little Money, and she had pawned them; that she did it out of pure Necessity, because I was not in the Way for her to borrow any of me, and said I should have them again that Night, and desired I would not let Mr Waring know it. I said, if she would be as good as her Word I should believe her to be a very honest Woman; she did not bring them that Night, and on Tuesday Morning I missed some more Things, and then I told my Husband directly, and he got a Warrant for her. She said as she had known me so many Years she thought she could make free with me, as she designed to bring them again; and I believe she would have brought them again, if my Husband would have had Patience.</p>

I am the wife of George Wright, of 118, Waterloo Road—on the evening of Christmas Day, about 9 o'clock, I was walking with my husband in Herbert's Buildings—I had a bottle of rum with me—I received a blow on my mouth, and the bottle was taken from me—two men came up, the prisoner Cooke is one of them—he took my husband round the neck, and the other put his hands in his pocket—I had seen them before, walking in the road, but knew nothing of them—Cooke had a light coat on—I knew his appearance before Scott had his hands in my husband's pocket—I said to Cooke, "What are you going to do with him?" he said, "To take him home"—I said, "He can take himself home, and so can I"—they then disappeared, and left us by ourselves—I did not count how many there were—we then went to the station, and preferred a charge, and described the men—I saw the five prisoners on Monday, and identified Cooke and Scott.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you miss any property? A. No; we have sold considerable quantities of the same description as this - I cannot swear this might not have been sold.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the evening of the 21st of November I met the prisoner about half-past seven o'clock, with a small bundle under his arm - I asked what he had got there; he said a shirt and a pair of stockings - he was coming towards London; I took the bundle from him - I took him to the toll-house, and on the way he told me that there was a little crape in it; I opened it at the toll-house, and it contained this crape only - he then told me he had received it from his father at the Bull, at Tottenham; that he had asked his father for a little crape to present to a friend in town - he said his father worked at a crape manufactory, and that it was his perquisite - he told me he would give me a yard if I wanted it; the tollman knew him and his father, and he told me he had no doubt it was all right, as he and his father worked in a crape manufactory for a Mr. Grout, who lived just by, and I might go and inquire of him - here are six remnants of crape.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has not the father absconded? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHEPHERD. I am a Bow-street patrol. I was with Davies, and what he has stated is correct.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never knew of any? A. No - men are allowed to work over time, for which they are paid; I believe this crape to have been theirs - I cannot say it had not been sold.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw my father on the Saturday, and he gave me some money to get a quart of gin and take to him at the Bull - he said he would give me a shirt and a pair of stockings; he gave me this parcel - I did not know what was in it.</p>
               <p>MR. BAYLIS. I have given pieces of crape to the prisoner's friends; they are very respectable.</p>

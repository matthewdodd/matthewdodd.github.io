               <p>about Cannon-street, and this aunt told her sister so, and Mrs. Pain told me she never could rest at the time, she was afraid Pain was about, he had been seen at Dockhead and different places—I never told her anything; it is only what she told me—she was in such a "flurry," she did not know where to go, whether to go down to her father's or not—I said, "I have got no money, so you must go to some relations"—I advised her to go to the workhouse—then she turned round and said, "I wish I went to the workhouse in the first place, and found my husband, as my father wanted me to do."</p>

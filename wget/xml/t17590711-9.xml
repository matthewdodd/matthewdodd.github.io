            . About half an hour past four in the morning on the third of June, I met with the prisoner at the bar in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields; she had this kettle with her. Producing a brass kettle.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my property.</p>
               <p>Bennet. I ask'd her where she had that kettle; she first told me it was her landlord's, and she was going to take it home.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Bennet. I am a Watchman, and watch in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields: I knowing her to be a disorderly woman stopp'd her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175907110010"></xptr>Q. What do you mean by disorderly?</p>
               <p>Bennet. I mean a common woman of the town.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You are a big rogue.</p>
               <p>Bennet. At last the prisoner said, she found the kettle at the door where I catched her.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the distance from the prosecutor's house, and the place where you found the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bennet. It is but a very little distance; I took her to St. Clement's watch-house; she stood stiff in it, that she found the kettle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I found that kettle in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields as I was going home; I do not know who is the owner of it; when I saw the watchman coming up I stood behind it, and would not let him see it; I intended to carry it to the Round-house, the place whence I came from; I had been taken up on the Saturday night, and kept there all night.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bennet. When you saw the prisoner first, was she walking along or standing still?</p>
               <p>Bennet. She was standing against a door in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the Fields?</p>
               <p>Bennet. It was in Portugal-row, the fourth or fifth door up, about a door or two on this side my Lord Keeper's; that was, she had it in her hand, and her apron not quite over it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What is the value of the kettle?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is worth four shillings.</p>

I am in service at No. 3, Park Place, St. James's—I was servant at Mr. Bolt's before the prisoner went there—I lived with him fifteen months—I got notice on 3rd June, and left on 3rd July—I often saw Mr. Rolt's cheque-book, but I had no wish to steal the cheques—I heard the prisoner say I ought to know the cheques were not come by honestly—I never said to her, "If they are found out, I know master will forgive me"—she is trying to bring me into it, and she is a wicked, bad girl—I never wrote a letter to her—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not in my writing—she gave me a bit of paper, and asked me to write to her; but, as my mother says, it is a blessing I have not done it.</p>

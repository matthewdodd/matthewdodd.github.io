On the 11th of May, about four o'clock, we heard an unusual noise from the next house, which was uninhabited; I went to a public-house in College-hill, Mr. Roberts's, the Queen's-head, he came with me and listened; the noise continued some time after Mr. Farnworth came home, and I acquainted him with it, he came down and listened, and heard the same noise; after that, we went out at the window that belongs to my mistress, we tried two or three windows to see if we could get into the house; trying a third, the prisoner came up to the window, we shoved it up, and he was at the window, the windows was on the ground-floor, in the back yard; we told him we heard some unusual noise, and should wish to come into the house; Mr. Farnworth said, he should wish to know what it was; there was a conversation between them, and he would not admit him to come in, as he said he was in charge of the house, he could not let any body in; after that, we went down stairs again, and the noise was then discontinued; Mr. Farnworth went to the publican, and while he was gone to that house the man came out, my mistress called to me, and I, with my master, stopped him, I was a little way behind him; my master said, he should wish to know what he had in his bag; I don't know what answer he made, my master followed him, and sent me for a constable; but before I went, a constable came, and my master gave charge of the prisoner.</p>

I came home on the 11th of May, between five and six in the evening; I was informed by my servant that he had heard an uncommon noise in the vault next to where we keep our bottles, I went and listened, and heard it very distinctly, it was as if something was struck upon an anvil, at distinct intervals of about a minute; the first idea that struck me was, that somebody was attempting to break into the vault; we went and got out of a window of our's, with the publican, Roberts, I desired him to try to-open one of the windows, and get in; one window we attempted in vain, the next

No; only some saw-dust among them, it was dirty and greasy; the halfpence, if they had been good, would have been worth four pounds, five shillings, and nine-pence; I did not search the prisoner, I took him to the Compter; the key of the house was found in the privy of the White-horse; Wainwright and King, and I, went to the house, and searched it, and found the implements for coining; we got in by the key that was found in the necessary.</p>

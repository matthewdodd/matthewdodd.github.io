            . I keep the Three Tuns public-house in Bridgewater-square. The prisoner came there on the 14th of February, and had some liquor - he returned again in the evening with a woman, and they staid till I was about to shut up the house; I was given to understand he had some money about him, and said if he liked to leave it with me he would know where to find it; he left me a 10l. note, and called again two days afterwards and had two sovereigns out of it, and ordered a leg of mutton to be cooked; I gave Vann 5l. 15s. 6d., which was the balance - the note was paid to a butcher, and then to a person in Smithfield.</p>

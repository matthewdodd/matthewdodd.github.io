            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On Wednesday, the 7th of March, I saw my mistress put the things into the window, the glass was whole and safe; at half-past eight o'clock in the morning. After the window was set out, I was going in to breakfast about nine o'clock, my mistress had gone to breakfast - my master was up stairs in his dressing-room. I was coming out of the kitchen, and looked in the shop as I passed through it, and saw the prisoner with another man at the window, I went down the shop nearer to the window and saw the prisoner in the act of pulling the muslin out of the window, and tucking it under his coat - he dragged it through a broken pane of glass. I ran to the door and cried Stop thief! they separated and ran off - I followed the prisoner. A man at a building stopped him, and took him to the Black Boy, public-house - he had got about a hundred yards, he was searched there; when he was first taken I saw him drop a piece of handkerchiefs in the dirt, I did not pick them up. When I got to the house I saw another piece of handkerchiefs and a piece of muslin taken from under his coat by Taylor.</p>

            . I was at the Black Boy, I saw the prisoner drop a piece of muslin as they were was bringing him to the public-house, I picked it up, took it to the public-house, and when he was brought in I took two more pieces of muslin from under his coat, I kept all three till the officer came, and then delivered them to Wiltshier in the officer's presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. - Q. Are you sure he dropped the muslin. - A. Yes, I did not lose sight of him afterwards.</p>

             re-examined. I know them by the private mark - I missed other things from the window, some Mecklin net and ribbon; my mistress told me the lace was missing - she is not here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. - Q. Did the person turn the corner, so that you might lose sight of him. - A. No, I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>MR. BOMMENAER. The three pieces of muslin cost me above 30 s.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was taken into the public-house, that man was there - the muslin was dropped in the street, how could he see me drop it; I was running after the thief, and got the muslin from him, they took me because I had the property. A carman came by who knew the man that took it.</p>

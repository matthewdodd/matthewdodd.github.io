On Monday the 8th of December, the prisoner came into our shop about twelve or one o'clock, as she usually did about that time, she wanted to buy some sewing silk, or to change some, I had suspected her the day before; she had bespoke a capuchin at our shop and bought the lace to trim it; we sent her backwards that we might have an opportunity of counting the bundles of silk thread, which we did, and there were six of them, I left her to look for what she liked; some of these bundles contained a quarter of a pound, some half a pound, and some three quarters ; they were several kanes tied up together. When I was on the other side the shop, I thought I saw her putting something into her pocket; as she was sambling about with her cloak she chose her silk and paid for it ; I let her go out of the shop and pass three or four doors; after I had told the bundles I fetched her back, and taxed her with taking a bundle, but she denied it very much, and said I was mistaken ; I took her about three or four yards into the shop, I thought I saw her fuoibling under her petticoats, so pufled her a little on one side and found the silk lying on the floor under her; then I called the other people which were in the shop to see it as it lay, there were seven or eight customers, and all at that time; then she was carried backwards,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175301110031"></xptr> but nothing more found; then she said it was the first fact, and desired to be let go on her knees.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain the silk did not lie on the floor before you brought her back ?</p>
               <p>Turner. I am certain that it fell from her. The file produced in court and deposed to.</p>

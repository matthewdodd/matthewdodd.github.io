I said I could not give him 30 l I would give him 25 l. I would not give him any more; he said, he wanted money to go out on the morrow and I should have them; I paid for them and my boy took them home; about a month after my house was searched for these goods; the things were lying about, they laid hold of them; I told them if it was about those things I would go with them, and bid them take what they saw of the things; I was sadly frightened: they laid hold of my husband; I said for God's sake don't meddle with him, for he was in France at the time; I said, I would take them to the man I had them of, if that would do; they went with one of my boys and took the prisoner and brought him to me; I told them he was the man: I had the things six or seven weeks before my house was searched.</p>

The day before my house was searched the prisoner came and said, he had two odd silk stockings; I told him I had not sold the things, and he might match them; he matched them and went away; this is the stocking he left with me; it was found when the house was searched; it is marked M 3.</p>
               <p>Mrs. WEISS. This stocking belongs to my lady; it was marked W. that mark is out, M 3. is a new mark (the fellow of it produced) this has been marked W but it is cut out and the place sewed up.</p>

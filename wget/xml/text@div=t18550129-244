                  </hi>. In consequence of some information that I received, I spoke to Pollard on the morning of 15th Dec., on meeting him at the corn market—I said, "I have ascertained that you have been having corn from my place, and you knew it was dishonestly obtained"—he said, "No, I never have"—I said it was useless for him to tell me so, for I was in possession of information, and I knew he had frequently had corn away; and I asked him sharply what he had done with the five quarters of oats that he had had away the week before last, and I think I mentioned the day—he hesi<lb></lb>tated for some little time, and then said, Well, he had had five quarters away; he remembered that he had, but he could not remember where he had taken them to—I told him it was of no use for him to tell me that he could not say where he had taken them to, and he must tell—he then said that he had sold them to a man that he had met, going over Southwark-bridge, for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he did not know the man, nor where he lived, but he delivered them from his own cart into the other man's cart—I asked him what he was to pay for the oats to my men—he said, "17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a quarter"—I then told him that the two parties who were with me in plain clothes were policemen, and I should give him into their custody—I asked him how he could think of robbing me in that way—he said he had been urged to do it by the others; they were continually teasing him to take the corn away, and he had often done it before—I do not think he mentioned the names of the men—I do not now remember whether he said who delivered them to him, but my impression rather is that he did name some one—he said, "Some were white oats, and some black oats"—we have all our orders and receipts filed—there is no order filed for the delivery of ten sacks of oats to Pollard, or any receipt from him for that amount—he was not employed in the warehouse; he was not a servant in the actual sense of the word, but was merely employed as a carman to cart for us—when I first brought the matter to his attention, I told him that he was engaged to</p>

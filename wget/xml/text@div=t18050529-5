             sworn. - I am an officer: On Monday, the 6th of May, I went in company with Mr. Robinson to No. 21, Castle-place, to Mrs. Young's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Mrs. Young's husband? - A. He is a City porter, she takes in washing; in searching about the house, we found several things which I produce; I then insisted upon searching the prisoner's pockets, which she resisted, and said I should not; in struggling, I was obliged to pull them off before I could search them; I found in the pockets a gold ring and forty-two duplicates, part of which is Mr. Robinson's property; we then searched Mrs. Young's trunks, and there we found some of Mr. Robinson's property; the prisoner said she had put them there herself; I then took her to Lambeth-street Office, where she confessed that she had pledged those things at Mr. Spinkes's, in Gracechurch-street, and that they were her master's property; I then told her that her master had lost some rings, which were very valuable; she said, she knew nothing more than what she told me.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Spinkes, No. 2, Gracechurch-street; I produce a waistcoat, a napkin, and a handkerchief, pledged for six shillings, pledged on the 25th of March. On the 1st of May, three table-cloths, two napkins, two pillow-cases, one pair of stockings, and three handkerchiefs; these pledges I took in myself from the prisoner at the bar, the young man that took in the other things is gone away.</p>

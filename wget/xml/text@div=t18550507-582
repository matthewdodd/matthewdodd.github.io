                  </hi>. I live in St. George's-place, Walworth-road. On 23rd April, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was coming out of my warehouse, and saw the three prisoners walking along together—about half an hour afterwards, as I was returning to my warehouse, I saw Nash go into Mr. Colson's shop, about thirty yards from where I had seen them all together—when Nash went into Mr. Colson's, the other two prisoners were on the opposite side of the way—I went into a shop near to Mr. Colson's, and soon afterwards Mr. Colson came into the shop where I was, and asked for change for a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I gave him the change, and I told him to go in, and I would follow him—I put the crown piece in my mouth, and found it was bad—I followed Mr. Colson to his shop, and found Nash there—I saw Mr. Colson give him the change, and Nash left the shop—I crossed the road, and followed the two female prisoners—they went in the same direction that Nash did, but on the opposite side of the way—I heard Stevens say to Price, that I was after him—I crossed the road to speak to a constable—Nash went down Hanover-street—the two females followed me—when I had spoken to the constable, I went and caught Nash—I took hold of him and said I wanted him—he did not say anything to me—Stevens ran away—Price came up to me, and said I should not take Nash—I said I wanted her as well—she said I should not take her—I gave her into custody to the policeman, and I gave him the counterfeit crown—my brother was with me while I was going after the prisoners.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patrol, on the 16th of November, about ten minutes past ten at night, I stopped the prisoner, in company with four others, by the side of Mr. Green's rope-ground, called Bagnigge-walk, three more patrols were with me; and going to search them, a gentleman and lady came up that had that moment been robbed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Council for the Prisoner. You did not find any offensive weapons on this young man? - Nothing at all, on searching the prisoner I found a gold seal and key, we found nothing else upon him.</p>
               <p>Court to Davis. What chain had you to your watch? - A black ribband, I had no chain.</p>
               <p>(The seal and key handed to the Judge.)</p>
               <p>Had you any thing fastened to the ribband besides the seal and key? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>What was the impression on the seal? - I believe it is a Shakespeare's head, but I will not swear to it, the key is an upright<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178412080071"></xptr> key, there has been a hook in the key originally, which is broke out, and which I think made the key particular, as I could safely swear to it.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at that key? - This is the key.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Davis. Begnigge-wells we all know is a place much frequented by young gentlemen that are in business in town? - It is.</p>
               <p>Is it usual, when they stay late, to make parties to come home together? - I never go into the room, but many people go home together.</p>

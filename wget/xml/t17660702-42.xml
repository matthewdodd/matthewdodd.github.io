            . I am the widow to the deceased; my husband came home about twelve o'clock that night; he was all over ashes; he said, he had been very ill used at a house in Thames-street by two villains; he complained prodigiously of his head, and said, the villain had given him his last blow, and desired I would go and get a friend on the morrow to see them brought to justice: all I gave him the next day came up again; he was very feverish; he got up, and went out about two hours, and came in again, and said he could drink nothing; he continued reaching all that night. I went out, and when I returned, my landlady told me my husband was dying. I went up to him; he had a violent fit, he had had one before. I sent for a surgeon, who bled him; this was on Thursday the 14th; he mentioned several times of their throwing gun-powder in his face; on the 28th at night he said he could neither spit nor blow his nose, but it made his head seem as if it would come in halves; he died between the 28th and 29th of May, a fortnight after he received this injury, and left word with me to bring them to justice as far as I could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ioney. I was sent for to the deceased on the 15th of May; he complained very much of his head; I asked him by what means it came; he informed me, he had been at a public-house by Thames-street, and in a fall his head went against something, and it grew worse and worse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention to you who did him the injury?</p>
               <p>Ioney. No, he did not; he mentioned two captains and some others: the symptoms he had upon him denoted an injured brain; upon which, I examined his head, but could find no wound or tumour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did those symptoms continue?</p>
               <p>Ioney. They did, till his death; he died, I think, the 28th; after his death I was desired to open the head, which I did, in the presence of another surgeon; we found there was no injury done to the external part, and the cranium was quite found; upon examining the brain itself, we found a large quantity of extravasated blood between the membrane and the brain, on the right side, the side he always complained of, from the time of his receiving the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. From the whole of your observation, what in your opinion was the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Ioney. There is no doubt but the extravasation of blood in the brain, was the occasion of his death. No man could live in such a case.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you account for that extravasated blood?</p>
               <p>Ioney. No, but the concussion or shock might break a blood-vessel in the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not intemperate drinking burst the vessel?</p>
               <p>Ioney. Undoubtedly that is possible, from drinking or violent exercise.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have lived so long if the vessels of the brain had discharged any blood that night when he received an injury?</p>
               <p>Ioney. I think it is improbable, by reason the injury in the brain appeared increasing. I found nothing staid upon his stomach, and two days after he became paralytic, and that increased more and more to the time of his death; these are symptoms of an injured brain.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a man has lived in general a very intemperate life as to drinking, and should happen to fall with his head downwards, might that occasion the bursting of a blood-vessel in the brain?</p>
               <p>Ioney. Without doubt it may, the vessels being full.</p>

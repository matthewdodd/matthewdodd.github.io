                  </hi>. I live at 39, Blackheath Hill, Greenwich, and am a retired confectioner—on the night of the 25th January I went to bed about 11 o'clock, having properly closed my premises myself—about 2.30 in the morning I heard a noise like glass breaking—I went to my window and looked out and saw two men there, and I went downstairs to the door and found a policeman holding the prisoner—he said "You had better look round your premises and see if they are safe"—I found two books gone, a Scotch snuff-box, and a piece of quartz from the mantel shelf in the front room, where they were when I went to bed—when the policeman called me the window was partly open and was broken.</p>

I was on duty on the morning in question on Blackheath Hill, and hearing a noise I went to the premises No. 39, and I saw the prisoner coming out of the gate—I asked him what he was doing and he said he was on his' road to Gravesend—I said I was not satisfied with the explanation, and knocked at the door and found the place broken into, the window broken, and the latch forced back, and in the garden two books belonging to the prosecutor—I took him to the station and found on him a snuff-box, a piece of quartz (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said I had put them there—I had not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know her before? - A. No; I think I recollect something of her face loitering about the back-gate; the great coat and muslin were mine.</p>
               <p>MARY SUTHERLAND sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Satchell; I heard a noise of feet up stairs; I went up and saw the prisoner going down the hill by the counting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. That is over this bridge, as you call it? - A. Yes; I followed her, and took hold of her, and asked her what the wanted in the parlour; she told me she had got songs to fell, she had a basket; I asked her to come back with me, and she swore she had got nothing belonging to me, though I had not charged her with any thing; and, as she spoke those words, the wind blew her cloak back, and I saw the muslin; I told her that belonged to my mistress; then she dropped the great coat my master has on now, and the muslin, at my feet; I kept hold of her and took them up; my master came, and took her into custody.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my great coat, it lay in a chair just by where the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Sutherland.) Is that your mistress's muslin? - A. Yes; my mistress and I were both working on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. She followed me, and asked me what I had got; I don't know where the house is; she took something off the ground; what it was I don't know, it was not from me; I go about and fell songs and godly books; I never was in the man's house in my life; I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>

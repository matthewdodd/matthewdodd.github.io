                  </hi>. I have known the prisoner a number of years—he was in the habit of bringing bills, and making inquiries about them for me, and his father and sister too. On the 5th or 6th of Dec. he brought me this bill for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a bill of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had had before, and this did not appear to bear the same signature—I said, "This is not Margaret Dubock's writ<lb></lb>ing"—he said, "Indeed it is, she wrote it in my presence"—I received a bill purporting to be accepted by Mr. William Clarke, on the 10th or 12th of Nov.—he represented Clark as a wig-maker, in Great Suffolk-street.</p>

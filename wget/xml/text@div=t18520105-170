                  </hi>. I keep the Rising Sun. On 2nd Jan. I received a sixpence from my niece, the last witness—I said it was bad—Evans was there—I told her it was bad—she said she was not aware of it—after biting it and doubling it up I gave it her again, and she went out—I went out, and Evans joined Eldridge, about twenty yards from my house, on the other side of the way—they moved on—I followed, and met a policeman—I directed his attention to them.</p>

I had my attention called by Mr. Hall to the prisoners—I followed them, and overtook them about 100 yards further—when I took them, Eldridge put her hand to her mouth several times—I took her by her throat, and out of her mouth she dropped twelve counterfeit sixpences—I took possession of them—in going to the station she said she might as well give me the rest, and she gave me three more from her bosom, wrapped in a piece of linen—site said I was too sharp, or else she would have swallowed them—nothing was found on Evans.</p>

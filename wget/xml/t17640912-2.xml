            . On the 29th of July, I observed the prisoner, with others, and especially one Germain. who had an adze in his hand, pretending to be a cooper, but he was no cooper, I think the prisoner had an adze also, and they were busy about the tobacco hogshead on the key. I saw the prisoner pull out tobacco, and put it into his pocket; I went and charged him with it; he was very abusive, and shov'd me about, and swore he would take tobacco, pretending to have a right so to do. I, with a great deal of difficulty, searched him, and found a pound of tobacco upon him; he, with the others, threw some away, and his companion Germain threatened me, if I took the prisoner in custody. I know no business they had on the key, except that of pilfering, which I had before observed several times.</p>

               <p>I was there, heading up a hogshead: I asked the man for a chew of tobacco, and he gave me that tobacco, and when Mr. Burch had me in custody, that man came and told him he gave me that tobacco.</p>

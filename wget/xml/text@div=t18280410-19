               <p>Q. That is supposing him to have received a message from a person at the door? A. Exactly so; he opened the drawing-room door - I was sitting near the fire; he crossed the room at the usual place which a servant would to give his master a letter - he presented me with this letter, (producing it;) he said nothing on giving it to me I believe - I immediately opened it, being surprised at a letter coming to me on a Sunday night at that hour; I did not read the letter half through; I got to about the middle of it, and said to my nephew who is in partnership with me in business - "What does this mean? why this is a hoax or an imposition;" it was a complaint of our negligence in not executing an order, which had never been given; while my nephew was just looking at the letter - I said to the prisoner, "Why sure you have not left the man who brought this in the hall?" and upon his appearing to admit that it was so, (I will not say that he said yes, but by his manner I considered that he had; he might have said yes, but I considered that he had; he might have said yes, but I cannot recollect;) we all started up together, I, my nephew and Mrs. Perry; we all ran down, and the prisoner was with us.</p>
               <p>Q. From the bell ringing until you went down into the hall what length of time do you think elapsed? A. From the ringing of the bell I consider it was two or three minutes, but from the time he came into the room until the time we were at the bottom of the stairs was but one minute; I have tried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then would four or five minutes be an extension of the whole time? A. Oh yes; when I got into the hall I observed the street door not wide open, but about 15 or 18 inches open, just sufficient for a person to pass through, and no one standing there; the prisoner immediately looked towards the door of the dining-room, which had no light in it, but it was faintly lighted by the hall lamp, which is exactly opposite that door; it has not a patent but a flat burner - the prisoner, shewing a great deal of alarm in his manner, said, "Oh! the sideboard drawer is open;" I instantly went in and observed the four plated bottle-stands which had been used at dinner, with some figs and oranges, which also had been used at dinner, and put away; remained in the sideboard drawer; the sideboard drawer is immediately on a line with the door - we had dined in that room and left it about an hour; at the back part of the drawer was a sugar-bason to hold white sugar; it had a silver spoon in it, which had been used at dinner - we did not miss it that night, but next day we found the spoon had been removed.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened at this time? A. I turned round and missed the small dial clock which stood on the chimney piece; after carefully examining the parlour, we all immediately went into the back parlour, which is immediately behind the front.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could a stranger who had come into your hall for the first time, have been conducted to the chimney-piece, where the clock was, by the light from the hall? - A. I think he might; we went into the back parlour - the hall lamp does not throw a light into that room - it was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100024"></xptr>perfect darkness, except a small glimmer on going in; we had brought no light down with us - we only had the light the hall lamp afforded; I told the prisoner to get a light instantly, which he did, and on his bringing it, I found the scrutoire, below the book-case, had a drawer open, and a box-coat and another coat gone from it - that drawer was always shut when I went into the room - it was his business to put my coat there; the door of that room opens against the book-case; another great coat was gone, which had hung behind that door; in the drawer were some papers, and a red morocco travelling case, which had not been moved. I said to the prisoner, "Why, good Heavens! I should not wonder if the plate is gone," and said angrily, "I believe you are concerned in this robbery;" he made no reply to that remark, but we all ran down to his pantry, where he kept his plate - it is a room behind the kitchen, and is called the butler's pantry.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then he made no answer to your remark, that you should not wonder if the plate was gone, or to his being concerned? A. I do not recollect that he did; when we got down stairs, close to the pantry door, before we got into the pantry, he exclaimed, "Why, my coat is gone;" my nephew was with me; when we got into the pantry, I immediately looked for the plate, and the whole of the silver plate appeared to have been gone; I cast my eye on the dresser in the first instance, to look for it; my plate consisted of seventy-eight pieces, and was of considerable value: on the first view of the pantry, I considered that it was all cleared away - it was worth about 120l.; the spoons and forks, and small articles, were usually kept in a box, which we had brought up stairs at night - the box was about twelve inches long, and eight wide; on the dresser laid the baize lining, which was intended for the smaller articles - that had been taken out of the box, and laid on the dresser; the box was not there, and has not been found; below the dresser is a closet with folding doors, on the shelf of which is usually deposited four silver candlesticks for the table - not chamber ones; two large plated candlesticks remained, but the four silver ones were gone - I believe the plated ones were usually kept with the silver ones - they had not been used that day; we burn a lamp at dinner; all the candlesticks were used together when we had company; two plated ones, belonging to the other two, were up in the drawing-room: I had a large plated dish and cover, that was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other plated articles remain below? A. Yes; a plated toast-rack hung up, and a plated winestrainer was on the shelf, immediately adjoining it - they were left; in the cupboard adjoining, where the candlesticks stood, was a plated cruet-frame, a plated pickle, and a plated soy-frame - they all remained; the cruet-frame was brought to the dinner table every day, and the soyframe when we had fish; the two small silver tops of the castors had been taken off, and laid close in front of the door-way, and the mustard-spoon was taken out of the mustard-pot, and laid on the dresser; we had drank tea that evening, and the silver spoons and milk-ewer, which had been used that night, were gone. I had dined with Mrs. Perry and my nephew, in the dining-room, and we went into the drawing-room to tea, about eight o'clock; the dinner things were cleared away from the dining-room before we left it, but the dessert things were left when we went up to the drawing-room; some of the things I have named remained in the dining-room when we went up stairs; we used a plated tea-pot at tea - that was not taken; the prisoner had taken down the tea things from the drawing-room - he was the only male servant in the house; we had no house-maid at that time, only a cook, and the nurserymaid, who was up one pair of stairs with the children; upon discovering our loss Mrs. Perry rang the nursery-bell; the cook came down - whether the nursery-maid came down I cannot say; I went up stairs, leaving my nephew in the kitchen with the prisoner; the watchman was passing - I called him in, and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How long, according to your judgment, would it take a person, even well acquainted with the premises, to take these things from the different places? A. A person well acquainted with the premises, and knowing the different articles, I should think would be very quick to do it in a quarter of an hour; I mean if he knew which was plated, and which was silver - if he had to examine them, to see which were plated, and which silver, it would take a much longer time, I should think, but it is a mere matter of opinion. I looked next day into the sideboard drawer, in the dining-room, and found the cut glass sugar-bason, but the silver sugar-ladle was gone, also a child's silver knife and fork, which was usually kept in the sideboard drawer, in a little green case; the linen, I should have said, was taken out of the drawer in the butler's pantry, and scattered on the ground.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You ordered the prisoner to fetch a light, and he brought one - was that in a servant's candlestick? A. Yes; we went down stairs with that candle, and I have no recollection of finding any other light below.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have spoken of different places where the silver was kept - did you, of your own knowledge, know where they were kept at that time? A. No. they were in the charge of the prisoner; I know the candlesticks were usually kept in the same place with the silver ones - I have seen them there, I suppose, within two or three months; when I asked if he had left the person who brought the letter in the hall; I am not sure whether he said Yes or anything, for my going down was so instantaneous.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say that he had left him there, and he had told you so at the time he gave you the letter? A. No, I do not recollect it; I have no recollection of his making any reply, I will not swear he did not say what you have stated, but I have no recollection of it, for when I said what I did, I rose up instantly; it was an action of a quarter of a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say, "I told you, Sir, when I gave you the letter, that the person was waiting?" A. No; I do not recollect one way or the other - I believe nothing passed, but I will not swear it; I did not ask if he had left the person, but said, "Surely you have not left the man in the hall;" I thought the ring at the bell was louder than usual - I noticed that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hand the letter to your nephew, and ask him if you had such a customer? A. I said, "Look at this - this is a hoax." I swear I did not ask him if we had such a customer, because I knew there was no such person - I swear that, to the best of my belief. None of my property has been found - the dish-covers were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182804100025"></xptr>plated, not silver; I knew what articles I had as well as a gentleman might know; the prisoner had a list of the plate - I knew what was plated, and which were silver, having purchased them; I could recollect what articles were plated, because there were but few: I should be more confused to recollect the silver articles: he had a list of the silver. I do not know the state of the area gate on the night in question, but my nephew does; I tried the kitchen door that night, after the robbery, and found it shut - that was about nine o'clock: I think it was while the watchman was waiting for him, as I had desired him to take his livery off, and put on his own clothes; the watchman came in at the hall door - the ring at the bell was about nine o'clock, and the prisoner was in custody about ten minutes after nine o'clock; the whole transaction did not occupy more than ten minutes - a considerable portion of the property had been used at dinner, and I had seen two-thirds of it in the course of that afternoon. I could give you the items that were on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner was in the house from eight to nine o'clock? A. Yes, for he brought the tea up about eight o'clock, and about twenty minutes to nine took it down; as far as I can say, he was in the house from dinner time, till the note was brought to me - his own great coat, which hung in the servant's hall, was gone.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have been asked if the prisoner was in the house from eight to nine o'clock on Sunday evening - had he been absent on the day preceding? A. Yes, he went out at twelve o'clock, and returned at four; he had out leave to go out. None of the silver plate was left except what was locked in the iron-chest up stairs; I do not recollect any being left except the two castor tops.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The plate which was in daily use you saw frequently? A. Every day; and when we had company I saw what was on the table or sideboard; I knew what number of spoons and articles I had, and should have had no difficulty in pointing out what was plated and what was silver. I bought my plate four years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was true. that when the prisoner presented you with the letter, he had left the man who brought it in the hall - could that man by possibility, before you got down stairs, have visited the places you have spoken of? A. No. it was impossible - there was not time for him even to have gone through the various places, without selecting the articles; if there had been three men they could not have made the selection in less than five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>MR. GEORGE JAMES PERRY. I am the prosecutor's nephew. On Sunday, the 17th of February I dined with him in Woburn-place, and recollect about nine o'clock in the evening the prisoner bringing a letter into the drawing-room. On my uncle opening and reading a little of the letter, he threw it down on the table towards me, saying it must be a trick, an imposition, or something of that kind; without my waiting to read the letter through, we all jumped up and ran down stairs - the letter was about ten lines, this is it (looking at it.) On going down stairs I observed the street door apparently open; I immediately looked into the back parlour; I went in at the door, which opens into the hall, and on going in missed my great coat off the back of a chair - we very shortly proceeded down the kitchen stairs to a small room behind the kitchen, which I understand to be the butler's pantry, and there I observed the prisoner's linen scattered about the floor; it was fit for use, clean from the laundress. My uncle very soon said he should send for the watchman, for he was sure the prisoner must be implicated - the prisoner was then close by me and within hearing; I was as near my uncle as him; I am hard of hearing and I heard it; the prisoner made no answer to that remark; the watchman came in at last; I saw the prisoner take his livery coat off, and while he was doing so, he told me that when he let the man in he took the letter, and put it on the end of the bannister rail, while he went down stairs and put on his livery coat, and that when he returned up to take the letter to the drawing-room, the man was still standing on the mat.</p>
               <p>Q. What interval of time in your opinion elapsed from the time the prisoner entered the drawing-room with the letter till your uncle went down stairs? A. It must have been in less than a minute I think; I do not recollect hearing the bell ring - I have been some time acquainted with my uncle's house - a person acquainted with the premises and with the property, I think it would have taken ten minutes to get it, but if not acquainted with the property and premises, if he had a light, which he must have had, I should think it would have taken upwards of twenty minutes - he could not do it without a light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. After your uncle had read the letter, do you remember his observing to the prisoner,"Why, you have not left the man standing in the hall, have you?" A. Yes. I have not the least recollection of the prisoner saying "Yes, Sir, I told you so when I gave you the letter" or of his saying any thing, the time passed so quickly - I do not think any words were uttered - my uncle is a glass-manufacturer: when I went along with the prisoner and watchman to the watch-house, I tried the area gate with my hand, and it was fastened - it cannot be fastened without being locked with a key - there is no catch lock to it, it is necessary to lock it to fasten it, as it appeared to me - I observed no catch lock to it - I will not swear there was none - I merely tried the bars of the gate with my hand - I cannot say whether the back area door was open or shut; I believe it was the first time I was down in that part of the house - not in the kitchen; the door leading from the kitchen to the street appeared closed when I was at it; I cannot say whether any body had previously closed it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you recollect the prisoner taking down the tea things? A. I do; he had his livery coat on then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Supposing a man to have been in the hall when the prisoner left the hall to come up with the letter, in your judgment, was there time enough for him to go into the back parlour, and take your coat, and rush out of the house before you got down; supposing he had nothing else to do? A. I think he might have done that, but he could certainly not have done any thing more; he could not have gone to the chimney-piece for the clock, nor have gone down to the butler's pantry.</p>

            . On Sunday the 17th of February, I was in Mr. Perry's service as cook; I remember going into the butler's pantry during church time - about 12 o'clock; during morning service; the plate was there then, in separate parcles; I went out about eight in the evening to church - the prisoner let me out at the area gate; I had never before gone out at the area gate, on Sunday evening, while the prisoner was in my master's service; he unlocked the gate, and let me out - he kept the key himself; as I went out, he asked, how long I should be out? whether I should be back in time to take the nurse's supper up by nine o'clock; I said Yes - I returned from church about nine, or a few minutes before; I rang the hall bell and the prisoner let me in - he had his livery coat on then; I went in through the hall door - I went into the kitchen; put the nurse's supper on the tray, and then went up with it - and when I had been in the nursery about five minutes, my master made an alarm of a robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after the prisoner had let you in, dressed in his livery? A. I should think about tea minutes and five minutes after I got up stairs with the nurse's supper; I found the nurse in the nursery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the footman brought the tea things down, if he was about to wash them up, would he take off his livery coat? A. Yes, while he washed them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to speak accurately to the time which elapsed from when you came in till the alarm? A. I think it was about ten minutes; I remarked then that I had not been ten minutes in the house; I have no recollection of having been into the butler's pantry after master came from church, till after the robbery - the prisoner, the nurse and myself were the only servants; there was nobody in the house the whole of the day to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAM PERRY re-examined. When I went down stairs I saw the tea things which had come from the drawing-room - they had not been washed, nor had the dessert things which came from dinner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whether the prisoner had been about to wash them at any time you cannot tell? A. No.</p>

            . I am a charwoman. On Friday, the 15th of February, I was employed at Mr. Perry's, and saw the prisoner there that day doing his work; I was on the kitchen stairs that day with my water, and he asked me if I knew whether that dish was silver, for the cook had told him it was; I believe he was cleaning it; it was a deep square dish for holding a stew, with a cover to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you been in conversation together before this? A. No; I had been up stairs at work - I believe this was on Friday, but I was there on Friday and Saturday; I had not been talking to him about plate before - I had been in common conversation with him; I had come down for water, and was going up with it - he stopped me, and asked if I knew whether the dish was silver; I said, "I know nothing about it, John," and went up stairs - nobody was present - the cook might be within hearing; I did not see her, for I was on the stairs, and she in the kitchen; I had been in the kitchen - I do not know whether she was in the kitchen or scullery - she was in the kitchen when I got the water; the scullery is a good way from the stairs - I cannot tell how far.</p>

            .

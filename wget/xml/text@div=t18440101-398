On Friday night, the 24th of Nov., I went to bed about half-past twelve o'clock I fastened up the house myself—I had two clocks, one in the bar, and one in the parlour—I had six silver tea-spoons, one silver table-spoon, sugar-tongs, two boxes of cigars in the bar, fifty-eight knives, fifty-eight forks, some tobacco, and a tablecloth, the greater portion or all of which were safe on I the preceding night—I called up the servants at half-past six next morning—one of them made a communication to me—I came down, and found the house had been broken into—the servant is not here—there is a wall running down by the side and back of my house, separating it from Tilney-court—I found a hole had been cut in that wall, large enough to admit me through—they had then cut some holes through the pannel of the back-door with a centre<lb></lb>bit, sufficient to put a man's arm through and unbolt it—I found that door open when I came down—I have known James Harvey Smith by sight a very short time—I know he lived down the court, but do not know exactly the house—when I came down in the morning I missed all the articles I have stated.</p>

               <p>4th of Dec., I saw the prisoner James pass my shop—I followed him about six or seven houses from mine, when I was getting towards him suppose he saw me, and after he had crossed the road, he went in different direction to what he had been going—he went towards Bethnal<lb></lb>green, and returned again—I went up to him, caught him by the arm, am said, "You are the person that sold me the dial on Monday night last'—he said, "I never had a clock or spring dial of any kind to sell "—that was the name he gave it—I mentioned both clock and spring dial to him—he said, "No, I never had a clock," and I said, "The spring dial"—he said no—I said, "I am certain you are the man"—he said, "I am not"—; then said, "Well, will you have the kindness to walk over, and my wife will see you?"—he did so—when in the shop I called my wife, and said to her. "Have you any knowledge of this person? "—she immediately said, "Yes, I have, you are the person who sold a clock to my husband last Monday night'—he said she was quite mistaken in the identity—I then sent for a constable, and gave the prisoner into custody—this carpet bag produced by Moore I be<lb></lb>lieve to be the one the prisoner brought the clock in—I am certain as to the blueness of the pattern—there was a padlock on it when he brought it to me which he unfastened with a small key that he had—the padlock was fastened on to this little loop or book.</p>

               <p>and "distress"—when I got into the shop they were talking together—I did not notice the conversation particularly, but I know it was that he wanted my husband to buy a clock—I went into the parlour for a candle, and they hung it up—I held the candle in my hand till, I think, the prisoner took it out of my hand, in hanging up the clock, to show the hook—I saw the prisoner leave with the clock in a carpet bag—I did not notice the pattern of the bag, and cannot say anything about it—he came back in about ten mi<lb></lb>nutes—I saw him return, I had not left the shop, and my husband purchased the clock for 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I saw the prisoner again that day week, when my hus<lb></lb>band brought him into the shop—I have no doubt about the prisoner being the person who brought the clock.</p>

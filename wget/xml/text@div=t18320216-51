            . I am an inspector of Police. On the 12th of January I went with Martin and Boden to the prisoner's house - he was painting the posts, which the carpenter was putting up; I asked whose they were - he said they were his, he had had them given him six months before, by Mr. Waite, who used to keep the Fortune of War, next door to him; I said Mr. Waite had not kept the Fortune of War for six months past - he said No, he had left it.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner there the second time I went, but not the first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You say you had seen these posts safe within three months? A. It might be four months; it was not so much as six - I think it was in october, or it might be in September: it could not be in August - I have been in Mr. Cumberland's service for fourteen years; I have now a discharge from him, in consequence of a letter which has been sent to him - I am to leave on Saturday week; I believe these posts came from Lord Camden's estate; his Lordship's work is not yet finished - I do not know whether the prisoner is his Lordship's tenant; the posts were not painted when I first saw them - I did not speak to the carpenter; they were next the pavement, in front of the garden - the prisoner consented to their being taken down, and then refused; he then consented again, and they were taken down - I did not say that I had a doubt whether they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160022"></xptr>were my master's; I went before the Justice - I do not know that I knew any body was coming up for the prisoner; I did not go to his wife, and say there was nothing in the charge, and there was no occasion to bring up any body; I did not go to her with any message - I saw her on the Thursday morning, before the prisoner was taken - I told her the posts were my master's, and she said they had been in their place a long time: I did not go to the house a second time - I do not know that I saw her again.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you again, and desire you to recollect yourself - did you or did you not see the prisoner's wife again? A. No, Sir, I did not, nor speak to her any where - Hilyard was the carpenter who was putting up the posts; he told me that Lovegrove found the posts, and that he had had them for six months, and he himself was to find the rails.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM AGGS. I made inquiry about the prisoner of the persons he referred to, and they gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see the prisoner's wife on any occasion? A. Yes, he desired me to go to the neighbourhood and inquire his character, and I went to his house, but not with an intention of seeing his wife; I went to see a lady named Lardner, who is now in Court - his wife said she was going down to the Police-office, and I said I did not think it was necessary - I did not think the prisoner was in danger; Mr. Cumberland desired me to say he did not wish to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to Mrs. Lardner, "Madam, you need not attend - it will save you a dirty walk? A. I did not say she need not attend; I do not recollect saying any thing about a dirty walk - I will not swear I did not: I told his wife she might expect him home by twelve or one o'clock, because the prosecutor said he did not wish to prosecute, he only wished him to be reprimanded, or to have some slight punishment.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you let them know when you found the Magistrate was disposed to commit the prisoner? A. No, there were several of his friends there, who knew what the Magistrate did, and I thought they would let them know - I believe the prisoner is a painter and glazier; his house is about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I was employed to put up these posts and rails; about seven months ago I repaired the back part of the kitchen for the prisoner - he said, "What shall I give you to put up some palings in front of my garden?" I said, "What am I to find?" he said, "Nails and rails - I have the posts in my garden;" I went and looked at them, and on the day stated I was putting them up; any person might have looked over the wall, and seen the posts in his garden - the prisoner said to Boden and Martin, "If you can swear to the posts swear to them here;" they said they could not, and he then consented to their being taken up - I was at the first hearing, and I was preparing to go to the second hearing, but the inspector came, said that no person would be wanted, and that Mr. Lovegrove would be at home at twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When had you seen these posts? A. About May - I do not mean to say that these are the posts I saw in his garden, but he had oak posts; I looked at them, and said they were rather short - he said, "Yes, but I have an oak bedstead up stairs, which I mean to cut up for spars;" I then said they would do very well - I noticed one was longer than the others, and so are these - he said I might do the job at any time that suited me, and I had a house to finish, which prevented my doing this before; the prisoner is a painter - I heard him say he had the posts of Mr. Waite.</p>

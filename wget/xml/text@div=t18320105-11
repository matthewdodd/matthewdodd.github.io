            , who is the landlord, lives in the house - I also live there. On Tuesday evening, the 3rd of January, about five minutes to five o'clcok, I was in my shop serving a customer, and heard a pane of glass snap; I lifted up some pictures in the window, and saw the prisoner's hands through the window, holding some paper, which was nearly as far inside the window as he could reach; I then went out, and stood behind him for about a minute and a half, and he was in the act of drawing the paper out, when I laid hold of him - he had quite moved it from the place where it had been; I brought him into the shop, and gave him in charge of the Policeman, Graham; there were three more with him, but they ran away - I did not know him before; the window had been broken before; there was a hold about the size of my two fingers - that hold was not large enough to draw the paper out; when I secured him the pane of glass was nearly out of the window - it had been broken two days before, and I put a large stiff piece of card against it, and nailed a piece of wood at the top and bottom; I put two tobacco-jars behind that - they were all removed, and the card pushed down; they continued in that way till I heard the glass crack - the paper was not actually taken away.</p>

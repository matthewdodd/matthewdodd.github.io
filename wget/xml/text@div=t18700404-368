                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Francis Edward Myers, as hop merchants, at 2 and 3, Hop and Malt Exchange—the prisoner has been in my service about ten years—since September, 1867, it was his duty to take charge of the cash-book, in which he would enter cash received and paid, nearly all relating to petty cash transactions—he would enter cheques handed to him for petty cash—if he required money for petty cash disbursements, he would come to me or my partner for it, and the cheque so given would be debited in the cash-book against him—it was his duty to make up a total of the cash-book each month—I had great confidence and trust in him, from the long time he had been in our service—on 29th January he came to me for a cheque for petty cash disbursements—I said "Have you spent the cheque that you last received?"—that was only a few days before—he gave me some rough particulars as to how he had spent that money—I was not quite satisfied, and asked him whether his cash agreed—he said not quite, that he had stopped the night before until 10 o'clock, and intended to stop another evening or two in the follow<lb></lb>ing week to set his book right—I asked him to show me the cash-book, which he did, and I found it had not been balanced since September 1st, 1869; it then showed a balance against him of 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him whether the balance then agreed with the cash—he said "No"—I got rather angry, and told him to take his hat and go at once—he then asked to speak to me privately—I went with him into the next room, and he said, "I am sorry to have to tell you that I have overdrawn my account"—I asked him how much it was—he said about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he could not say exactly, "But," he said, "I will secure you with a bill of sale on my father's furniture"—his father's furniture had been seized a long time ago, and he had made himself responsible to pay off the debt in weekly instal<lb></lb>ments—I wrote for him on the Tuesday or Wednesday following, and he came—in the interval I had had the books made up, and a balance struck—I have examined the books myself—on 29th January I find that the balance against him was 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him that—he said it could not be so much, it might be 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he added, "I must have had losses"—I asked him if he had taken any <hi rend="italic">lump</hi> sum at any one time—he said no, he had taken it in small amounts of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and it had been going on for two or three years—I said "If the money is not forthcoming, you must expect a policeman to be sent down to take you up"—in October last I had a traveller named Arthur Brodrich—I have my cheque book here—on 25th October I drew a cheque, payable to myself, for Brodrich's expenses—I don't know whether that cheque was given to the prisoner—there is an entry on the counterfoil of a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the word "Brodrich" in the prisoner's handwriting—that cheque is entered by the prisoner in the cash-book, on the credit side, but not on the debit—in the ordinary course of business, it should not have gone into that book at all—I have Brodrich's receipt for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner had no authority to take moneys from the petty cash and use it for his own purpobes, without asking me.</p>

               <p>prisoner away I had not the slightest suspicion of anything—I always found him pretty industrious—whin he first came to me he was paid weekly a very small salary, then he had £100 a year, paid quarterly—he was allowed to draw the money weekly, and debit himself with £25 at the end of the quarter—he sometimes attended from 8.30 a.m. to 9 or 10 p.m., not generally speaking—our general hours are from 9.30 to 7 in the evening—occasionally he would come as early as 8, and stay till 9 or 10—he had the invoices to attend to, the account sales, the English correspondence, list of amounts, Custom House work, keeping the day-book and balancing the cash-book; those were all his duties—I had access to the cash-book when<lb></lb>ever I liked—I was frequently in the habit of coming to him for sums of money out of the petty cash, and my partner also—my partner is not here—he left London this morning—you asked me these questions at the Police Court—no memorandum was kept by myself or partner of the turns—the prisoner ought to have kept a memorandum of them—they were only loans from one day to the other—there were no disputes between us as to those amounts—I daresay there were differences; I believe there was on one occasion—there may have been two—if the amount had been against the prisoner he would not have had to make it good—if at the end of the month he had said there was a deficiency, it would have been looked into, and most probably we should have taken the cash-book away from him—I told him if the money was not forthcoming he must expect to be arrested—if it had been forthcoming I don't know that he would not have been arrested—I meant by that, that I wanted the money—he was given into custody, I believe, a fortnight yesterday—that would be five or six weeks after I had discovered the deficiency—he was taken at his own house.</p>

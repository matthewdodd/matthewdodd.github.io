                  </hi>. I am a farmer, of Chipping Ongar, in Essex. On Tuesday, 1st Jan., I was returning from London to my residence—I had occasion to go through Epping Forest—I saw the prisoners about three o'clock in the day, just behind the Eagle at Snaresbrook, in Wan stead parish, on the road that leads to Woodford and Chigwell—I and my wife were in a gig—Joseph came up to my horse, took hold of its head, and stopped it—I asked him his business—he came up to the side of my horse, and I said to him, "Friend, what is your business?"—Joseph said, "Your life or your money," and immediately fired a pistol—I do not know whether it was</p>

                  </hi>. On Thursday, 1st Jan., I was returning home with my husband, from London, in a gig—in passing through Epping Forest, I saw the prisoners—it was about three o'clock—it might be a little after—they came, took hold of the horse, and demanded our money or our life, and directly Joseph fired off a pistol by the side of me—the discharge did not come very near me—it went down the road, by my side—the pistol was pointed by my side—it could not have hit me—it was not pointed at me—we both told them we had got no money—Joseph directly held another pistol pointing to us, and demanded our money, or he would blow our brains out—I and my husband told him we had got no money, and then James came up beside my husband, took him by his coat, and began to handle him, I suppose for his money, and my husband called out—James had something in his hand, but I do not know what—he took hold of my husband's coat, and said he wanted our money or our life—we told him we bad got no money, and he told us to be off, and if we looked back, or made any alarm, he would blow our brains out—we drove off—I think they said the place where we were stopped was in Wanstead parish, but I do not know—it was a little way beyond the iron bridge.</p>

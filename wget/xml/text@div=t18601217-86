                  </hi>. I have served as a steward in the navy—on 27th October, I was coming down Parliament-street; somebody accosted me, and I went with him to a public-house—I did not know him at all—soon afterwards a man with spectacles came in, who I did not know, and he and I and the other man, went to the White Horse, in Orchard-street, where we found Gibbons waiting in the skittle-ground with the skittles up, and Thompson came in afterwards—the prisoners played at skittles, and after they had played some time, somebody asked me to play; that was not either of the prisoners—I played with the whole of them except Thompson, who stood there, but did not play—before that, I went and pawned my watch for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and made up 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I deposited the money and lost it—after that, they found out by my conversation that I had 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at home—they said that if I knocked the skittles all down in ten times, I was to have 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but if I lost, I was to pay 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I knocked them down in three times, and asked for the money—it was in Thompson's hands, but was turned over to the other when I had won—I did not go on playing—they got me to sign a piece of paper, saying that it was a country note—Gibbons then said to me, "You had better run as hard as you can"—I asked him to come with me, but he said "No;" and it then struck me that there was something wrong I went back to the house, but they had all gone—I took Gibbons back, and was dragged down the steps.</p>

On 21st November, at 12 o'clock, I was on duty in Druty-lane, and the prisoners and three others passed me—the prosecutor gave me information, and I followed them past Russell-square—I did not take the prisoners then, but I did afterwards in one of the bye streets, when I met another constable—I saw Gibbons shifting something from his breast pocket and placing it somewhere else—I went across to the dock, searched him, and found these flash notes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his trousers—I said, "What have you got there he said, "It is nothing. only a piece of paper"—I took them—he had got a watch as he said, but it was only a piece of paper and a gilt chain—I searched Thompson, and</p>

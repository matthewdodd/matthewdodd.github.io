                  </hi> (City Police Sergeant 58). On Wednesday night, 4th July, about ten minutes to twelve o'clock, I was in plain clothes near the Tower ditch, and met five men—I swear positively to Pearce, and have no doubt Kelly is another—I stood one side, to allow them to pass me, on some blue clay near some sewage works—Pearce struck me, and I fell—he then got on me, tore my watchguard from my pocket, and attempted to take my watch—Kelly was at my trousers pocket, and attempted to take my money—my pocket was completely torn away—about 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was stolen from me—I called out "Police!" and Pearce took up some blue moist clay and plastered it in my mouth—I struggled hard with them, and eventually they got away—I was in the act of getting up when I was kicked on the knee<lb></lb>cap by one of them—I saved my watch—I pursued them, but I was not able to run, and they got away.</p>

                  </hi> (146 H). On 5th July, about half-past one in the morning, the prisoners and some others were pointed out to me—they ran down a court—I secured Kelly, and Fox took Pearce—I told Kelly I wanted him—he said that he knew nothing about what it was for—I took him to the prosecutor, who said, "That is the man"—I then told him the charge.</p>

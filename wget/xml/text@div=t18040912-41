               <p>Q. What is this girl? - A. She is a neighbour; she lives about three doors from me; her father is dead; her mother keeps a mangle.</p>
               <p>Q. What age is she? - A. I cannot tell; I missed money before at different times; she has been taken ever since the 21st of July, and been in prison. On the 10th, I had the shop robbed of a bowl full of money, and I put some money there on the 14th, to see whether they would come again; twelve shillings and sixpence there. On the 15th, the money was there, which was Sunday, and in the afternoon the money was gone; I was determined to find out some method to detect them, the shop laying intirely back from my house; I went to Hatton-garden, and engaged with the officer to detect them; I put some money there on the 16th, and told the officer to set up to watch. On Friday he came, and told me he could not come that night, he was upon particular business; I set up myself, and this girl came between three and four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she get in, at the window? - A. The pane was broke; there was a board put up there, she pulled it down, and came in; Mr. Hancock was called, and he came into the shop, and saw her; we let her come out of the shop with the property on her, because we thought there might be somebody else there; Mr. Hancock saw her come out, and he took her about three or four yards from the window; when he took her, he brought her into the house; she had nothing but a sort of a smock-gown on, and a pair of slippers; he ordered me to go to her mother's, and fetch her clothes, which I did; I saw nobody with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the money on her? - A. The money was in her hand in a bag; I called her mother up.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the prisoner.) Q. What age are you? - A. Not ten years.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Smith.) What kind of a woman is the mother? - A. She is a hard working woman, and has got a large family.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find out whether she was set on by any body? - A. I cannot tell; I produce the money; it was all marked by Mr. Smith, I desired him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

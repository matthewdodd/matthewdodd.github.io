            . I lived at No. 8, Almonry, Westminster, when this happened. On the night of the transaction I was in Dyer's shop, Tothill-street - Howard was there; Phillips stood at the side of the door - it was a little before one o'clock in the morning; the prisoner was in the shop - Phillips said to Howard, "I want to speak to you, Betsey, if you please;" she said, "I am coming;" the prisoner said, "What charge have you against this woman?" Phillips said, "I shan't detain her a minute," and they both walked out of the shop - the prisoner said nothing then; Phillips said again, "I want to speak to you, Betsey" they stood for a few moments, and the same words were repeated again, "I want to speak to you if you please," and the prisoner said to her, "You shan't go;" Phillips took his staff out of his pocket, and said to the prisoner, "Go back, or you will break the window."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike him, or strike at him, with his staff or any thing? A. No, nor was there any angry words, not in the least; Phillips and Betsey, and the prisoner likewise, then crossed over the road - they stood there a few moments, and the prosecutor again said, "I want to speak to you, if you please;" the prisoner said again, "You shan't go."</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after the staff had been drawn? A. Yes, and in a few minutes I saw him put his hand into his lefthand pocket, and with his right hand he stabbed Phillips; I could not see whether he took any thing out of his pocket - Phillips instantly exclaimed, "I am stabbed! I am stabbed! protect the prisoner, for that is the man that has done it;" he reeled as well as he could into Dyer's shop, holding his two hands where he was wounded - he was bent double, and the blood was running down; the prisoner exclaimed, "I have done nothing, so help me, God; what have I done?" I said, "You have stabbed Mr. Phillips, the Policeman, and he is in the cook-shop, having his wounds looked at;" I still remained in the cook-shop- I saw the prisoner secured at last by Ando.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the Policeman make any charge against the woman? A. No, not any in the least; nothing had been done when the Policeman took his staff out - he took it out to protect himself; nothing had been done to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true that the prisoner had put his hands on him, or attempted to touch him at all at the time he took his staff out? A. No, not in the least - Elizabeth Howard was about five yards from the Policeman; he was not speaking to her at the time the prisoner struck him - I will swear that; I was very near Phillips - I cannot exactly say how near; I was near enough to see the deed done, not more than three yards off, and perfectly sober: I am an unfortunate girl; Mad Harriet is a nick-name that has been given me - I never told any body that I knew nothing of this transaction, nor any thing of the kind- I never said I did not see the prisoner stab the Policeman for any thing to that effect, to any body: I do not know

               <p>Q. Did you not swear you had not spoken to her since the transaction? A. Yes, but not about the transaction -I have spoken to her about twice; they came up and threatened my life - I was obliged to speak; I did swear that I had not spoken to her since the transaction, that is not true - I did not speak to her about Phillips' concern, but they threatened my life, because I was up against the prisoner; I did not speak to Howard of my own accord -I have not spoken to her above twice about Phillips' concern, nor about any thing else; I did not know the prisoner before - I was not long in the cook-shop; I had not drank any thing the whole day - I went in to get a basin of soup; I had no beer nor gin; I had not been to any public-house - I have not spoken to the prisoner's mother about this transaction.</p>

            . I am a waiter at Dyer's cook-shop, in Tothill-street. The prisoner was there with a girl on the 28th of May, at very near one o'clock - they stood having a conversation together, when Phillips came up to the door and called Bet out - she went out; the prisoner followed her out - I thought I heard a few words, and went out to see what was the matter, but did not see any thing particular; Phillips said to the prisoner, "Come away, don't break the window;" he said so to the prisoner - Phillips and the girl crossed the road, and the prisoner followed after them; I went in doors to serve my customers, but had not been long before I heard Phillips sing out, "Stop him! stop him! I am stabbed! I am stabbed!" I went out, and the prisoner was walking some distance down the street, very deliberately - I went after him; Rierdon, the serjeant, came up - I took him into custody, and he was taken to the watch-house directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How near were you to them when they crossed? A.

            . I am an inspector of the Police. I remember the prisoner being brought into the watch-house that night - he appeared sober when he was first brought in; I went out for about half an hour, and when I came back he appeared drunk - I said to him,"How soon you can be drunk," for I was satisfied he could have had nothing while I was away; his drunkenness appeared to me to be feigned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you smell his breath? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to DAVID PHILLIPS. Q.Have you any other Christian name? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When was the first moment that you took your staff out? A. When I called the woman out - I said, "Bet, I want to speak to you;" the prisoner came behind, and said, "You shan't speak to her;" he put his arms out, extending them - I went towards the window; he came behind me, and laid hold of my arms - I took that in good part, and said, "Let go my arms," and then I took out my staff; I did not do any thing to him with it -I did not put it against the window at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If I did it, it was under the influence of drink - I was not aware that I had done it till I was told of it in the morning; I was drinking all that day.</p>

            . I know a woman who goes by the name of Mad Harriet - I had some conversation with her in the Broadway, Westminster, on the Wednesday, as the prisoner was coming up for his second hearing on the Saturday; I asked if she was going up against him - she said No, she knew nothing about it; she said she never saw any of the transaction at all - I never threatened her life.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Who was present at this conversation? A. Elizabeth Howard - there was nobody with Harriet; there were two people on the other side of the way - I do a little needle-work, and take in a child to nurse; that is the only way I get my living at present -I do not get my living by obliging gentlemen; I did so a good while ago, but I have been living with a young man for about twelve months, and do not go out - this conversation was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon: it was on the Wednesday after the man was stabbed - I was at the Police-office, but not concerning that; I was not there when Mad Harriet was examined - not further than about Queen-square; I did not know about her being called in to be examined - I was not examined at all; I now live in Castle-lane, near Westminster infirmary, about a quarter of a mile from Howard - I did not go and tell the Justice about the conversation; she told me she never saw a knife, nor did she see the prisoner stab - she said she was coming up Tothill-street when the prosecutor fell in her arms, but she did not see the knife, nor see him stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she begin the conversation with you? A. No, we called her - she did not say she had been in the cookshop; she said she went into Dyer's to call assistance for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us any thing else she talked about, except the stabbing? A. No, for a Policeman came up and took her away; no other conversation took place between us.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's mother. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300019"></xptr>have seen Mad Harriet - I never offered her money not to give evidence - she told me she was asleep in the cookshop at the time of the transaction, and did not see any thing of it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Where do you live? A. At Old Brompton - I had this conversation with her at Westminster, in one of the streets leading to Tothill-street; it was in the street - she was a perfect stranger to me; my son was with me, not the prisoner - he heard part of the conversation; he is not here - he was not acquainted with Austin.</p>
               <p>Q. You and your son, being perfect strangers to her, met her in the street, and began a conversation? A. Yes - nobody else was present; I met her the first time by myself, and some time after my son came up - I was talking to her then; I had seen her once before about the same place; the last conversation was a night or two before the second hearing; I had not been introduced to her at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know her? A. She was sent to me in the street by my young man or my son - I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean by your young man? A. A young man I sent to her - he was a stranger to me; my son sent the young man to fetch her out, but I do not know who he was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoken of a person by the title of your young man, who do you call your young man? A. My son is my young man, and he sent this young man - I objected to his going into any house to her, and he sent a young man, but I call my son my young man - my son was not present at both the conversations; I do not know that he knew Austin; he was to find somebody that knew her to send her to me - he left me to find the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what passed at your first conversation with Austin? A. I asked what she knew of it - she said,"Nothing at all;" that is all that passed - she repeated the same thing each time; she said she was not present at the transaction, and therefore could say nothing, for she knew nothing; I did not have much conversation with her - I did not suppose she was going to swear my son's life away - the first conversation was a few days before the second.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in a few days you walked from Brompton to Tothill-fields to see her again? A. I did, and the same conversation passed - I asked what she knew of the transaction; she said, "Nothing at all;" she was not present, and therefore could say nothing, for she saw nothing - she said both times that she was asleep in the cook-shop; I was not present when she was before the Justice - I did not tell the Justice that she was swearing false, for she had said she knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the Justice examine any body for your son? A. No - there were only two witnesses examined; I was only at the second examination.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH HOWARD. I am a girl of the town. I was in conversation with the prisoner at the cook-shop on the night this happened; the Policeman came there, and I went out - I did not see the Policeman stabbed; I saw the staff in the Policeman's hand - he was speaking to me at that time; he made no charge against me when he took me out of the shop - the prisoner asked what he took me for; I then saw him draw his staff across the prisoner's face - I afterwards saw him on the opposite side of the way, and he hallooed out that he was stabbed - I never saw Austin there at all.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You knew the prisoner very well at the time of this transaction? A. Yes - we were not living together then; we have not lived together for two years - we had met that night at Knightsbridge, and then went to a public-house; he had several half-pints of ale - we then came to the cook-shop, and had something to eat; Phillips came in, and said he wanted to speak to me - the prisoner asked what he wanted me for; he said he only wanted to speak to me outside the door - I did not go out then, and he came in again; the prisoner had said if he had any thing to say he was to say it within; Phillips came in again, and called me - I went out then; the prisoner came out, and asked what he wanted me for, and then they had some words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lay his hands on you to prevent your going? A. No, he never touched me - he did not put out his arms; I never heard the prosecutor say, "Take care, or you will break the windows," nor any thing of the kind; the Policeman made no charge against me - he spoke to me civilly; I crossed over with him - he wanted me concerning a half-sovereign that was given to me by mistake for 6d.; the prisoner came across directly afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it the prosecutor pulled out his staff? A. Opposite the cook-shop - it was after we crossed; I did not see him touch the prisoner's face with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean in drawing out his staff he crossed the man's face? A. Yes; he did not strike, nor did I hear him threaten - I saw no blows struck on either side; I went some distance off.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did you hear any thing of the Policeman being stabbed? A. He said, "They have done me! they have done me at last! I am stabbed!" that was about five minutes after I had began to walk down the street - I mean it was a very little while; I dare say it was a quarter of an hour after the staff had been produced- I do not suppose the transaction lasted half an hour altogether; I did not go away when he said he was stabbed - there were several people near when he called out, both men and women; I have not seen any of them here - several came out to see what was going on; none of them went to assist him: the Policeman drew his staff across his face, so (drawing her hand across her own face, close to her eyes.)</p>
               <p>Six witnesses deposed to the prisoner being of a mild and inoffensive disposition.</p>

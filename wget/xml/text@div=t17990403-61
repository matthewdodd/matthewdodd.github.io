               <p>Q. Do you know the defendant, Jones? - A. Yes; I have known him about four months; I never saw him but once before I went to him.</p>
               <p>Q. In January last, did you take any indigo from your master? - A. It was taken in December.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you take? - A. Above a hundred pound weight; I sold it Jones on the 10th of January last.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the indigo placed in any packages? - A. In a box, and three paper bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you put them there all at once? - A. No, at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Jones? - A. I went to Jones on the 10th, and asked him whether he would buy some indigo.</p>
               <p>Q.What business was Jones? - A. He <rs id="t17990403-61-deflabel350" type="occupation">kept a warehouse</rs>

               <p>Q. What kind of a warehouse? - A. A druggist's and dryfalter's; there was every thing in the warehouse, grocery, and doctor's drugs, and indigo, and cochineal, and various other things; breeches-pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Any stockings? - A. No; there were ropes, twine, and bags.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know you were servant to Messrs. Alder and Ellis? - A. I told him so that morning; I told him that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030045"></xptr>Reeves, the warehouseman, was gone away; I told him I had had some words with Reeves, and I had moved the indigo away to another part of the town for fear he should tell of it; I sent it away in a coach to Mr. Townsend's, a butcher's, in Fetter-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with it? - A. Nobody; I sent a letter with them, desiring Mr. Townsend to receive them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Jones where the indigo was at Fetter-lane? - A. No, I went with him; he met me on the 11th, at the Green-Man in Bucklersbury.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met him, what passed? - A. He and I went to Townsend's, that was between three and four o'clock; Jones was facing Townsend's, at a public-house, drinking a pint of beer, while I went over to Townsend's; Townsend had been to me on the 10th, in the afternoon, and asked me the meaning of sending these things to his house, a box nailed up; I told him it was indigo, that was taken from Messrs. Alder and Ellis, by Reeves and me; that we had quarrelled, and I was afraid him and my wife would discover where it was, I did not know what to do with it; I told him I would fetch it away that night, and that very same day I was accused by Mr. Alder of it; Townsend was frightened, and did not know what to do, and he removed it to Calcott's, in Fleet-lane; Jones and I went there, and it was taken into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same indigo that you had sent by the coach? - A. Yes, and the box was still nailed; I opened the box, and the bags, there were three different quantities in each bag; there were forty-three pounds in the bags, nine, sixteen, and eighteen; Jones examined them, and asked me what I would have for them; I told him four shillings a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a fair price? - A. The Manilla was worth about eight shillings, and the other, six shillings, and six and sixpence; he bid me two shillings and nine-pence; I desired him to consider, and not talk so; then he said he would give three shillings, and he would not give any more, and so I took it; the Manilla was weighed in that shop, and Jones took the weight upon a piece of paper; I took the East-India indigo into Fleet-market, and weighed it, Jones carried the box, and I carried the bags; Townsend was present at that time, he left us in Fleet-market; he offered me a two pound note and a one pound note; I told him I would not take a part of the money; so then he called a coach at the Obelisk, and put them in, and told me he would call upon me and pay me; I told him I would not let the indigo go without he paid me for it; then he ordered the coachman to drive over to Maize-pond, in the Borough; about ten yards before he came to his own house he stopped the coach, I carried the box, and he carried the bags, to his own house in Maize-pond; I took the sack away, and the paper bags were put into a box.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the box? - A. It was not unpacked then; then we went to a public-house, the sign of the London-bridge, in Maize-pond; his son came and brought a sack; then he went out and returned back again in a few minutes, with the money; he took a pen and ink, and reckoned up what it came to; it weighed a hundred and two pounds altogether; he said he would not pay for the odd two pounds; then he said he must have discount for ready money; he gave me fifteen pounds one shilling, and I gave him two shillings and sixpence discount; then I went away. (The constable produced the box and the bags).</p>
               <p>Whitney. This is the same box, there has been a mark upon it of 2s. 6d. which has been attempted to be scratched out, and a 3 put over it; but I am sure it is the same box.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about the bags? - A. They appear to be the same, there is no mark upon them; they were made by my wife, they are not made like common paper bags; and the bags were in the warehouse, all tied round with this sort of string.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he apprehended? - A. The day after he had bought it, on Saturday the 12th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. Q. What trade were you before you lived with Mr. Alder? - A. A chimney-sweeper; I was a butcher by trade, and kept a shop in Fleet-market six years.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave off the business of a butcher? - A. I failed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave off the trade of a chimney-sweeper before you went into Mr. Alder's service? - A. I did not leave it off, I am in the business now.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first began to plunder him of his property? - A. In November.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you carry on the business of stealing your master's property before you were discovered? - A. About two months.</p>
               <p>Q. To the amount of a hundred pounds, perhaps? - A. This parcel, I suppose, is not worth much less.</p>
               <p>Q. You stole a great deal besides? - A. I was concerned in taking more from my master.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you accused a man of the name of Reeves? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was indicted in consequence of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went before the Grand Jury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The bill was thrown out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know he was not tried, and is at large? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined before the Grand Jury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you were a witness against the Hughes's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them? - A. They were cleared.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present in any of the conversations that you had with Jones? - A. Townsend was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody else was present at any of those times? - A. No; there were three or four persons saw it weighed in the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Whitney? - A. Yes: On Thursday the 10th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning, a hackney-coach stopped at our door, and two parcels were left, a box and a bag; the next morning I removed them to a relation of mine, of the name of Calcott, in Fleet-lane, Fleet-market; in the course of that day, about four o'clock, Whitney came to me for these things, Jones was waiting at a public-house opposite, Jones came out; Jones and I, and Whitney, went to Calcott's; the same box and bag that were sent to my house were in the shop, and Jones and Whitney took them backwards into the yard; the box was nailed, and the bag tied; they opened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030046"></xptr>them, and I saw that the contents of the box and the bag were indigo.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the sack? - A. Small paper bags of indigo; Whitney assured Jones, before Jones purchased it, that all was right.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he explain that? - A. No; Whitney weighed them; Jones bid him 2s. 9d.; Whitney would not take it; then Jones bid 3s. and said, he would give no more; Whitney told him he should have it; the small paper bags were weighed at Calcott's, and the box was weighed at a butcher's, in Fleet-market; I went with them; it was in my way home; Whitney took the box, and

On the Monday following I went to Eustace, in the Borough-market, and there I found a box of indigo; I took it to Union-hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you weigh the indigo? - A. I weighed the bags, but not the box; one bag weighed nine pounds, another sixteen, and the other eighteen.</p>

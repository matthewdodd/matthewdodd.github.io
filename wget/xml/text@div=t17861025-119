               <p>What lead was that that you discovered there? - The lead that came from this temple; it was painted white; I applied it before several witnesses, and found it correspond with the building, and the dimensions; I left it in the care of an acting constable that served the warrant; it was rolled and beat up together; he confessed taking it.</p>
               <p>Were there any promises made to him? - Not to exempt him from prosecution.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing to whom the house belonged? - No.</p>
               <p>Was that confession taken before the Magistrate in writing? - I am not clear whether this last confession was taken down before the Magistrate or no; we could not promise him the favour of the Court; but we told him, we imagined it would be the only way to obtain favour; then he told us; and until we told him so, he never declared himself.</p>

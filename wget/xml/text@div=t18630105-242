                  </hi>. I live at Lansdowne-road North, Notting-hill—at the time this matter happened I had a place of business at the Opera-arcade—I am a retired officer from the Indian service—I became acquainted with the prisoner about ten months ago; I saw him in a house in Gloucester-street, Pimlico—previous to that I was living in Sussex-street, dose by—he was introduced to me—he told me he had a recipe efor making Eau de Cologne and brandies, and asked me if I would speculate in them—I told him that I would on condition that I saw that everything was perfectly straightforward—he proposed that he should introduce me to Mr. Farina, but that I should have to pay a premium to obtain the secret, and be able to manufacture it—by appointment I went again to the prisoner's house, and he introduced a party to me who represented himself to be Farina—I have since ascertained that that person is called Turhoff; I never met him but that once—after some discussion an agreement was drawn up in my presence—the draft was drawn up by a solicitor, and afterwards copied out by a friend of mine—the party who represented himself to be Farina, signed it "Johann Maria Farina," and the prisoner and his servant attested it—on the other sheet there is a receipt for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was for the premium I paid—it is in the prisoner's handwriting, and is signed by Turhoff—I saw him sign it—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th March</hi>, 1862, <hi rend="italic">and purported to be an agreement of sale and purchase between Johann Maria Farina, of Cologne and Paris, and the witness</hi>)—After that was drawn up the prisoner asked me for some money to begin the manufacture with—he gave me a list of all the different things that he would have to purchase for the purpose of making the Eau de Cologne, amounting to 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">odd</hi>—I gave him that, and also a cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay for a plate which had been lost—this is an agreement and receipt for the money, which I received from the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave him the cheque for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the night of 10th March, and dated it the 11th—he said it was wanted for a new copper plate from which to print the outside wrappers—he said Messrs. Smith, of Fenchurch-street, would engrave it—in consequence of that I drew the cheque, and struck out the word "Bearer," and made it "or order"—I did not authorize him to get the money or endorse the cheque—this sheet of plates was shown to me by the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live in Clement's-inn; the prisoner was in my employ as clerk for three months. On the 6th of July I had a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, which I received from Twining's—I cut it in two, and inclosed one half, directed to Mr. William Allen Jones, in Dublin—I gave the prisoner that and the other half to enclose, telling him to put one in the post-office, and give the other to the postman—this is the note I gave him—five or six days after the 6th of July I asked if he had posted the letters, I not having heard from Mr. Allen Jones—he said he had—I asked him for a copy of the letter he bad sent, and he handed me this—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Clement's-inn, 6th July, 1846. Dear Sir, In this and another envelope I send you a Bank of England note, No. 59142, 4th May, 1846, for 101., the receipt thereof be pleased to acknow<lb></lb>ledge."—I afterwards made inquiry about the note, and ultimately found it.</p>

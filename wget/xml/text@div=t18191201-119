I saw them safe a little after seven o'clock - the window was sound then. I went into the shop again a little before nine o'clock, and found the bottom pane of glass broken, and two pair gone; a third pair was doubled up ready to be taken away. My shop door was fast at seven o'clock, and I found it still fast. I had been in the back room adjoining the shop all the time. I did not hear the glass break.</p>

            . I am brother to the prosecutor, and lodge in the same house. I put a candle on the counter about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, and sat in the back room with my brother. I went into the shop at eight o'clock to my box, staid there till about a quarter before nine o'clock, and then heard somebody at the window; I looked round and saw a person's hat. I stooped down that they might not see me, and ran to the door, opened it quick, and saw the prisoner's arm thrust through the window. I caught hold of him as he took it out, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have caught you at it now, have I?"</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person with him - A. No. He wanted to know what I had caught him at. I brought him into the shop, he had nothing in his hand - nobody was near him - I could see from one end of the street to the other. The property was never found.</p>

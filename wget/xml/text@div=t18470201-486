                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Bateman, a confectioner, in the Minories. I remember the prisoner Jones coming to my master's shop on the evening of the 12th of Jan.—she asked for two buns—I wrapped them in paper—she then asked if we sold linseed meal—I told her no, she could get it at the chemist's—she gave me a shilling—I noticed it, and felt it—I found it was a bad one—I walked into the parlour to see Mr. Bateman—I came out again, and said to Jones, "This is a bad shilling"—I put it down—she said she did not know it, and said something about a lady, but I could not tell what—she said she would come back in a few minutes for the buns, and bring another shilling—she put the buns on the counter, and turned round to go to the door—child</p>

                  </hi>. I am the beadle of Tower<lb></lb>hill. I was in the Minories on the 12th of Jan., and I saw the two prisoners together—they came past the Three kingdoms public-house, and went to Mr. bateman's window—they stood talking there a few minutes, with their faces turned towards the window—they stood close to me, and I heard Jennings say to Jones, "go on, it is all right"—that led me to suspect something wrong—I saw Jones go into the shop—I went to window, and saw her give Miss Higgins a shilling—I saw her look at it—she turned it round, and rubbed it with her finger—she took it back to Mr. Bateman—she then came out and gave it to Jones—I went and stooped her, and took it from her—she said a lady gave it her for carry-ing a parcel—I asked where the lady lived, and where it was done—she said she did not know—I handed the shilling to Miss Higgins, and left Jones in the shop with a friend of mine, who was with me—I went and laid hold of Jennings, who was six or seven yards from the door—he dropped three shillings—I picked them up, and said, "where did you get these?—he said "I found them wrapped up in a piece of paper, which I have in my pockets"—I took him into the shop—Jones was there—I asked Jennings if he knew that female—he said, "No, I never saw her in my life before"—I told Miss Higgins to mark the shilling, which she did, and gave it me—this is it, and these are the other three.</p>

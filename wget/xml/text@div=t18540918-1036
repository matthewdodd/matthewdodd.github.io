                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 125). I was on duty in the Regent's-park on the evening of 11th Sept—about a quarter past 6 o'clock, I heard a noise proceeding from the canal—I went to ascertain the cause, and saw the prisoner and two children standing by the side of the canal—I saw her lay hold of the younger one, Thomas Parker, and throw it backwards into the canal—she then turned round, laid hold of the second one, Henry Parker, by the arm, and turned towards the water—I rushed down, and pushed her up the bank, got into the canal and pulled out the child that was just up to its neck in the water, and was going down—the water is about six feet</p>

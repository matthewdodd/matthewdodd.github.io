               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you not know that he was robbed himself? A. No; I heard somebody had run away with his change, from the bar of a public-house - he said something of that sort at the watch-house; I cannot tell now whether he did say so or not -I believe he is deaf; I talked to him loud enough to make him hear.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not ask him for 2l. to let him go? A. No; it was his first proposition to me; I do not know Jones, the watchman - Stokes, the beadle, was present, and said he would not have such a thing arranged there; I said if his master could raise 2l., but it was not my first proposition - I have not had 1s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Explain this? A.When I went to the watch-house, he fell on his knees, and begged me not to prosecute him, and said he would give ever so much to be liberated; I then said, "Can you raise 2l.?" he said he could raise 1l.; I said could not his master raise the other pound.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You would let him go for 2l. though you were sure he had given you the beating you have described? A. Yes; he did not appear stupified, for he was very resolute with the watchman.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was at the corner of Gibraltar-walk; I had just called one o'clock; I got into my box, with my back to the road - I was reaching my pipe down, and all at once there was a rush behind me; I turned round, and saw the prosecutor lying on the ground, and three men beating him cruelly - there were three men on him; I said, "Halloo! are you going to kill the man?" one of them answered, "You b-g-r you, if you come out we will serve you ten times worse:" I said, "So you shall;" I came out directly, sprung my rattle for assistance, and as soon as I came out they started across the road; they ran three or four doors down James-street, - the prisoner spoke a word or two to the other three, but what it was I cannot say; he returned, met me, and stopped me from pursuing them - he held up his hand, and asked me what I meant; I stepped back, and moved my stick to keep him off, for I expected to receive a blow every moment; two officers, hearing my rattle, came to my assistance; I took him with his hands out at me, asking me what I meant - he was then about ten yards from where the prosecutor lay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you not know his hand was only up to his ear, to assist himself in hearing what was said? A.His hand was up near his ear, but his fist was doubled - he could hear me without my going near him; I was afraid to go near for fear of a blow; nobody spoke to him while I was in the watch-house - I never saw him with more than one hat; he had no stick.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in Brick-lane, between one and two o'clock on Sunday morning, the 19th of October, and heard a rattle sprung; I went up and heard a man lie groaning on the pavement - I found the prisoner with his hand up, as if he was going to strike some one; I laid hold of him, and took him in charge - he certainly seemed in a mad kind of manner, not right in his mind; he fell on his knees, begging him to let him go - he said he was an innocent man, and never did a robbery - I did not then know there had been a robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He appeared wild? A. Yes; he was rather the worse for drink, I think - he has been out of his mind I am told; I heard something of his having been in a public-house, and somebody running away with his change, whether it was from him I cannot say - it was next day, I think; I know, it was not that night.</p>

            . I was with Glibbery. I am a constable, and was present when the prisoner was apprehended; he was near Norris, but I was at a distance, and did not see his hand up; the prosecutor was not well enough to give the charge - we laid him all along in the watch-house, and the blood came from him; we could get nothing from him for some time, and we left him there - he got up about half an hour after; the watch-house-keeper got his direction, and he was led home - I saw him next day, and he described the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you look at the prisoner's hands to see if there were any marks of blood on them? A. No; he had no weapon - we did not know whether there had been a robbery till the morning; I have said I did not think the prisoner was one of them - that was only my idea, because he fell on his knees and prayed, and said he was innocent; he had only one hat - he seemed much alarmed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent; I came up Church-street, and there was not a soul there; when I came up to the watchman, he said, "Keep off:" - "Well," said I, "my friend, I want to keep off," and they took me to the watch-house, and found 1s. 9d. or 1s. 10d. on me; when the man came to me, he said, "You are the very man who struck me. I bended my knees down before my Maker; and am as innocent as ever there was a prisoner before the bar; I never put a hand on the man - he has certainly sworn my life away; he said I knew where his hat was - I said,"My good friend, there was not a soul with me when I went up to the watchman, if it was the last word I had to say:" he said he could swear to me by the corner of my handkerchief, and said,"Is not that the handkerchief you had on last night;" I said it was; he came to me on the Monday, and said "You are the very man who struck me; if I was to go to your master, and ask him for 2l., don't you think he would lend it you?" I never put a hand on him - I told him I would have my trial and justice.</p>
               <p>THOMAS JONES. I am a watchman of Bethnal-green. I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was there - the prosecutor was talking to him at the cage-door; I heard him say if he would give him 2l. he would make it up when he came to Worship-street; I was obliged to go to the watch-house, and did not hear the prisoner's answer - there was only me, Stokes, and the prosecutor there.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to take the prisoner - the prosecutor stated that he had got his jacket and waistcoat on; I had seen him three days before with a smock-frock on - he said he bought the duplicate five months ago, of Sorrow or Forrow, and had got them out of pawn at Isleworth; I inquired and it was so - when before the Magistrate, he said he had made a mistake, it was the name which was on the duplicate which is Screw; the prosecutor came to me and asked what my expences were - I said "You have been before the Magistrate, you cannot make it up now."</p>

On Saturday-night, the 16th of February, I was in Johnson-street, Somer's-town with some bread, and as I was coming home in Weston-place, by the Small-pox Hospital, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prisoner Brown came up to me at the corner of Weston-place, and asked me to go and give her some drink; I accompanied her to her house in <placeName id="t18330411-7-crimeloc36">Haddon-place</placeName>

            . I am a Policeman. On the night of the 16th of February I saw the prosecutor in Battle-bridge, about forty yards from Haddon-place - he told me he had been robbed; his account appeared sensible and correct - he said two women had robbed him; I went with him to the house, No. 3, Haddon-place, which is kept by the prisoner Brown - I know that; I found her there - Smith and her were both in the room when I went into the house; Gates went into the room with me, identified them, and said it was the room they had been in, and that they were the persons who robbed him; I asked Brown what she had to say to it - she said she knew nothing about the robbery, that some man came into the house, and ran away, and she had called out Police - Smith said she was not in the house at the time, that she had just come in - I took them to the station - Brown had 6s. 6d. in silver and 9d. in copper in her pocket; the prosecutor had said he had lost about 6s. 6d.; she said she had had the money before he came to the house - I found nothing on Smith.</p>
               <p>Brown. Q.Do you not recollect my calling you into the house, before you saw the man? A. No you did not call me in.</p>
               <p>Q. I said the man ran in with his basket, and two young men rushed in after him, and desired you to look after them? A.No; I had not spoken to you that evening. The prosecutor said Brown robbed him, and Smith held his hands the while.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. The man came into my house and asked if I had got a fountain. - I said I thought the street was the best place for him; two men rushed in and wanted to strike him, and said, "Jack come out;" I went to the door to look for the Police, and saw Smith - I asked her to go and look for a Policeman; she came in; the two men ran away - he took his basket and ran after them, then returned with the Policeman, and said we had robbed him; he was asked which had robbed him, and pointed to Smith - he said the same at the station; I said she was not there, and then he said I assisted to rob him.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. Brown fetched me into the house; I found this man scuffling with two others; the Police was called - the prosecutor remained in the house, and presently he took his basket and went out - he came back in about twenty-five minutes, with a Policeman, and charged us with robbing him; I was not in the house at the time; he said at the station that I had robbed him, and then accused Brown of it.</p>

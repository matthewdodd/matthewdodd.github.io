               <p>SARAH PONSDEN. I live in China-mews. On the 18th of August, at nine o'clock at night, I gave my son William three bundles to deliver, one containing these articles, belonged to Mr. Potts, of Little Gower-place, whom I wash for; he was to take it there; my little girl, who went with him, came and said he was robbed.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PONSDEN. I am eleven years old. My mother gave me a bundle to take to Mr. Potts; I had delivered two other bundles, and had Mr. Potts' left; I was in Little Gower-street - the two prisoners came running along, and James snatched at my bundle; he could not get it, and snatched again - I hallooed Stop thief! he then made a third snatch, and got it. I had seen him before - he had followed me two or three times; they ran away together, and James gave the bundle to Butler - they ran down Little Gower-place, and tried to throw it over the pales, but it fell down, and I took it up; I carried it on to Mr. Potts' - some persons were pursuing the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the watchman ask you if Butler took it? A. Yes; I said James took it, and gave it to him; James always had his hand in his pocket; I never observed that he had but one hand - he only used his left hand to take it, I am sure.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper. I was in Gower-street; a boy said I was wanted; I went to Little Gower-place, and saw Butler in custody; the lad said a man had taken a bundle, and given it to Butler, who tried to throw it over the pales; and a gentleman said he saw him try to throw it over, and dropped it. I took him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130108"></xptr>the watch-house - he said he received the bundle from a man unknown to him; and, on Monday morning, he said James was in his company - James was then taken.

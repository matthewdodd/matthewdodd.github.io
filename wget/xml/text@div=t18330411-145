            , a waterman, is the messenger usually employed by him to convey those messages. On the 18th of February I went to the banking-house of Barnard and Co., Cornhill, about three o'clock; I saw Stowers at the door, and received some letters from him - (Mr. Patterson, of Broad-street, is my solicitor, and has been so for some time;) after doing my business at the banker's where I staid some time, I came out, and was proceeding along the street towards Mr. Patterson's, in Broad-street; previous to that I had given Stowers a letter with directions to wait for me; I got into <placeName id="t18330411-145-crimeloc812">Spread Eagle-court</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q.How long after his return did you and him finally settle the account? A.Five or six months; the ship returned in 1830, and the accounts were settled in 1831 - I saw him frequently before the settlement, in the presence of his officers; I should think I saw him half a dozen times - Mr. Cooper had the account to settle before it went to Mr. Rotch; I did not attend the several meetings at which Mr. Rotch investigated the accounts, but I attended the last meeting, and I paid the balance; I have not heard of the prisoner being employed at sea since - I have frequently seen him about the streets, and at our wharf, but had no intercourse with him since; I know Lesley, a dealer in Irish provisions - I do not recollect conversing with him last year about the prisoner; I do not recollect ever saying any thing to him as to the state of the prisoner's mind - I never could have said, "Oh, poor fellow, he is mad; I have known him a long time, and think he is not right in his mind."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever observe any thing to lead you to consider he was not sound in his mind? A. I considered so from report, but nothing from my own observation - except that I understood he was much addicted to liquor, and then he was very outrageous; I never saw any thing to induce me to suspect his state of mind.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q.Have you said to any body that you believe him mad or not right in his mind? A. I have no recollection of it - I am not entirely recovered now; my recollection did not properly recover itself till after I was removed to the surgeon's.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have the kindness to state the amount of property entrusted to his charge on board the Partridge? A. A great many thousand pounds - he had to account for a cargo of 14,000l. independent of the ship; he returned in 1830 - the settlement of accounts was in February, 1831.</p>
               <p>CHARLES STOWERS. I am a waterman in the employ of Mr. Mellish; Mr. Cooper is managing-man in the business at Mill-wall, Poplar. On Monday, the 18th of February, Cooper gave me some letters to deliver to Mr. Mellish, at the bankers' in Cornhill; I was to wait in the street till I saw Mr. Mellish - the letters were delivered to me at Millwall; I got to Cornhill about five minutes before one o'clock - after being there some little time I saw the prisoner; I knew him before - he came down from the Exchange towards Leadenhall-street; he was alone - I was waiting near the door of Messrs. Barnard's; the prisoner said to me, "Charles, are you waiting for master?" I said,"Yes, I am;" he said, "I should like to see him - I want to speak to him;" he did not stop above a minute or so with me, for he said, "It will not do for us to be seen together, as Mr. Mellish might think there was something wrong," and then I should be to blame - I continued to wait in Cornhill (this was about half-past one o'clock); while I was there I saw Andrew Hitter, who had been an officer on board the Partridge - when I had spoken to him the prisoner came and spoke to me again; he told me he had seen young Hitter speak to me, and he said that young man was not fit to be sent to sea, that he was more fit for the situation he was in on shore; he said nothing more, except again saying it would not do for us to be seen together, as Mr. Mellish might think something wrong, and I might be blamed; and then he went down towards Leadenhall-street - I saw him return on the opposite side of the way, and he went into the entrance of the house No. 71; I was standing before Messrs. Barnard's window - I could see him walking about in the entrance; he did not go into the house, but seemed walking about as if waiting for somebody in the entrance - Mr. Mellish came to Barnard's door about ten minutes or a quarter after three o'clock; I gave him the letters - he read them, and then went into Barnard's; and while Mr. Mellish was reading the letters, the prisoner seemed to be secreting himself in the entrance of No. 71 - he was rather concealed on one side; Mr. Mellish told me to remain where I was while he went into Mr. Barnard's, as he had a letter to send to Mr. Cooper; he came out of Barnard's in six or seven minutes - he then told me to remain, or to go over to Mr. Shears' and wait for him; I saw Mr. Mellish go down Cornhill towards the Exchange - I missed the prisoner out of the entrance of No. 71, and I crossed over to go to Mr. Shears' and as I got on the pavement I saw the prisoner turn out of No. 72; I had not seen him come out of No. 71 - I merely saw his back as he turned out of No. 72; he went towards the Exchange on the north side - this was a very short time after Mr. Mellish had gone towards the Exchange; I saw nothing of what happened - he went in the same direction as Mr. Mellish, only on the opposite side; in the conversation he had with me he appeared perfectly well, rather the worse for liquor, but perfectly rational, and in his senses.</p>
               <p>JOHN FURBY. I am a painter and glazier. On the 18th of February I was cleaning the windows of Mr. Lutty's office, in Spread Eagle-court, about four o'clock; I observed the prisoner come up the court behind Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110069"></xptr>Mellish, who I did not know then - the prisoner was behind him; he came up as close to him as he possibly could - I supposed he was going to give him a slap on the head; I saw him shove the pistol into the back of his neck, and then I heard a report - the muzzle of the pistol touched his neck; it went off, and Mr. Mellish fell backwards immediately - I was frightened, and stood and looked - I had no power to go and assist him; I saw blood on the stones - I observed the prisoner throw the pistol behind, gently backwards, the moment he fired it; I was so frightened I did not know what to do - a person went to Mr. Mellish and helped him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I suppose there were plenty of people in the court? A. There was nobody in the court but myself that I saw - I was on the ground; the court is a very considerable thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice his countenance? A. No - he looked very sullen after he had done it; he threw the pistol gently behind him; nobody had taken hold of him at that time - it was nearly four minutes before any body took hold of him, as near as I can recollect; he did not go away - he remained nearly in the same spot - he never moved off.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BEALE. I am a ticket porter. About four o'clock on the 18th of February I was entering Spread Eagle-court, I heard a report, and hastened to the spot; I saw the prisoner throw the pistol behind him - I saw Mr. Mellish arising, and heard him (Mellish) say, "What does this mean? I don't understand it - What does this mean?" the prisoner replied, 'Mr. Mellish, you tried to kill me, and I tried to kill you if I could;" Mr. Mellish walked away - I staid with the prisoner; he made no resistance, and in about a minute two street-keepers came and took hold of him; he appeared quite collected, and spoke very rationally, what he did say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you before or behind him? A. Behind; he did not see me - the pistol was fired before I got into the court; the prisoner and the prosecutor were about nine yards down the court from the entrance, and there is an elbow in the court which would hide persons who were entering from those on that spot - I did not see them on going into the entrance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q.Which way did you enter the court? A. From Finch-lane; it leads from there into Threadneedle-street - it is an open thoroughfare for every body.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body coming the contrary way to you? A.Not one; I heard the report before I saw any body - the court is about one hundred and sixty yards long taking the turning and all; it is full of houses and open shops.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If any body had been entering the court in the opposite direction, must you have seen them? A. I must have seen them, for I entered directly I heard the report.</p>

On the 18th of February I was in his shop in Spread Eagle-court; I heard the report of a pistol, saw the smoke ascend, and saw Mr. Mellish fall - I immediately ran to his assistance, and on his rising up he asked what was the matter; I saw the prisoner there - a gentleman asked who shot him; the prisoner said, "I shot him - he injured me of my living; I know the laws of my country, and I shall be hung for it:" he seemed to be in his senses, and sober.</p>

I heard the report of fire-arms; I ran into the court, and saw Mr. Mellish leaning on a gentleman's shoulder, and another gentleman supporting him; I saw the prisoner, and heard him say he had had the pistol loaded for these three months, and that it had now done its duty - that he was quite satisfied and comfortable now as it had done so; he said Mr. Mellish had not only robbed him of his money, but his character - that he was come to his last penny, and his life would be made amenable to the laws of his country, and the sooner he was taken out of that open court the better; I delivered him into the custody of Rawlins - I followed Mr. Mellish to the house of Mr. Miles, the surgeon; I did not observe any thing of intoxication or insanity about the prisoner.</p>

            ; there was a great crowd there then - Rawlins, the beadle, was in my company; I assisted in securing the prisoner - I do not know that Rawlins said any thing to him; I believe I said to the prisoner, "What is the matter? what have you been doing?" he said, "I have done it - I have followed him for a month, and I know I shall be hanged for it; I won't hurt any of you - take me where you like, I won't offer to go;" we took him to the watch-house, and searched him there - he gave up his powder-flask to me: I asked him if he had any more pistols - he said No; he said at the watch-house that he had had a law-suit with Mr. Mellish, and had lost it - that it had been referred to arbitration, and Mr. Mellish had robbed him; I have the pistol - I received it from Beale; I searched him - he had one penny in his pocket, and said that was not his own.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he say any thing more about the penny? A.He said he had not a farthing in the world that was his own, that his character was gone, and he did not know what to do; I afterwards took him in a coach to the Compter - as we went there, he said the pistol was loaded with two half balls, four slugs, and some small shot; I was in his company for half or three quarters of an hour - he appeared sober, and in his proper senses the whole of that time.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Quite unconfused and collected? A. He was rather agitated at first, but came to his proper recollection before I left him.</p>
               <p>JOHN RAWLINS. I am beadle and constable of St. Bennet Fink. On hearing the report of a pistol, and a noise, I went to Spread Eagle-court; the prisoner was delivered into my custody; on my taking him, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110070"></xptr>said I had no occasion to lay hold of him, for he had shot Mr. Mellish, and therefore would go very quietly with us wherever we chose to take him; he said he had been injured by Mr. Mellish, and was then perfectly satisfied, so long as he been able to shoot him; he said he knew he should be hung for doing it, and said he could not help it, that the law must take its course; I took him to the watch-house - he gave a powder-flask up to Price; I went in the coach with him from the watch-house to Giltspur-street - he said the pistol was loaded with a ball split in two, and some small shot; he might mention slugs, but I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>JOHN MILES. I am a surgeon, and live in Throgmorton-street. Mr. Mellish was brought to me with two wounds, which had been received on the right side of the head; the larger wound was a lacerated wound - he was in a very exhausted state, having lost a deal of blood from the larger wound; he lost blood from a branch of an artery, which was lacerated - there was no positive evidence of the presence of any ball at that time; I did what I could to stop the blood, and accompanied Mr. Mellish to his house in York-place, Baker street, and have attended him till this time; Mr. Brodie also saw him at different times - I bandaged the head, and on the third day, we removed the dressings, and at that time there was no evidence of any ball - but at the second dressing, which was about the fifth day, one half ball had worked itself to the aperture - Mr. Brodie was able to take it out with his finger without any operation; I have that half ball here; we extracted at a later period some shot; the pistol, I should think, had been fired in a slanting direction; I think it very likely, if it had been fired directly horizontal, we should have had an injury to the bone - I suppose it rather glansed the bone; the shot was taken from very near the smaller wound - the large wound was about an inch and a half beyond the right ear; the pistol appeared to me to have slanted upwards; I have been in attendance on Mr. Mellish till now - he is considerably recovered.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Did you see the prisoner at the time? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say my Lord.</p>
               <p>ANDREW NIECE HITTER. I live in London, and am a ship-broker. I sailed a voyage with the prisoner in the Partridge in 1826 - I was the fourth officer; the prisoner was master and commander - I might have known him about a week before I sailed that voyage with him - I joined the ship at Gravesend; we made to Cape de Verd in the course of our voyage, and at that place, I observed something particular in the prisoner's conduct - we had been on our voyage about six weeks; the chief of our crew went on shore there by the Captain's orders; (our crew consisted of about thirty-three) he ordered them to work on Sunday, and they would not, so he sent about twelve men on shore - he got others in their stead - I think the same number; he sent about three or six months of the ship's provisions away with the men - the governor would not allow them to be sent on shore without it; the men that came on board, I should think, had never been on shipboard before - part of them were slaves; they were decidedly unfit men to work the ship - we were then bound on the South Sea voyage; it was very important to keep provisions on board, and to have proper men on board.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Were these the best men that could be found? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q. Were the men he sent on shore more fit for the work than those he received in their room? A.Decidedly so; any man who was conscious of what he was doing, would not have done it - it was my opinion, and the opinion of all of us. I remember one Sunday his nearly shooting the third mate; the ship was going out - it was after we had been at de Verd; he used to keep pistols over his head in his berth - he called the third mate down into the cabin, to have some conversation with him; the pistols were in a case - he took one up, and fired it - it just grazed the mate's ear; I saw all this: the prisoner laughed, and spoke of it as a joke to every ship we passed - the pistol had a ball in it, for it lodged in the rudder-case: I saw it there; the ball was in the ship when we came home - he kept it there to show.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean that the pistol actually struck him? A. The ball grazed his ear.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q.Did you get to Berkeley-sound, in the Falkland Islands? A. Yes - the prisoner was quite an altered man there, we thought he had taken to drinking; I do not know whether he did or not - I do not know whether the crew took any notice of it; I was in the habit of speaking to the officers - the officers spoke about it- we all thought he was getting quite different; when we were off Galley-bay, he sent me away in a boat, with about five persons, to get turpin, which is a sort of turtle - he sent us in an open boat; we had a sail and five men, without any provisions at all - he would not let us take any: we were to go about twenty miles - he did not say how long we were to stay: he did not represent any difficulties we should have to contend with; it was his command - the weather turned out very severe: we were gone about a day and a half, and were in distress for want of water and provisions, and returned; when I came back I represented the difficulties we had undergone - he passed it off as a joke, and laughed at it; some of the men had drank salt water from necessity, and he treated that quite as a joke - he was very proud of his office as commander; he was always boasting of his big ship, saying he was master and commander of the fine ship the Partridge, and placed in the shoes of Mr. Mellish himself, and would show his authority - I considered that indicted deficiency of mind and weakness - we all spoke of it as such; it was the common opinion of us five - nothing particular had happened to have affected his mind then, he might have drank a little, but we had not the opportunity of knowing that. We went to the Marquesas - it took us about a fortnight to go there from the Galipagos; these symptoms continued - before we got to the Marquesas we nearly lost the ship, through his having a pilot who was insufficient (that was the Captain's fault) - he could have prevented it, because I had been to the place before, and knew it better than the man he employed, who was a cannibal alomost: we warned him of it, and he only laughed at us: I suppose he saw the danger of the man being pilot - we warned him of it when the ship was in danger, by putting her about; the mate took it upon himself - he was next in authority to the cap<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110071"></xptr>tain: we had several Welch sailors - he would have one of the Welch sailors on the sofa, saying the Lord's prayer in Welch, and he would drink with him to; that was done often; it appeared to me extraordinary: it was the subject of remark among us - he had him into his berth, sitting with him on the sofa, drinking with him, talking all manner of foolishness, saying the Lord's prayer in Welch three or four times over, and asking him about Wales, and that repeatedly; I saw him heave at several whales - I was in the boat with him; we went down after a large whale, and he hove two irons at her, which missed, and then he jumped overboard upon her - I did not expect to see him come up again, but he swam back to the boat, and came into the boat - we had been out then about twelve months: I have often seen him strip himself; he would dance about in his own cabin, or in the common cabin for us all, and sometimes he would break about a dozen panes of glass with his fists at a time, and cut his hands; sometimes he would fall with his head against the window of the berth, and cut his head - sometimes he would break half a dozen tumblers, and dance on them with his bare feet; he did this frequently for months - he would have the doctor take the glass out of his feet, forehead and hands, and go at it again just the same; he said that it was through family fits, that the family were troubled with them; he would often tell the boy, after dinner or supper, to heave the plates and knives and forks out of the cabin window, or else he would flog him; he has then said he would break more - he had a sofa in the cabin; he gave that away at the Sandwich Islands, to a sail-maker; he gave no reason for it; after he gave the sofa away, he had a cradle made, something similar to an apple-stall which women have in the street - it had four legs to it, two stools and a platform to it, and a thing covered over it- he would sleep in that: I heard him order the cooper to make it in place of the sofa - I should think the sofa was the most useful thing: this appeared to me the act of a man not in his sound senses - he would dance round the chairs half naked, or waltz with the chairs in the cabin, and sing - this surprised me very much; no man in his senses would be so absurd - he often used to sleep with his head on the table, and a pistol by him, he has done so ten, thirty, or forty times, sometimes by day and sometimes by night; it was dangerous to sleep with a loaded pistol close to his ear; they were horse pistols, with a barrel of ten inches perhaps; sometimes the muzzle of the pistol would be towards him, and sometimes put towards the fore part of the cabin; we spoke of it to him - he was very impatient of controul: he was a passionate man, and very jealous of his power and station in the ship; we had a person on board named Thompson, who had a sleeping place to himself; I have seen the prisoner jump on the top of him when he has been in bed and asleep, with a pistol in each hand - Thompson was the mate, a chief officer; I have often seen that; it was quite a common thing on board - he did not keep company with Thompson at all; the pistols were sometimes loaded and sometimes not - he would sometimes come and throw a jug of cold water into my face when I have been asleep; I always remonstrated with him - he said it was to show his authority as master and commander; he sometimes put the bottles on the cabin table, and took his steel or knife and fenced with them, and sent them away to the other side of the cabin, liquor and all; he would often jump out of his bed in the night, and say the devil was in the cabin - he often said we were going to rob him, and he would lock every thing up - these symptoms increased more and more; we all spoke of it - the cook died during the voyage in my arms, in his berth, and the prisoner would not sleep below for six weeks or two months after, for fear of his ghost - he gave that as a reason; he was completely mad at the Sandwich Islands for six weeks, and had two doctors to attend him - the doctors thought he would have died there; we had then been out nearly two years - we were refreshing the ship there; I saw him at intervals: he was laying almost dead when I saw him - he had his head shaved; I think he got worse after that - I thought his mind in the worst state when we got nearer home, some of us locked him in his berth, for he had got mad altogether; (we had been out forty-five months; he was going to blow the ship up in the chops of the channel) - we locked him up by common consent, for the safety of the ship: he continued always so till we got into the Downs: I left the ship at Blackwall - he was worse then, and the pilot had to put him below - the prisoner said he would shoot him if he could get a pistol; the pilot was in command when the ship was in the river - I parted with the ship at Blackwall on the 10th of July, 1830, and he remained in that state till I left the ship.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you communicate these things to Mr. Mellish as soon as you arrived? A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Mellish personally? A. All the officers did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Mellish your opinion of the state of his mind? A. Yes; I spoke, I do not exactly know to whom - I spoke more to Captain 
               <persName id="t18330411-145-person1083">Dale</persName>
             (who is dead) than to Mr. Mellish - I had to communicate with Mr. Mellish and Captain Dale, his agent, on business when I quitted the ship - I was alone with Mr. Dale sometimes, and told him of this conduct - I saw Mr. Mellish there sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Captain Dale die? A. Two years ago nearly - he died in 1831; he was my uncle - when we were at a place called Goa, the prisoner abused the governor, and threatened to shoot him: the governor had sold him some iron, and they disputed about a dollar, or a dollar and a half - I do not know that he had pistols with him; I saw him for some months after I quitted the ship - I always thought, and still think, that he was of insane mind; I have seen him sometimes lately on 'Change, but we never spoke after all was settled - I only saw him after I left the ship to settle the affairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Was that your first voyage? A. The second - we had been three years on the first voyage; I was then under Captain Hewit, in Mr. Mellish's service; I have not been to sea since I went with the prisoner - I am now a ship-broker; the instances I have named were dispersed over the whole forty-five months of the voyage, and I have not named one hundredth part of them; I wrote home to Captain Dale at times, but not so often as I ought - I did not write till after we had been out two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did those letters contain information of his unsound state of mind? A. No, not much - they did contain<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110072"></xptr>some; I cannot tell when I named it - I did not write to tell him Captain Folger was a madman; I cannot remember what was in the letters; I never wrote to Mr. Mellish, but I wrote to Captain Dale I suppose about six times - I wrote to him from the Sandwich Islands.</p>

               <p>Q. That was while he was mad, and under the care of a doctor; did you tell the captain that? A. No, I do not think I did - I wrote to him from Goa; I do not think I named it then, for when I came home he always blamed me for not telling him; the first instance happened at Cape de Verd, when he put the men on shore for not working on Sunday - I do not think there was any British consul there; I should say decidedly he was sober when he shot at the mate - they had had no words; he took the pistol and fired it; I do not know whether he knew it was loaded - it was about nine o'clock in the morning that he sent us out to catch turpins; we might have done that in a day or less, but he sent us different ways - they are not caught so easily - there may be none when we go; they do not live in the water, but up in the bushes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had had provisions with you, might you not have been out longer than he liked? A. We might, but there was no water there - I never saw the pilot that he took eat human flesh, but he has said so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know whether he could have got a better pilot there? A. No - a pilot is a man who knows the coast he comes off of, but I knew the coast - I did not know the soundings, and do not believe that any body does.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He jumped on a whale's back, and back again? A. I cannot say he jumped right on her, he jumped after her, and into the vortex of the water where it had gone down - he swam back; he used to skip and dance on glass when on the Japan coast, and at different times on the voyage - we did not attempt to confine him; he struck the surgeon once; the surgeon did not confine him - there was a consul and British people at the Sandwich Islands; many of these things happened before we got there - we complained to the consul there, but he threatened to take us all out of the ship, and flog us all; I do not know why, but because we disputed the prisoner's authority, madness, and stupidness; on coming home we did not remonstrate with the government about the consul's conduct - I know many sailors who are not afraid of ghosts; he was going to blow the ship up in the channel - there were some King's ships in the channel, but we did not complain to them, nor when we got on shore - we were glad to get clear of him.</p>
               <p>Q. In the whole voyage was not the prisoner extremely drunk and dissipated, both on board and on shore, spending and throwing away Mr. Mellish's property, and wasting it? A. Yes, after the time I mentioned, but not at first - we told Mr. Mellish about the proceedings on the voyage, and how he had wasted his property; I did not tell him it would be improper to pay him any money - I told him the whole proceedings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell him you believed Folger was mad? A."Mad and drunk" I have always said; I do not know that I ever spoke to Mr. Mellish so much as to say he was mad, because others spoke more than me; there were three besides me, and we all spoke together, saying he was mad and drunk - I told him and Captain 
               <persName id="t18330411-145-person1084">Dale</persName>
             all I have told you to-day, word for word, the whole proceedings of the voyage.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you told him the prisoner was mad at the Sandwich Islands? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you tell him you believed him to be a madman, and not in his right senses? A. I do not know that I exactly said that - it might be the effect of drink at first, but he was mad several times on the voyage; I considered it was brought on by drink at first.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You continued to see the prisoner afterwards, did you not tell any friend of his that he was in a state which he ought to be looked after and confined? A.No, I did not trouble myself about him; I was tired of him - I knew he was going about this town.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q.When you communicated with Mr. Mellish was it at Mr. Mellish's request? A. Yes, I attended with the other petty officers - Thompson was the chief officer and the chief speaker; Mr. Mellish had us there to ascertain what had been the prisoner's conduct - we explained all these instances, and one hundred which I have not named; Thompson would have to take the command of the vessel if the prisoner was unfit- I have seen the prisoner drinking and drunk; I told Mr. Dale all these circumstances, leaving him to judge of them - we were treated with contempt by the consul.</p>
               <p>ARCHIBALD LESLEY. I am a provision merchant, and live at Wandsworth. I made a communication to Mr. Mellish (since Folger's return) of what Folger has threatened or talked about; Mr. Mellish smiled, and said"Poor fellow; I believe the man is crazy or mad!" I had heard what Folger had said of Mr. Mellish, and I thought it my duty to put him on his guard respecting Captain 
               <persName id="t18330411-145-person1085">Folger</persName>
            , because I thought he might attempt to injure him - the prisoner spoke in a very violent manner, and said he had a good mind to horsewhip him on Cornhill; this was about this time two years.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not state in the conversation, that Mr. Mellish had behaved badly to him in many matters? A. In the settlement of his account; I understood him to mean that he had not given him so much as he ought - I did not tell Mr. Mellish he had said he would horsewhip him; I told him enough to put him on his guard - Mr. Mellish smiled, and said, "I believe, poor man, he is crazy or mad, I do not know which;" I will undertake to swear he either said crazy or mad - the prisoner did not attempt any violence on me or the passengers; I observed no violence in his manner; but as soon as he spoke of Mr. Mellish he seemed to go quite intemperate and to talk about the matter - I knew the Partridge, and who she belonged to, and talked to him about it.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any thing to lead you to suppose he was not right in his mind? A. I thought his behaviour very indiscreet, to speak of a gentleman on the top of a coach as he did - I was not afraid to sit by him.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN BLISSON. I was in a South Sea whaler in 1826 - I met with the Partridge in the voyage, and knew the prisoner as commander - I did not see much of him; I saw him at Guan - I was communicating with him about fourteen days, till I left the port; his conduct appeared extraordinary in one or two cases - in some business he had to transact with the governor his conduct appeared that of a man not in his right senses, and I made an observation to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110073"></xptr>that effect at the time - I never knew any thing else of him - I was once in his company at home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When was this? A. I saw him three weeks before he committed this act - I was in his company about three hours; he was in liquor then - I met him about Change; he spoke about Mr. Mellish - I believe no man was more kind-hearted and humane than he was, but he has always appeared under great excitement when he had spoken of Mr. Mellish; he was quite calm and collected till Mr. Mellish's name came in question - I have seen much of persons who are insane; the disorder begins when the subject which caused their malady is raised.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You did not know him before 1829, I believe? A. Yes, for three or four years before that; I know he was a little the worse for liquor when he abused the governor - I was obliged to apologise to the governor for him; I attribute his extravagant conduct to the effect of liquor - nothing was mentioned about Mr. Mellish in 1829; when I saw him three weeks before this, he was labouring under the effect of liquor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When persons in a calm state have gone off when a subject has been named, have not those been cases where the mind has been under some delusion? A.Generally; I have been with two or three masters of ships in similar cases, and there has been something which operated on their minds.</p>
               <p>Q. He was the worse for liquor when you saw him for three hours three weeks before this occurrence, but not drunk? A. Yes, he was evidently excited by liquor; he spoke violently of Mr. Mellish, and said he had been wronged by him.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q.Did he not speak of Mr. Mellish as having ruined him in character and fortune? A. He did.</p>

             KELLY. I was formerly captain on board a merchant vessel - I was Vice Consul of the Society Islands once, but not when the prisoner touched there as captain of the Partridge; I saw him at the Sandwich Islands when I was in command of the Sophia; I never knew him before - I have met him on Change since his return; from what I have seen of him, he is certainly not of sound mind - I do not consider him in a condition to take care of himself.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. When did you first become acquainted with him? A. At the Sandwich Islands - he was under my observation for about a month there in 1829; I saw him again about eight months ago on Change, and several times since; I was never on board his ship at the Sandwich Islands - I saw him frequently on shore; I have often seen persons labouring under the effects of constant drunkenness, present the appearance of persons of unsound mind - I always supposed his case to be the effect of nervous excitement, brought on by excessive drinking; I know he was in the habit at that time of drinking to a great excess - the extraordinary conduct I saw, was in my judgment, the consequence of excessive drinking; I have met him eight or ten times on Change, and conversed with him within the last few months, and then I conceived him mad; I have talked with him alone, and in the presence of others before February - I observed to one or two friends that he was mad, for when conversing about Mr. Mellish and his loss, his conduct was so strange and he had such a dreadful nervous excitement and trembling; I observed to my friends, that I thought he would commit suicide.</p>

               <p>Q.Was he at those times under the effect of liquor? A. On one occasion he was, it was evident he had been drinking; I cannot say that he was not labouring under the effects of liquor on the other occasions - these were mere casual meetings on Change; our conversation was not of any great length - I did not communicate with Mr. Mellish; I had not the pleasure of knowing him - the prsoner's conduct was more violent when Mr. Mellish was named - but his general conduct was wild, inconsistent; he had a strange incoherency of speech, flying from one subject to another.</p>
               <p>Q. At times when he was not in liquor? A. Yes, he frequently said Mr. Mellish had taken away his character, and he had nothing worth living for; I never observed him under any morbid delusion.</p>
               <p>JAMES CURTIS. I keep the Rum Puncheon at Gravesend. I have known Mr. Folger more than two years; he has lodged with me occasionally - he has passed a great deal of his time in my view; his conduct has certainly not been rational, like a man in his senses - I have seen him do a great many actions which a man in his senses would not do; I have reasoned with him about it, and so have other people in my house - the last thing I can recollect, is, that he came down from London in the evening, it was a very cold night; he said, "Curtis I will go and have a warm bath" - he went and had a warm bath, he got tipsy afterwards, and next morning he had another warm bath, and went and stood on the bridge; I said,"It is a very cold morning, you had better not stand there" - he said, "Never mind, it will not hurt me," and in the afternoon he had another warm bath, and then called a waterman to row him over to Tilbury Fort; the waterman did not bring the boat soon enough, and he jumped into the water, and pulled the boat to him - I took him up stairs and put him to bed, he was so wet; I believe his mind disordered, and very bad - I have heard him speak very violently of Mr. Mellish indeed; as soon as Mr. Mellish's name was mentioned, he was like a madman directly - I have had to get him out of the bar, and persons have made the remark, "Curtis, you will have to get a strait jacket to put this mad Captain into very shortly;" when his mind was not directed to Mr. Mellish, he was as good as possible - he brought a little boy to my house once, and behaved kindly to it, and so he did to my children; he has been at my house a month at a time.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. His violence was always when Mr. Mellish was named? A. Yes - it is on that violence I form my opinion; I have seen him violent on other occasions - Mr. Mellish was not named when he had the warm bath; he was not in liquor when he jumped into the water - he had been tipsy the night before; he went to bed about eleven o'clock - it was between three and four o'clock the next afternoon that he jumped into the water; he had dined, and we had a pint of port.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know whether a little<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110074"></xptr>iquor will affect him? A. He can take a great deal before it takes effect; I never endeavoured to get him confined - I have said it was a pity somebody would not take him in hand and govern him; I put him out of my parlour by force when he was sober, the latter end of last summer.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q. Was not Mr. Mellish always in his mouth and thoughts? A. Yes, he began talking about him with nine people out of ten, who came to my house - I thought I should hear of his being picked up in the canal someday; he has said he should like to horsewhip Mr. Mellish, and bought a whip for that purpose - he said several times that Mr. Mellish had ruined him, and taken away his character.</p>

            . I keep the Dog and Duck, at Queenhithe. I have known the prisoner about two years; I have bad opportunities of observing his conduct and manner, and the state of his mind - in my judgment, at times his mind is unsound.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean when he is labouring under the effect of liquor? A. I have seen him so when he had not been taking any thing strong to my knowledge; I have frequently seen him in liquor - he lodged with me(but did not board) for eight months, from August, 1831, to April, 1832; he came down stairs one night nearly naked, after having been gone to bed about ten minutes, and when told of it next afternoon, he knew nothing of it - he had not drank to excess that night; he always took something - he drank to excess at times.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. He had not drank to excess that time? A. I did not perceive it; after he went to bed I always went to see if his candle was safe - I thought it proper; he was constantly in the habit of drinking to excess, but I have seen a difference in him when he has not been drinking to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>RICHARD HEMMINGS. I am a waterman. I have known Folger well, these six or seven years, down to the present time; I generally rowed him by water - I have taken him to London or Greenwich; I observed a great deal of oddness in his manner - he would sit in the boat as comfortable as any man, when all of a sudden he would get up and stamp his feet, and behave very strange - that did not endanger the safety of the boat; I did not like to see it, and I used to talk to him - he was sober enough then; he always paid me regularly - he did not stand particular as to what his fare was; I have continued to see him about twenty times in a month down to the present time - I thought him a man of odd manner, like out of his mind: he was not in his right mind, in my opinion.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN, Q. You only rowed him about? A. No, the last time was about two months ago; I rowed him from the Dog and Duck to the King's Arms about a month before this occurred - and he kept going on as soon as he saw Mr. Mellish's wharf, stamping his feet and throwing his arms about - he did not say so much then as at other times; it was about two o'clock in the day - he was sober then, in my opinion; he always landed where he told me to take him to - I never charged him any thing; he used to pay me without charging - I have seen him very tipsy; once or twice at the Dog and Duck - his conduct was just the same then; once in particular he was very bad.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Can you mention any particular instance of his not being right in his mind? or have you known him violent only when Mr. Mellish was named? A. He always used to mention Mr. Mellish; he came to me one day, and told me to row him to St. Katharine's-dock as hard as I could - I did so; he said, "Make your boat fast and come ashore directly;" and before I could get ashore he said,"Come along, I am in a terrible hurry" - he got into a coach, and told me to jump in; he told the coachman to drive as hard as he could, somewhere about two miles - he knocked at a door and inquired for some woman, and kept running about the house; the woman came - he said,"Bear a hand, I want to get to Gravesend as quick as possible;" the woman got into the coach and went with us- we drove to the steam-pocket wharf; I saw him go on board the Eclipse, and saw no more of him; he was very bad that afternoon - he had not been drunk that I know of; that was last summer.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ANDERSON. I am a tailor, and live in Cannon-street, St. George's East, I know the prisoner very intimately, probably for ten or twelve years; occasionally I considered him decidedly of unsound mind - I have had opportunities of observing his conduct and manner very frequently; I have seen him frequently the latter part of last year with a pistol about him - I saw him with a pistol at a tavern; at one time, he was sitting at a table - there were eight or ten persons there; it was on the 5th of November - it was at the Kettle-drum in Ratcliffe-highway; he frequently attempted to discharge the pistol, but it did not go off - I saw him put the powder into it, but on my taking hold of him I believe the powder fell out; I saw him put the cap on - it was a percussion pistol; I did not see him put any thing but powder into it - he discharged a pistol at my house early in the evening, on the same day, when people were present; it was loaded - he would have put a ball into it, but I prevented him; he fired it in the yard - not at any thing particularly; he would have fired it in the house, but I prevented him - I conclude he was of unsound mind, from the general violence he has shown whenever Mr. Mellish's name has been mentioned, or whenever he came near Mr. Mellish's premises; I have frequently been with him - he has been perfectly sober at that time; it has been at nine o'clock in the morning - I have observed this occur at all times; he frequently said that Mr. Mellish had deprived him of his character - he was continually harping on that; that was principally since the arbitration has been decided - he said this when sobe ras well as drunk; I have not seen persons of unsound mind - I have known persons driven to drink by disappointment and distress.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose he visited you? A. Yes, continually down to this affair.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN KING. I have been in the South Sea fishery. I have known the prisoner about seventeen years - he sailed with me in 1816 and 1817, in the Elizabeth, which belonged to Mr. Mellish - I have not seen much of him for the last twelve months; he was a very fine young man when he sailed with me, and one of the best young men I ever had, and I believe he was then in his right mind, but I do not believe him to have been so for these last three or four years - he has been to my house several times, and I have observed a very great alteration in his conduct; I believed at those times his mind was disordered, and I have told Mrs. King so - this was when he was perfectly sober;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110075"></xptr>I have children, and he always had them on his knee when he came to my house - he was not a man who would take another's life, if in his right mind - I never noticed any of these appearances before he sailed for Mr. Mellish; I have not a doubt but that has been the cause of his disordered mind - he could get no employ; he has told me that Mr. Mellish refused to give him a character - I do not think he has spoken on any subject without bringing up Mr. Mellish; he has been more exasperated a great deal when Mr. Mellish's name has been mentioned - I have seen him go by my house in an open landau, like a madman, huzzaing, and holding his hands out in the street; I considered him of a disordered mind.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.When he first came to you was he sober? A. Yes, I have never seen him intoxicated - I do not go into company; he occasionally called at my house - I have seen him there two or three times in the course of the last year; it was three or four months previous to this transaction that he was in the landau - I live at Deptford; I never saw a sailor huzza along the street unless he was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you mention any instance of insanity besides his speaking with violence of Mr. Mellish? A. No.</p>

               <p>MR. MELLISH. I never had any application from the prisoner for a character - I have had no conversation with him, except in the settlement of accounts; I never expressed to him, that if asked I should not give him a character - I was present when Mr. Rotch told him he could not expect a character from me, after what had been stated.</p>
               <p>WRIGHT WELBY. I live in Spa-road, Bermondsey, and am a sail maker. I know the prisoner as a neighbour - in my judgment he is of unsound mind, for he almost shot me; I had never spoken to him - it is three months ago - between eight and nine o'clock in the morning I had occasion to go down my yard; I heard the report of a pistol, and heard the fence crack - I saw the handle fall off a trowel which was stuck in the wall; I was about three feet from the trowel - the prisoner was about ninety feet from me at the time; the shot split the trowel handle - I cannot say whether he was shooting at me or the fence, for the fence is nearly as high as my hat; the fence was between me and him - the ball came in a direction towards me; there was nothing which I could see in the fence to shoot at - I have seen him walk upanddown the yard, at six or seven o'clock in the morning, as if he was out of his mind, raving - he appeared to be in a deep study, and then he would shake his hands and stamp his feet - there was no apparent cause for that; I saw nothing to provoke his anger - I have observed him do this several times; I concluded he was of unsound mind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your premises are separated by a fence? A. Yes, and there is one house between his and mine.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA WHITNEY. I live at Bermondsey. I have known the prisoner nine or ten months - I lived within one house of him; I have seen him behave extremely curious in many instances, and believe him of unsound mind - he has come into my shop three or four times within an hour, and laid out 6d. or a 1s. in children's sweetmeats, or toys, and he would take and throw them on his parlour floor; I consider no rational man would do that - I sent them home by my little girl, and they were sent back again; he has thrown them down on the floor, but not in my presence - I understand so, because his wife would not take them in; I have been probably an hour or an hour and a half with him, at his house or my house, and three or four times in public-houses - he repeatedly mentioned Mr. Mellish's name, and as soon as his name has been mentioned; he has been shaking, and said Mr. Mellish had not only robbed him of his money, but of his honour and character, so that he could not get another ship - from these instances I should say he is not in his right mind; he has been perfectly sober on these occasions - I have seen him in liquor, but more frequently quite sober than drunk.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Can you mention any circumstance except hearing him speak of Mr. Mellish violently, to induce you to believe him out of his mind? A.Certainly; I have seen him act very imprudently to men at work on the road before his own door - he treated them very profusely with liquor; he took them in, gave them brandy, and sent for half-and-half for them, and gave a boy 2d. or 3d. to go a few yards to fetch it for them.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM JORDAN. I live at Spa-road, Bermondsey. I live about sixty yards from where the prisoner lived - I have not seen much of him; I have seen him occasionlly, generally at the public-house which I go to take my lunch at; I have met him occasionally at a public-house about eleven o'clock in the morning - I have seen him mostly sober there; I considered he acted sometimes rather flighty, and was easily turned either to generosity or anger - I was out with him one day at the time they were canvassing; he had a pistol with him, and offered to sell it to me (he behaved like a man that was a little bit frightened) - I said I did not want such a thing; he might have had a glass of grog at the time - I think it was like a man deranged his exposing the pistol.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.How long ago was this? A. It was the day they were canvassing for Mr. Beanclerk - I think in February; they were going down to the Royal Oak in carriages - I was not canvassing.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you think his mind unsound? A. The generality of his conduct was flighty - he was easily led either to anger or affection; I can give you no further instances of it - one night after that he was snapping his pistol in the faces of the people at the door; it was not loaded; it was to make a report to please the children - it was a percussion pistol; he was rather silly than otherwise - he put the pistol into his pocket.</p>

            . I am a coal-merchant, and live at Rotherhithe. I have known the prisoner about twelve months - I have had opportunities of observing his conduct and manner, and think him of unsound mind; on the evening of the 8th of February last, the Friday week previous to this, when I entered the room at the Europa inn, he was sitting in a sort of sleepy posture, as if dozing - on his left-hand side was Captain Corner, and on the other side was Captain Lawson - Corner aroused him, and he immediately started up, and said he did not know there was a d-d blackguard in the room; nobody answered him for some time, till at last Mr.

             got up, and remonstrated with him on the violence of his conduct, and after his advice he instantly sat himself down, and put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110076"></xptr>himself in the same position as if to doze; Captain Lawson began a conversation about a sermon preached at church, and all of a sudden he jumped up, and said, "Captain Lawson, who sits there, is a d-d rascal." and then he looked completely insane; there is a gentleman in Court, who, at the request of us, took him under his arms, and drew him out of the room, as we did not consider him safe; this was between nine and ten o'clock in the evening - I do not think he was drunk; I have learned that he had brandished a pistol once before, and I consider if he had had a pistol at that moment no man's life would have been safe.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he visit at your house? A. Never: I have been in his company perhaps twenty times; I always considered he was insane - I did not cause him to be taken care of.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.You do not know where he had been during that day? A. I heard him say he had spent the day on the other side of the water.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BAKER COX. I am an attorney. The prisoner applied to me about three years since, to assist him in some law matters - his affair with Mr. Mellish was part of what he wanted advice about; he attended my office frequently on the subject; I knew him before that - on the former voyage he appeared a very different man to what he did on his return from that voyage; he was quite an altered man; I acted on his instructions for a certain time on the subject of suing Mr. Mellish - there was other business; there were actions brought against him by different seamen - the business was rather complicated; I considered the man on his return in a very excited state - I ultimately refused to act for him; a tender was made by Mr. Mellish; I thought it reasonable, and advised him to accept it - he refused; I stated my reasons in writing, and declined to act for him - it was plain that the advice I gave him was right, but he treated me as if I was misleading him; ten actions were brought against him by the seamen - I could have settled all those for 60l. - he refused that, and if they had gone on he must have been ruined; I told him I considered I had not advised him right; and I had brought about the arrangements with Mr. Mellish, which was through the friendly interference of Mr. Rotch; he behaved to me with gratitude on the former voyage, and made me a present; about a week before this transaction he met me on 'Change, and said, "What do you mean? why do you not get me a character from Mr. Mellish?" I said, "Have you sent to Mr. Mellish for a character?" he said, "Oh no, he has taken away my character, and I don't care about it;" he spoke in a wild incoherent manner; I said, "Mr. Mellish is only bound to give a fair answer to your character while in his employ;" he went on with wild ejaculations and I left him - he said, "Mr. Mellish has taken away my character, and you ought to have got me one;" after I wrote the letter to him I had no further intercourse with him, except meeting him occasionally - I consider, and I thought then, that his head was in a state of disorder and derangement.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When you saw him on 'Change he had wit enough to know you were his attorney against Mr. Mellish? A. I have mentioned his words; I certainly consider he referred to me as such - when he settled with Mr. Mellish he brought the cheque to me, settled his account, and by my advice invested the rest in stock; I consider he was mad in not taking my advice in the different actions against him - when I gave him that advice he would frequently clench his fist, stare wildly, pace about the room, and appear any thing but a rational being; I knew some of his friends; he had no relatives in this country, or I should have advised a distringas on his property in the Bank.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to a Magistrate and state your opinion of him? A. If I had I expect I should have been laughed at, for, according to my opinion of the laws of insanity, I had no right to do so; he never threatened Mr. Mellish or any body in my presence; I heard he had spoken angrily about me, and previously he was full of gratitude; I have repeatedly seen him staring about the street; all the while he attended on me about Mr. Mellish's business I thought it was the effect of excitement; but after that was closed I thought him not rational; it was after the settlement that I declined to act for him.</p>
               <p>MR. GILBERT McMURDO. I am surgeon of the gaol. I have been in the habit of seeing a good many cases of lunacy; I saw the prisoner either the second or third day after he came into the gaol - I saw him at Giltspur-street on the second or third day after the transaction; I have had almost daily conversation with him - I have taken pains continually to observe him, thinking it probable I might be asked my opinion; I have no knowledge of any symptom which he has exhibited to make me come to the conclusion of his being of unsound mind.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q.How often have you seen him? A.Very nearly daily; there has generally been some other persons present - the wardsman and four or five who reside in the same ward; they were generally present, so as to hear what I said to him; I have been with him half an hour and three quariers of an hour at a time; I was told it would be likely I should be wanted, by the Lord Mayor - I was not subpoenaed to-day, but was told very likely I should be wanted; the Lord Mayor did not desire me to be here to-day; the Clerk of arraigns told me it was very likely I should be wanted, and I had better be in attendance; on one occasion the Lord Mayor met me, and said, "Mind you see that prisoner, for it is very likely we shall want your evidence" - I cannot answer whether that was the day he had been examining the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. You are employed by the Corporation? A. Yes; I go to the Compter daily to see the prisoners - the persons with the prisoner have been always perfectly silent when I was conversing with him; my object was entirely to ascertain whether he was of sound mind or not.</p>

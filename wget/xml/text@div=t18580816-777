I am a commercial-traveller, living at 126, Brunswick-street, Hackney-road—on the evening of 17th July, I was in Mr. Craske's shop, and saw Smith there—a shilling was handed to me which I found, on examining it, was a bad one; it bent nearly in two—Smith paid a good penny for what she had had, and then left the shop—the last witness said she thought the woman had bad money, and I followed her—she walked</p>

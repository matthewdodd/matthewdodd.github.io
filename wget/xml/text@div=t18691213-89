                  </hi>. I am a solicitor—I acted for Mr. Johnson in this matter—on 1st October I was present in Court—I saw Savory there—in accordance with the notice I had given, I applied for an adjournment—I heard Savory sworn, and heard what he said—I did not take any note—I handed in a medical certificate with reference to Johnson's absence, and Savory got up and said, "Oh, that is all nonsense, I have seen him"—the judge said, "Well, let this man be sworn"—he was sworn, and said, "I saw him yesterday, at his office in Basinghall Street, and in the Bankruptcy Court, and I saw him this morning in Basinghall Street"—I then Cross-examined him, and said "Now repeat where you saw him," and he said, "I saw him in his office in Basinghall Street, yesterday, and I saw him this morning in Basinghall Street"—I said, "This morning, that was after you got my notice"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "In the face of that notice, why did you come here with counsel and witnesses; and, if you had seen the man, why not say you had got a notice of his being ill, and you were sur<lb></lb>prised to see him in the street"—he said "He was over the other side," or something of that sort—I had given him notice of my intention to apply for an adjournment—after this evidence a verdict was taken for the defendant for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was not able to go into the set-off—the Judge would not hear any remarks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you take any note of what was said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I could not—I was examining him at the time—he did not say, after saying that he had seen Johnson that morning, "He was also seen at his office in Basinghall Street," nor did he point to a man named Hart—there was a man examined, I can't tell his name, who repeated Savory's words, word for word—I acted for Johnson from the commencement of the proceedings—his claim was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than Savory's, it was 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—Johnson was not present on 23rd July, and I paid the costs of the day, through his absence—I communicated to him that the verdict was against him, two days after-wards—he has not applied for a new trial—he has paid the money—he has taken no other proceedings than these.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MOODY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not apply for a new trial? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I believe the rule is that you must indict for perjury first, and apply for a new trial afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

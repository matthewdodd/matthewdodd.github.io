I am a scale-maker, of Smithfield—I have one partner—the prisoner was my apprentice—he used to work in the shop—he was never allowed to take money—I marked three half crowns, a florin, and other silver, amounting to 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on 3rd March—I put it in the till, and it was safe at 12 o'clock in the day on 4th March—the prisoner was left in the shop alone from 12 o'clock till about 1—there are several men em<lb></lb>ployed in the shop, but they were gone to dinner—I came down from dinner about 10 minutes or a quarter past 2 o'clock—I then examined the till, and two half crowns and one shilling were gone—I sent for an officer—the prisoner was charged with taking money out of the till—he said he had not touched it—he was searched at the station—the police afterwards produced to me two half crowns and one shilling—they were part of the money I had marked and put in the till—the till was always kept locked—I had left it locked that day, and I found it locked—the prisoner had not a key of it, that I know of—he had no business to have one—he had been gone to his dinner, I suppose, about ten minutes before I came down—when I came down he was not there—he came back in about an hour.</p>

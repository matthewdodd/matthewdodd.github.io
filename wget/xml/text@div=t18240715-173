            . I am servant to a gentleman who lives at Lambeth; my brother wanted a pony; we were to meet in Smithfield. on Friday, the 2d of July, to buy one - after we met he left me; I had only 15 s. in my pocket;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150073"></xptr>I saw the prisoner who had two ponies - I asked him the the price of one, he said 3 l. 10 s.; he then said 3 l. and then came down to my price, which was 50 s.; I said I would give him something to drink, and gave him half-a-cown, and went to look for my brother - I stopped half-an-hour, but could not find him - I then went and pawned my watch, with Mr. Stafford in St. John-street, for two sovereigns - I came back to the prisoner, and met him at the same place (Stafford's man threw them on the counter, and they both sounded alike:) I said I had got the money, he said I thought you was not coming I took him to a public house and gave him a glass of rum, and then paid the two sovereigns and 7 s. 6 d. out of my purse, and he delivered me the pony, and as I was going away he said to me</p>
               <p>"As a friend I would advise you to sell it, for it is broken winded, and has got the staggers" - I then looked and it had been blooded in the neck, and offered it for sale, and two or three came round me and offered me 20 s. or 25 s. for it - the prisoner then said he would buy it back again; I said I would lose 5 s. by it: he said I must lose 10 s. At last I agreed to lose 7 s.; he gave me two sovereigns and three shillings. I went to Mr. Stafford's to get my watch again, and there discovered that one of the sovereigns was bad - I then went back, and found him on the other side of the market; I told him I wanted to speak to him, and got him up St. John-street, and then told him what I wanted, and had him secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. What are you - A. I am a gentleman's servant. I swear that I got those sovereigns from the prisoner; he said to me,</p>

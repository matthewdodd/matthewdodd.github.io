            . I am servant to Mr. Bridgeman. I took the candles to Mrs. Hill's, No.30, Old Gravel-lane. When I got into the lane, a boy met me, and told me they were to be taken to No. 60, <placeName id="t18180506-140-crimeloc803">Anchor and Hope-alley</placeName>

The prisoner and Mrs. Hill were behind the counter. I gave her the bill. and asked for the money. She said there was half a hundred weight of soap ordered, told me to fetch it, and she would pay me when I returned. I said I would not leave the goods without the money. She said her husband was out, and she had not got enough. She sent the boy out to change a 10l. note - She went out after him. She returned, and said she could not find the boy; he came in soon after, and said his master would return in half an hour. She sent me back for the soap, and said she would have the money when I returned. She called the boy into the room, gave him a paper, and sent him with me, desiring him not to give the note till I gave him the change - I thought he had a note. I took him to the shop - He told us to send half a hundred weight of soap; he had not got the note. I returned, but they were gone. The prisoner was in the shop when I delivered the goods.</p>

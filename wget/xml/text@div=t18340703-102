            . I am single, and live at No. 19, Bell-court, Gray's Inn-lane. On Saturday night, the 31st of May, I was going out for some beer - I passed by the end of King's Head-court, and observed a scuffle under the archway, almost at the bottom of the archway - I went up to them, and saw the prisoner and deceased fighting together, scuffling - I tried to part them, but could not - Cronin had got the deceased fastened by the neck, either by his neckcloth or throat - he had his head against his breast - I saw Cronin strike the deceased about the head and shoulder - I could not say exactly the spot - I left them and went to Mrs. Cronin and Mrs. Welch, who were on the other side of the court, underneath the parlour window, three or four yards from their husbands - Mrs. Cronin had got Mrs. Welch's back hair twisted round her hands - her hair was down - she was holding her by her back hair - I loosed her hair out of Mrs. Cronin's hand, and parted them - I went back to the men - they were in the same situation as I had left them, scuffling together - I interfered again, but was not able to part them - I caught hold of Cronin's arm, and said,"Let go of the man" - he said he would not leave him till he had given him his whack - I saw no more of it, as my mother called me away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I think you said the affair had began before you went up? A. Yes; how it began, I cannot tell - both of the women were scuffling - Mr. Welch had his coat on when I was there - I left them fighting - I did not see a man with a green shade over his eyes - if he was there, he must have come up afterwards - he might have been there without my seeing him - there were about four or five persons down the court looking on - the two men and two women were fighting and defending themselves as well as they could - I did not see the deceased strike at all - they were scuffling - I had known the parties before - I came back after it was all over - I do not know Margaret Burke by name - I do not know Mrs. Costello - there were some women there - the deceased was rather a thin man - he was not so stout as the prisoner - I do not think he was so old as twenty-eight - he was a tall man.</p>

            . I live in York-street, Westminster. My son-in-law lives at the corner of King's Head-court - I was at his house on the 31st of May - the noise brought me out about twelve o'clock, or after - I went down the court, and saw two men fighting - they were beginning to fight then - one with his coat off, and the other on - it was Welch and Cronin - I saw them fighting for about ten minutes, I should judge - they fought nearly half up the court - Welch was knocked down with a blow from the fist - the court is paved with flag-stones - Welch recovered himself, got up, and fought again for two or three minutes after that, and at the end of that time, he received a blow at the side of his head from a fist - Cronin gave the blow, and then Welch's head came down with a tremendous fall on the pavement - he laid there some time, and a man with a patch on his eye, asked me to lend a hand to carry him as he was either dead, or very much hurt - he was not able to get up - I lent a hand to carry him to the bot<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030048"></xptr>tom of the passage to the door, and then helped to carry him into the passage till the doctor came - the policeman fetched the doctor, who I saw try to open two veins in his arm - he got no blood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About how long did the fight continue altogether? A. I should judge nearly ten minutes - I did not know the parties before - the deceased had his coat off while he was fighting, and he was knocked down with his coat off - I did not see what became of his coat, nor who was holding it - I did not see the man with the patch on his eye with one - nor see him take any part in the fight - it was dark - all the parties were Irish, I believe.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I went to King's Head-court, on this night, hearing of a disturbance there - I got there a little after twelve o'clock - I saw Welch lying on his back, and his head between the prisoner's legs - I pulled the prisoner off the deceased, and in consequence of the Irish rows which there are in Gray's Inn-lane so frequently, I let the prisoner go without taking any notice - he went out of the court - I heard Welch was dead, three or four minutes after I turned the prisoner out of the court, and immediately turned round, and found him coming down the court, and took him in custody to the station-house - he said there that they had had some words, and that was the cause of the fight - the prisoner's mouth was covered with blood, and his nose with dirt - I went for Dr. Whittell, the surgeon, who came along with me to the house where the deceased lay - that was about a quarter of an hour after I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see Welch distinctly? A. No, I did not; because there was a crowd of sixty or seventy people at the time we came up - I did not see him distinctly till I saw him in his own room - I saw him lying on his back, but not to tell whether he was dead - I did not see him fighting - he had his coat off; the prisoner had marks of violence, as if he had been injured.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was called in on this occasion about a quarter past twelve o'clock - I found the deceased in a first-floor room, in King's Head-court - he was extended on the ground on his back - I examined him, and found he was dead - I opened the body the following day about one o'clock in the afternoon - the whole of the organs except the brain were remarkably healthy - there was a rupture of vessels in several parts of the brain, but more especially in those vessels corresponding with marks of violence in the scalp - there were three marks on the scalp - I think very probably one was inflicted by the fist, but the other two appeared to be done by something pointed - it was not so obtuse - his head might have come in contact with something which projected on the pavement, or against the wall - I think it was something more pointed than the fist, but I do not mean to say it was any instrument - I think it was more probably occasioned by the fall.</p>
               <p>Q. What in your opinion was the cause of his death? A. Injuries inflicted on the skull - those injuries were quite sufficient to cause death - I saw no other injuries which could have caused death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do I understand you to say some vessels about the brain were ruptured? A. Yes, several - I should not say, that could be caused by the excitement in fighting - concussion might have done it, certainly, but not any exertion of his own - if he struck the other man with immense power, it would be similar to concussion on the ground - he was remarkably healthy, but certainly not a strong muscular man - I said at the inquest that I found the whole organs in a healthy condition - in point of constitution, I might have said that the deceased was a remarkably strong man, but not alluding to muscular power.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the woman was speaking to the prisoner, was there not a fight going on in the court? A.

               <p>Q. Was that deficiency in the parcel reserved for your own use, or in the parcel that you had packed up? - A. The deficiency was in those that were put back again, and the same with the patent silk; there were twelve pair in paper.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of the patent had he agreed for? - A. He had not agreed for any,</p>
               <p>Q. What was the quantity he had fixed upon for packing up? - A. He took out what he liked and laid them in a heap; when my back was turned to show him some others, he must have taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. But there was that deficiency? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see those stockings again? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't understand you with respect to the white and patent silk stockings, there was a dozen of each; did he direct you to pack the whole dozen? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with those that he did not order? - A. I made up the paper myself, and put it aside.</p>
               <p>Q. This paper you did not examine till two days after he had left the shop? - A. No; not till the third day.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of those things? - A. Between three and four pounds.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. In the first place, are you quite sure he is the man? - A. I am very sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. He ordered you to pack up some stockings? - A. He ordered me to pack up the silk carefully by themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many pair you packed up? - A. I really don't know; I know the whole amount of the stock that he looked out was 18l. odd.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the only ground for your supposing he took those things is, that three days after, when you came to calculate your stock, there were five deficient? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted your shop was not shut up those three days? - A. No; certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. And those things have never been found since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the parcels that you put back appear to you to be in the same state the third day, as when you put them back? - A. They were; I am sure they never had been opened.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am son of the last witness; I was in the shop at the time the prisoner was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him the time that he first called? - A. Yes; I was there the whole of the time, though not behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him the second time? - A. No; he only called once.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes, he did? - A. Yes; I believe he called on the Thursday morning first, and on the Friday morning the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. However you saw him both times? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the quantity of stockings that was shown him? - A. Yes; I am confident there were twelve pair in each bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the bundles upon their being taken down, when you suspected some had been stolen? - A. My father did in my presence; there were three pair deficient in one bundle, and two pair in the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in the habit of serving in the shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the interval of the time between his coming and choosing the stockings, and your examining them afterwards, had you taken down those bundles? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Has your father any other servant that serves in the shop? - A. He has not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You were in the shop the first time that he came? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220062"></xptr>Q. Your's is a shop of very good custom, I believe, and a great many people coming in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It happens in the hurry of business, when customers come into your shop, that you pull down a great many bundles in your anxiety to serve your customers? - A. It might have happened so, but these things I am positive were not taken down.</p>
               <p>Q. But in the hurry of business you or your father might have done it? - A. I must have recollected it, if it had been so.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are certain you took down in that interval neither of those bundles? - A. I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To the Prosecutor.) In the internal between your showing him these stockings and examining the bundles, had you shewn them to any body? - A. I am sure I never had, for they were patterns I intended to return, the patterns not being agreeable to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. Is there any other servant in your shop? - A. There is a shop-woman attends occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. You have left somebody there, I take it for granted, to take care of your shop? - A. Yes; Mrs. Clark.</p>
               <p>Q. She serves occasionally? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, in the defence that I meant to have set up, I intended to prove an alibi, but was advised to the contrary; if I had not, I should have been able to proved myself to be near 100 miles off at the time, at Bury St. Edmund's; but it would have been a very great expence to have subpoened witnesses so far to give evidence; I think it is not necessary for me to trouble your Lordship long, and therefore shall say but very little; that I am innocent of the charge is all the defence I can make; it is not very likely that twelve gentlemen-remember, gentlemen, my life is at stake-it is not likely that twelve gentlemen, as honest men, would take away my like in such a case as this; a shop that is open to all comers and goers; the prosecutor said, three days afterwards he examined the parcels; is it possible, that upon such evidence my life is to be taken away? I shall trouble you no longer, gentlemen, you will remember my life is at stake.</p>

            . Q. Did you lose any hay any time - A. I lost a great deal several times; the hay was in a field; I lost so much that I set a watchman to guard it. I watched the fore part of the night, and then I went home to bed; at half past one in the night I was called up by the man that was watching; I went to the field, and found the two men in custody.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was employed by Mr. Smith to watch the meadows. About half past one in the morning, I saw two men come into the field, and take a large cock of hay, and put into the barge: there were three men, I only saw two active. The short prisoner steered the boat, and the other was steering; there was only hay in their boat; there was no hay in the other boat. We weighed the hay, it weighed eighty-five pounds. I saw them put it in the boat quite plain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bridger, a miller, and live at Stanley-bridge, Fulham, in the parish of Fulham. On Tuesday night, the 26th of October, I went to bed about half-past ten o'clock—I fastened the house up myself—I had been to bed about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, when I heard a noise at the front door—I got out of bed, looked out of window, and stood at the window nearly a minute, when I saw two men come out of my door—one was the prisoner—I cannot say who the other man was—Weller had something under his arm, but whether</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184110250101"></xptr>
               <p>it was any thing more than his umbrella, or not, I cannot say—I knew Weller before—it was moonlight, and there was a gas-light in front of the house—I did not observe whether the other man had any thing—they went across the road where the gas-light was, in the direction for the Bull-alley, which is a little distance from my house—I then left my window and ran down stairs as fast as I possibly could—when I came to my door they were returning from the Bull-alley, and they came straight into my house, and called for a pint of beer—I had then missed all the things stated, off the horse, by the tap-room fire—I had been washing, and hung them up after I had fastened my house up—I drew them a pint of beer, and they had twopenny worth of bread and cheese—I afterwards brought them another pint of beer, in the meanwhile my husband was searching for a policeman, and the things—a policeman came, and we then gave them into custody—my things were brought to me a little before eight next morning—the house had been entered by the front door, which fastens with a spring-lock—with a hard force the spring would fly open.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you bolt the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was only fastened by the spring-lock—I fastened the door which goes from the tap-room to the shop, but that is not the front door—I had a lodger, but he comes in at another door at the back of the house, with a key which I give him out of the window—Weller lives about half a mile from me—I had not gone to sleep—I looked down upon the men—Weller had a hat on—I am positive of his person—I know Thomas M'Carthy, who keeps a public-house a little way from my-place—I told him I could not swear to the other man, because I did not know him, only by his dress—I have never said I could not swear to either of them—I know Weller veil—I never said I could not swear to him—I have said I could not swear to the men, but not that I could not wear to either of them—I am quite sure of that—I did not tell M'Carthy that I could not swear to the men—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a person named</hi> Pitts)—I only know that person by sight—I may have said to him that I could not swear to the men, nor more I could to the men, only to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after you had seen the men from the window, did the pri<lb></lb>soner and the other man come into your house and have some beer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say not three minutes—there was a light in the tap, which I had left on the table—the shutters were shut, but the door was open when they came in to drink, and they could see the light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you known Weller? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have known him personally about there for two years—he is a cow-keeper, and occu<lb></lb>pies a house—he is a man I never heard a bad character of—he had a hat and coat on, and the other one a cap and flannel jacket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were above the man, and he had his hat on, how could you see his face enough to be sure of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not, till he got on the other side against the light of the gas—I was certainly frightened when I found there was some one inside the house—I threw up the window to look out, and the men were just under me—they were in the house when I threw it up—it opens without the least noise—I received my things from Purdy, and gave them to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I felt work at half-past six o'clock next morning, and as I went home, down Bull-alley, I saw a bundle under a hedge, about 150 yards from the prosecutor's house—I took it home, told my neighbours what I had found, and afterwards gave it to Mrs. Bridger.</p>

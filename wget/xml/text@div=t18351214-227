I was called to see the shilling—the prisoner said she got it from her mother, who lived in Mar sham-street—I said I was rather doubtful of it, by her coming past so many places to my place; but if she told the truth I would forgive her—I took her to Mar sham-street—she then said she did not live there, but over the water, and that she got it of a gentleman in the house—I delivered the shilling to the policeman, in the station-house.</p>

               <p>Was that the prisoner? - To the best of my recollection, and to the best of my belief he is, I will not swear positively that he is the man, the man was committed; the prisoner took us to a man that lived in Carnaby-street, one Crook, where he had sold it at a penny a pound.</p>
               <p>Mr. James, Prisoner's Council. Then the prisoner went voluntarily and shewed you where the grate was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to observe, Sir, whether the prisoner was intoxicated or not? - He did not appear to be much intoxicated, there was a sort of stupidity about him; it was an old grate, and had been mended.</p>
               <p>Court. Describe the situation of this grate? - There is a plate under the grate, it is under the street.</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. Do you know who was at the expence of putting this grate there? - A person that belonged to the Duke of Queensborough.</p>

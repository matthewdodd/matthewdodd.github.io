                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Lowther, of Tottenham Court-road. About half-past one o'clock, on the 1st of October, the prisoner and another girl came and offered this shawl in pledge—I could not swear which offered it, but I believe it was the prisoner—the witness came, in a very violent manner, and said, "That is mine"—I gave it him—he said, "Send out for an officer"—I said I had nothing more to do with it, and he said he would take them himself.</p>

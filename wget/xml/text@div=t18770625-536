                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Woudhuysen—on 4th June, about 4.30 p.m., I was on the Holborn Viaduct, entering Messrs. Meeking's shop, and felt a tug at my watch chain—I looked down and saw a watch and chain in the prisoner's hand—I had not noticed him before—he said "I beg your pardon"—I immediately took hold of him and said "You have got my watch"—I saw him give it to another man, who ran away—the prisoner tried to get away, but I called a constable and gave him in charge—he struggled, but not very violently; I held tight on to him—I have not recovered my watch; it was worth 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On 4th June, about 4.30, the prosecutrix called me; she was holding the prisoner by Meeking's shop, and gave him in custody for stealing her watch—on the road to the station he threw something away—I spoke to another constable, who went to the place and found an old silver verge watch—the prisoner said that he did not throw that away; he threw away the bowl of a pipe—he was asked why, and said that it looked bad for the dirty bowl of a pipe to be found in his possession.</p>

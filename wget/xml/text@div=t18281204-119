               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you never say the person threw the bundle away instartly and another man picked it up? A. Yes; I never said he had a blue dress and a yellow neck-handkerchief, to the prisoner's father, nor to any body.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You saw him carring the bundle, and when he was pursued, he threw it away? A.No, before he was pursued - when he had run forty or fifty yards; a stranger picked it up, and I got it afterwards.</p>

            . I am a clock-maker. I was in the Commercial-road on Friday evening, the 21st of November, about a quarter to nine o'clock - it was a bright moon-light night; I perceived a scuffle - two or three prostitutes were standing about, and some persons hustling; I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw a man run with a bundle; I immediately pursued him, and came very close to him, when he threw the bundle away - I still pursued him across the field; he jumped on a bank, and I got on the bank at the same time - he jumped over and I also; he turned round, and struck me in the face; I made a snatch at him, and I stooped down and laid hold of him - it was the prisoner; he ask what business it was of mine; I took him back, and found Arment crying and inquiring for his bundle of clothes - I took the prisoner to the spot where I had seen him throw the bundle down - it was taken up and given to Arment; I gave the prisoner in charge, and am certain he is the man who threw the bundle away - I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you brought him up, did the prosecutor say he was the person who took the bundle? A. I cannot say, there was so much confusion - I do not recollect his saying so.</p>

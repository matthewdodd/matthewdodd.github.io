            . I live in Golden-lane, Barbican. Late in July, or early in August, I was in the prisoner's room when Medcraft's daughter came down, and asked for two flat-irons - Mrs. Day said she would send them up presently; Mrs. Medcraft came down herself then and said,"Mrs. Day, if you have not the irons, send up the duplicates;" she knew they were pawned, in fact, she actually redeemed them for her own use; I know there was a great intimacy between them all, and on Christmas day, I heard her ask for the poker to raise up the hatchway; Mrs. Day said, "No, you will break it;" Medcraft made answer, "D-n the poker, I forgot that you had not got it."</p>
               <p>SARAH MEDCRAFT. This woman swears false; she is the prisoner's sister; I was never in her company, and I said nothing at all about the poker.</p>
               <p>HENRY BUCK. I am the husband of Sarah Buck. I know that Mrs. Medcraft gave the prisoner leave to pawn, or make use of every thing in the place; she has often been in the room, seen the things were gone, and made no complaints about it; she has employed both the prisoner and myself to pawn things.</p>
               <p>S. MEDCRAFT. It is all false, I declare.</p>

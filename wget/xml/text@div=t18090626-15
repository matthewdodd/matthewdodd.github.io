               <p>Q. Did you miss any books from your shop, and when - A. On the 12th of May, a book called Walton's Angler; that is the only book that I missed till I went to the pawnbroker's, then I found five others.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had that book been kept - A. It was on the counter in the shop for sale among others; I had seen it three days previous; I gave fifty shillings for the book; I do not mean to say that is the value; I saw the prisoner in my shop on the same day, and on the 19th there were nobody there but him and my mother; the moment I came in he went out. On the 22nd of May, two persons called on me late in the evening and gave me some information; in the morning of the 23rd I went to Mr. Gordon's, the pawnbroker in St. Martin's-lane; he shewed me Walton's angler and others; I knew them when I saw them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Pray Mr. Foster have you any partner in your shop - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who attends your shop when you are not there - A. Sometimes my mother; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Whoever took them books from your shop if they were not sold might not they take them at separate times - A. I cannot answer that they were all taken at one time; I have often been robbed.</p>

            ? - Yes. I have known him near six months; he is a coachman. I live at Lambeth; he brought the pig to me and desired I would take care of it till I saw him again, that he was going to drive a job for a gentleman at Peckham.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you how he came by the pig? - He said he bought it of a person on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050029"></xptr>road, and gave five shillings for it; the gentleman came to my house, I happened to be at home; he saw the pig the prisoner brought to me.</p>

               <p>You have known the prisoner six months? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He always bore a good character? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He told you he bought it on the road, and gave five shillings for it; do you know any thing, after the pig was discovered, of his going down to clear himself voluntarily? - Yes; when the constable came, I would have gone with him to the gentleman's house; he would not go. He said we could not oblige him to go to that gentleman's; they laid a scheme for him to go down for hay for Mr. Jacques, and another man to go with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Who refused to go with you to the prisoner's house? - The constable said I could not oblige him to go there.</p>
               <p>What constable? - Mr. Presgrove.</p>
               <p>To Presgrove. On what account did you refuse to go to the prisoner's? - Mr. Jacques said he was doing a job at Peckham for a coachman that was ill, that if I took him away in a disagreeable manner he might lose a job, and disoblige the gentleman; and begged I would not go to him; that he would contrive to send him down for some hay with another man on the Monday, and then we might stop him.</p>
               <p>Did you know yourself of the pig being missing? - Yes; I saw it the day before.</p>

               <p>I met a man with two pigs. I asked him what he would have for one of them? He said five shillings; I bought it of him. I took it to a publick-house and shewed it to several people, and asked if I was taken in; they said no; but it was as much as it was worth. I took it to Lambeth; when they told me the pig was taken away I went voluntarily to Mr. Henderson.</p>
               <p>Sleath. He asked me to go with him on the Sunday to Mr. Henderson's.</p>
               <p>To Presgrove. I believe you found the pig in a publick-house? - No.</p>
               <p>You enquired at the publick-house, and heard the pig had been left there? - No. The gardener enquired at the publick-house.</p>

               <p>Did you see any thing of the prisoner's bringing a pig to Mr. Jacques' yard? - I did not see the pig, but I heard it squeaking in the bag, when Sleath took it home.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? I lived with Mr. Jacques ten years. I knew him directly after he came to Mr. Godwin's; Mr. Henderby's coachman being ill I recommended him to drive for him.</p>
               <p>Where did you hear the pig squeak? - At a publick-house on Addle-hill; I was up stairs, I did not see it.</p>
               <p>To Sleath. You told me the prisoner brought the pig to your house? - To my stable.</p>
               <p>Where is the stable? - Upon Addle-hill, the Bell-yard; I took it from the stable to Lambeth, which is about two miles. I took it on the Friday night at eleven o'clock; Presgrove found it on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Where was it all day on Friday? - In my stable; I turned it out of the sack; they said it had continued in the sack some time.</p>
               <p>When was it brought to the stable-yard? I do not know; the prisoner told me of it on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050030"></xptr>Friday morning, I believe, between eight and nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did you take the pig then? - No, he brought it to me.</p>
               <p>Where from? - I believe from Jacques's yard, but do not know.</p>
               <p>How long did he say he had had it, and what account did he give you of it? - He did not give me any account how long he had it; he desired me to take care of the pig which he had bought, while he went into the country.</p>
               <p>When did he say he bought it, and of whom? - He said he met two men on the road with a couple of pigs, or one man, I cannot say which, who were driving the pigs along, and he asked if they would sell one of them; they said yes. He asked the price; they said five shillings. He said he would have his choice.</p>
               <p>Did he say that before there was any enquiry made about it? - No.</p>
               <p>What did he say when he brought it? - He said he had got a pig, and desired me to take care of it till he returned out of the country; that he had bought it and given five shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you what he intended to do with it afterwards? - No.</p>
               <p>Is he a housekeeper or got a family? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he say what he intended to do with it? - When he lodged at my house about two months before, I desired him to buy a pig for me if he could meet with it.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing said that you was to have this pig? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you say nothing to him about it that you should like to have it? - No, nor did he say I should have it or should not.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing said about your having it? - No, nothing at all.</p>
               <p>How came he to get a pig for you, had not you as good an opportunity to get a pig yourself? - No, I was a gentleman's servant, and he was out of place. I asked him if it lay in his way to get me a pig.</p>
               <p>What price did you tell him to give for it? - I did not tell him any price.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him what sort of a pig you wanted? - Yes, a small pig.</p>
               <p>This was about the size you wanted? - It was.</p>
               <p>How came you then not to say any thing about having it when he brought it? - I did not care whether I had it or not, therefore I did not say any thing to him about it.</p>
               <p>How old was it, was it two or three months? - Yes.</p>

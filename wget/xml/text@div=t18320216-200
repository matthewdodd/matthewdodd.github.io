            . I am errand-boy to Mr. Hawkings. I took a letter from my master, on the 13th of January, to Mr. Jones' factory; I delivered it to Mr. Henshaw, and waited outside the counting-house for an answer - I saw a coachman speaking to Mr. Henshaw, and a man came in behind the coachman - he took a coat off a nail against the wall, and went out - I told Mr. Henshaw, who went out with me; we found the prisoner with the coat in a green bag - he was taken back, and I went for an officer.</p>

About half-past four o'clock on the evening in question, the prisoner was given into my charge; as I was taking him to the station he said he did not take the coat, but it was given him by a coachman, whom he knew by sight, but he did not know his name, nor where he lived.</p>

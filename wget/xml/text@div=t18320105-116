On the 17th of December the prisoner came about a quarter-past five o'clock in the evening (he had called several times before for relief); he brought a letter, which I took up stairs to my master, leaving him in the hall; my master desired me to take the note down again, saying he was to take it to Baron Ompteda; the prisoner urged me to take it up again to my master, which I did; I came down again in a minute, and heard the door slammed too; I came down and looked out, but the prisoner was not in the street; I then looked into the parlour, but did not miss any thing; my master came down, and we missed a time-piece off the mantel-piece, and a blue cloth cloak from the hall; I had seen them safe when I opened the door to the prisoner - he had been there on the Saturday before, and my master gave him five shillings.</p>
               <p>REV. WILLIAM KUEPER. I recollect the servant bringing me the note addressed to the Baron Ompteda, and the prisoner requested me to deliver it to him - he had been with me the day before; I told him if he would bring me a line from any respectable person, I would attend to it, instead of which he came in the morning while I was attending duty as Chaplian of the King's German Chapel; I was angry with him for coming at that time; he came again in the evening, and brought this letter, which I sent down again - the servant brought it up again, and I took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not tell me to bring you some certificates? A. Yes - I understand he has been a corporal in the army - he says he is a Hanovarian.</p>

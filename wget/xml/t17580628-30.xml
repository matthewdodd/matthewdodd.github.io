               <p>Q. When were they taken?</p>
               <p>Ing. They were begun to be taken in January last, and ended in the month of March, I believe. The prisoner lodged and boarded with us<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280031"></xptr> about three years; but I never had a shilling for his lodging and board.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live when he lodged with you?</p>
               <p>Ing. Then I lived in Craven-buildings in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against him now?</p>
               <p>Ing. He came and asked it as a peculiar favour, that my husband would indulge him, two or three nights in January last, to let him lie at our lodgings in Clare-Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your husband then?</p>
               <p>Ing. He was then in the King's-Bench prison; there we let him lodge, and there were all these goods mentioned; but he took the liberty of staying longer, for he was there three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you beds in your lodgings ?</p>
               <p>Ing. I had several; he came over to me, and desired me to be careful about my lodgings. I had no good opinion of him. I went over the 21st or 22d of May, in order to look over my goods; I unlocked a cabinet, and found the bolts had been forced, and it had been opened without unlocking; out of that I missed a Dresden waistcoat, a silver snuff box, one Holland shirt, one worked apron, and I believe a handkerchief or two.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these things you mention before?</p>
               <p>Ing. I saw them the last time I had looked in it, which was about two months before?</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body lie in that lodging besides the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Ing. Yes, my son lay there on nights, but was not there on days all the time the prisoner did; he used to come to me at about eight o'clock most mornings, and to go there by ten at night. I missed a quantity of pewter, a tea-kettle, some china cups and saucers, and a clock without a case, out of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I acknowledge I took many things and pawned for their use.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How is your husband supported in prison?</p>
               <p>Ing. By his own fortune: he has got an estate in the city of pretty near 200 l. per year.</p>
               <p>Q. What does he lay in prison for?</p>
               <p>Ing. There are only two actions against him, one for 27 l. the other for 12 l.</p>

               <p>Ing. He did; he was taken there by the prisoner, and my son admitted him?</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner frequently used to come over to you and your husband?</p>
               <p>Ing. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not employed by your husband to look out for a coffee-house for him ?</p>
               <p>Ing. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never employ him to pawn some of your things ?</p>
               <p>Ing. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never employ your son to pawn things for you?</p>
               <p>Ing. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never receive money of either of them for things that were pawned?</p>
               <p>Ing. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your son sending the prisoner to pawn things ?</p>
               <p>Ing. My son has told me he has given him some trifling things to carry out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you imagine had the money?</p>
               <p>Ing. I imagine the prisoner has had part, and my son a part.</p>
               <p>Q. From January to March, had you not been over at their lodgings ?</p>
               <p>Ing. I have two or three times; but did not open a drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your son tell you these things were going, before they were all gone?</p>
               <p>Ing. I cannot say he told me of it till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you arrest the prisoner for a debt?</p>
               <p>Ing. I did, it was a debt of 6 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he carried to prison?</p>
               <p>Ing. He went to the Marshalsea for it; but we dropped that.</p>
               <p>John Williams. I lay at the lodgings every night, but was frequently out every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there all the time the prisoner was in the house ?</p>
               <p>Williams. I was; I was in some distress, and he persuaded me to send a few of the things; I sent him with seven small pictures, my own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280032"></xptr> cloaths, and a gold mourning ring, the whole were pawned for about 30 s. he took the other things I have mentioned, but Bentley took my cloaths out. He desired me to write a letter to Bentley, about two months ago, in which he was to send him a blue book, in which were all the accounts; which I find was to lay it to me, as if I knew of the whole of the things he had taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write it as he desired?</p>
               <p>Williams. I did in these words for the book wherein were the account of all the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you know of any goods being pawned by the prisoner at the bar, except what you have mentioned of pictures, your own cloaths, a ring, and trifling things to the amount of 30 s.</p>
               <p>Williams. I do not. Here is a letter of his hand-writing, that he sent to my father-in-law in prison. I know it to be his hand-writing: I desire it may be read.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there a blue book in Mr. Bentley's hands?</p>
               <p>Williams. There was; it had blue leaves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you know of the china and tea-kettle being taken away?</p>
               <p>Williams. No, I never missed them; being frequently over the water.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at Mr. Fielding's on Mr. Hambleton's examination?</p>
               <p>Williams. I was at his last examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you there?</p>
               <p>Williams. He told me he had delivered things to him to pawn, and I had received the money for our use.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280033"></xptr>Q. from prisoner. Whether you did not come over in the morning, and say your mother wanted some money, and delivered the pictures to me to pawn for money for your mother?</p>
               <p>Williams. It was not for my mother, neither did I say so. I wanted the money to pay for some things that were in Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. What things ?</p>
               <p>Williams. They were some spoons that were left there at an inn. There was some money to have been paid; it was three or four shillings short.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether he did not send Bentley out with some spoons to pawn for him ?</p>
               <p>Williams. There were some salt spoons I believe I did send him with, but am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no other thing that you can recollect, that you sent the prisoner and Bentley to pawn?</p>
               <p>Williams. No.</p>

            . I was housekeeper to Mr. Innes, an attorney, in Gravel-lane, Southwark. The prisoner's wife came to me when I lived there, and said Nanny here is poor Hambleton: I said I thought he had been at sea. I went out after her, and heard her say to him, my dear, I want a pair of shoes; he said, my dear, what can I do? if I take any thing more out of the drawers, they will be missed. I went to Mrs. Ing, and told her what I had heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mrs. Ing and you acquainted before?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. No. She was quite a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know where to find her?</p>
               <p>Wilkinson. I went to her lodgings in Faulcon-court. I had never seen her but once before.</p>

            . I live in Drury-lane, and am a pawnbroker; the prisoner at the bar brought several things and pledged at my house, at several times, from the 11th of February, to the 25th of March; five gowns, a sack, four petticoats, a shift, a pair of ruffles, and a pair of plated buckles. The whole were pawned for about 39 s. 6 d. I questioned him very closely; he said they were all his own wife's wearing apparel. Mrs. Ing saw them before the justice, and there swore to them.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did he pawn them in?</p>

                  </hi>. My niece gave me the shilling; I found it was bad; I broke it with my teeth—I said to the prisoner "This is a bad shilling," and showed him the pieces—he said he was very sorry it should fall on a working-man, he had got change for a sovereign on Friday night in Fetter Lane—I gave him one part of the shilling and retained the other; he threw several pieces of silver on the counter, and asked if there was any more bad among that—I just looked at them, and said "I do not think so;" he paid with a good shilling and left—I followed him and saw him enter the Grapes, about 200 or 300 yards off—I went in at a different door; I spoke to the landlord, Mr. Daniels, and showed him the broken shilling—I heard Mr. Daniels say "This is a bad one"—I went round to the compartment where the prisoner was, and said "Another one"—he said "What do you mean?"—I said "You tried one with me, and now you have come to try one on with a friend of mine"—he made no reply; a constable was sent for and I gave him the broken piece.</p>

I keep the Grapes in Thomas Street, Horsely<lb></lb>down—on Saturday evening, 16th November, I saw the prisoner come in—Mr. Battle afterwards came into another compartment, and looked at me, and held up part of a shilling—the prisoner called for 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of rum; my barmaid served him; he put down a shilling quietly, I picked it up, and</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a boot and shoemaker, in Holborn, I know both the prisoners very well; about eight or nine months ago, the prisoner, Parkes, came to me, I lived then in Fetter-lane; he came and bought goods of me, which I never got paid for.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Brown for the first time? - A. On the 13th of last June; Brown came to my shop, in Holborn, about eight or nine o'clock, and told me he wanted some boots and shoes; that he was going to the West-Indies.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Holborn? - A. Opposite Brook-street; he said, in all probability, before he should wear them out, he should be shot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you his name? - A. Yes; I took it down in writing, "Captain Brown;" he looked out two pair of long boots, one pair of military boots, and one pair of short boots, and eight pair of shoes, and a dozen of strings; the shoes and boots came to 61.8s. I gave him the strings, and lent him a handkerchief to wrap them up in; when he had looked them out, he said, if I would send my boy a little way with him, he would return the money; but before he set off, he asked me if I would take measure of him for two or three pair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140005"></xptr>of boots, which I did; I thought it not proper to send the boy, I went myself; I asked him first what sort of tops the boots should have, he said yellow; I told him I had the pleasure of making up some boots for some gentlemen in the West-Indies, belonging to the 17th regiment, and they were lined with yellow; and he then said he belonged to the same regiment; I asked him if he knew captain Dixon and major Raw; he said, O dear, yes, I know them very well, they are my companions; I said, how is it that you are not gone with them; he said he had been under orders with them in Ireland, and was then going over to them; going across the fields he talked more of captain Dixon, and he said his brother was agent to the 17th regiment; that if I could once get into his brother's company, whom he expected where he was going, he would buy a hundred pounds worth of shoes and boots of me; he said he had been drinking all night at the City Arms, and if I would go in there and take some ale in the gardens we should see his brother there; we went down into the gardens and sat down upon a bench about five minutes, and the brother never came; and then he told me of his brother marrying a lady with a large fortune; after sitting there some time he got up and went into the house, and came back again and he sat down again, and told me his brother had been very lucky indeed to marry a woman with 15,000l. and he had been enabled to put it into Down and Thornton's hands; he said his brother was very much of a gentleman, and he wished he would come, for he would lay out 100l. with me as soon as not; upon his brother's not coming he appeared disappointed, and said I am very sorry I cannot pay you in gold, I must give you one of my brother's drafts; he said he had been in the house to get change, and could not get change; I looked at it, and said, what is this upon the money that is at Down and Thornton's, and he said, yes; that his brother and him always paid every thing in that way if they laid out 100l. that there was the money on demand; he said, Mr. Hulls, I am very sorry I have not the balance to give you, but if you will call upon me at Mr. Drummonds, at No. 10, Hart-street, Bloomsbury, at three o'clock, I will give you the balance; this was about eleven o'clock; he gave me the draft for five guineas; he told me I should meet his brother and him and three or four gentlemen at his house in Hart-street, and that I should have an order to make as many boots as I could possibly make between that time and the time of failing; this was at the City Arms, and he gave me the draft, and I took the boots up to the house, and then I went up to Down and Thornton's.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe, in fact, the draft was not honoured? - A. No; they told me it was a forgery, (produces the draft.)</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards did you go to Hart-street? - A. Yes; but before I went there I went to the Lord Mayor's for an officer to stop the goods; but before I got back the goods were taken away; then I went to Hart-street, at three o'clock, with a gentleman who lodges with me, to No. 10, and that was quite a different name, I think Johnson, but it was not Drummond, nor any such name.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor Brown? - A. No; I then went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw captain Brown after till you saw him in custody? - A. No; by tracing him out I found he was at a house in Fan-street, buying watches, but I did not see him there; it was about three or four days after that I saw him at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. It was several months from the time you had seen the prisoner Parkes and the time you saw the person that you say was the prisoner Brown? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw Brown before nor since, except the time you had seen him at the Mansion-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. From a variety of customers that you may have, do you mean to swear positively to the person of Brown? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bill indorsed at the time the prisoner offered it to you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think it was the bill of his brother at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then though you understood this was a promissory note of his brother's, you did not ask him to indorse it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you any doubt about his person? - A. Not the least; I could tell him from five thousand.</p>

            , of Ruighton, in Salop? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Have there been any notes of that kind made payable at your house in your time? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that note presented at your house? - A. I have no doubt in the world of this being the note which Mr. Hulls presented; I was convinced it was a trick, and I refused to pay it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. I believe you know it is frequently the custom to make accommodation<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140006"></xptr> notes, and so on, payable where they have not cash? - A. Accommodation notes are very different things from this.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not sometimes the case that notes are made payable where there is not money to pay? - A. It is not regular; we have very frequently seen bills returned.</p>
               <p>Q. But does it not sometimes happen that bills are made payable at a place where there is not cash to answer the demand, and afterwards the money sent? - A. In bills of exchange it is so, bills are returned.</p>
               <p>Q. But is it not sometimes the custom with a good bill to be drawn upon a place where there is no cash to answer it? - A. I never heard of such a thing with a good bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not sometimes the course of trade? suppose, for instance, a man resides in the country, and now and then goes to town for the purpose of carrying on his transactions in the merropolis; is it not usual to draw money upon a house where there is not cash? - A. It is a kind of question I know not how to answer; a man often draws upon his correspondent, but he either has credit or cash in that house, or else it would be useless.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing, for instance, a man has no connection in London, does it not sometimes happen he will make his bill payable, for instance, at a coffee-house, where there is no cash? - A. Very often.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you generally find accommodation bills drawn upon demand and regularly printed? - A. No; accommodation bills on demand are nothing; this we should consider as a country Bank-note, (the draft read.)</p>

               <p>No. B. 248, Ruighton, Salop, April 20th, 1796, I promise to pay to bearer, on demand, at Messrs. Down, Thornton, and Co. bankers, London, the sum of five guineas, for value received, for Self and Co.</p>

               <p>Q. Well then, you mean to say there is no such person, according to your knowledge, of the name of Brown, at Ryton; can you undertake to say, that at neither of these places there is a man of that name? - A. I dwell upon the place where I live.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you undertake to speak no farther than that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are the other Rytons places of large trade, or villages? - A. All villages.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any manufactures carried on there that you know of? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of your Ryton? - A. It is spelt Ryton, the others are spelt Royton.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Brown? - A. Yes,(points to him): On the 14th of June last, captain Brown came to my house, and ordered two dozen of watches, and they were to be got ready for him the next day, when he was to call for them; about a quarter of an hour after, there came Mr. Hulls, and another gentleman, the prisoner was not there then; he came on the Thursday following, this was on the Tuesday, he was to come on the Wednesday;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140007"></xptr>nesday; he told me that he could not pay for all the order, and therefore he would only have half of it, and he had not got cash enough to pay for it, but I was to go with him to Islington; I then told him there was an order left for me to take him, that he must go with me to answer for what he had done, and I took him into custody, and delivered him at the Compter; I saw him again the next morning, Friday, nothing passed between us; I asked him if he knew any body in the Court, at the Mansion-house; he said, he did not know any body at all; he desired that I would say nothing but the truth, and I told him I would not, and he was ordered to be examined again on the Monday or Tuesday, I don't know which, I attended; when I came to examine my counting-house, where captain Brown and I had had a conversation, and where I took him, I found these papers, (producing them.)</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to call him captain Brown? - A. He told me he was captain Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. That was on the Thursday? - A. No, on the Tuesday he called himself captain Brown; the next time, I said, are you really a captain? and he said, yes, he was; he shewed me something, but I did not look at it; he said, it was his commission.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Saturday, in your counting-house, was it, where he and you had been talking; was that on the Thursday, or when? - A. On the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation on the Thursday? - A. Yes, a little; a conversation about the money.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time the prisoner and you talked together in the counting-house? - A. On the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you talked together on the Tuesday in the same counting-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Saturday after the Thursday you found these things? - A. Yes, (produces three five-guinea Ruighton, Salop, notes): they are drawn upon Drummond and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things found in the same place where you and captain Brown had been talking on the Thursday, and on the Tuesday? - A. Yes, under a vise-board.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. While you were talking to him, he might have an opportunity of thrusting them under the vise-board? - A. Yes, he might; my brother was there at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprehended him in that place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect from your memory-looked at one of them, tell us how they are signed? - A. Entered T. B. and signed M. Parkes.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the numbers of them? - A. 243, 244, and 246.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Shelton, be so good as read the number again of that which was produced before, (reads No. 248.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. It was on the Saturday you found these notes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your counting-house is open to every body who transacted business with you? - A. Yes; every one that comes to do business goes into the counting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Your brother was in the counting-house at the time the prisoner was there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your brother here to-day? - A. No, he is not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What is your brother's name? - A. John Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. When people come to your counting-house, your brother and you are pretty attentive? - A. He is very seldom there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then one or other of you must have continually had your eyes upon the prisoner? - A. I looked at him pretty well myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Brown? - A. Yes; I searched him at the Compter, and found this five-guinea note upon him, in his right-hand waistcoat pocket, No. 245; it corresponds with the other three notes, and this pocket-book I found in his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that drawn upon? - A. Mess. Drummond and Co. bankers, (it is read); the engraved part all agreed with the other notes. (Produces the pocket-book.</p>

               <p>Q. When was it you searched Brown? - A. The 16th day of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend Parkes? - A. Yes, upon the 21st. of June; I searched him, and found this pocket-book, and forty-one or forty-two five-guinea notes, I am not certain which, which I took out of his waistcoat-pocket; and, in his coat-pocket, I found this copy of the commitment of Brown to the Poultry Compter, which, I believe, I can swear to be in the hand-writing of Mr. Baldwyn.

            , signed to that note, and tell me if you believe that to be his hand-writing or not? - A. I believe it to be the hand-writing of Parkes; I took notice, at the Mansion-house, of the turn up of the B in Brown; but upon comparing it with many letters that I have received from him, I am convinced it is his hand-writing; and the body of the note is also his writing, and the figures.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. Twice you saw the prisoner write? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he write? - A. His name at one time, and the other time I looked over him while he was writing a letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear, from having seen him write his name twice, that that is his hand-writing? -</p>
               <p>Court. He has not said so; he has said, that his belief is formed also upon a comparison.</p>

               <p>Mr. Ally. A comparison is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. A comparison in his mind is evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. Can you take upon yourself to swear, from his having wrote his name once, and seeing him write at Marlborough-street, that this is his hand-writing? - A. My reason is, I got an answer from Parkes, upon a particular business, under the signature of A.B. all the B's in those letters, which were very frequently used, are turned up exactly in the same way, which it might not be proper to produce.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are undertaking now to swear, that it is the hand-writing of Parkes, not from having seen him write, but a comparison with some other writing? - A. I have seen him write, and have received letters from him, and notices of bail.</p>
               <p>Q. What I want to know is, whether you can swear the writing produced in evidence here, is the writing of Parkes, in consequence of comparing this writing with what you in fact saw him write; or whether, in consequence of comparing it with that which you did not see him write? - A. From having seen him write, I am confident the body of it is, and the figures; in his letter, where he says, I have written to you frequently to accept this bail, the B has always been the same.</p>
               <p>Parkes. (To Manning.) Q. In the first place, did you ever see me write? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where? - A. At the York Hotel.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, when you met me there, you asked my name? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You wrote it down? - A. No, you wrote it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you produce that writing? - A. I have it not by me.</p>
               <p>Q. No, nor never had. - Stand up, and see if you can look an honest man in the face. - Did you never know a furrier in the debtor's-side of Newgate, that formerly lived in Oxford-street? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never robbed any man of ten pounds under pretence of getting his liberty? -</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot ask that.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you know at the time you saw him write the letter at Marlborough-street, what the contents of that letter was? - A. I had him in custody, and it was to write to some friend of his to come to him.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Do you know the name of that friend? - A. No; I have had many letters from him, and he told me in the coach he had written to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. Q. Upon the oath you have taken, do you mean to say you know it was a letter to a friend to come, merely from the situation in which he was, or from what you saw in it? - A. He told me he was doing so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140009"></xptr>Q. Did you see him write, upon your oath, so as you could read the contents of it? - A. Yes; it was a small room; I paid more attention to the form of his hand, in order to know whether it corresponded with the letters I had received.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else present? - A. Yes; four or five persons who had him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you read every word? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, from what you saw alone, that he was writing to a friend? - A. No; I barely glanced at it, to see whether his hand corresponded with that of the letters I had received.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were close enough to observe the writing of the prisoner, this was not a very long note. I ask, could you or not observe, merely from your personal observation, what the contents were? - A. I might, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, after that, that you will now swear positively to the hand-writing of that man; you might have seen what he wrote, but did not? - A. I did not; I wanted to see whether it corresponded with a letter I had received the day before, which was very natural for the prosecution I was then engaged in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you, for that reason, pay attention to the nature and character of his handwriting at Marlborough-street? - A. Yes. (The papers found in Brown's pocket-book read)."Dear Brown, Mr. Ally will attend you to-morrow at the Mansion-house; keep your own counsel, and send your wife to me the moment you have been examined; I am fearful you will be committed for trial, but never fear, that will be all they can do; fail not sending your wife to me, that I may get your brief ready."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. (To Manning.) Q. Look at that paper, do you believe that to be Parkes's handwriting? - A. I am sure it is. (Reads another paper), Addressed, "Mr. Thomas Brown, New Compter."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. That is a superscription upon a cover: it contains a receipt, dated, London, May 10, 1796; - "Received, this day, of Mr. Thomas Brown, the sum of twenty-one pounds, for four five guinea bills, drawn by myself. I say received. Mr. Parkes, Ruighton, Salop."</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Look at the superscription on the cover, and tel me whose hand-writing that is? - A. It is Parkes's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am going now to prove the handwriting of some papers found in this pocket-book not his hand-writing, but referring to business with him.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that paper, and tell us if you believe that to be Brown's hand-writing? - A. I am sure it is not his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper? (Shewing him another.) - A. This corresponds with a letter that I received from Brown, written in the same style and hand that this is, and I then thought it came from another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it or not to be his hand-writing? - A. I am sure it is not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. Mr. Brown was a <rs id="t17960914-3-viclabel11" type="occupation">recruiting serjeant</rs>, was not he? - A. He was, under my command.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a very common thing for people in the army to take upon themselves a little more than they have a right to; and corporals, ensigns, and others, frequently call themselves captains? - A. Yes, surely; he was a recruiting officer in the regiment; I produced his attestation before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Was he an officer? - A. A non-commissioned officer; he was a serjeant of the Loyal British Rangers. It is a very common thing when they go into a country town for them to be called captain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him in the 17th regiment? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an engraver, in Chancery-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed by any body to engrave any plates? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at one of these notes; is that off the same plate that you engraved? - A. It is like it; but it is impossible for me to say it is. It is ever since March last.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the prisoners at the bar? - A. I cannot immediately say; I don't recollect the parties; I cannot swear to the men.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you believe about it? - A. I believe that some man came into the shop while I was busy, and ordered it to be done; it might be one of those men, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you any more reason for believing it to be one of those men than any other - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mrs. Brown? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never speak to Mrs. Brown? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140010"></xptr>Q. Look at it again, and tell me if you engraved it? - A. It is very like the one that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You never engraved but one plate for Ryton, Salop? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearance of that plate, and having never engraved but one, do you believe that to be your engraving? - A. I cannot possibly swear to it, because any man may make one like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any alterations made after the plate was engraved? - A. Yes; a dot upon the top of the i, and Self and Co. was put to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did the person come to you about that plate? - A. Two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you have no recollection of the person? - A. No; I am generally very busy, and have but one pair of hands; I have many counsel and attornies asking me questions, and I am so vexed that I frequently turn my back, and tell them to go to the stationers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make such an alteration upon a note dated Ryton, Salop, as Self and Company, before? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q. Is it usual for strangers to go and be-speak, and you execute, work, without knowing who? - A. Very frequently; the person was not in the shop above a minute either time; I was very busy finishing some work; I had some magnifying glasses before me at the time, and I did not look at him.</p>

               <p>Q. Who paid you the money? - A. I cannot say whether it was a man or a woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. (To Stokes.) Q. Whether it is a thing uncommon for persons alone concerned in business, who have no partners, to draw bills for Self and Co.? - A. I believe it is very frequent.</p>
               <p>Parkes's defence. I know nothing at all of the transaction; I cannot say more than my Counsel have said for me.</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. I know nothing at all of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ally. My Lord, I take it this is not a case of the description set forth in the indictment; that it is not in point of law the offence in the indictment; if it is any offence, it is an offence of a different nature; I am apprehensive this is an indictment; against the prisoners, stating, that they have falsely made, forged, and counterfeited, a certain instrument, which makes it a felony, without benefit of clergy; in the case I would take the common law definition of forgery to be the false making or altering a writing for the prejudice of another; so the statue of Geo. II. pursuing the common law definition, sets forth, that whosoever shall falsely make, forge, or counterfeit (then enumerating the different species of instruments in that statute). shall be guilty of felony without benefit of clergy; and I take it to be a fine qua non, without which the prosecutor cannot stir a single step, without which we cannot be called upon to defend a charge of forgery; they should prove the instrument to be a falsehood; then it follows for me to put a question, what in point of law is a false instrument? I take it a false instrument is that which appears upon the face of it to be the instrument of one whose instrument it ultimately turns out it is not, appearing to he signed by a person whose name it does not bear, or of some person who has not given his consent, or that a false instrument may be an instrument under a fictitious name; then it follows of course that if this is the definition of a false instrument, that if it falls out that the instrument produced in evidence is the signature of the man it bears, is the signature of him whose name it appears to have upon it, it cannot be a falsehood or a forgery.</p>
               <p>But it may be said, and I know in this case it will be said, that if the instrument itself is a true instrument, yet if the party uttering it accompanies it with false representations to defraud a tradesman, or any other person, it is a forgery.</p>
               <p>I have taken the liberty to lay down two propositions: first, that the instrument must be a false one; or, secondly, an instrument under a fictitious name, and that the evidence cannot convert it into a false one if it is not so. I refer your Lordship to the case of Aickles, reported in Mr. Leach's book, 345, and my Lord, in that case a question arose whether or not a person, who has for many years been known by a name not his own, and afterwards assumes his own name, and that for the purpose of a fraud, whether if his own name is assumed for the purpose of a fraud, it can be a forgery, they held beyond all question and doubt that it could not be a forgery; for that however false representations might make a man guilty of a cheat, they could not in contemplation of law make it felony. So say I, and sheltering myself under the authority of this case that argument cannot hold, because the decision of the Judges in this case establishes a contrary doctrine, and in this case a fortiori, for Aickles was a man of notorious turpitude, and it appeared that he had for a length of time passed by a name, for the purpose of fraud, that was not his own, then re-assumed his own name, and that is not a forgery; but if the prisoner makes use of his own name, because he was always known by the name in which he has drawn the bill, he therefore cannot be guilty of forgery; and in the case of Jones, Douglass 302, afterwards copied into Mr. Leach's book 187; in that case it was held upon a special verdict, argued before the Court of King's Bench, that a man cannot be guilty of forgery in making use of false representations; and in the case of King and Aickles, a man uttering a note in his own name, though he is not known by that name, and for the purpose of a fraud, is not a forgery,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140011"></xptr>and without the authority of these cases taking the common law definition, taking care always to guard the public against impositions; I take it, if there is any justice in the country, if there were no decisions in the books, there is sufficient authority to say, that a man under such circumstances cannot be guilty of forgery. Suppose a man to give a note, and suppose this man, however honest, is afterwards deprived of his property, and in consequence of his inability to discharge the obligation that the man to whom he gave that note, like another Shylock, perhaps insisting upon his discharging the obligation, though he takes heaven and earth, perhaps, to enable him to discharge it, shall it be permitted to that man to go the unfortunate debtor, and say, you have uttered a note for which, though it bears your own name, I will drag you before a court of judicature, because you made a false representation when you uttered that bill.</p>
               <p>Shall such doctrines as these be promulgated under the sacred fanction of your Lordship? I am sure they never will; and I am sure no Court will decide that false representations, under such circumstances, will make an individual guilty of forgery: then I apprehend from these cases, and also from a case determined by Mr. Justice Grose, at the last assizes for Surry, where a man was indicted for uttering a promissory note, and it turned out that the note was signed with his own name, and he represented that he came from a serjeant major in the regiment, when he did not, but the bill appeared to be signed in his own name; what said the learned Judge, Mr. Justice Grose, who tried that cause? Immediately, the very moment when it was proved that the signature was the signature of the man, that very moment he told the Jury they must of necessity acquit the accused, because it being signed by himself it could not be a forgery, it could not be deemed a false instrument; and it was first necessary to prove a false instrument, but turning out to be his own name it could not be a false instrument. So in this case taking it for granted that the name signed to this bill as proved by the last witness, Bartholomew, that the name of 
               <persName id="t17960914-3-person78">
                  Thomas

            , signed to that bill, is the name by which he has been known, I say he cannot be guilty of forgery, because the instrument not being a false instrument, not being the instrument of any other person than himself, not on the face of it appearing to be a false instrument of any other person, it cannot be a false instrument, and therefore cannot be a forgery.</p>

The other case I likewise agree to, because, at the time the party signed his name, he represented that he came from a serjeant major, when he did not, so that it is the party issuing his own note under a false representation.

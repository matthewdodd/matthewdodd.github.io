            . I am a Constable, I was sent for to the Queen's-Head in Whitecross-Street, where the Prisoner was stopped, and took her with me to Mrs. Blunt's, and she said that she had robbed her: she owned she took the pocket with half a guinea and six shillings in silver in it, (but she said there were ten shillings,) a new shift and six ells of cloth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She had hid these things from her husband, and gave me the keys to take them out to pledge, that he should not know of them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Garland. Did the Prisoner at that time say, that she pledged them with the privity of the Prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Garland. I did not hear any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Mary Hall. The Prisoner owned the taking the money and the things mentioned by the last witness, and a burdet gown.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutrix. The Prisoner says she took these things by your direction and privity, and that you ordered her to pawn them?</p>

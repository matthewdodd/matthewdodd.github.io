On the 29th of December the prisoner came in as a customer; we were all engaged - I was sorting a drawer of buttons; the prisoner came up to the drawer, and let a bundle fall from under his arm, into the drawer; in taking it up again, I saw him take out a gross of buttons; he then said it was very cold, and put his hand, with the buttons, into his coat pocket; a young man came and told me of it - I told him to inform Mr. Harrison, which he did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had he bought any thing? A. Not then; he did afterwards; the buttons are worth 1s. 4d.; he did not appear at all in liquor; I believe he is a very respectable man - I told him to come into the small room, and then charged him with it; he made no resistance.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HARRISON. I was in our parlour; a young man told me of this circumstance; I went out - one of our men served the prisoner with cloth to the amount of 11s.; he was taken into the parlour, and the buttons were found. I have inquired, and find he bore a most excellent character; he had frequently dealt at our shop - they were found in the cloth which he had bought, not in his pocket.</p>

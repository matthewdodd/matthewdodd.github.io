                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's hospital. On the night of the 6th of May, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the prosecutor was brought to the hospital with an incised wound in the cheek, about two inches long, completely through into the mouth—it appeared to have been inflicted by some sharp instrument, such a knife as this would do it, used with force—he lost a considerable quantity of blood from the wound, which might be dangerous considering his usual habits—the wound itself was not danger<lb></lb>ous, but I feared erysipel as from the excitement of the system.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 6, White Horse-court, Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell. The prisoner and Mrs. Dimmock have been quarrelling for these five months—the prosecutor never interfered between them until this night—they were <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> one another—the prisoner was down stairs, and Mrs. Dimmock was up stairs—something was shoved out of Dimmock's window, I do not know who by, or what it was; it was like a bit of brick, or some kind of dirt—the prisoner ran to the dust-hole, and gathered up whatever she could, and resented the blow back again—I then saw the prosecutor get up, and come down stairs in his shirt—he took the prisoner by the shoulder, shoved her about in the court, and shoved her against the wall—she then took the candle out of my room, which is just opposite hers, on the ground floor, and ran up stairs—the prosecutor followed her, and broke in her door—I went up, on hearing them kicking the door, and Mrs. Dimmock told me to come down, she did not want to hurt me—I said, "It is no use breaking the woman's door"—when the prisoner's door was broken, she opened her door, came out, and kicked a board off Dimmock's door—I had hold of the prosecutor all the time, outside, on the landing—he then went into his own room—Mrs. Dimmock was then in her own room—she was standing just at her own door—you can step out of one room into the other—they shut the</p>

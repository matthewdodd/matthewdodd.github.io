It is about 12 months since the prisoner was sent to Jamaica, and he has been returned about six weeks; my servant came up to me this day se'nnight in the morning, about eight o'clock, and told me my house was broke open; I came down and found the kitchen window broke open; there was a little place where I kept some brandy and wine, that had been pulled all about the parlour, and particularly an apple-pie which the young man at the bar was very fond of; I believe he had filled his belly, but the silver spoon in the pie was there safe; I immediately called my servants, and asked them if they had seen any thing of the prisoner he having served me so some time before; I said, I fancy it is my friend Glass come again; I being about going out of town, desired them to see if they could see him; accordingly one of them found him; he was brought to me; I said to him, how came you here again; he told me a gentleman had bought him in Jamaica, and that he lived with one Dr. Fisher in Cecil-street; I could not find such a gentleman; at last he confessed he lived with Dr. Fisher; I wrote the doctor a letter, he came to me; the prisoner told me the doctor had threatened to whip him for pissing his bed, and that was the occasion of his running away from him; he left the silver spoon and several things of value, he only took a handkerchief which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176809070049"></xptr> our people found upon him; I cannot tell where it was taken from.</p>

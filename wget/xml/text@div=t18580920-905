                  </hi>. I am a confectioner, of Rutland-street, Nine Elms. On 28th August, I was at the Rising Sun public-house, East Ham, about 2 o'clock—my cart was there—I had a shawl in my cart, on the box that I had been sitting on—I went into the public-house, leaving the shawl safe on the box—I was in the house about five minutes, and when I came out I missed the shawl—I had seen the prisoner there, and his cart standing close to mine—there were other carts standing some distance in the road—I followed the prisoner's cart; I came up with him about 100 yards off, there were two carts, his and his mate's—I went to the first man, and asked if he had seen a shawl—he said no, he had not seen anything of the kind—I then went to the prisoner, who pretended to be asleep, and I saw my shawl under the nosebag—I said, "You have got my shawl"—he said, "Does it belong to you?"—I said, "You know it does not belong to you"—I took it, and gave him into custody.</p>

PEARCE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this van you were driving for selling biscuits with which licensed victuallers are supplied? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there were a number of vehicles at the Rising Sun; there were some at the trough—I know they were the carters of Mr. Hill, the brickmaker at Ilford—I came up to the hinder cart first, and in the first cart I saw my shawl and the nosebag—I could only see a bit of the fringe of the shawl, he had a bag on the top of it; he was going towards Ilford—he gave me the shawl—he did not say that, not having met a policeman on the road, he was going to take it to the station, and give it up—I followed him a little way; we met a policeman, and he was given into custody—he was taken before the Magistrate, and let out on bail.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 381). I took the prisoner that afternoon—he said he picked up the shawl and put it in the cart, and was going to take it to the station to be left till called for.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know of his living with Mr. Hill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have known him about four years—I knew of his going back to his work, and Mr. Hill's foreman is his bail—I do not know anything against his character.</p>

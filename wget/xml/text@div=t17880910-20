             sworn.</p>
               <p>I lost a horse on the 21st of December, 1785.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to come so late with this prosecution? - Because I did not meet with the man before; my horse was lost from No. 64, London Wall, from my stable; the prisoner hired my horse to go to Croydon.</p>
               <p>What time of the day? - I believe it might be about nine or ten.</p>
               <p>You keep an inn there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He came into the yard there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you present? - I was.</p>
               <p>What did he ask for? - He wanted a horse to go to Croydon for the day; I let him have one; the horse never returned from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to let an entire stranger have your horse? - He gave me a very good information where he lived, his name and place of code, he gave his name James Smith, he lived at No. 1, Cable-street, Wellclose-square.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you what he was? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Did you ever make any enquiry for him there? - I did.</p>
               <p>When did he say he would be back? - At night.</p>
               <p>He did not come? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you make any enquiry at the place where he directed you? - I went to the shop, and the shopman said he did not know whether he was within or not, and I found they knew him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever get your horse again? - Never, I never saw the horse since; I never saw the prisoner, to know him, till he was taken up; they sent for me according to the advertisement.</p>

               <p>When was that? - It was some few days before the last sessions; I came here then about it.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake at this distance of time to swear positively that he is the same man? - I am very sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>How long might you talk with him in the yard? - Ten minutes perhaps; he came into the counting-house and wrote his name; I am very sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Did you know him as soon as you saw him again? - I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>He was shewn you by the officer? - No, he was taken up.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178809100017"></xptr>Was there any description of him that he was taken up by? - The man came and told me that he thought it was the man; he was taken up not on my business.</p>
               <p>Then he was shewn to you as the man that stole your horse? - He came out, I knew him directly.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him then, or ask him any qustions about it? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing? - No; only he said once he could prove he was not there at the time, at another time he said he could prove that he was there at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Counsel. Why this is a very long time ago? - It is so.</p>
               <p>Are you in partnership with Mr. Campion? - Yes these ten or a dozen years.</p>
               <p>Are you partners in the horse dealing line? - No, we do not deal, we are in the job way.</p>
               <p>How many livery horses may you have, thirty or forty? - More than that, they are gentlemen's horses.</p>
               <p>But riding horses; how many have you to let out? - two or three.</p>
               <p>This is pretty near three years at Christmas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

            , jun. sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in the counting-house at the same time; I took particular notice of the man, we always do of stranger; I suppose he was there about ten minutes while they were getting the horse ready; I am sure this is the same man.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to swear positively to the person of the man at two years and a half distance, that you never saw but once? - He has a large mole on the left side of his face, which I took particular notice of at the time; he has that mole now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Can you tell us how this man was dressed? - He had a great-coat on.</p>
               <p>A pretty large great-coat? - Middling about that, with a pocket on each side.</p>
               <p>I take it he had a round hat on? - He had.</p>
               <p>Did you never happen to mistake one man for another in the course of your business? - No, sir, I do not know I have.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing to you about this horse of Mr. Pegrim's? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If it will not offend my Counsel I wish to ask a single question of young Mr. Pegrim; Whether that advertisement of the mole on my cheek was in the papers? - He was not advertised at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If you recollect, the elder Pegrim swore there was an advertisement.</p>
               <p>Pegrim the elder. Hobbs was advertised and the other man was advertised, it was in the Hue and Cry.</p>
               <p>Was this man advertised? - No, I do not think he was; I rather think he was too.</p>
               <p>Where is that advertisement? - I do not know whether he was or was not.</p>
               <p>Did it mention the mole on his face? - I do not know; I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>Court to Bear. What description did Pegrim give you of the man? - A tall slim man of swarthy complexion; he did not give me any particular mark.</p>

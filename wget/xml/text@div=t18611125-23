                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On the morning of 7th November, I was on duty in Stoke Newington, and going down the Green-lanes I saw a fire—I met the prisoner, and asked him where the fire was—he said, "Just below here"—I said, "What is it?"—he said, "Two stacks of hay, close to each other"—perceiving particles of hay and straw hanging about his hair and whiskers, I said, "You have been sleeping in the hay"—he said, "Yes; I have, Sir"—I said, "Have you got anything about you?"—he said, "No"—another constable then came running up, proceeding in the direction of the fire, and having heard what I said, he said to the prisoner, "Have you any matches?"—he replied, "No"—we searched him, and found a box of matches on him, and a knife, and a little bag—I said, "I am suspicious that you have set fire to this straw, and I shall take you to the station on suspicion"—he then said, "I will tell you the truth; I did do it"—on the way to the station I asked him where he got the matches from, and he said he bought them for a farthing—at the station the charge was read over to him by the sergeant, and he was cautioned in the usual way—he said it was a bad job.</p>

I was on duty in King Henry's-walk, near where the fire was—I was going towards the fire and saw Kidd questioning the prisoner as to where the fire was, and about his sleeping under the stacks—the prisoner said he knew nothing at all about it—I said, "Have you got any matches about you?"—he said, "No; I have not"—I said, "I must see"—I put my hand in his pocket, and pulled out this box of matches—I asked him what was the reason that he set it on fire—he said, "Well I did do it; but don't hurt me"—he had previously stated to the other constable that he did set it on fire—I went on to the fire, and found it was two stacks of straw belonging to Mr. Rydon; they were burnt.</p>

I am the prisoner's brother-in-law—I have known him personally for four years, but I am acquainted with the last twenty years of his life—it has been for some time our opinion that he is not quite right—that is likewise the opinion of medical men; but their testimony only goes to this, that it is a monomania, of which we can produce abundant evidence—they do not feel authorised to say that it goes to the extent of lunacy—about eight months ago I took the necessary steps to confine him in a lunatic asylum, but on account of its not going further than mono<lb></lb>mania,</p>

On the 6th of January, about a quarter-past eight o'clock in the morning, I had a customer in the shop, and went into the cellar for something he wanted - this ream of paper was behind the door; as I went into the cellar I saw the prisoner entering the shop, through a glass door in the passage, and having lost paper before, I stepped back into the shop, and caught him with a ream of paper in his hand; he stood behind the door, with the door open - the instant he saw me he dropped it on the floor; I collared him, and sent for an officer - he told me he wanted some marble paper; this was coloured paper - marble paper is not made up into reams.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know what he is? A. I am informed he is a book-binder: marble paper is not called coloured - I was four yards from him when I saw it in his hand; he had not moved out of the shop - after I collared him he asked for marble paper.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Without taking off the cover could you tell whether that was marble paper or not? A. I should think not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ship painter, and live at No. 16, Cottage-grove, Mile-end-road. On Tuesday night, 15th May, about a quarter to 10 o'clock, I was about fifteen yards from the high road, and all at once found something passed round my neck, and found myself in a state of strangulation—I saw no one at the time, but within a few seconds I saw three persons flitting before me—I became insensible, and when I came to myself I was on the ground—on attempting to get up I found that my right hand was disabled—I got up, and endeavoured to cry, "Stop thief!" but I found that a small vessel in my throat had been broken, and I could not articulate—I was taken to a doctor, and have been incapacitated from doing anything with my hand ever since—my trowser were torn down from my pocket, and I missed my purse, containing a half sovereign and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my eye glass was gone also—about a minute and a half after I recovered I saw a policeman, and told him what had happened—the police inspector called on me about an hour and a half afterwards—this was in Cottage-grove, going towards my own house, and was not more than fifteen or sixteen yards from the public street, where a great many people were passing—this eye glass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my property, and is what I lost.</p>

I cannot swear to this eye glass, but it is very much like one which the prisoner gave me, as he owed me a trifle—he told me that he picked it up, and next morning I pawned it, in my own name and address, at Mr. Thorpe's, at the top of the street I live in, for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know on what day of the month or of the week it was—I have not got the ticket—he gave it to me, as near as I can guess, between 11 and 12 o'clock at night.</p>

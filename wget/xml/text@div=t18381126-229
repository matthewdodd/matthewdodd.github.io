                  </hi>. I live in Hogg-lane, Woolwich, and am a shoe<lb></lb>maker. On the 1st of November I was at the Duke public-house, sitting by the fire with my gin-and-water—I got up, and some one took my place—I asked him to move—he struck me, and there was a row—the two prisoners were there—I lost my watch—I asked the landlord if he would lock the door—he said he would not—several more were sitting near me—Fowler was my second when I fought—he came and assisted me—I did not ask him to come—it was not with my consent—he held me round the waist, and I felt him feeling for my watch—Heath was in the room, but I did not see him do any thing—this is my watch—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fowler. Q.</hi> When you felt my hand at your watch, why did you not accuse me of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not feel you take it—I went to the bar after it—I said I had lost my handkerchief, and afterwards found it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fowler. Q.</hi> You went out and accused a female of taking your watch, and came back—I still remained at the bar, and had a pint of half-and-half—why did you not have me taken then?—bow can you say it was my hand against your watch, when there were from twenty-five to thirty people—did you see any marks on my hand? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not see any marks.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. On the 2nd of November I went to the Earl Grey beer-shop, and I saw Fowler asleep—I left him, and from informa<lb></lb>tion</p>

               <p>I went across the road, and there saw Conner, who is not in custody—I went to the Earl Grey again, aroused Fowler, and told him he was suspected of having stolen a watch—he said he had done no such thing, but because he was there he must be suspected—I found a half-crown and two shillings in his pocket—I then took him into custody with Conner, in the van to Woolwich—I found on Conner a duplicate of the watch—when they got off the van, Fowler squared up at me—Conner called out to Fowler to stick up to me, and Conner made his escape.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. Between one and two o'clock on the morning of Friday, Butcher offered me the key and seals—I went to her house and took the prisoner Heath, but previously when I was called into the house, I saw Fowler with his arms round the prosecutor, and Heath after that accused Butcher of taking the witch.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Heath</hi>. You say that I ran away? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No—I say you accused the girl of robbing the man of the watch—I took the girl away, and when I came back you were gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fowler</hi>. He says he did not see me afterwards, and he states in the depositions that he saw me go through the gardens at half-past two o'clock in the morning with Conner. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No—I saw Conner go through the garden at two o'clock in the morning, and another man, who, I believe, was Fowler—the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> was between twelve and one o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fowler's Defence</hi>. I went into this house about eleven o'clock, and Conner was there—I sat down, and had a pint of porter: lifter that Conner said, "We will have a pot between us"—we did to—I saw the prosecutor get up to get a glass of gin-and-water from the mantel-shelf—there, was a quarrel about a chair, and the prosecutor knocked a man down—I picked him up;—after that he went to the bar, and said he had lost his watch—the next morning I went to Greenwich and saw Conner come out of a public-house—we went on and went to another public-house—he said, "Stop there till I come back," which I did, and fell asleep till the officer came and apprehended me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Heath's Defence</hi>. I was not in the house above half an hour, and I was awoke up—I picked up the seals in the tap-room, but I did not take them from the man's person.</p>

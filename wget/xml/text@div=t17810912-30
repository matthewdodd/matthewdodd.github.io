Upon Friday, the 24th of August, I set the bricks to the carter, and the prisoner loaded his cart. To the best of my knowledge, he had 1000: I do not know how many more. He did not tell me where he was going to. Mr. Clarkson, the clerk of the field, gave him a ticket.</p>
               <p>Do you always send 1000? - No; sometimes 750, and sometimes 500. If the cart is very full, it carries above 1000. He told me he was wanting in his number in the last cart, and he must have some over then.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Scott. I was at the taking-up of the prisoner. I charged him with selling 200 bricks, and asked him how he could be guilty of such a thing; as he was in constant work, and earned 17 or 18 s. a week, and had that week earned 24 s. He said, Burland had before seen him put down some bricks in Tabernacle-walk, and asked him, if he could not bring him some bricks, and he would give him something to drink; and accordingly, the first opportunity, he carried him some. He said Burland first gave him a shilling, and afterwards 5 d. He confessed that as soon as he was charged with it.</p>
               <p>Did you make any allowance to Haggard afterwards? - Yes; he was charged 850 only.</p>

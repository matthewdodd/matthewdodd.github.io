            : On Wednesday the 8th of February, about half after six o'clock, as I was folding some things in the shop, I heard a noise; I turned round, and missed two waistcoats; I was inside of my shop, with my back to the door; they were pinned to a coat that was hung up against the partition near the shop door; I went to the door, and saw the prisoner at the bar running; I pursued and took him; I suppose he ran about four or five hundred yards or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever out of your sight? - A. Yes; he was turning round the corner, I missed sight of him; he made great resistance; he had the two waistcoats under his jacket when I took him; I told him he must come back again; I offered five shillings to any body that would assist me, but they would not; I was used very ill indeed several times; I brought him back, and sent for an officer; the officer has got the waistcoats here; I am sure they were taken from the inside of the shop.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.

               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

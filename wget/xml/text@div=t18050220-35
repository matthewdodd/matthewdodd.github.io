               <p>Q. How far was he carrying it off? - A. About two yards from the place where the hat was, he was still in the shop; I got up, and caught hold of him by the collar, and asked him what he was at; he dropped the hat, and began crying; I called out to Miss Swallow, my master's sister, who was in the next parlour; she locked both doors, and went up stairs to call a gentleman; at the time she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180502200036"></xptr>was gone, he asked me to speak as well as I could for him; I held the boy till the gentleman came down; then he secured him till I went and fetched a constable; I am certain that is the boy, and this is my master's hat.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Procter.) Are you sure you saw the boy take the hat from where it was? - A. I am sure I saw him take it.</p>

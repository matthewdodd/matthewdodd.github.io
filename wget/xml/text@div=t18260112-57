               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. It must have been stolen by some person on your premises? A. I presume so - they must have entered the warehouse to get it. I often slept out - nobody could enter without being let in by some person within; I never saw the prisoner there.</p>

            . I first knew the prisoner in November - she came to lodge with me at No. 32, Great Sutton-street - we became intimate; she informed me that Mrs. Buchanan had been a particular friend of her's, and the sole support of herself and former husband, for when she could not give her money, she gave her her master's prints and cottons, which she tore into lengths, and pawned at different pawnbrokers, and burnt the tickets to avoid detection; that Buchanan lived with a Mr. W. in the City, but she did not say where. I had often heard her talk of going to Mrs. B. in Newgate-street, by which I knew she meant Buchanan, and one night she sent her daughter to Mrs. Buchanan in the City for a bundle - her daughter returned, and could not find it; she and her mother had words, and she told me what a stupid girl she must be, as there was a board up close by to say where Mr. W. had removed to; next night she went herself, as she told me, and saw Mrs. Buchanan, but she had company, and she was to go the next night. I then went myself to find out Mr. W., to inform him she was coming for a parcel - I at last found Mr. W., who had removed to the Poultry, and Buchanan lived there; I told the clerk the prisoner was to call, and told him what she had told me - that when the officers were walking on the opposite side of the way, she went to Mr. W's., and brought the prints away, wrapped round her body, after eight o'clock at night. I once wanted some shirt frills for my son - she said she had plenty in pawn; about three weeks ago she went to Hatton-garden to swear to the loss of some duplicates, and when she returned, she said she had settled it all comfortably.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever say she had been at the prosecutor's house? A. She said she had been in the warehouse several times - that their stock was immense, and a little could not be missed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not understand from her that the bundles were ready for her when she called? A. No. I never asked her a question, it was all said voluntarily - she told me she knew where to find the things, that they were between the bed and mattress. I gave information as soon as I knew where to find the prosecutors.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get your living? A. I have two houses in St. James's walk left me by my father. I kept a butcher's shop till within the last six weeks, and have books with 4 or 500l. of debts on them; I am a widow, and have six children; when I want money I collect a few debts - no single women lodges in the house, except the prisoner's daughter. I occasionally lent the prisoner 1l., and she got communicatlve with me; she represented herself as my sister, but she is not. I had no quarrel with her - I should be afraid to have words with her. I wished her to leave my house - she has abused me, and used very improper language, but if she was abusive at night she was civil next morning - she was not quite sober, and I excused it. I gave her notice to quit several times, she said I must give her regular notice, and I must wait till quarter day to do so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long before you gave information had you learnt who Mr. W. meant? A. I did not know till I went on a Thursday night in November, and read it on the board in Newgate-street.</p>

               <p>MR. MASSEY. When the prisoner was apprehended I saw her searched, fifty-six duplicates were found on her; she said, "If any of those duplicates belong to Mr. W's. property, I will eat my head." I asked who she meant by W., she said, "I mean Buchanan's master, Mr. Wiltshire." Mr. Wiltshire's name had not been mentioned at that time.</p>

            . I am a marshalman. I went to the prisoner's house, and directly the door was open I ran to the bureau and pulled out some duplicates. I said,"Here are plenty of duplicates;" she said there was no property there belonging to Mr. W. Mr. Massey asked her some questions, but I was busy searching, and did not attend to them. I did not tell her Buchanan was in custody till afterward.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When he came in he asked if I knew Buchanan; and when the duplicates were found, I said, "If there is any of Mr. W's. property there, I will eat my head." What Johnson has said is false. I knew her five years ago, but have not seen her for three years till lately, when an intimacy commenced, and she proposed our taking a house together; quarrels ensued in consequence of men going in and out at all hours - I was informed the house would be indicted. I certainly told her I was going to see Buchanan, and if she had no money she would let me have other things, as she often lent me clothes to pawn.</p>

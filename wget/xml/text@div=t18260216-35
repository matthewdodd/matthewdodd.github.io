These coats were kept in the drawers, on my second floor - the prisoner Robert was three months in my service as errand boy - I had discharged him about three weeks; I pulled them off on Friday, and missed them on Saturday, the 11th of February, at eleven o'clock at night; a person coming in at my yard gates might easily step up stairs - I have found one coat; I apprehended him at his mother's, in Falcon-place, Ray-street.</p>

            . I am groom to Mr. Wills, of Percival-street. On Saturday evening, the 11th of February I was by master's stables, behind his house, and saw the prisoner about twenty minutes to eight o'clock - the gas was lighted - I cannot be mistaken in him - he said he had a place at 6s. a week, and would get me one at 8s. - I said I was satisfied with the one I had got - nothing more passed - he had got nothing.</p>

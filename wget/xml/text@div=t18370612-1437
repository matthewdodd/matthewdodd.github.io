                  </hi>. I am a gold-beater and live in Tottenham-court-road. The prisoner was my servant—having missed money, on Tuesday, the 30th of May, about half-past two o'clock, I marked one penny, ten halfpence, two half-crowns, five shillings, and one sixpence, and put them into my cash-box in the bureau in the back parlour—the box was occasionally locked—they were safe between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—on going to bed I locked the bureau, to the best of my knowledge—the key turned in the usual manner—in the morning I missed one shilling and two halfpence—I then marked two shillings and one sixpence, and added them to the number which I had previously placed there—I went out about two o'clock in the afternoon, and left them safe—I returned before five o'clock, and found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. had been abstracted—I sent for a policeman, and asked the prisoner if she would consent to be searched—she did so, and we found in her pocket a piece of gold, which I had missed about three weeks before—not finding the marked money on her, I asked if she would consent to have her box searched—she said yes—on getting into her room, she said, "If I confess the truth, will you forgive me?"—I said, "Open your box"—she did, and I saw a bag—she said, "I have taken 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the box, and no more"—we only discovered two shillings and three halfpence marked, which I recognised and a scent-bottle, which she afterwards said she had taken from the kitchen.</p>

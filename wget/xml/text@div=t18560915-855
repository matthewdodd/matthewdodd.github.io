                  </hi>. I am an outfitter, of No. 132, Minories. On Saturday afternoon, 30th Aug., between 4 and 5 o'clock, I saw the prisoner, with two others, pass my shop, and from an observation they made in passing, I watched them—in about five minutes the prisoner and one of the others returned, and the prisoner had a bolt of canvass under his arm—I followed him, but not seeing a policeman, after following him along several streets, I stopped him, and told him to take the canvass back to the shop in the Minories, where he took it from—he Raid, "Pray don't give me into cus<lb></lb>tody"—I insisted on his taking it back, and he took it back, and passed the shop one door, and said he had taken it from that corner of the street—I</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 103, Minories. On that Saturday afternoon I saw the prisoner pass, with the last witness—I believe this bolt of canvass is mine—it is exactly like a bolt I had just before—I had nine or ten bolts standing on a shelf in my warehouse, near the door—the door was open—the value of this is 34<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found that one bolt was gone, No. 4, and this one is No. 4, and is from the same manufac<lb></lb>turer as mine.</p>

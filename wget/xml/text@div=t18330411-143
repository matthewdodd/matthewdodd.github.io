               <p>WILLIAM KNIGHT. I live in Philip-lane, and am a watchman of Cripplegate. On the night of the 9th of March I saw the prisoner in London-wall, in company with two men - they turned out of Aldermanbury Postern, looked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110067"></xptr>at me, and went on to New Basinghall-street; the prisoner and one of the others then went into a court close by the prosecutor's shop - they staid there a little while; I watched them, and saw the prisoner take the piece of beef from the prosecutor's; I took hold of him, and he dropped it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw two lads in Chiswell-street - I suspected them, and followed them into London-wall; one of them took the beef - I ran, to try to stop him, but he threw it down at my feet, and the officer took me - I said, "There he goes - stop him!"</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KNIGHT. When I laid hold of the prisoner the other one was close to him, but he made off immediately, the beef was under the prisoner's left arm; the other man who had a basket, was a little distance off, on the other side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor's clerk, of 36, Marchmont Street—on 18th June about 12.30 I was in Euston Road—as I was coming along the prisoner rushed out from a dark place and assaulted me, and gave me several violent blows on the chest—they both struck me—Grueber gave me more violent blows than the other—they both said "Search out his b—breeches"—Grueber thrust his hand into my waistcoat pocket and tore it—I had gold and silver in my trousers pocket—seeing that I was lonely in the hands of these two ruffians I called out "Harry, come along!" as if I had a friend, but I had no one—they then walked away—a policeman came up—I followed the prisoners and gave them in custody—they had got about 100 yards—I kept them in sight—I was not the worse for liquor.</p>

I met the prosecutor in Judd Street—he complained of the assault and gave me a description of the parties—I went after them and took them in charge—the prosecutor was with me—we overtook them from 80 to 100 yards—I told them they would be charged with assault with intent to rob—they said they knew nothing about it—I found on Grueber some keys and three button-hooks, and on Cooley two knives, a key, 11¼<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, and a Hanoverian medal—they were sober and so was the prosecutor.</p>

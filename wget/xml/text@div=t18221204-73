On the 29th of November, about a quarter to six o'clock in the evening, I was writing in the parlour, behind the shop - my candle had been lighted above an hour; nobody was in the shop. I heard an unusual noise, rose up, opened the parlour door, and found the shop door wide open - it had been shut, and has a bell to it to give notice if it is opened. I cast my eye on the counter, and missed three reams of paper, which I had received two hours before - I ran to the door, saw nobody, and thought no more of it; but next day some was produced to me, which corresponds in quality and quantity. I had bought it of Messrs. Wilson. I had been out of the shop about a quarter of an hour, and left<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040031"></xptr>the door on the latch, in the usual way. If it had not been opened with great caution the bell must have rang.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On the 29th of November, a little after six o'clock at night, I was with Westcoatt; we turned into George-street, and saw the prisoner standing with something in his arms; he was seven or eight minutes walk from Miss Morris's. We passed him a few yards, turned back, and by that time he had got inside the door of one Joseph's house. I looked in, and asked him if he lodged there, he said he did; I asked if there were any other lodgers - Westcoatt came in and seized him. I took this paper from him. I found Miss Morris out next day.</p>

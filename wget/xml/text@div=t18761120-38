                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Masters, of Hertford House, Acton—on 12th October on going to rest I saw the house properly secure—the kitchen window was fastened—I went to bed at 9.30—at 2.30 I went downstairs and missed from the kitchen dresser a cruet-stand, gravyspoon, two dessertspoons, two tablespoons, six teaspoons, one saltspoon, a pair of nut crackers, four knife rests, a pair of silver solitaires, and a patent lever corkscrew—I went down in the dark and found the kitchen window open—I missed a pier glass from the parlour mantelpiece, a shawl from the sofa in the parlour, and two coats from behind the door—they were there the night before—the articles produced were handed to me by the police—I recognise all the plate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This tobacco pouch produced is not mine—the things produced have my marks upon them—they are not' all marked with my name—some I had given me—they are all plated except the teaspoons, and saltspoon, and one fork, which are silver—there are only five tea spoons here, there ought to be six—the goods I lost I value at 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the opera glass was a small one and had no mark on it except the maker's name—the shawl was worth about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that was not marked—the dress coat was not marked—I think it had Samuel Brothers' name upon it—one silver teaspoon is missing, and the top of the pepper castor, the corkscrew, and a silver solitaire.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to the South Devon constabulary—I was on duty in North Row and North Audley Street—about 10.15 or 10.20 on 21st October I saw the prisoner there with a man named. Joyce—as I passed I heard Joyce say to prisoner "All right, go over the way "—the prisoner then went down North Row towards George Street, crossed over the road to the other, side and came back again, then crossed over North Audley Street and went into a public-house at the opposite corner—he was carrying this bag—Joyce lingered at the same corner about a minute and then followed the prisoner into the public-house—I waited about five minutes and the prisoner came out alone with the bag and went to Oxford Street—I then doubled round North Row, a block of buildings between George Street and North Audley Street, and met him—I asked him what he had got in the bag—he took out the cruet stand and I said "Where did you get it from <hi rend="italic">V</hi>—he said "I found it in the park "—I said "That won't do for me; I must take you to the station "—at the station I found the articles produced; I found the gravyspoon in the bag—I found other property, but not in the bag—these two spoons were in his undercoat pocket—he did not say where he got them from—he said he should like to have a glass of brandy and water on the road—I afterwards ran back and took Joyce; the bill against him has been thrown out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, N</hi> 170). On Sunday morning, 6th April, at a few minutes before 6, I was on duty in Park-road, Holloway, that in very near to Hillmarton-villas, Cam den-road—I saw the prisoner in front of 18, Hillmarton-villas—I had looked in that direction a second before and there was no one there—he was hastening towards the Holloway Catsle—I passed on, not seeming to take any notice—there are no houses there, only a field, so that I was able to see him—when he came to a port where houses were, he looked round each way, and they looked down a turning the Penn-road—I followed up the Park-road until I came in a line with the Penn-road, and there saw him again watching two persons—I turned back, crossed a field, waited in a recess for about twenty minutes without seeing him—I then went into the Penn-road, and saw him come out of a gateway at the back of Penn-road-villas—I followed him back into the Camdin-road, and asked him what his business was there—he said that he had been to ease himself, having asked permission of a man who was on a ballast-heap—I asked him his name—he said William Davis; that he lived at Highgate, near where the omnibuses started, but he could not tell me that name of the street or house—I took him in custody, having watched his movements three quarters of an hour—I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on him at the station—I was afterwards called to 18, Hillmarton-villas, Camden-road—I took the prisoner's boots with me, and tried them, with Sergeant Gould, to some footmarks in Mr. Sugden's garden, and in the gardens of Nos. 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18—they corresponded, and we traced them distinctly to what Sergeant Gould found the property in my presence, concealed under some old building wood, at the back of a garden, about 600 yards from No. 18—that is a very exposed place, quite open, a person can get in with very little difficulty—a square of glass had been removed, and an iron bar taken out from some stone work, the cavity in which was filled up with cement, which this knife might have assisted in removing—the bar was outside and must have been removed before the glass.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Were my boots clean or dirty when you took me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Dirty, but you washed them in the cell—they had mud on the sides and on the soles—I had been walking about all night, and had mud on the soles of my shoes—an impression was made with your boots by the side of the footmarks, and it corresponded.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-serjeant,</hi> 40 <hi rend="italic">N</hi>). On Sunday morning, 6th April, I accompanied the prosecutor from the station to his house, at a few minutes to 9, and found that an entry had been made by removing a thick bar, which had been fastened with cement at the bottom—it was loose at the top—this knife would remove the cement and putty—I first saw the knife when Marsh brought it to the station, it then had cement and putty on it, as if</p>

               <p>it had been rubbed aganist the compo—I traced footsteps from No. 14 to the rear of No. 18—they came out of the side gate of No. 18 into Camden-road. where I found similar impressions, and the property wrapped up in two or three different parcels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was concelaed behind some old build<lb></lb>ing materials, timber, about 400 yard, from the prosecutor's house—I took the boot, made an impression by the side of the footmark, and it corres<lb></lb>ponded exactly—there is a peculiarity about the boots, they are rather high in the waist, as if they had been half-soled and stitched together, and that impression was in the mark—the sloes had been carried nearer to the heel than is usual, it is half-soleing, or rather I should say three-quarter—they were only the impression of one person's feet—it was in garden mould and was very distinct—the boots were quit free from dirt when I made the Comparison.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The knife is hardly able to out a piece of board, and the waist of this boot is higher than the sole. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The sole is higher than the waist, and there was that peculiarity in all the impression.</p>

I am a warehouseman in the City and live at 16, Hill<lb></lb>marton-villas, Camden-road—on Saturday night, 6th April, about 11 o'clock, I saw everything fast before I restored to rest—these are the boots I took off that evening—they were left in the kitchen—this property is all mine, and all was safe on that night—soon after 7 the next morning, I was disturbed—an iron bar had been removed from the sill of the pantry window outside, fastened in cement—it could be easily removed—that is at the back of the premises—the slightest instrument would remove it; there would be no difficulty whatever.</p>

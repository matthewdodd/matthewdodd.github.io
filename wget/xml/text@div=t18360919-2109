                  </hi>. I live in Carey-street, Lambeth, and am a general dealer. I have known Tiller two or three years—on Saturday, the 20th of August I went to Covent Garden market, with my donkey and cart—I saw Tiller there, and employed him to look after my donkey and cart, while I went to pay for my purchases—I returned twice, and he was still there,—I went away again for about ten minutes, and then my donkey and cart and apples, were all gone—the donkey was worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the cart, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the apples, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—I found the donkey at Hoxton station-house, and the cart at Kingsland—I did not see Welsh at the time I lost it—on the 2nd of September I saw him in Broadway, Westminster—I said I had been looking after him a long time, and asked where Tiller lived—he said if I would not hurt him, he would tell me where Tiller was—I went to the West Gallery form what Welsh said, I found Tiller there, and took him into custody, and Welsh too.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, and live in Prospect-place, Kingsland-road On Thursday morning the 25th of August the two prisoner came with a donkey and cart to my place, about half-past ten o'clock and asked me to buy the cart—Tiller was the principal speaker—the other was in the cart—I said it did not suit me, there were so many of them stolen—I said, "Is it yours?"—he said, "Yes, it is"—I said, "Is this your name?—there was the name of Hall on it but part of it was broken off—he said it was his cart, and he wanted to sell it, that the might buy a pair of hampers for the donkey as they were going round the country—I said, "You are sure it is your own?"—he said, "Yes"—he wanted 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would not give more than 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—they said that would do—the other got out, and they came into my shop, expecting to get the money, but I called in a neighbour to mind the cart and donkey while I went to see if I could find Tiller's mother who, he said, sat in Golden-lane, and in going I lost them.</p>

I heard no more of them till I read the Advertisement, in which the pocket piece was described ; I went, and was informed that the prisoner told them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175307180013"></xptr> that the place was mine; the prisoner was in the Gatehouse, and lay in, I did not want to see her, because I did not know her, and now I cannot swear that that she is the person that pick'd my pocket.</p>

            . On the first of last April, I, Mr. Hayley, and the prisoner at the bar, went out, and going into Spring-Garden gate, the prisoner pick'd the lady's pocket of the things she has mention'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the lady?</p>
               <p>J. M. Wright. I am sure it is, for I saw the prisoner working upon her, (as we term it.) We went into the two brewers in Maynard-street, St. Giles's, to share our money, I had three half crowns, and a snuff-box, that she took out of another pocket, in the room of the piece of gold which she said she would lay up to buy a boat for the child she was then big of.</p>
               <p>Q. What things did you take from this lady ?</p>
               <p>He mentions them severally.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ormond. Did you ever get your pieces of money again?</p>
               <p>Ormond. No, not any of them, nor never saw them since I told this evidence that I would give five guineas for that piece of gold because I greatly valued it; but I never had it.</p>

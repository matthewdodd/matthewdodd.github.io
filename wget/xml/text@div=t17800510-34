Upon the 6th of April the prisoner and another woman came into the shop and asked for a sufficient quantity of cotton to make a bed gown. I produced the piece mentioned in the indictment, among many others, for them to choose a pattern out of; as I was leaning on the goods, persuading them to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100046"></xptr>buy a piece that seemed to please them, I felt something pluck under my elbow; I did not suspect them till then. As we had lost things before, I let them alone to do as they pleased, and turned round to the shelves to reach some other goods, in order to detect them. While I was doing so, I imagine a piece had been pulled down on the outside of the counter; they did not buy any thing; when they went out I followed them and called them back.</p>
               <p>How long were they in the shop? - About fifteen minutes; they hesitated a little before they came back; when they came in the prisoner leaned her arm upon the counter. I laid hold of her and turned her round, and as she turned I saw the piece of printed linen drop down from under her clothes. I took it up; it was exceeding warm, I imagine from bodily heat; we had no more of that pattern.</p>

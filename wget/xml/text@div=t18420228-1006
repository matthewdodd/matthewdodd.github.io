                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Ebenezer Ballinger—the pri<lb></lb>soner was our carman—I suspected him of robbing me. On the 26th of February I saw him go out about eight o'clock in the morning, to his breakfast—he was brought back to my counting-house—I said I suspected him—he said he had never taken anything—I said he had better see if he had anything then about him—he put his hand to his pocket, and took this piece of stilton-cheese out—I sent for a constable—he said if I would forgive him he would do so no more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Stokes, a jeweller, of No. 1 Spencer-street, St. John-street, Clerkenwell; he resides in that house. On Saturday night, 17th May, I was in the back parlour, a little after 10 o'clock—I heard a strange noise at the outer door, that leads to the street, as though some one was on the landing—I said to the girl, "Sarah, have you been up stairs?"—she said, "No"—I listened again, and heard a noise—I was sure some one was getting in—I heard footsteps over head in the bed room—I ran to the street door, and called "Policeman!" and "Mur<lb></lb>der'."—while I was doing so, a man jumped down from the leads of the first floor into the area—he said, "Don't be alarmed"—he had something in his hand, which I thought was a pistol—he was coming towards me, I drew back into the passage, and closed the door, or partly closed it—I believe the prisoner is the man—I went to the bedroom with the policeman—I found the catch of the window torn off, and it was hanging down—there had been a wash hand stand under the window, which was a little removed, and the window was wide open—I had seen that window between 6 and 7 o'clock—it was then shut and fastened—it had not been opened all day—no one had come in at the front door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in New Hall-street, Isling<lb></lb>ton. On Saturday night, 17th May, I was passing the end of Spencer street—the last witness came to the door and screamed—I looked towards the house and saw the prisoner jump from the back part of the premises, inside the railings—I saw him on the top of the wood work, he crouched down, and broke some of the wood work—he made a spring, and got over the iron railings—I made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at him, but having a bad thumb, which has since been cut off, I could not hold him, he got from me—I gave infor<lb></lb>mation, and the policeman pursued him—Mrs. Stokes was still screaming, and I went to her, to see if any one else was there.</p>

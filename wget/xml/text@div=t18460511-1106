I am the wife of John Hall, of Orchard-street, Port<lb></lb>man-square—he is a coach-plater, and ironmonger—the prisoner worked for him for a short time—he was laying lead on the roof of our house in Orchard-street—my husband provided the lead—the prisoner had a large piece of lead <hi rend="italic">to</hi> cut from—when he left work I told Valance to call him back—I said I wanted <hi rend="italic">to</hi> speak <hi rend="italic">to</hi> him—when he came into the room I said, "So you are a thief, are you?"—I then locked the door, sent for an officer, and gave him in charge—the prisoner took the lead from the belt round his waist before the officer came—it corresponded with my husband's lead.</p>

                  </hi>. I work for Mr. Hall—on the 6th of May the prisoner had a job to do on the roof, and Mr. Hall told him to take some lead from the yard—he took some pieces off and doubled them up—he then doubled up another piece and put it by the side of the bench—I told Mrs. Hall—she told me if I saw him take it to watch him—in about ten minutes he came and took the piece of lead into the next shop, and put it under his trowsers—I said, "You are very foolish to do that"—I followed him and told Mrs. Hall—she took him into the parlour—he took the lead from his belt, and said it was the first piece he ever took, and begged her not to give him in charge.</p>

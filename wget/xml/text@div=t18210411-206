On arriving there I got out of the gig and rang the bell; it was about half past six o'clock in the evening. When I returned from ringing the bell, I saw the wheel of a cart locked into the wheel of the buggy. It is a wide road. I had drawn up as close as possible to the foot way. There was room for four carriages to pass without touching us. There were at least six persons in the cart; it was full of men and one boy. Master's box coat was in the buggy over his knees; we had the head up, it being a wet night. I saw the prisoner in possession of the coat about ten minutes after I rang the bell. We were expostulating with them for coming in contact with the gig, and begging them to unlock the wheels. Master ordered me to pursue the prisoner; I overtook him about a hundred and twenty yards from the gig, and saw the coat on his arm; he dropped it, and put himself in a fighting posture. I drew back, and stooped to pick up the coat, and he gave me a very severe blow between the two eyes; my hat fell off. The blow knocked me down. Several of the party who had been in the cart were behind, and I received some kicks from them as I lay in the road. The prisoner picked up a silk handkerchief which flew out of my hat, and ran away with it; he came back in about a quarter of an hour, to enquire what was the matter, and was secured.</p>

The coat was thrown across the road first, and put back in the gig by a gentleman's servant, and put in the gig while I held the horse. There might be thirty people about or more. I heard there had been a bull bait in the neighbourhood. The people in the cart came round and said, I hope you are not hurt; and they felt about my breeches and almost pulled my watch out. I got some severe blows; my nose is all on one side now with it.</p>

            . I live next door to Mr. Broughton, in Clarendon-place. On Tuesday evening at 6 o'clock I was in Clarendon-place, and saw the cart locked in the wheel of Mr. Broughton's gig, and saw the prisoner going off with the box coat. I followed him with Reynolds as quick as possible, overtook him, and he dropped it. Reynolds being nearest received a blow as we were both stooping to pick it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. There was great confusion? - A. Four persons were running; I believe all four came out of the cart. I picked up the coat. One of the people in the cart took it, and it was returned. I don't know who took it the second time.</p>

            , my father is a plumber, glazier, and painter, living at Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes; on the 17th of January, they all three came to my father's shop door, about nine o'clock in the morning, they asked whether Mr. Cooper was at home, I told them he was not, but they might leave the lead. (I did not say my father had taken his business, Mr. Cooper being dead.) They left the lead, and I told them they might call again the next day; they came the next day, my father was at home; I was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell what they said about the lead. - A. The coal meter's man, Francis, he came to receive the money for the lead; the prisoners came in about an hour, I was not present then, I was sent after Mr. Brown, the officer, and when the officer came they were gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did two, three, or four men come. - A. Francis made four.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father is a plumber. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a very honest man, I am sure he would not buy any stolen lead. - A. He would not.</p>
               <p>Q. And he brings you up in the same honest way; you had no doubt but they came honestly by it, and so you desired them to leave it. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>THOMAS HAVELL sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the father of the boy. - A. Yes, I saw the prisoners on the 17th of January; three of them came to my house about ten o'clock in the morning, they informed me that they had left some lead about an hour before at my house; they informed me that they had got this lead in a ditch between my house and Mile End road; I told him I was sure it was stolen from some place or other by the appearance of the mark of a crow bar wrenching it from some wall; the reply made by Saunders was, I have not the least doubt of that business, we found it in a ditch, it must have been stolen from somewhere; he asked me if I would not purchase it of them, they assured me they had found it there, and they could bring witness to prove it; they mentioned a Mr. Sumner, a coal meter, that came by at the time, who saw them take it out of the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave some instructions to Mr. Rogers, the officer. - A. Yes, and Rogers came into my house, and apprehended them when they came to see if I would purchase it, about an hour or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. After this lead had been left with you, and you told them you supposed it was stolen, they called again. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The lead is laid to be the property of the churchwardens of Shadwell. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is only a stone's throw from your house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Smith said to you, we have found the lead very fairly, he said he would go to the police office himself, after you had told him what Rogers has stated. - A. Yes, he said he would go himself.</p>
               <p>Q. And after that Rogers took him in custody. - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a servant to Mr. Sumner, a coal meter. - A. Yes. On Friday the 17th of January, about half past eight in the morning, I was coming across Shadwell Fields, I saw Saunders by a ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any thing in any ditch before you was shewn it by Saunders. - A. No, he told me there was something black in the ditch, like lead; after that curiosity led me to go back, and when I looked I saw it was lead by poking it with a stick; it was about six inches under water; Saunders told me he passed it about half after seven o'clock in the morning, he would have picked it up, but being by himself, if he had been detected, he had no witnesses to prove that he did. not steal it; I made answer, you have got plenty of witnesses now that we have found it under water, laying in a ditch, so now we will pick it up.</p>
               <p>Q. How many witnesses had you. - A. The three prisoners, me, and my master Mr. Sumner; we got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190063"></xptr>it up out of the ditch; afterwards we rather paused what we should do with it; we thought it best to take it to the first plumber's shop to sell it.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, it is needless to go on; we must believe the witness on the part of the prosecution. How can we say these men stole the lead; it might have been stolen by somebody else.</p>

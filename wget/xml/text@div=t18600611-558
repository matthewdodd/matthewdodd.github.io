I live at 1, Wentworth-street, and am a boot and shoe<lb></lb>maker—on Sunday, 29th April, I lived at 26, Flower and Dean-street—on that afternoon I saw the prisoner Besborough; he came and beckoned me out, and I followed him—he went to a house situated on the left-hand side of</p>

               <p>Lower Keate-street, the last house on the left-hand side coming from Brick-lane—when he got there he took me up stairs to a back-room, and showed me these shoemakers' tools—he asked me if I would buy them—I told him they were no use to me—they were no value—at that time another man came in whom he called <hi rend="italic">Jem Joe</hi>, and he said, "Here is a lot of cuttings" (bits of leather)—I asked him what he wanted for the lot together—the other party said. "Fifteen shillings"—I told him I would not give one third of that—he asked what I would give, and I gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—Besborough said, "They are very cheap for the money"—they did not take the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. then—I asked <hi rend="italic">Jem Joe</hi> how he came by these things, and he said they were left there for rent; the man had been away three weeks—I then left and went away, and when I got two or three doors off, <hi rend="italic">Jem Joe</hi> came and said I should have them—he and Besborough stood at the door together—I put two half-crowns into <hi rend="italic">Jem Joe's</hi> hand, and he gave a half-crown to Besborough.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Fitzgerald's Defence.</hi> For above 18 years I have been getting a living by hard work and jobbing at the wharves. I never was charged with any dishonesty. On that Sunday morning when the steam packet arrived, the prosecutor went to the wharf and tried to get in; but he was refused, no stranger being allowed, and be being much in liquor, for he had been drinking with two men whom he had employed, both strangers to me. As he could not get on the wharf, one of the two men said, if fee knew the name of the party be would go in. The prosecutor gave him the name and address, and this man then went on board the ateam packet and found the woman, and she gave him charge of the goods, and he brought them out in the street and asked me to fetch a hand-truck. When I came back the man that had charge of the goods and his mate loaded the truok, I then asked the men where the goods were going, they said to Oxford-street, near Soho, which is a long way from the wharf, aud they were to get 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I then efused to go, as that would not pay three men and truok hire; I told them to go and get a truck for themselves, as I bad left sixpence deposit on that truok; one of the men then handed me a sixpence, saying that they did not want me to go with them, and that they would take back the truck safe; they began to drag the truck along, and the prosecutor and his friend with them. I did not like to let the track go with two strangers, and I followed them to Tower-hill. I saw a policeman and I asked him to stop the truck, but he took no notice of what I said, and the two men dragged the truck along Tower-hill and the prosecutor and his friend with them. I went no further with them but returned back to the neighbourhood of the wharf, where I stopped till the afternoon. I then went to inquire of the owner if the truck had been brought back, he said, "No," and there was some one there asking about the goods, and we went to the station-house and reported the loss. If I had had any fear or known anything of the goods, I might have gone miles away, but I went seeking the truck and could not find or hear of it. On the Sunday evening I was taken, and when at the station-house, all the property I had in thd world was M. I am quite innocent of the charge.</p>

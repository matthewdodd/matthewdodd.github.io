            . I am an officer. On the 10th of October I took a part of these articles from the prisoner's person; this vinegarette and four pins I found in her box at a relations', where she was lodging - she said, "They are all my own;" I went to the watch-house, and asked her how she came in possession of the property - she said they were given to her by a Mrs. Smith, a casualty sort of acquaintance, to whom she had lent 10l., and who, she believed, was then at Birmingham; she afterwards said she was very sorry, and it was all Mr. Rutland's, except the linen - I found duplicates on her which led to some of the articles.</p>

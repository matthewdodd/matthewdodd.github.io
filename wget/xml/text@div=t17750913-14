             towards London, at about half after nine at night, in the third field from Tottenham-Court turnpike, the prisoner came up to me and stopped me first; he struck me over the breast with a pistol, and said, your money, your money. I said to him, take your pistol away and I will give you my money: he kept the pistol at my breast; in the mean time Holmes had a scuffle with the other man, and the prisoner immediately ran away: I pursued him, and he was taken in a minute; he was not ten yards from me; it was a moon-light night.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not take the other man?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing when you took him?</p>
               <p>Lloyd. He said, he wanted to ease himself; I took him to the Red Lyon, in Tottenham-Court-Road, where I knew a constable lived; I charged the constable with him, and desired him to search him; there was nothing found upon him but eight-pence; the constable found the pistol in the field the next morning; (the pistol was produced in court by Saw.)</p>
               <p>- Saw. The prisoner was brought to me about a quarter before ten o'clock at night. Mr. Lloyd, whom I knew, informed me he had been stopped by a footpad, and charged me with the prisoner; I handcuffed him, and then he said, d - n your eyes now you have done your worst, you can but tuck me up. I searched him and found eight-pence upon him; he asked me to give him a pint of beer; I did, and he drank it: I then asked Mr. Lloyd where he was stopped; he said, in the third field from the turnpike: I took two men with me at three o'clock in the morning to the third field, and there I found the pistol in a water-gutter cut for the draining of water, eighty or a hundred yards out of the foot-path, towards Primrose Hill. As I was coming out of the field, I met Mr. Lloyd and three of four more with him, coming into the field; he asked me if I was come to look for the pistol; I said, yes; he said he should know it from a thousand. I then shewed it to him, and he said, that is the pistol that was at my breast.</p>
               <p>"On his cross examination, he said, that</p>
               <p>"Holmes was attacked and robbed by another</p>

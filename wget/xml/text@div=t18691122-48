                  </hi>. I am a porter in the employ of Messrs. Ben<lb></lb>jamin Hay &amp; Co., 29, Aldermanbury—about 2.30 on the afternoon of 11th November I saw a bale of goods in the passage as I went out—it was then in good condition, and not disarranged in any way—I returned in about five minutes and saw Williamson in the act of pulling open the bale—he saw me and ran out—I ran after him and gave him into custody—I afterwards examined the bale and found it had been cut open some distance—it had also been moved from the door—it contained woollen goods to the value of about 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believe—it was a large bale.</p>

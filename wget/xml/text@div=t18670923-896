                  </hi>. I live at 21, Princess Street, and am the wife of Robert Bentley—on the 4th September I was standing at my own door, and the prisoner came up to me—she had a knife in her hand—I said, "Mrs. Hull, you have got a great deal to laugh at; you had better go in and mind your own business;" she took up the knife and struck me on the nose, which cut it—I bled a great deal.</p>

Q.</hi> You have got the plaster on still? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have had it off—I put it on last Monday again when I went before the Grand Jury—I do not feel inclined to take it off—I was quarrelling with my husband because he was a long time on an errand—I had been to a public-house—I only had a glass of stout—my husband came to the door of the public-house, but he did not fetch me away—he asked me to come—I went directly he asked me—we quarrelled indoors—the prisoner came while we were quarrelling—my husband has a saw—I did take it up—I never touched it—we have not got a four-pound weight—I did not hit the prisoner at all, she struck me first with a knife—I am quite sure I did not hit her with a saw—my husband never struck me in his life—we have a lot of lodgers in our house—I have been up before the Magistrate—I never robbed any one in my life—a man owed me a little money—I had three months—that was the only time.</p>

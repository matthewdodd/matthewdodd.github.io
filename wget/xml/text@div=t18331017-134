On the 20th of September, I met the prisoner at the corner of Brick-lane, in Wentworth-street, about nine o'clock - I had been drinking something, but knew what I was about; I had seen the prisoner once before - she asked me to treat her, and I took her into a public-house, and then we went to her house in <placeName id="t18331017-134-crimeloc732">George-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. What public-house did we go to? A. To the Founder's Arms; there were several of my friends there - we had gin and water, rum and water, and half-and-half - I paid for two glasses of gin and water.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am not the person at all - I never saw him till the 24th; and when I was taken there were two other women there, and he said he could not say that either of these were the women. Witness. I had seen her once before, and talked to her, and I saw her come to bed to me that night - I swear she is the woman.</p>

             (police-constable H 178). The prosecutor said he had been robbed of his watch and pencil-case; he described the prisoner - I had seen her four or five days before, but did not know her haunts - on the Tuesday after she was taken, and said she had sold the watch to a man named Smith - my brother officer went and took him - in going to the office, the prisoner said she did not care what she was done to, so long as Smith was liberated.</p>

            . I am the wife of a police-officer. I searched the prisoner at the station-house, and found nothing on her - while I was stripping her, she said she took good care to throw the pencil-case away, and there was no pencil in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never said such a thing; the first time I saw the prosecutor he came up-stairs with two policemen - there were two other women there; the officer asked him if either of those were the women; he said,"No" - I afterwards went down to get a pennyworth of pepper, and one of them said, by the description, I was one of the women - I said I was not, I would go where they pleased.</p>

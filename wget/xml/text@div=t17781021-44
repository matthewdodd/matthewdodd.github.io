               <p>I wish you would apply yourself to the conduct of the defendant in procuring that warrant? - Being discharged, I think it was towards the middle of June, 1774, I was informed that there was a warrant, charging me with concealing my effects.</p>

               <p>How long is this ago? - Upwards of four years.</p>
               <p>How did you pass the intermediate time from this supposed examination at my Lord-Mayor's; in the first place you describe yourself in a commission of bankruptcy as a pawnbroker and mercer in Queen street, Southwark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had a warehouse too in Watling-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you had that before the commission? - About three or four months.</p>
               <p>You gave an account in your examination that the goods from this warehouse were sent to a supposed correspondent of yours, one Mr. Hallinger at Amsterdam? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that he was indebted to you four hundred and seventy pounds? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you got an account with Mr. Hallinger? - What account I have I entered in the book under the commission.</p>
               <p>You have no other then? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you any book of the goods in the warehouse in Watling-street? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor any account with Mr. Hallinger but what was in the proceedings under the commission? - No.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>The commission I admit, for it will be proved that it was found to be a fraudulent one, upon an issue directed to be tried in the court of King's Bench; but though it was so, the whole of the counsel for the defendants examination is to show the fraud of this commission; the charge against the present defendants, is, that they, from an over anxiety to punish the prosecutor, made use of very improper and wicked measures for that purpose, by procuring the affidavit of two men of the name of Hargrave and O'Neal, (we shall show the sort of men they are presently) they procured these men to make this charge against the prosecutor; and whatever other charge might be true against him, this was a false charge; and it subjected him to be punished as a felon; therefore the examination respecting the fraud of the bankruptcy may be spared.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the defendants. Then you admit him to be a dishonest man.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prosecutor. An honest man or a dishonest man may be charged unjustly.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the defendants. As three or four years are now elapsed, did your assignee recover this four hundred pounds of Hallinger?</p>
               <p>Rigals. I cannot take upon me to say they have.</p>
               <p>I believe you can take upon you to say they have not? - How can I say that.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Try? - Suppose I say no.</p>
               <p>Have they or have they not? - I believe no.</p>
               <p>Are not you sure no? - There is no certainty of any thing; how can I take upon me to say whether they have or have not; how can I take upon me to say whether they have wrote letters or sent any person, they may have done it and I not know it.</p>
               <p>Do you not know upon your oath that there is not a farthing recovered of him?</p>
               <p>Give an answer, is there any thing recovered by your assignees from Hallinger? - I do not believe that there is.</p>
               <p>What was the amount of the debts that you gave in as owing at the time of your commission; have you got the total amount? - I cannot take upon me to say that I have.</p>
               <p>Do you remember to make up the deficiency of those debts, how many notes and bills you gave in as owing to your estate? - I gave in 245 notes, I told the commissioners that three parts of the notes had been paid to persons who had not enquired after them; other notes were due; Mr. Bargrave, one of the commissioners cast them up, and said there was about 1000 l. that might be recovered.</p>
               <p>How many bills of exchange? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>I believe twenty three? - I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>You gave all these in, did you not, as being due to your estates? - Not as being due to my estate, I gave them in as in my possession.</p>
               <p>Not as due to your estate? - Not all.</p>
               <p>Which of them? - I cannot tell, if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177810210042"></xptr> had had the accounts I could have stated which was due, and which not due.</p>
               <p>Have any of these 245 notes and 23 bills been recovered? - Bills! I don't understand what you mean by that; they might be bills that I have been paid, they might be bills that I have paid. I have paid Mr. Wilson 600 l. a year. I gave them as being in my possession under the commission.</p>
               <p>How many of the 245 notes that you gave in were recovered; or were any way recovered? - That I cannot take upon me to say, I have recovered none.</p>
               <p>Don't you know that none of them have been recovered? - I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Why don't you know so? - I don't.</p>
               <p>Of the debts that you owe, I think there is a note that you gave to one of these men that you now think proper to indict, 
               <persName id="t17781021-44-person507">
                  Edward

                  </persName>
            , one of your notes was given in, as owing from you forty pound to the defendant Stack? - Given into where?</p>
               <p>To the commissioners? - Yes. He had a forty pound note of me; he swindled me out of it.</p>
               <p>You was the swindlee there then instead of the swindler. Was Stack one that signed your certificate? - I don't know that he was; I cannot take upon me to say. (The certificate was referred to, his name was not to it.)</p>
               <p>There was another note, I believe, to O'Neal, another of the defendants? - I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Did not you give a note to O'Neal? - I cannot say whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Because you dropped before that you might have seen him.</p>
               <p>"Did you know, O'Neal, said</p>
               <p>"the learned Counsel? Why, yes, I might</p>
               <p>"have seen him before.</p>
               <p>"Now, upon your oath, whether you gave O'Neal a note and for what money? - It is more than probable that I did.</p>
               <p>Yes; because it is certain. Now did you or not give him a note? - Yes; I think I did.</p>
               <p>How came you to give O'Neal a note when you doubted almost whether you had ever seen him before; you had no dealing with him of any sort you say? - No; he applied to me, and had a note of me, and told me he could get it discounted for me.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the Commissioners this? - Yes, I think, I did. I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Yes, you are sure you did not? - I cannot take upon me to say nay. Can you recollect what passed five years ago?</p>
               <p>Counsel. Yes; I could in so material a matter as that.</p>
               <p>Court. Answer the questions; if you don't know; say you don't know.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I ask, upon your oath, did you tell the Commissioners that he had taken it of you in order to get it discounted, or did you not give it in as one of the debts owing from you? - Not as one of the debts to the best of my knowledge, but I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>I asked you about Stack's note. Did you give Stack a note? - He had a note of me.</p>
               <p>For how much money? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you swear that was due, because you said you knew nothing at all of Stack? - Yes; I think I made oath that he had a note of me.</p>
               <p>A note from you to him which was a charge upon your estate; do you know now that you swore that that was due to him? - I don't know that I did.</p>
               <p>Will you say you did not? - I might, probably, as he had a note of me; it was my debt to him, and I was accountable for it and liable to be arrested.</p>
               <p>Then whether this money was owing to Stack or not you don't know; or that you swore it before the Commissioners? - He was to get me money for the note, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>So that was a swindling thing of you by Stack? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had no goods at all of him, but gave him this note to negociate? - I think I had some part in goods that he had; he had got money for the note.</p>
               <p>You say he got the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then how came you to swear that you owed him the money? - The note was due, therefore it was a debt from me.</p>
               <p>Did you give it in as a debt due from you to him? - I very likely might.</p>

             was so obliging as to sign your certificate as a creditor for money lent for 86 l. 4 s. 8 d. do you know that or not? - I don't know that he has signed it.</p>
               <p>You don't know that he has signed it? - No.</p>
               <p>You never was at any meeting where he promised to sign it? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know that he proved a debt of 86 l. 4 s. 8 d.? - I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>Be so good as to give us a little history of this time. I believe you was arrested at the suit of one or other of these gentlemen or creditors, either Wilson or Slater in August 1774? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe you applied to be discharged under the Act of Parliament as a fair bankrupt, claiming the same privileges that an insolvent debtor would have; did you or did you not apply to be discharged? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you make that application to the late Mr. Justice Aston? - Mr. Tew the attorney did for me.</p>
               <p>I believe that was ineffectual, you was refused to be discharged? - Certainly, or else I should not have been four years confined.</p>
               <p>Did you make a second application to the same judge? - Not that I know of; I cannot take upon me to say what the attorney did. I was not discharged.</p>
               <p>Did you not know that a second application was made to the same judge, Mr. Justice Aston? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you know of a third application made to Lord Mansfield? - I have been informed that it was moved in the Court of King's Bench.</p>
               <p>No; we will come to that by and by; was there not an application made to my Lord Mansfield as a judge at his chambers? - No.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Tew has been obliging enough to do this for you unknown to you? - Only the first I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you know of the application to the Court of King's Bench? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You made a very long affidavit yourself, in order to obtain a rule for them to show cause why you should not be discharged? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether you then swore that all these were true debts; that they were fair creditors; and the debts justly due to them? - I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>You did not mean to swear so? - I do not think I did swear so.</p>
               <p>Would you have sworn so? - No, I should not; I think not; if I had read the affidavit.</p>
               <p>Then, if you have made any such affidavit that has slipped your memory, now what became of this application to the court of King's-Bench. - They granted a rule;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177810210045"></xptr> something, I do not know what they term it.</p>
               <p>I will tell you. They granted an issue to be tried upon this simple question, whether your commission was a fraudulent one; yea or no; and it was found fraudulent, was it not? - Yes; I think so.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that? - Yes; I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>So am I, for I happened to be at the trial; then that commission was found to be fraudulent; now upon its being found to be fraudulent, I ask you whether so late as March 1777, you did not apply to the late Lord Chancellor to have this commission superseded as fraudulent? - I applied to Judge Ashhurst in 1776 to be discharged; he told the Clerk that he had seen a record of a verdict; that the commission was fraudulent, and that I could not be discharged as a bankrupt, but must be discharged as an insolvent. I waited till the insolvent act took me up to St. Margaret's-Hill; I was remanded then as a bankrupt; I could not be discharged as an insolvent.</p>
               <p>In March 1777 did not you petition to have this commission superseded, because it was fraudulent? - If I had not endeavoured to supersede the commission, I should have been confined for life.</p>
               <p>And was not that the reason why you applied to have this commission superseded, being fraudulent? - Yes; because it was fraudulent; that was the intent of my Lord Chancellor, by giving me the supersedeas.</p>
               <p>Was it not that because this commission was fraudulent, therefore your discharge was so long withheld from you; that, if you had done all fairly, you would have been entitled to be discharged between the summer of 1774, and the summer of 1777? - I could not blame the judge for not discharging me when those people went and swore that they could prove I had concealed many thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt now I hope that it was fraudulent? - There cannot be a doubt because there is a verdict.</p>
               <p>You was taken from the Poultry Compter before my lord mayor; I ask you whether you did not, while you was in the Compter, tear some papers, and fling them either out at the window or upon the floor? - I tore I believe two or three letters, or a letter that I had in my pocket; I cannot take upon me to say, or some memorandums, or something.</p>
               <p>It is that very something that makes the whole difference; be so good as to say whether Mr. Aiken's name was contained in that something that was tore? - I cannot say it was.</p>
               <p>Do you say it was not? - No; the whole was not bigger than that piece of paper, (about inches six square.)</p>
               <p>Was or not Aiken's name in any paper that you tore in the Compter? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>You knew nothing of him? - I gave him a bond for seven hundred pounds; his name might be on a paper.</p>
               <p>Why was it to be torn when you was taken into custody? - I have a right to tear what is in my possession.</p>
               <p>And I will answer for it you had a reason for tearing it? - I cannot take upon me to say that I had no particular reason.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you had no reason for tearing this paper that had Aiken's name in it? - I do take upon me to say so, as far as I can learn, for I do not know that his name was there.</p>
               <p>Why did not you keep the paper in your pocket? - Because I saw that I was beset.</p>
               <p>Counsel. And so you was afraid of some innocent thing, set down upon that paper, popping out of your pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. What reason had you for destroying that paper? - I had been making some minutes of how I had been treated.</p>
               <p>Counsel. But this paper would help to defend not convict you; did not you think that there was something in them that would bite; you tore them all? - I tore them all! if you had seen the paper you would not have thought much about it.</p>
               <p>I have seen it, and therefore I do think much about it. - What I had been writing was nothing more than the minutes, and I do not know that Aiken's name was concerned about it; it was memorandums of what had passed before I came to the Compter.</p>
               <p>That was your hand writing then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177810210046"></xptr>Court. Then will you swear whether Aiken's name was upon it, you must know that. - No.</p>
               <p>Court. This is a most shameful answer.</p>
               <p>Do the counsel for this prosecution wish to carry this cause on any further?</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prosecution. I have no wish to press the prosecution any further, now I see the nature of it from this man's evidence I am satisfied about it.</p>
               <p>Court. The man can have no credit; it is at least prevarication, and such as will take all kind of credit from him.</p>

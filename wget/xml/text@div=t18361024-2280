                  </hi>. I live in Wood-street, and am a glove manufacturer. The prisoner was in my employ—it was his duty to make sales—he was a confidential servant—I purchased about fifty dozen of French gloves, and on the 5th of September I directed him to force some sales, and ten dozen boxes of 120 pairs were taken by him to Sewell Cross, at knight-bridge, to office them to Mr. Pontez, the glove-buyer there, and particularly to say that I could allow but 1 1/2 per cent on those French gloves—I mean discount, our usual allowance, for our own manufacture, is 2 1/2 per cent—the following day he told he had made the dale of ten dozen, and I par<lb></lb>ticularly questioned him if he had told Mr. Pontez that he was only to have 1 1/4 per cent a dozen allowed on the goods—he told me he had, and</p>

               <p>marked the invoice 1 1/4—I consequently entered them into my own book, and passed them to the account of Sewell, Cross, and Co—when the account was rendered, they denied ever having purchases such gloves—I had no money for them—the money due, including that account, was 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—those ten dozen pairs were worth 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was the money due for them—I saw him them away myself.</p>

I live at 6, Longferry-road, Mile-end, and am a linendraper—on 22d September I went to bed about 10 o'clock—I was the last person up; I secured the windows and doors—I was awakened at about half-past 3 in the morning, by a noise like a hammering at a window, as if a window had been pushed down—I threw up my window and called out, "Police!"—I then saw two men running across from the back of my house towards some vacant land—a constable caught the prisoner, and returned with him—the prisoner said he was standing at the</p>

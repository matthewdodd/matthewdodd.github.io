                  </hi>, I am a beershop-keeper, of 4, Portpool-lane—on 12th January, about 3 in the afternoon, I was in Long-lane—I stopped to look at a crowd—I did not see the prisoner till I caught him taking my watch out of my pocket; as I was coming out of the crowd he put his hand in my pocket and took my watch—I am sure he is the person—I caught hold of him by the collar, and while I was saving the chain he took the watch from the chain—I saw him do that—he up with his fist as if to hit me—I turned round to call a young man, who was with me, and when he came up the watch was gone—I called a constable, and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

On Saturday evening, 17th March, about twenty minutes to 6, I saw the prisoner in a building partly pulled down for the railway in Moor-lane—he was putting something in his pocket—two children were with him, one standing on one side and one on another—that struck me—the prisoner saw me and made a run through the window—I stopped him and asked what he was doing there—he said, "Nothing "—he said, "Let me go"—I told him I should not—he then struck at me—I threw him down, and when assistance came, I took him to the station—another officer searched him—he struck me several times before I threw him down.</p>

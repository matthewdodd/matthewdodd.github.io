                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Noel, of 63, High-street, Cam<lb></lb>den-town. On 23rd Jan., the prisoner came and asked to look at some chil<lb></lb>dren's dresses—I showed her several—she asked if I would send her two or three to look at to try on the child—she left her address, 18, Camden-street—she promised to return the money for the one she took by the person who took the dresses—I sent them by Maria Carter—she brought back no money, nor either of the dresses—I afterwards saw one of the dresses on the prisoner's child, when she was in custody, three weeks after.</p>

When I went to the shop, I asked to look at some dresses, and said if they fitted I would keep one, and if not I would give an order for one; she never named payment to me, nothing was said about payment. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She said if she should alter her mind with regard to the colour, would I make her a pink one at the same price as the one she should take, whichever about fitted the child—I said I would—she said she would send the money back by the person that brought the dresses—I sent the dresses on the faith of what she said—I sent no bill with the dresses.</p>

I received two dresses from Miss Carling, which I took to 18, Camden-street—I gave them to Mrs. Marshall, the landlady, who took them up-stairs to the person—I did not ask for the money—one frock was to be left and paid for, and the other returned—a message was brought down by the servant, which induced me to go away contrary to my orders—I went again, and saw the servant—I did not get either of the frocks again, or pay<lb></lb>ment for either of them.</p>

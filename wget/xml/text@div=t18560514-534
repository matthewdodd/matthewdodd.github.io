On the evening of 13th March, in con<lb></lb>sequence of information, I went to the Royal Oak public house, and found Harriet Washington, with her head on the tap room table, bleeding very furiously from the eye and the nose—the prisoner was there, and a person present gave him into custody for throwing a quart pot at the woman—the woman could not speak—the prisoner said, "I did do it; I did not intend it for the poor woman, I intended it for my wife"—his wife was not there, I did not see her till we got thirty or forty yards towards the station; she followed us.</p>

On the evening of 13th March I was at the Royal Oak, and saw the prisoner there, and his wife, whom I did not know—they were having words—my friend set his beer down on the table, and the prisoner's wife took it up and threw it at the prisoner—he then took up the pot, and threw it—I think it was intended for his wife, who was sitting down—I was standing up, not a yard from her, and it struck me with great force over the eye—I was taken to the hospital—I was there five weeks, and am still an out-patient.</p>

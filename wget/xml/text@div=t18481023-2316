                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my service—on 11th 0ct., about nine o'clock in the morning, I went to the prisoner at his work—I asked what screws he had bought the day before, and what he had given for them—he said he bought four gross at Messrs. Fields, in Broad-street, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Giles, at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a gross, that would be 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him to produce them—I counted two gross and four dozen, which he produced, and I knew he had used about three dozen, as he had been making a mattress-frame—I could count every screw that he had used; that would make up two gross and seven dozen—I am quite sure there were not three gross—I said he must produce the other gross—I went to Messrs. Fields, came back, and asked him again about them, and if he had bought them at Messrs. Fields—he said yes he had—I took him there—he pointed out Robert. Law, and said he bought them of him—Law denied that he had sold him any—the pri<lb></lb>soner still persisted in his statement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Messrs. Fields' service, of Broad-street, St. Giles, ironmongers.

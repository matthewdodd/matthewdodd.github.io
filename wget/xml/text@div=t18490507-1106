On Saturday evening, 21st April, I was alone in my shop—you enter the shop from a door in the passage—about twenty minutes past eight o'clock, a man came into the shop and asked for a watch—I requested him to close the door, which he had left open; he did so—I thought he wanted a watch that had been left to be repaired, and asked him what name it was in—he said, "I want to purchase a watch"—I asked him what price, and he said he was not particular—I showed him two lever watches, and afterwards a third—I said I would recommend him either of the two, which would last</p>

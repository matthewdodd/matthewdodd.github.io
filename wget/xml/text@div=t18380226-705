                  </hi>. On the 10th of February I saw the prisoner in my Husband's shop—it is a chandler's shop in East Smithfield—the prisoner wanted some bacon—there was a person with him—he asked the price of the bacon—I said 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he asked me to let him have it for 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said I could not take it, and then he said he would give me 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—one of them said, "Don't beat the woman down"—they bought some bread and pota<lb></lb>toes, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in all—they paid a five-shilling piece—I gave change, and put the crown into my pocket—it staid there till the next morning—I had no other crown there—when I took it out the next morn<lb></lb>ing I saw it was bad—I am sure it was the same as I took from the last prisoner—it was nailed on the counter, and was given to the policeman last Saturday.</p>

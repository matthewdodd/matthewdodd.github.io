                  </hi>. I live with my parents—my father is an appraiser, in Thornhill-street, Islington. I was playing with some boys on the, 9th of April, in the Chalk-road—I got my hands dirty, and washed them in some water in the road—in pulling out my handkerchief to dry them, I pulled out two half-crowns and two shillings, and they dropped into the rough road—I picked up the half-crowns and one of the shillings, and was look<lb></lb>ing for the other, when the prisoners came up, and Poulton asked me how much I had lost—I told him what I had picked up, and that I was look<lb></lb>ing for another shilling—he asked me to show him what I had found, and I showed it him in my hand—Smith was there at the time, and began searching one of the boys—Poulton then took the two half-crowns out of my hand, and knocked the shilling out of my hand—Poulton said, "I will have four"—Smith took up the shilling and put it into his pocket—they ran off—the boys followed them down the Chalk-road, and called "Stop thief"—Poulton threw stones at them—a gentleman assisted us, and went</p>

               <p>for a policeman—when the gentleman was gone for the policeman, Poulton gave me one half-crown, and said that was the half-crown he had taken from me—when Smith took my shilling—I took him by the collar and held him, and said I would have it—he pushed me and said he had not got it—that he bad got three shillings from the Gas Company, but he had not got my shil<lb></lb>ling, but I am quite sure he had it—the policeman came and took them both.</p>

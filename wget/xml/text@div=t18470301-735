                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 658.) On the morning of the 18th Feb. I was in Bishopsgate-street, and saw the two prisoners standing together against Mr. Teede's shop-door—Lawrence worked at Mr. Teede's—the shop shutters were not taken down—in a few minutes the shop-door was opened by a person inside—the shutters were then taken down by Lawrence, and both the prisoners went into the shop—in a few minutes Brown came out with four sugar bags in his arms—he put them down in a gateway, and directly he put them down, Lawrence came out and went to Brown—I saw Brown look into the bags, put his hand into his pocket, and take out a money-bag—he gave Lawrence some money—Brown then tied the bags up, put them on his back, and went away—I went after him—I stopped him and asked what he had got—he said, "Some sugar<lb></lb>bags," and that he had bought them at Mr. Teede's—I said I was aware of that—I said there was some sugar in them, I must take both to the station—I was searching Lawrence—I said to him, "Have you any money, Lawrence?"—he said, "No"—I said, "You certainly have some"—I found his hand<lb></lb>kerchief, and in it was a shilling, a sixpence, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and some coppers—he then said, "All I had for the sugar and bags was one shilling"—this is a sample of the sugar I found in the bags.</p>

               <p>and am in the employ of the post-office, as a postman—on Monday night, 10th December, I was by the City-road-bridge, going towards Islington—I was not in uniform—the female prisoner came up to me by the bridge, and asked me to go home with her—I consented to do so—I had known her before by sight—I walked along the City-road with her, towards Islington—she said she would go into the City Arms public-house for her key—she went in, remained about a minute, and came out again—we then turned down Graham-street, which is a continuation of Macclesfield-street, and went as far as Hope-wharf, which is on the right-hand side of Graham-street, and leads down to the canal—there is no thoroughfare; the water is at the other end—she then said she should not go home, and said, "Let us turn down here"—we turned down on the right-hand side, near a heap of sand, and stood there talking about five minutes—I then heard footsteps—I turned my head round, and saw the two male prisoners coming down—I said to her, "Who are these?"—she said, "Hush! hold your tongue"—by that time they had got up to me, and asked me what I had to do with that girl—Thomas Radshaw went partly behind me, and Dixon partly in front—the woman then took hold of my chain—I scuffled with the two men some little while, but they got me down—I struggled with them—they both began kicking me brutally on my head—I caught one of them by the leg, and held it—I found a hand on my mouth, and I left go of the leg to take the hand away—I caught the leg several times—I called "Police" and "Murder"—they were some little while doing this—there must have been some alarm, for they then got up and went to the top of Hope-wharf—I ran after them, and saw Thomas Rad<lb></lb>shaw running without his hat—my right eye was closed, and my left filled with blood, so that I could not see which way they turned—I turned back, and picked up my umbrella, and a hat which belongs to Thomas Radshaw; also my hat, which was lying on the ground—I went to the top of the wharf, but the blood ran down my face, and shirt, and trousers, and all my clothes—I was all over mud—I got so faint that I was obliged to be led to a doctor's by two men—I afterwards went home in a cab to my father's, and on my way noticed that part of my chain had gone—it was rather a dark place, but there was sufficient light for me to see the prisoner's face—I missed eighteen pence, which was safe when I was on the wharf with the female prisoner—I have been in the hospital nearly three weeks, and after I came out I went with Sergeant Hooper to Oxford-street, where I came full face with the female prisoner, and I turned round and saw Dixon crossing the road with a constable—I said, "That is the man who assaulted me, and that is the female who assaulted me"—Maria Ballard was with the sergeant.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, 315 <hi rend="italic">N</hi>). On 30th October I went to a house in Oxford-street, just by Regent-circus, and saw Dixon sitting down—I walked in at the door, and he got up to me face to face, and said, "Allow me"—I</p>

               <p>said "Allow <hi rend="italic">me"</hi>—I then said, "Your name is Dixon"—he said, "Yes"—I told him to consider himself in my custody on a charge of robbing and violently assaulting a postman in Macclesfield-street, City-road, and stealing part of a watch chain, and some money—he said, "Let me go outside, and do not make any bother here; can we refer to the parties to-night?"—I said, "No, you will have to go to the station for identification"—as we proceeded arm in arm the prosecutor came up, and said, "There is the man that assaulted me"—I said, "Go away, we do not want you here"—I put him in a cab, and took him to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Dixon. Q.</hi> Did you not object to the prosecutor recognising me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I said, "Go back," and when he said, "That is the man," I found it was too late—I wished you to be properly identified—it was raining heavily on this night—I have visited the scene of the assault, and have measured it—the nearest light is thirty yards from the top of the wharf, and from the top of the wharf to where the prosecutor was assaulted, is twenty-eight yards—that makes fifty-eight yards altogether—the nearest lamp-post is fifty-eight yards from the spot—there is an angle there, but the place is all open—I took another constable, and let him walk down to see if I could recognise him, and I could, as plain as possible, though that was a stormy night—I heard you express a wish for the hospital surgeon to be examined—he is not here, he has left the hospital, and gone to practise in Wales—the surgeon is here who first saw the prosecutor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner Dixon in his Defence stated that Ballard had concocted her evidence in revenge upon him, for occasionally living with the female prisoner; that it was impossible for the prosecutor to identify any person fifty yards from a lamp on a dark rainy night; that he must have been mistaken for another man, and that the prosecutor could not have pointed him out without Ballard's assistance, who pointed him out by saying "There he comes" and who knew that he was to be found in Oxford-street, unconscious of being wanted; that the prose<lb></lb>cutor was not to be believed, at he could not have been going home with the female with only 1 s . 8 1/2 d. in his pocket; that the sudden terror and excitement had disconcerted his brain, and that the Magistrate agreeed in the remark, that if the prosecutor was disqualified from undergoing examination, he was also disquali<lb></lb>fied from identifying a man, and that when charged he acknowledged his name, and requested to be taken before his accusers.</hi>

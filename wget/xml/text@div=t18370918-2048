I recollect the prisoner coming to sleep at my house—I saw him go away with a bundle—I went after him, and found him at the pawnbroker's, in the box, pawning the coat—he consented to go with me to our house, No. 36, Bishopsgate-street—he walked back part of the way, and he said he had no money, would I allow him to go—I said, if he would go into any respectable house, and let me search the bag, I would, and I appointed the Sun Coffee-house—before I got there he</p>

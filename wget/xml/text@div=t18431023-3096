                  </hi>. I keep the Duke of York public-house at Dept<lb></lb>ford. On the 9th of Oct. the prisoner came, and said he was a contractor, under Grisell and Peto, for the extension of the railway, that he had got thirty-five men under him, and asked me to let him have beer for the men, and he would pay me weekly—I believed that, and let him have six gallons that evening—he took it to the work, as he said—his wife took some, and he took some—I went the next morning, and found him at work at a different place, and gave him in charge.</p>

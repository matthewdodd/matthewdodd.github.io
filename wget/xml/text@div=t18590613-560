I keep the Admiral Keppel in High-street, Hoxton Old Town—on Monday, 9th May, about 11 in the morning, the prisoner came and asked for half-a-pint of porter—he put a counterfeit half-crown on the counter—I saw it was bad—I said "You are aware it is a bad half-crown"—he said he had been out on the drink on the Sunday and took it somewhere, but he did not know where; and he did not know it was bad—he felt about his pockets and took out a penny and tendered it to me—I asked why he gave me the half-crown when he had a penny—he said he picked it up off the floor in the bar—I said, "That cannot be, for you never stooped" I am sure he did not—he then asked me to return the half-crown—I said, "No; I shall keep the half-crown, and you too"—he said, "It is no use locking me up"—I said, "I shall do it"—I turned for half a minute, and he ran out—I went and fetched him back, and gave the bad half-crown to the officer.</p>

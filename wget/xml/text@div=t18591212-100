                  </hi>. I am a merchant carrying on business at 66. Friday-street—on the evening of 29th November, I was walking along</p>

               <p>Cheapside, when a man fell down apparently in a fit—I began to assist him—while doing that I felt something at my pocket—I immediately let go of the man and put my hand to my pocket, and caught the prisoner's hand just leaving it—I found that something had gone out of my pocket, and the chain of my watch was dangling down—I said to the prisoner, "You have got my watch"—he ran away—I went after him and seized him—two or three persons got round us, and I saw the prisoner pass something with his left hand to some one near—I collared them both, but they wrestled and got away from me—I followed them, and just about Old-Change, I collared the prisoner and took him back, and gave him in charge—I have not recovered my watch—I did not lose sight of the prisoner—when I crossed the road the first time Cheapside was very clear—I saw the man that had the watch run away—I could have followed him, but I knew the prisoner better—another gentleman ran after the other man but did not catch him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Isaac Newton, of 11, Evangelist-court, Ludgate-hill—I was in Cheapside on 29th October—I saw the prosecutor running after the prisoner; he caught hold of him just by my feet—he said "You have got my watch"—the prisoner said "I have not; let me go"—he then sung out "Father, father;" a young man came up to him, and the prisoner passed something to him with his left hand—I could not see what it was, but it was something that glittered—I said to a gentlemen close by, "Hold that man, for he has got the watch," but he would not hold him—they took the prisoner back to Sweeting's, the oyster shop, and searched him, but found nothing on him.</p>

            . I know the prisoner, and I know Francis Rowe - I was in the Royal Waggon Train, and he was a comrade of mine - I had not seen him for fourteen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040034"></xptr>years - he was discharged in 1823, and is now living at the Naval School, at Camberwell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have not seen my husband for twelve years last June - he left me with a young child, and hearing by several persons that he was dead, I concluded he was so - I told Brown I was not certain whether he was dead - I lived with Brown very comfortably for six years, till his misconduct, (and not mine,) compelled me to act as I did - he is on the point of marriage with another person, and that is the truth of the matter - the turnkey brought a lady to me to know the particulars, and I told her - I have a daughter fourteen years old - Brown knows that I said I was awkwardly situated, as I did not know whether my husband was dead, and he said if I had twenty husbands he would marry me.</p>
               <p>JAMES BROWN re-examined. Q. Upon your solemn oath, when you married her, had you any idea that she had a husband? A. No; she told me her husband went abroad, and died there.</p>

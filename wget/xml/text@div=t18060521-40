             sworn. I live at No. 104, Whitecross-street, at Mr. Salmon's. On the 29th of April, the prisoner at the bar came to our shop, I believe about the middle of the day, to pledge a saw and three planes, I advanced him ten shillings on them.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable, I produce the saw, I received it from Mr. Salmon.</p>
               <p>Nelson. That is the saw I received from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am certain it is my saw, it is worth six or seven shillings, I was using the saw about an hour before I missed it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing at all about that saw; last Monday I went to pledge two saws of my own, and the first place I carried them to, a pawnbroker's in Chiswell-street, I told him I wanted seven shillings, he said that was too much, he would lend me six shillings, he said are they your own saws, I said yes, he said there is a young man has lost a saw, and it has been found in Whitecross-street; as this gentleman would not let me have seven shillings, I went to this gentleman's in Whitecross-street, I laid the two saws down on the counter, I told him I wanted seven shillings, he asked me my name, and I not telling him my own name, I happened to think of the name that that saw was pledged in; the pawnbroker says, have not you any tools here before, I said I have not, he said are you sure of that, he brings me this saw down, and asked me if I knew it, I said I did not, he detained me and sent for the prosecutor, that was the instigation of my being brought here.</p>
               <p>Nelson. In consequence of his bringing the two saws which he just mentioned, I sent for Torry, and his giving the same name, as he had done on the 29th of April, he was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner brought that saw. A. I am certain that he is the identical man; he said it was his own property.</p>

               <p>On Sunday evening, the 6th of May, I was walking up <placeName id="t17810530-32-crimeloc147">Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

Just as I turned into Artiilery Lane, a young man came running up to me, and asked me if I had lost an handkerchief; upon which I put my hand in my pocket, and found my handkerchief was gone. He told me a boy had picked it out of my pocket. I turned back with him: 
               <persName id="t17810530-32-person337">
                  John

             had hold of the prisoner, and he had my handkerchief about his neck. White took it from his neck, and gave it me: the boy said it was his own, and he had had it some time.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Passing along Bishopsgate-street, on Sunday evening the 6th of this month, I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket: he turned up a passage; I followed him, and took hold of his coat; he asked me what I did that for, and I pulled him out into the street, and by that time Mr. Hodgson had returned; but before that, I told him a gentleman had lost his handkerchief, and he pulled it out of his pocket, and threw it about his neck: he said it was the handkerchief he always wore about his neck: that was while he was in the passage.</p>
               <p>Are you quite certain you saw him take it out of the gentleman's pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>( The handkerchief was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>He says he had hold of my coat: Is it a likely thing, while he had hold of my coat, that I should take a handkerchief out of my pocket, and put round my neck?</p>

                  </hi>. I am drayman to Messrs. Goding and Co., Belvidere-road, Lambeth; the deceased, William Knott, was my mate. On Thursday, the 9th of Nov., he was driving, and I was riding on the front plank of the dray—when the accident happened we were just against the Civet Cat, at Kensington—there is barely room for two omni<lb></lb>busses and a dray to pass there—the deceased was driving at a moderate pace—just as we were passing a cart, standing at the corner of the street where the Civet Cat is, two omni<lb></lb>busses came up together, one on each side, but the off one was a little a-head—that was a red one—Clinch drove it—Horne drove the other, which was a blue one—that was on the near side, which was its wrong side—we were all three going towards London—the red one was on the off, its right side, but on the wrong side for passing another carriage—when they came on each side of the dray, the deceased was walking by the side of the dray, conversing with me, against the front plank, which I was sitting on—he was in a place where, if unmolested, he could have had command of his horses, and driven his dray properly—the red omni<lb></lb>bus was coming furiously, but the blue one stopped just as it came alongside; I did not see at what pace it came up—the red one went galloping by at a furi<lb></lb>ous rate, and went on—its coming at that furious rate, and their whipping the horses on each side the dray, caused the alarm to our horses—at that time something, I did not see what, took the deceased off his standing, while the omnibusses were by the side of the dray—the horses in the dray made a start from the flogging of the horses on each side of them, and attempted to run away—they ran about twenty yards—Knott was hanging at the front chain of the front pin of the dray at the time the horses started—he was taken off his feet—when I saw the danger, I tried to get hold of him as I was sitting on the dray, but I could not—I jumped from the dray as quick as possible, ran to the fore-horse's head, and stopped the horses—they were some distance from the blue omnibus—it was then stopping—the red one did not stop at all—I looked back, and saw a congregation of persons round Knott, just pick<lb></lb>ing him up—I did not see the wheel pass over him, because I was in the act of stopping my horses—my back was towards him—Mr. Oak sent for his cart, and his man, and a constable took him to the hospital—I was obliged to go on with my dray—I did not know either of the prisoners before.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the deceased properly the driver of the dray, or were you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Generally I was—he was the foreman, but we took it by turns—I was the driver—he was my mate to render me assistance—we generally make it a rule for one to drive out and another home—it is our own rule—the proper place for the driver is not generally speaking at the head of the foremost horse—sometimes we have a young horse in the shaft, and are obliged to attend to him—we had not got a young horse on this occasion—we had an old one in the shaft—no doubt the driver must be at the head of the foremost horse, but if he wanted to ask me a question, he must come back to the dray—he asked me, "Do you know what turn we are going to have? "—we have long journeys sometimes—one man is quite sufficient to drive two horses, and we give one another the chance to rest ourselves on the front plank of the dray—we had put our beer down at the Swan public-house, Hammersmith—the Civet Cat is two miles or thereabouts from there—I drove down the road, and was sitting on the dray coming back, till we came to the Civet Cat—I had not been sitting there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184401010019"></xptr>
               <p>all the while—the deceased said, "Get up, and have a ride"—he had just the same wages that I had—I had not been riding on the shaft from Ham<lb></lb>mersmith to Kensington—I had been driving my horses as usual, from the Swan to the Civet Cat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not just now say that you took it by turns, one to drive out, and the other home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I drove out, the deceased drove home—he drove all the way from the Swan—I had been on the plank about half way from the Swan to the Civet Cat, for a mile—I had no whip in my hand—I had no command of the horses where I sat—the deceased was talking to me by the side of the plank where I was sitting—he was in a situation to have control over the horses at times—when he attempted to get forward towards the horses the omnibus was alongside of him—if he had been at the head of the horses, he would have been able to stop them, certainly—if he had been in front he could have put his hand to the rein of the shaft horse, and stopped him directly, and if I had been in front instead of riding I could have done it—had not the near-side omnibus been there the deceased would have been at liberty, and could have cleared himself—it was about four or five yards from the place where the blue omnibus stopped to the place Where the deceased fell—I cannot say exactly, for I jumped off the dray when I saw the danger—my back was toward him when I was in the act of stopping my horses—I will swear Horne whipped his horses—I saw them both whip their horses, the blue omnibus was not going at a rapid rate—it was alongside the dray when I first saw it—I attempted to take the deceased by the collar, but could not—I am confident I did not take hold of him—I did not attend the first coroner's inquest—I did the adjourned one—I was not summoned to the first, and knew nothing of it.</p>

               <p>the dray some distance, on account of the dray going at so slow a pace—the two omnibusses were abreast—we were not able to pass, the road being narrow and vehicles coming from London—when we came to an open space near the church, which stands back, the blue omnibus attempted to pass on the near side—it pulled out a little to pass, and just at that time the red omnibus also attempted to pass, and did pass, just at the time the dray had arrived just by a post at the corner of the Civet Cat—the red omnibus, at the time it passed, was driven at the rate of nearly seven miles an hour, or between six and seven—I cannot say whether the horses were trotting or galloping—I saw the driver of the dray walking along by the side of the horse in the shafts of the dray, with a whip on his right shoulder—at that time the blue omnibus was trying to pass, but by that time the dray had arrived a little further, where the road runs rather narrow, and there was scarcely an opportunity for it to pass—just at that time the dray-horses had started off—the red omnibus was passing just at that time, and had arrived to about the first horse, the leader of the dray—I cannot say what the driver of the red omnibus was doing at the time, for seeing the man hanging to the shaft of the dray took my atten<lb></lb>tion off—I saw the dray-horses start off into a kind of canter—I cannot say what occasioned them to do so, my attention was directed to the man clinging to the shaft of the dray—at the same time, his fellow-servant, who was sitting on the first plank of the dray, put his hand out, as in the act to catch hold of the deceased, to assist him and hold him on, as it were—it appeared to me as if he let go of the man, and the moment he did so the deceased fell off on his back, rolled over on his face, and the wheel went right across his back—I got off the omnibus, and assisted him up, and he was taken to the hospital—the blue omnibus was standing still at the time.</p>

WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see any thing at all like furious driving? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—it was impossible for Clinch to be driving furiously, the mere length of the dray was not sufficient to spring his horses into great speed—we had been walking behind the dray for some distance, and a driver could not have sprung his horses into a greater speed than six or seven miles an hour merely the length of the dray—I was sitting outside in front, and had a full view of the whole—no one could have had a better view than I had—the deceased, if he had had presence of mind could have got on the causeway—I distinctly saw Chapman catch hold of the deceased by the collar, and as soon as he let him go he fell—the dray horses were going very slow when I first saw them.</p>

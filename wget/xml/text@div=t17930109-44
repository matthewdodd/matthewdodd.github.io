               <p>On the 26th of December, the day after Christmas day, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw a person whom I suspected he had these pots in his apron, I did not immediately know what it was; I followed him and I hit him on the shoulder, and asked him what he had got there, he gave me some evasive answer; I said no resistance, and he let them fall out of his apron; I said as you have carried them for your own pleasure, you shall now carry them for mine, (or I will break a leg or arm;) to Marlborough-street, he carried them to great Marlborough-street, to the Police office there; I first saw him as I came out of great Crown-court, in Dean-street, Soho.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, of Thackeray Square, Streatham—on Thursday, the 20th September, I was at the Surrey County Lunatic Asylum painting in No. 2 Ward in the gallery, between six and seven in the morning—I saw the prisoners there and a person named Tite—he was in bed in a cell when I went into the ward, in a little bedroom which leads into the gallery—the door of the room was open—I could see into the cell—I don't know the number of it—there was nobody else there when I went in, but the attendant or warder of the ward (Sims) asked Tite to get up and dress himself—he refused to get up—Sims fetched him his clothes, and put them into the cell for him to dress himself—the two prisoners went into the room, but who assisted the man to dress I cannot say positively—while he was in the act of getting up, dressing, he came out and said that he would strip himself before the doctor and show his marks—when he was dressed he came out of the cell and went into a recess—there was a settee there—he laid on it and coughed, and tried to spit—it is just at the corner of his own room—I thought he was going to vomit—he then went and sat on the settee on the opposite side of that recess—he then got up and swore, and made use of bad language, saying he would strip himself before the doctor, and he would be the death of the first b—he came across—he walked along the gallery at my back, to-wards No. 1, and took hold of a chair—I did not see him raise the chair to strike any one—I turned round in an instant, and found the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186610220144"></xptr>
               <p>Burton trying to throw him down—he threw him down on the ground—Morgan came in just at the time the whistle was blown—Sims blew the whistle, and Morgan was in the act of coming into the ward from the laundry—he had been out—it is correct that Sims and Burton were in the ward—Sims blew the whistle, and Morgan came from No. 1—there are two doors leading from 1 to 2—Burton threw Tite down, somewhere about the same time that Morgan came in—it was done so quickly when Morgan came in—he fell on the man Tite, and punched him with his fists—he went down on his knees—I will not attempt to say whether it was accident or wilful—he was down on him on his knees, and striking him on the body with his fists—I cannot say where his knees were—they were close to him—I did not take particular notice of the position of the men—Burton was at the man's head—he had got his head down, holding him by the back—I never counted the blows—he might have struck him a dozen times, or less—the blows were struck about the body, about the breast.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I may take it, I suppose, that you don't know any<lb></lb>thing about the fight between the two lunatics on the night before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I can see that plan, that is the gallery—I was on an oblique direction to No. 10—I was towards No. 1 way—I was working opposite the next room to No. 2—I was at work at the door which opens into the gallery—the door was open, and I had got my back turned to the gallery—I did not see everything that took place in No. 10—I did hear the lunatic use violent language; he said he would strip his b—self, and show himself to the doctor—he swore very much—he was excited, of course—it was after he left the cell that he threatened to murder anybody who came near him—he refused to get up—he went into the recess alone—I was still at No. 2—I did not feel at all alarmed—he could have struck me with the chair as well as anybody else—there was a chair standing near the glass door, very handy—he seized that chair—how he took it up I cannot say, I did not turn round to look—Sims, the attendant, then blew the key, which acts as a whistle—I turned round and saw Burton throw Tite down, and Morgan came in at the door and fell on him and punched him—Sims was close handy when I saw the man seize the chair—we commenced painting in that ward on the Monday morning—I believe this was the fourth day we had been there—there were other painters at work; one was in the room directly opposite Tite, that would be No. 4, that was a man named Conn; the other was at the fireplace—this was between six and seven in the morning—the first time I talked about this was on Saturday morning—this happened on the Thursday—my mate Conn talked about it when we got out to breakfast, and we said we did not think it was right, we thought it was ill-treatment—no notice was taken of it—the conversation was re<lb></lb>newed at dinner-time—we did not tell it direct to anybody, but there was a man sat in the shop at work who has been there for a number of years, and it appears that he afterwards made a report—he is a bricklayer—I told the doctor on the Saturday when I was sent for.</p>

               <p>on 20th September in doing some work at the County Lunatic Asylum—I went to work about ten minutes past six in the morning—I was working in this gallery No. 2 at the fireplace—I could not see into Tite's room from there—I had a full view up and down the gallery—between six and seven in the morning, while at work, I saw Tite walking about the gallery in an excited state, and he walked towards the end of the gallery, took up a chair and raised it over his head—the next instant the door of the gallery opened—a patient entered, and an attendant, Morgan, afterwards, who rushed at Tite and threw him down—he put his knee on his stomach and punched him the ribs—he struck him four or five times, but the whistle was blown, and the other attendant came—Burton and Sims were there at the time this was being done by Morgan, and Hunt came afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, of Streatham—on 20th September I was working at the Surrey County Asylum, No. 2 ward—I was at work at No. 4, opposite No. 10—the door of No. 10 was open—I could see into it—the first thing that attracted my attention was the patient hallooing—I turned round, looked into the cell, and there saw Morgan kneeling on the patient's ribs with both his knees, striking the man with his right hand on the breast, and holding him by the throat with his left—this was between six and half-past in the morning—I heard Tite complaining of the ill-usage he received—he got up and stood on the floor, and said that he would pull his shirt off and show the doctor—then Morgan threw him again, and rammed his head on the floor, and the blood flew out of him on to the floor—he knocked the blood out of the side of his head—while this was going on Burton and Sims were standing looking on—this took place in the cell—I then saw Burton take Tite by the back of the neck and drag him to the sink—a very little while afterwards I heard a whistle blown—within a few minutes—it was all done in a few minutes—when Burton took him to the sink I heard a choking sound, like a man being half strangled—Sims and Morgan went towards that way, but whether they went to the sink or not I cannot say—after that I heard the whistle blown—I came out, and I saw Burton take the patient by the back of the neck and throw him on the ground three times—I could not say what Morgan was doing then—I was so upset that I cannot say whether I saw Morgan or not—Tite was then put into his cell again, I believe by Burton—I could not be positive—I could not say exactly whether it was by Burton alone, being upset—I could not say with certainty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not see this affair of the chair then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I saw nothing done with a chair—I was at work inside—I don't recollect seeing the man who was at work at No. 2—I was not aware he was there—the two first <hi rend="italic">rounds</hi> commenced in the cell where Tite was—there was Morgan and Tite, and Sims and Burton were looking on—only Morgan and Tite were in the cell—Sims and Burton were standing looking on at the door—I could see between them—I saw Morgan kneeling on the patient in the cell on the floor—the patient was naked—it went on I suppose five or six minutes before the patient came out—he came out dressed—Burton was with him then, and took him to the sink—they were there perhaps four or five minutes—I did not see them come out of the sink—the next I saw was Burton take the patient by the back of the neck and chuck him down on the floor—that was in the gallery No. 2, near No. 1—they were close to No. 1 door—I know now that Kennedy was at work at No. 2 cell—I was not aware that Fraser was at work—the patient was not violent until after he had his walloping.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he violent at any time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw him violent, not at all, not till after Morgan and Burton had done with him. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he was violent in his room, because he said, after the first round, "I will pull my shirt off, and I will show my body to the doctor," and then Morgan threw him down again and hit his head on the floor, that was when the blood spurted out of him, not from his eyes or nose, only from a scratch—the blood came out of his head from the ramming on the floor, from his eye and his forehead—I have never said anything about blood before—I was never asked the question—I did not see them beat him again when they got him into the cell—they put him in, and locked him in—that was after they brought him from the sink—I have been working there since June—I am only a casual hand—I never saw any cause for beating Tite—he used threatening language afterwards—not in the cell—I never heard him there—he said he would kill the doctor, and so he would the attendants—he didn't say anything about a fight he had had the night before with a patient of the name of Burgess—it was after all was over that he threatened to kill the doctor—not in the cell, in No. 2 gallery—Tite told me that privately—I had a private conversation with him—he said so in the gallery after this affair, when he was sitting in the recess lamenting his pain.</p>

               <p>Morgan about seven months—a person named George Tite was a lunatic in the asylum—I believe Sims was the person who had the charge of the ward in which Tite was—it was the duty of the prisoner to assist Sims, if he required them, certainly—on the morning of the 20th September I saw Tite in the airing yard—I saw him first at six in the morning in bed—he was then asleep—I inquired about him, in consequence of having heard something that had taken place the previous night—I did not speak to him then—I saw him at nine o'clock in the yard—he was limping about, and very much bent—in consequence of some communication he made to me, I spoke to Burton—I stated to him that I heard that he was concerned in the affair which took place between six and seven that morn<lb></lb>ing, and asked him to let me know what it was—I stated to him that I had heard there had been a disturbance in the ward in the morning be<lb></lb>tween George Tite and his attendant, and that he had been called to assist and was present the whole time, and I wished to know the whole parti<lb></lb>culars of it—Burton then stated that he saw George Tite in the adjoining ward in an excited state, and that on heating the alarm whistle given he went into the ward to assist the attendant Sims, who was then in charge of the patient—he said that Tite had a chair in his hand, and was threat<lb></lb>ening to strike somebody, and that he along with Sims went to take the chair from him, and that a scuffle had then ensued between the three parties—he said that he did not use any more force than what was necessary to place the patient in his own room—when I said to him that Tite had received very considerable injuries, and that something more than mere restraint had been resorted to, he said that he had not done anything more than what he considered to be necessary for placing the patient into a single ward—that was all that took place between me and Burton—I had no conversation at all with Morgan—I saw Burton frequently about the asylum about seven and nine in the morning—I did not see Morgan until nine o'clock—Burton made no communication to me previously to my speaking to him—it was Sims's duty to have stated the occurrence that took place to me—I have been seven years head attendant in the asylum—I have not heard the evidence given here to-day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross<lb></lb>examined. Q.</hi> How long had Burton been in that employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four years—I have had no complaint to make against him—the men who are taken there have approved characters, or they would not be taken—they do not go through a period of probation—we do not, as a fact, prefer men of great physical strength—we take small weak men—they are not all refractory patients that we have—it is a matter of selection afterwards as to the warders—No. 2 ward is not a refractory ward—the refractory ward is No. 3—Tite was not a refractory patient—he had been so when he was subject to fits—I mean to say distinctly at that time he was not a refractory patient—I heard there had been a disturbance between Tite and Burgess—not a regular fight—Burgess knocked Tite down—I do not know where he hit him—I did not see it done—that was merely on the report of Burton—Burton told me that Tite had had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with Burgess—that was not at the time that I had the conversation with him; it was earlier in the morning—I know that he refused to dress in the morning till something that was in his clothes was given to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical attendant at the County Lunatic Asylum, Wandsworth—about half-past nine o'clock on Thursday morning, the 20th September, Tite came and asked me to examine him, and I did—he had rather a severe abrasion on the cheek bone, and various bruises on his body, the worst of which was over the breast bone, and his mouth was very sore—he complained very much of the inside of his mouth—I did not see any laceration, but his gums appeared swollen—I think they were in such a state that blood might have flown from then an hour or two previously—his mouth was so sore that I ordered him beef tea for his dinner—the bruises were very lightly apparent at that time, but a day or two afterwards they became much more developed—he was bruised on the hips, and he complained of his right arm, but there was nothing of importance to be seen on the arm—I think some of the bruises must have been inflicted as recently as that morning—the discolouration of a braise is usually complete in about six hours after, if it is not a very deep-seated bruise, and in this case the discolouration was not complete on that mor<lb></lb>ning—my examination was about twenty minutes past nine—I think if the injuries were inflicted about seven o'clock, or a little before, in my judg<lb></lb>ment that would coincide with the appearance that I saw—the one on the cheek bone I would not be certain about—I think that might have been caused the night before—I will not speak at all positive as to that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any report made to you during that morning by anybody in reference to an act of coercion or seclusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We had no report on that morning, but in the weekly report there was an entry of his having been secluded—this report came in after that morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am an attendant in the Surrey County Lunatic Asylum, in ward No. 3, and have been so for sixteen months—on the night of 19th September last, about seven o'clock, I saw the patients Tite and Burgess together—as I and Morgan were passing we heard a rush and a fall on the floor—I went immediately to the spot, and saw Tite rising from the floor very much excited—Burgess wag in the act of kicking him at the time—I stepped between them and parted them—the contest between them lasted some five or ten minutes—when I first saw Tite he was on the floor—there was a struggle between them—I think they were about equally matched—they were both down—I did not see Burgess kick Tite, he was in the act of kicking at him when I stepped between them and separated them—some few minutes afterwards they got together again, and I saw Burton, Morgan, and Sims with them—Tite was very much excited, and he threatened to kill Burgess the first oppor<lb></lb>tunity he had—they tried to pacify him, but it appeared in vain, and they undressed him and put him to bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attendant in this institution, and have been so upwards of three years—I was in charge of the attendants over the patients—on Wednesday, 19th September, about half-past seven o'clock, I saw Tite and Burgess fighting—Tite picked up a log of wood to strike at Burgess, and Burgess, to defend himself, closed with Tite, and they both fell down together—Burgess recovered his feet first, and kicked Tite several times on different parts of the body—they were then separated, and Burgess was taken away—Tite was very much excited—Burton told him to go and sit down, and keep himself quiet—there was a bruise on Tite's cheek, slightly bleeding—he refused to sit down, and we undressed him and put him to bed—we were obliged to use force to do so—I afterwards examined his pockets and found upwards of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money and a sharp instrument, a piece of steel between two pieces of stick—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he must have made it himself—I reported this matter to Dr. Anton, the same evening, verbally—I believe Burgess did not receive any bruises—I did not see or hear anything of it—we put Tite into a room by himself, and locked him up—it was not a padded room—he was not so violent as to require that—next morning as I passed his door I said, "Tite, it is time to get up and have a wash"—he gave me no answer—some few minutes later I spoke to him again, and requested him to get up—he did not move, and I went and took the bedclothes off of him, and then attempted to dress him, which he</p>

               <p>resisted and refused—at the same time Morgan was passing the door, and I asked him to assist me, and he came to do so—as we were pulling his drawers on Burton was passing—Tite then flew at Burton and caught his arm in his mouth; then, loosing the hold of Burton's arm, he caught Morgan by the testicles—he was very much excited—Morgan left, and went away to the laundry—Burton and I took him away from Morgan, and at last succeeded in dressing him—Morgan cried out for help, and he said he felt sore afterwards—after Tite was dressed he walked to the sink in front of Burton and me, with Burton's hand resting on his jacket collar—I searched him after his clothes were put on—he took the jacket off to wash himself, and after that he went and sat down and was quiet for a minute or so—he sat on a settee in a recess opposite the attendant's room door—he le left the sink and went quietly back to the recess—I am sure of that—he then came to me at the attendant's room door opposite the recess, and asked me for his money and his knife—I told him it was all right, the doctor had it—he made no answer—he was quiet then—he turned away and went to the other end of the gallery, near to No. 1, where there is a glass door—I did not observe that he said anything as he went along—he might have been talking to himself—I saw him pick up a chair, and he stood near the door of No. 1 and said that he would smash any b—man that came near him—he was very violent indeed, and very much excited—just at that moment Morgan came through the door from the laundry, the door near the sink siding with No. 1 glass door—Tite was against the glass door, there was about two feet between the door Morgan came through and the glass door—Tite said, "Now, you b—I will do for you"—Morgan, to defend himself, closed with Tite, and they both fell on the floor—I blew my signal whistle for assistance, and Burton came up immediately; it was his duty to come, he was bound to come—he assisted in taking Tite from Morgan—they were on the ground together—Morgan held him down while I took his shoes off—that was after we took him into the single room—it is not true that Morgan knelt on his chest and punched him in the ribs—Tite was very strong when excited, most patients are—he did not display considerable force that morning—they merely fell together, and then Tite was taken from Morgan—there was a struggle while they were on the ground—when we succeeded in getting him away wo took him to his room—he was violent going along—we merely shoved him before us—he was in front of the three of us, Burton, Morgan, and me—I don't remember that he said anything—when we got him into his room he sat himself on the floor, and I took off his shoes while Burton and Morgan were holding him—he kicked at me once, and he struggled with his feet to prevent my taking off his shoes—I took them off one at a time and threw them on the floor—we only took off his boots, neck-handkerchief and braces—that is a usual thing to do to prevent the patient strangling himself—during the whole time none of us used more violence than was necessary to control him—we merely held him, and kept him from striking us—when they use force to us it is necessary for us to use force—we succeed in quieting them by that means—they are susceptible to fear—I reported the case to the head attendant at the time, directly he was locked up, after the boots, handkerchief, and braces were taken from him—I gave a full report of what had happened verbally—Tite is violent at times—this was one of those occasions.</p>

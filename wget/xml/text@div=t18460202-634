                  </hi>. I live at No. 40, Church-street, Rotherhithe. I am the wife of Peter Stacey—we keep a beer shop—on the 20th of Jan., on going down stairs at night I noticed a door closed which I usually left open—I put my hand against it, and felt something against it, some resistance, something outside, and on my shaking it the handle of a broom fell—on open<lb></lb>ing the door there is a window, as you come to the bottom of the stairs, which shows light into the bar—I saw the gas alight, and saw a man standing with his back against the window, with somethings lying on the table, he appeared to see me because he ran right to the door and escaped—I think the door must have been on the jar, closed, but not latched,—I did not hear him lift the latch—he had no shoes on—he had on a round jacket, and a cap, and cord trowsers—the gas was burning in the room—I missed four sovereigns and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver—I had left the money in a box, wrapped up in a piece of paper in a closet on the stairs overnight—some articles had been removed—a tea-caddy was taken off the mantle-piece with 1/2lb. of tea in it—I had seen the prisoner at our house the night before, but do not remember seeing him for several weeks before—I will not positively swear he is the man I saw in the parlour—but I have every reason to believe he is.</p>

I said, "I don't know, you had better call again," he went to the door and I had given information about him—I did not ask why he thought master wanted him—I thought he would run away if I questioned him—I could not detain him—I went immediately to the station—I was disturbed about a quarter past two o'clock in the night.</p>

I am the witness's husband—I was the last person up—the house was quite secured—I went to bed at twenty minutes after eleven—I fastened the back doors—I went into the yard twice after I shut the front door—the street door was quite fastened—when the alarm was given I got up—my wife said something, when I came down—I went to the back door and found it shut, but the side part of the door jamb was broken away, a few boards taken out and a hole large enough for an arm to be put through and unbolt the door—I found a pair of shoes near the door, and outside the door a chisel, which I gave the policeman—my house is in the parish of Rotherhithe.</p>

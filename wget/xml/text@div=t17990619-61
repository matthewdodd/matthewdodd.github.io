               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going down Thames-street and a person asked me to work, I went to work; and after that, I went to the foreman of the works, he told us all to go down stairs, and that man that is standing there, was there then; there was a tub standing in the middle of the floor, I went towards it, and we all stood round it; after standing a little while, this man happened to see me near the tub, and said, I had been taking coffee; he came up to me and robbed me down; they went to the door and whispered together, and after whispering, he said, now he had got a b-y backed soldier, and hoped he had got a cock.</p>

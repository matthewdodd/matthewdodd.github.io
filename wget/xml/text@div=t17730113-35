I am servant to Mr. Hobsendorf; while he was gone to chapel I was alone in the house; between eleven and twelve the prisoner came on a visit to me; I remember I went up stairs with him to look at some pictures; I went down stairs and left him up stairs; we were separate from each other about five minutes; I am not certain that he staid up stairs, or whether he went down stairs with me I cannot say, but I am certain I went into the kitchen to dress myself, and that five minutes must have passed between the time of his being separated from me and my seeing him again; but whether he was up stairs, or in what part of the house at that time I cannot form any opinion. It is the custom of my master always to lock the door of his bed-chamber, and I never went into the chamber to make the bed but when my master was in the dining room.</p>

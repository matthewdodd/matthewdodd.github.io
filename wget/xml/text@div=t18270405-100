In consequence of information, about three weeks ago I called in Avis, the officer, and searched the hay-loft about half-past nine o'clock at night - we found, in a hogshead, part of a Gloucester cheese, which had a mark on it - we left it there, and I afterwards missed a part of it, and went with Avis to Eary's lodging, who was our carman; I found two pieces of cheese there, which corresponded with the cheese I had seen in the hay-loft - I found part of a ham there; I told Eary we had been robbed, and had long suspected it, and asked if that was not part of the cheese which we had found in the hay-loft; he said it was - I had made him no promise or threat - he said he had bought the ham of Procter, one of our men, for 7d. per pound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where is this loft? A. At the back of our premises - we have three carmen and six porters, our other servants do not go to the warehouse where this cheese was - I was not present when it was marked, but I saw it after it was marked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you afterwards go to Gaisford's lodging? A. Yes, I found some eggs, bacon, and lard there - he said, he had taken the lard from our premises some time ago, and the eggs he had stopped out of his rounds when eggs fell from eight to ten a shilling - he had delivered eight to the customers and kept two; the bacon he said he had received from his cousin.</p>

The day that I missed the Hudson's Bay martins I charged him with taking them, I only missed them at that time. The person that he sold them to came to me and told me of it, and said he had bought more of him. I took the prisoner before Mr. Fielding, and there he confessed he had taken them, and three fox skins more than Mr. Arnold had bought of him.</p>

            . I am a headborough, and took the prisoner into custody; he was carried before Mr. Fielding, where he made a voluntary confession, upon being charged with taking the skins, and begged forgiveness. [The Hudson's Bay martins produced in court.]</p>
               <p>Mrs. Arnold. The prisoner at the bar brought these Hudson's Bay martin skins to our house, and said there were a large quantity of them just come from abroad, of different sorts, that these were he had brought on shore, and mine was the first house he had been at. I asked him if he was a furrier. He said no, he was quite a stranger in town, and knew no furriers. I asked him if he knew any journeymen. He said no; and making a very good appearance, I bought them of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Arnold. I live at the corner of Cornhill, near to the Mansion house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had 68 martin skins in my shop, and I lost 42, here are 40 in court.</p>
               <p>Q. did you lose them all at one time?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They were taken away at different times.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence, but called his master, the prosecutor, to his character.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The prisoner had been with me about six weeks and behaved exceeding well; he has worked till the blood spun out of his fingers ends, but was not of the trade; he is a cook, and had hired himself to be a cook to an India captain.</p>

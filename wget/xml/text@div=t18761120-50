                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Markstay—on the 6th September last, I was awoke up early in the morning and found my stacks were all on fire; they consisted of two barley stacks, two wheat stacks, and a straw stack, and there were also two waggons or vans which stood between the stacks just as they had done harvesting, and some ladders, ropes, and all kinds of things—the stacks stood about a quarter of a mile from my house, and about 4 or 5 yards from the road—the straw stack stood nearest the road and the others stood all in a row—when I got there they were all on fire—I was insured, the damage done we considered to be between 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not see anything of the prisoner; I think the fire began at a straw stack—it was 12.20 when I was called, and the stacks had been on fire for sometime.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the Colchester borough police—on Wednesday, the 6th September, a few minutes after two in the morning, I saw the prisoner outside the police-station; that would be some<lb></lb>where about 5 miles from the fire—he said "Sergeant, I have met with an accident"—I asked him "What kind of an accident?"—he said "I have accidentally set fire to a haystack; I sat down on the bank by the side of the road to light my pipe and threw the lucifer over my shoulder "—I took him into the police-station, and in about an hour an inspector came in—I then</p>

               <p>took him to the county police-station—on going there he said "I never knew that the stack was on fire until I felt the warmth at my back "—he was sober; I was in uniform—I handed him over to the superintendent of the County police, and stated the case to the superintendent in his presence—he then said that he saw someone come out of the house not dressed, and that he then left and came on to Colchester—he said that he attempted to put the fire out, but the wind was too strong and the fire ran all over the stacks—he looked very wild and very frightened—the night was windy and wet.</p>

I am a police sergeant, stationed at Great Cogglesshall, Essex—that is about five miles from Markstay—I was on duty on the night of the 5th September—my attention was drawn to a light in the sky—I looked for a second or two and saw it was a fire—I then looked at my watch and it was 12.25—I went to the fire—there was a great blaze then, and it must have been blazing for some time before—one side of the stack may get very hot before there is a very great blaze.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Kent constabulary, stationed at Canterbury—I know the prisoner—about 11.15 on the night of the 22nd August last I was called to a fire in Hollow Lane, near Canter<lb></lb>bury—I proceeded there and found a straw stack burning and also part of another—there were two or three engines there—the stack belonged to Mr. Collard—with the aid of the engines and plenty of water the fire was prevented from spreading further—I went to the city police-station at Canterbury and there found the prisoner—an inspector informed me in bis presence that he saw the prisoner standing outside the police-station door and took him in thinking that he was a deserter; that he searched him and found a discharge upon him; that he then told him to go, but after he got outside the prisoner turned round and said "I may as well tell you that I set fire to the straw stack, but that I did it accidently when lighting my pipe "—I enquired of the inspector whether he found any lucifer matches or a pipe upon him—he said "No; but the prisoner stated that he had only one match, and that he threw that away "—I told him I should detain him and charge him with having wilfully set fire to the straw stack—he again said that he did it accidentally—I took him before the Magistrate next day; he was remanded until the following Saturday, and ultimately discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bainbridge-street, Bloomsbury, and am a stone-dresser; I am employed by the surveyor of the pavements at St. Giles. I was working in Russell-square on the 24th of May—I went into the Mews, and saw the prisoner put two stones into the cart, and go off with it—I had a large heap of stones in different parts—I saw him go out of the Mews with the cart full; but I did not see where he got more than two stones—these are like the stones in the Mews—I cannot swear they are the same.</p>

I live in Museum-street, Bloomsbury, and am sur<lb></lb>veyor of the pavements of St. Giles and St. George's Bloomsbury—my foreman called on me in taking the prisoner to Hatton-garden—I saw the cart after it was in the yard, it was loaded with stones—I did not compare them with any that we have in the parish, but I have no doubt they are the same, because there are no others in the Mews—we have two stones here that were taken by the prisoner—those were found in the cart—we had many stones in Upper Montague Mews—I did not authorize the prisoner at many person to carry any stones away.</p>

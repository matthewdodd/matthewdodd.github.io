            . I am butler to Mr. Canning, his house almost joins the Almshouses. On the 26th of April, about two o'clock in the morning, I was at Mr. Canning's gate, leading to Kensington, I heard a knocking, I went to the house and called to the servant Matthew, and we went together to where the knocking continued; I went close to the man, it was dark. I observed he had something between his knees, and he was chopping. I asked him what he was doing of, he said he was chopping some wood; he got up and ran away, I pursued him and caught hold of him, he got loose again, tumbled into a ditch; he got out and tried to get away the second time; I then caught him, and he struck me over the hand with something which I wrested from him, it proved to be a piece of pipe; I then led him into Mr. Canning's house, and secured him, and in the morning I went for an officer. In our way back we went to the place, there were several bits of lead chopped, we matched the lead, it exactly fitted with the remaining piece, he told me that the piece of lead he had in his hand he was knocking up</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 26th of April the last witness came for me, I went to Brompton; in our way we went to see what the man had been chopping; I found the head of the pump in a ditch, where it had been buried; this piece that the first witness took from him matched with the piece of lead remaining to the pump. It is part of the pump of the almshouses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to sleep at an outhouse by the road side; I saw three pieces of lead lay close by the road-side, I got a piece in my hand, I was knocking to see if I could break it. I never took it from the pump.</p>

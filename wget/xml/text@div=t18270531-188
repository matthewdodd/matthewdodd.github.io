            . On the 23d of April, about six o'clock in the evening, I was walking with two gentlemen in Piccadilly; an officer tapped me on the shoulder, and asked if I had lost my handkerchief; I felt, and it was gone - he then showed it me. I have no mark on it, but I have every reason to believe it is mine; it is the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Were there many people there? A. Yes, a considerable crowd and many boys about - the mail coaches were going off. Judd appears to have had a good character.</p>

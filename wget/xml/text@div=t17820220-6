               <p>I remember the morning of the 5th of February; I know a pond in Mr. Davis's yard; a little after eight o'clock I found the body, there. It is a coach yard, Davis is a coach master; at the bottom of his yard is a pond not so large as this room, but the inside square of the court about four feet deep, I believe.</p>
               <p>Was it four feet deep towards the edge? It was deepest at the farther end; as I was watering my horses I saw a bit of checque swimming upon the water, as I stood on the side of the pond, I put in a stick and pulled it to me; as I was pulling the checque towards me I saw the woman's hand rise out of the water; I saw a ring upon her finger; I went to the stable and called

               <p>I Know the prisoner at the bar, and I knew his wife very well; on the 5th of February I was called upon to go to the pond side; our stable is near the pond where I was, the first thing I saw was a checque apron lye on the top of the water; I took my fork and twisted it round the apron, and 
               <persName id="t17820220-6-person157">

             the body to the edge of the pond; it lay about a yard and a half in the pond when I put the fork in to pull it to the edge; as soon as I saw the face, I said God Almighty forgive me, it is Mrs. Brown! I immediately sent for the prisoner; he came down the yard directly afterwards; I did not go for him; I was there when he came down into the yard amongst the rest of the people; I said Oh, Mr. Brown, it is a shocking affair; oh, says he, it is indeed; the next thing he said is, oh,

            , you turned my wife out of doors last night (he Davis was present) and she ran down the yard at that time, and he (the prisoner) ran after; I said the next words, Mr. Brown she has no cap on her head, nor handkerchief, nor no shoes or buckles; upon this Mr. Brown made answer, and said, her shoes and buckles were in the pond. I was by the pond side when it was took out; the body lay sideways in the pond, we catched hold of her arms, and seeing her hand I put the fork under and lifted her up; brought the body out of the pond, and put it upon some straw; I did not examine the body; I took notice of no marks on it; Mr. Davis came down by his orders; she was taken to Mr. Brown's house; he said it was more proper than to let the body lye there.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>The body was taken out before Brown came? - Just as he was coming down the yard.</p>
               <p>You had a pitchfork in your hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You put it under her body? - Yes; her legs were quite straight as though laid out. I put the handle of the fork under her cloaths, and there was a step at the pond; we put it in particular under her cloaths.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the shoes were found in the pond? - There was only one shoe and buckle found, the water was taken all out, and no other found; the shoe and buckle was found soon after, as the pond was emptied as soon as possible we could; we got our engine and pumped the water out as soon as we could get men to work; there was no cap on her head, it was found tucked hard under her roll, in her neck; she used to wear a roll; she had neither shoe nor buckle; I said it is a shocking affair, he said so it is.</p>
               <p>Are there any necessary down your yard? - There are two necessaries down that yard.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Hampstead, not far from Mr. Davis's yard, I cannot say how far; I heard three screams a little after twelve at night.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - A fortnight last Monday; it was the night before the body was found, I was coming that way, when I heard two screams, one by Mrs. Forster's, and another at the top of the Church-yard.</p>
               <p>What distance is it from Mrs. Davis's house to Forster's? - A good way; the second noise was from the Church-yard stile, when I got to the top of Cock-alley, I heard a most bitter scream, that was in the town, not a great way from Davis's yard.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell the distance, but Forster's is a good way from Davis's? - No.</p>
               <p>How far is the Church-yard stile, is it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200020"></xptr> between Forster's and Davis's yard? - Yes; between Forster's and Davis's yard, I cannot tell how far the Church-yard is from Davis's yard, it is a good distance, but higher than Forster's; I heard a third scream at the top of Cock-alley.</p>
               <p>Is Cock-alley, or the Church-yard stile, nearest to Davis's? - Cock-alley; and that was a louder screak than I had heard before; the third was the last I heard; I then went home and told my father, he said it was a screich owl, I said it could not be a screich owl.</p>
               <p>From this house, which was your way home? - By the Church-yard stile, and by Bradley's, when we came by Forster's, we came nearer Davis's yard, I cannot say how near I was to the yard, my way home was higher up in the town; I live in the middle of Hampstead, I did not come nearer Davis's yard, I saw nobody but the watchman, I asked the hour, he told me it was past twelve.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>There are watchmen in Church-row, there are many houses; I did not tell the watchman I heard the screams, he was crying the hour, I never was nearer Davis's, there are houses between, I did not mention it to the watchman, I went home directly.</p>

I took out one note, found them all safe, and put the book back—my daughter and the prisoner were in the next room—I showed the note to my daughter in the prisoner's presence—I did not have occasion to go to the pocket-book again till 4th April, when five of the notes were missing—I gave information next morning to the police, and got the numbers of the notes from the bankers.</p>

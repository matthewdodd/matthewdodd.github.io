               <p>What condition was the deceased in at that time? - He appeared to be very ill, but appeared to us to be very sulky, or something of that kind, he was a person I did not know; he sat down after he spoke these words; a little while after we helped him into a coach and sent him home to Moorgate; I do not know how long he lived; I believe he was alive at Moorgate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you know who struck the first blow? - To the best of my knowledge I do not; but this man was very averse to fighting, but the other insisted upon it.</p>
               <p>You told us that they shook hands at several times? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did it happen in this instance, who proposed the shaking of hands? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Do you mean this, that it was shaking hands by way of mutual consent to box it out? - Yes, without all manner of doubt.</p>

               <p>Was it what you call fair fighting? - It was a fair fight.</p>
               <p>If these people will be so brutal to fight in this manner with one another, does it never occur to you to go somewhere to fight, that you might not have the stones to fall upon? - I do not know; it was over; he gave out, and said he would not fight any more then, but he would have it out another time; he spoke no more that I heard of.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were they both drunk? - I really believe that neither of them was cleverly sober; as for Barrett, he was very drunk; we took him into the house, and put on his clothes as well as I could; and I got somebody to help him into a coach, and I drove him home to Moorgate; when I came there, somebody said he was dead, and somebody said he was not; I saw no breath, and I went for a surgeon to bleed him; the surgeon would not come; he said where they fought, there he might go and be blooded.</p>
               <p>When you came back from the surgeon's, was he dead then? - Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>How soon did he die? - I cannot tell how soon after; I helped him out of the coach into his master's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. He was your acquaintance? - I lived a fortnight with him; I did not know any thing of this man; Barrett was certainly very much in the wrong, and provoked this man; I thought he had had a good beating, but I did think he would die.</p>

               <p>On September the 24th, I opened the body of the deceased; and on the left side, below the false rib, in the cavity of the abdomen, I found a quantity of blood, perhaps exceeding a pint; on the external surface of the body, on the left side, on the fifth and sixth ribb; there was some contusion, but by no means mortal in itself; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Was there any appearance of a rupture in any vessel? - No, there was not.</p>
               <p>From whence did that blood proceed do you apprehend? - Perhaps from too great an action of the heart; from too much drinking; it must come from some vessel undoubtedly, but not visible.</p>
               <p>You could not discover that some artery had burst, or any large blood vessel? - By no means, my Lord, they were in a perfect healthy state.</p>
               <p>What do you take to be cause of his death? - Perhaps an apoplexy.</p>
               <p>Did you open the head? - I did; the brain seemed to be in a healthy condition.</p>
               <p>Does it happen that people die of apoplexies, without the disorder shewing itself upon the brain? - It does, my Lord, but not often; the heart and arteries appeared in a healthy state; I cannot say to a certainty what might be the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Would the blood that you found in the abdomen have produced it? - Not instantly, but in the course of twenty-four, or thirty-six hours; it must have been taken up again into the absorbent vessels, and taken again into the system; it could not have been discharged any other way than by the absorbent vessels.</p>
               <p>Did you find the heart and receptacles surcharged with veinous blood? - They were; I meant by healthy state, that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250147"></xptr> heart and arteries were not by any means ruptured.</p>

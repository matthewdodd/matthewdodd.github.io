               <p>On the 21st of April last I had a little business to do at the post-office; I was attacked about a quarter after nine at night; I was coming down Tower-hill; I was a stranger to the city, I saw the prisoner Thomas standing in the corner between two houses, I asked him the way to Iron-gate; I am sure it was him; he made answer, you are almost down within a trifle of the way now; he swore an oath upon me, that he believed I might be a <rs id="t17870523-3-viclabel17" type="occupation">seaman</rs>

               <p>Was the other man with him then? - The prisoner Thomas was immediately on his knees, picking the money out of my pocket: Brown kneeled on my breast with one hand at my mouth, and Thomas took my money out of my pocket, two half crowns; I am sure the prisoners are the men; I never saw them before, they were both in-the house.</p>
               <p>How long might you be drinking this beer? - It might be ten or twelve minutes, I cannot say the exact time.</p>
               <p>Had you candles? - There was light in the house, I could distinguish their faces very plain; I am sure they are the same persons, very sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Thomas. Whether he ever saw me from the time he saw me in the house till after he lost the money? a man was brought into the watch-house, and he swore that was the person.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you accuse any other person of behaving to you in that manner you have mentioned? - No other person but them two, there was another person taken into custody, I could not say he was the man; I knew he was not the man; I believe the watch took him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever charge that other man with having treated you in this way? - No, I never charged any other person but the two prisoners, I am sure it was them; I was robbed on Saturday night, and on the Tuesday the prisoner Thomas was taken; I had not seen nor heard any thing of him in the intermediate time; as for Brown he was apprehended immediately, I put him into the watch-house myself; he never was out of my sight; the prisoner Thomas was apprehended by the description I gave of him to Mr.

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the head-boroughs of the parish; on Monday night after the robbery, I apprehended Thomas; on the Sunday night it was my night at the watch-house, I enquired his charge, and there was another man came to the watch-house to speak to Brown, and the watchman said he thought he answered the description of the other man, in consequence of that, he was taken into custody; on the Monday morning I saw the prosecutor; he described a very stout man in an orange coloured shag waistcoat, and a blue great coat; I knew the prisoner Thomas before, and in consequence of this description I apprehended him; I took him into custody on the Monday, and brought him to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>When you apprehended him, did you give any information to the prosecutor? - He was committed till the prosecutor came; he was in the office; I was desired by the magistrate to let Thomas come in by himself, when he came in, he picked him our directly; there were twenty people in the office.</p>
               <p>PRISONER BROWN'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor never was the person that apprehended me at all; I was walking over Tower Hill, and another gentleman took me in his arms, and asked me what I had been after, I said nothing that I knew of; then the prosecutor came up and said I had robbed him; then they took me to the watch-house, and took me before the justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Thomas. I wish to ask the prosecutor if he was not merely provoked by the officer at the Rotation Office to swear against me and this prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it your own free motion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And what you have said is all true? - Yes, it is all true, so help me God; every thing I have done and said is true.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Thomas. There was a person here that was to speak the truth on my trial, he does not answer; I am very sure he could have proved me to be innocent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. This man that is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178705230009"></xptr>standing here now is innocent of the affair; the man that took the money out of the man's pocket was not taken, that I declare in my dying hour; I have not been above four months from America; I am entirely a stranger in England; I came from Georgia in Savannah.</p>

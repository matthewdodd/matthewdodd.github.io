               <p>Q. Where did you live on the 7th of December last - A. In <placeName id="t18150111-44-crimeloc253">Robinson's buildings</placeName>

On that day between three and four o'clock in the afternoon I had occasion to go to the necessary; I went into the necessary, and sat down upon the occasion I went for, another necessary joined with it, a partition separated one necessary from the other; I heard the door of the other necessary open, and a person come in; I heard a moving as if in great distress; the moving lasted between four and five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know who the person was - A. No. The next I heard was the cries of a child two or three times; the next I heard was the drop into the cesspool; I cannot say exactly it was it; I supposed it, and then a faint cry, and a snuffling, as if it was getting short of breath; upon which I went out, and went to a railing that separated the two back yards, it being too high for me to get over, I put my head over; I heard some thing wiping the floor of the necessary house, it seemed to me as if with a cloth; with that I came into the man that I lodged with, his name is Rhodes; I told him what had happened, and asked him what house that privy belonged to, it belonged to the next house. I went there along with Rhodes; I saw a good many women there, and a mangle; I asked the women which was the woman that had delivered herself of a child, the prisoner was present; one of the women said the prisoner was the person. I asked the prisoner what made her put the child into the privy; she denied putting it in herself, but that it went into the privy, and said that it was in the privy. I desired a nightman to be sent for, and the child got up; a nightman was sent for, he is here; I saw the child found, it was dead.</p>

I took her by the arm, and brought her out of the privy, and led her to her house, and discovered what she had been wiping the privy with, I conducted her into her mother's; she dropped the cloth by the side of her; I picked it up, and tied it up in my handkerchief, and kept it until the officer came; I gave Mr. Pace, the officer, the handkerchief and cloth. I assisted Pendergast: we tore up the privy to get the child out; I gave all the assistance I could to find the child; we did not find the child; we sent for a nightman; he came; I saw the child found.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and nightman; I was sent for by a man, he told me there was a child down in the privy; I immediately stripped, and went down; I dragged seven times, and the eighth time I brought a female child up; that is all I know. A child that fell from its mother could not have gone down so low, without it had been poked down with a pole it could not.</p>
               <p>MR. OLIVER. I am a surgeon. I saw the infant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110027"></xptr>immediately after it was taken out; the infant was quite dead, a female child; it was a full grown child.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the child to have been born alive, would it found in that situation, would that have been the cause of its death - A. I understand the child had been down an hour in the privy, certainly that was the cause of its death.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of a woman's delivery, the difficulty is greater with the first child - A. Certainly it is.</p>
               <p>Q. I beg to ask you from the knowledge which you have acquired upon this subject, whether it is by any means uncommon for a child to drop from its mother without a moments notice - A. No, it often happens they often come all at once, and drop on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not a person who went to a privy for the ordinary purpose, be surprized with labour, and the child drop from her in an instant - A. No doubt of it. On examining the child, I found no marks of violence upon the child, the navel string was broken as it would be by falling from its mother. It is common for a woman to mistake labour pains for a pain in the bowels.</p>

               <p>Q, At the time that this happened, did you know that she was pregnant - A. I knew it; it was well known in the neighbourhood. After the alarm of the child being in the privy, I went into the house; I said, Kitty, my dear girl, what have you done to your child: she said it is in the privy, Mrs. Rhodes it is indeed, I could not help it; I have had the case in my own house. I have delivered two women of children in my own house, or else the children must have been lost; the prisoner had been at work that very day at mangling, that work caused the labour speedily to come on.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. TO THE JURY. The only question know, is whether she concealed the birth of the child it does not appear to me that she concealed the birth of the child.</p>

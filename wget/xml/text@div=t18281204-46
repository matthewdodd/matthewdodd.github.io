            . I am a servant to Mr. Chatfield. On the 27th of November my mistress sent me for change for a shilling, and when I went out the prisoner was sitting in the shop; my mistress came after me to the shop, and told me to watch the prisoner - I did not see her come out of my mistress', but I watched her into Church-street; I saw her open a shirt, and she had the other things under her arm; I took hold of her, and asked what she was going to do with them - she said to sell them; I asked where she got them - she said it was no odds to me; I took her back, and my mistress sent for the officer - she begged my mistress to forgive her; the things had been in the parlour - I had left the shop about half an hour; she dropped the shirt when I came up.</p>

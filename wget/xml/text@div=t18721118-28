I am the wife of Thomas Lambert, and live at 9, North<lb></lb>port Street, Hoxton—on 17th July last I let my back parlour, with the use of a, sitting-room, to the deceased girl, Ellen Moore—she gave that name—I had not known her before—the prisoner joined her on the Saturday night—I believe she went to meet him—that was the first Saturday after she came—he continued to come every Saturday afterwards, and stayed till Monday—on Saturday, 14th September, he had been there ten days—he stayed that Saturday night and the Sunday, and until Monday—I did not see anything of him on the Monday morning—I saw the deceased about 11.30 that morning; she was coming up stairs from below, with a jug of water, to her room—I saw her go into her room, and saw nothing more of her till 2.30—I then heard the report of a pistol—before I could get up stairs there were three reports—they appeared to come from their room—I went to the door, and tried it; I found it was locked—I tried to break it open, but found I could not—I ran to the street door, and called for help—a man named Barrett came up, also Alexander, and Mrs. Brett and Mrs. Howard, two neighbours—I went for a policeman and somebody went for a doctor—when I got back the room door had been opened, and I saw Moore coming from the room, bleeding very much from the cheek and from the eye—I caught her in my arms, and sat her on the stairs for a second, and then took her down into my room—she managed pretty well to get down the stairs by herself—I gave her some water, and the neighbours bathed her face—while she was there I went up into her room alone—I saw the prisoner</p>

I am a fishmonger, and live at 16, Wilson Street, Hoxton—on Monday, 16th September, I was in Northport Street, and saw Mrs. Lambert outside her door, No. 9—in consequence of what the said to me I Went into the back parlour; the door was closed, but I got in by merely turning the handle—the deceased had then been taken Out of the room; she was not there—I was the first man that was in the room—I saw the prisoner lying on the bed on his back—I turned round and said they ought to be ashamed of themselves to leave the man lying there in the gore of blood in which he was—I saw blood upon him—he asked me if the girl was dead—I said "What girl?" I did not know anything about a female—he said "The girl that I have shot"—with that in came Mrs. Lambert find asked if I would go down stairs and see the girl—I did so, and afterwards returned into the room where the prisoner was—he asked me if I would give the girl the ring out of his pocket—I said ho, if he would wail, some one would be there and go to his pocket for the ring—he asked me a second time, and soon after that Mrs. Lambert came in, and he asked her to go to his pocket for the ring, and she did so—I saw her show him the ring, and she said "Is this the ring?" and he said "Yes"—he said "Good God, I must have been mad to do such a thing as this; I shall get seven years for it at the least"—before this, when I came up, he asked me how the girl was, and I told him she was much better than he was, but to keep himself quiet—he wanted to rub his forehead where he was wounded—he told me that his revolver laid under the table, and to be careful of it, as there were two charges in it—Mrs. Lambert picked up the revolver and gave it to me, and I put it in my pocket—I afterwards gave it to the police—the prisoner asked me if I would give him some brandy—I said "No, that is more than I can do"—the doctor and the police came in shortly after, and the doctor ordered him some brandy.</p>

On Monday, 16th September, just before 3 o'clock, I went to 9, Northport Street, and into the room on the ground floor, where the prisoner was—the surgeon was there attending to him—I afterwards saw the girl below—the pistol was handed to me by Sergeant Goodyer—I produce it; it is a seven-chambered revolver—I found that five of the chambers had been discharged, and two were still loaded—I told the prisoner I should have to take him to the hospital—I sent for a cab, and carried him into it—on the road to the hospital his head was covered up with a handkerchief; he uncovered himself, and looked out—I said "Your name is Augustus Elliott"—he said "How did you find that out?"—I said "The woman told me"—seeing that he looked respectable, I said "Are you a gentleman?"—he said "No, I am not a gentleman, but my friends are very well off"—we went a little further, and then he said "I did not buy the revolver with the intention of shooting her, but to take with me to America; we had a few words, and I fired at "her three times and myself twice"—I said "If you are a gentleman, I will telegraph to your friends"—he said "Oh, my friends will find it out soon enough by the papers in the morning"—in his coat pocket I found a box of cartridges—I have tried them, and they fit the pistol; they are the same sort as the ones that were extracted—I left the prisoner at the hospital, and returned to the house and examined the room—I found an indentation in the party-wall about 4 feet 6 inches from the floor, such as would be made by a small bullet—Mrs. Lambert gave me a bullet; I should think it was one that had been fired—on the 8th October the prisoner was taken from the hospital to be charged with this offence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gunsmith at 14, Newcastle Street, Whitechapel—Inspector Ramsey showed me this pistol, it is a revolver with seven chambers; I drew the two charges—it is a single-action pistol, you have to cock it each time of firing—it has no cap, but a small rim cartridge—there are three grains of powder in the cartridge, as well as the detonating powder.</p>

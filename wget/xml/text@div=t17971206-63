               <p>There were two other Counts, For uttering two other counterfeit half guineas, on the same day, to the said William.</p>
               <p>And a fourth Count, For uttering on the same day, to the said William, a counterfeit half crown, knowing the same to be counterfeit.(The case was opened by Mr. Knowlys).</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GOODING sworn. - Examined by Mr. Ward. On the 26th of October last, the prisoner came to me, between six and eight o'clock; I had often seen him before, and dealt with him a great many times; he came to buy a peck of oysters, the price was half-a-crown; he gave me a straight new half-guinea, and I gave him change out of it; in a short time after, he came a second time, for another peck of oysters, they were natives, the price was seven shillings and sixpence, and he gave me another new half-guinea, which was crooked; I gave him three shillings in change; and he came again a third time, for another peck of oysters, at half-a-crown, he gave me another new crooked half-guinea, and I gave him eight shillings out of that; he came again, a fourth time, for another peck of common oysters; he gave me a half-crown piece, which was a bad one, I returned it to him again, and he gave me another half-crown in the room of it, immediately, which was good; I cannot be certain whether it was two shillings ans sixpence or half-a-crown; I saw nothing more of him, but I went about eight o'clock to breakfast, and then we always take an account of our money; upon looking over them, I found three half-guineas that were bad.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how much money you had first in the morning? - A. No; we always begin afresh in the morning, with an empty bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how much you had at eight o'clock? - A. I cannot say, it might be two or three pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How many new half-guineas had you? - A.Only three; I had but two more, and those were old ones.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that these three half-guineas were the half-guineas you had taken of the prisoner? - A. I knew them directly, when I came to overhawl them again; I immediately went round Billingsgate, to look for him, and saw him standing upon the quay; I went to him, and asked him how he came to give me so much bad money, and he said, he had given me none; I told him, he certainly had; the oyster-meters came up, and Mr. Parrot, an oyster-porter, who searched him, had found a bad half-crown upon him; and then they sent for an officer, and took him away; I saw a bad half-crown found upon him, and some silver and gold, and a Bank-note; I do not know how much; the bad half-crown was found in a paper by itself; the officer can give a better account of what other money he had than I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the half-crown that was found upon him, was the half-crown that he had offered you before? - A. It was very much like it; there was no other half-crown found upon him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The prisoner is what is called a bobber? - A. Yes; people who do not know the way to go down, employ these men to buy them for them, and they give them a penny a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there was nothing wonderful in his comeing to you for a second, third, fourth, or tenth peck? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a pretty brisk market that day? - A.No great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold a great many oysters to other people, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All the money you receive, you put indiscriminately into your bag? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This poor fellow has been long employed upon the quay, you had no suspicion of him, and therefore you put them into your bag? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this half-crown in the paper in his breeches pocket, or his fob? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say that he had put it there, wrapped up in a paper, because he would not offer it to anybody? - A. He might, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to breakfast, and when you returned, you found him at his work upon the quay? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he time to shift any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He had while you were gone to breakfast? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. But not after he was apprehended? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How many half-guineas had you taken in the course of that morning? - A. Only five.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell where you got the other two from? - A. One of them I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the bag yourself, or did you deliver it to your partner? - A. No, I did not; we count the money and put it down upon a piece of paper, to see how much we have taken.</p>
               <p>Q. You have known this man upon the quay many years? - A. I have not come there above a year.</p>
               <p>Court Q. Are you certain that the prisoner is the man you took the three half-guineas of? - A. Yes; I am.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PARROTT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I measure oysters for the meters: I was coming up the ladder, and Mr. Gooding, and a meter, had got the prisoner talking to him about some bad half-guineas; the prisoner said he did not give them to him; I searched him, and found this bad half-crown wrapped up in a piece of paper, in his fob.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the rest of the money you found about him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179712060072"></xptr>good? - A. I believe it was; I returned it to him; I kept the half-crown till I got to the Lord-Mayor, and then it was given to the constable, Giles Bolland.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You found the half-crown in his fob? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he has been a long time on the quays? - A. Yes; two or three days one week, and two or three days another.</p>

The prisoner came on board - he said he was distressed, and asked me to let him say on board a few days, as his master owed him some money, and when it was paid he would go; he staid one week, and went on shore on the Monday; I missed four spoons - they had been in the caddy; he had the key of it; I came on shore the next day, and saw him in Shadwell; I told him I had lost some silver spoons - he said he knew nothing about it; a friend said he had some money in his possession; I asked where he got it - he said he had taken his money of his master; I sent my friend to know if it was true, and he gave him in charge; the spoons are lost, but I have seen the top of the mustard-pot - it is the property of Alexander Hanning.</p>


               <p>Prisoner. He had the top of the mustard-pot himself; it was in the basket of dust. Witness. Yes; it was in the dust, and I put it on the dresser, and you asked what it was.</p>
               <p>JACOB DE SOUZA. I went with the prisoner to the City, as he said his master had given him a sovereign, and he lived in some square, but I forget the name; I asked if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110135"></xptr>would go there - he said he did not know the number of the house; I then sent for a constable, and took him up.</p>

            . On the 5th of November I was in my room and heard a disturbance in the passage. I went down stairs to see what was the matter. There I found Mrs. Yeoman had stop'd the prisoner at the bar with the things mentioned in the indictment. The prisoner said it was the first time she had ever done such a thing, and she would never do so any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own she took the things ?</p>
               <p>J. Chapman. She did. (Produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them.</p>
               <p>J. Chapman. These are the same things she had got. They are my property, except the apron, which is Tomison Spalding's. I having missed several other things before, asked her if she had them; but she only owned the taking of these.</p>
               <p>Tomison Spalding. I was out from home, and when I returned they had got the prisoner in the passage with the things mention'd. We sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say for herself?</p>
               <p>T. Spalding. She said, she thought she was bewitch'd in going down stairs (that is, into the back kitchen, where these things lay.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these things, are any of them yours?</p>
               <p>T. Spalding. The apron is mine. The others are the property of

             lodges in my first parlour. She has lost a great many things. I catch'd the woman at the bar in the passage with these things here produced. Upon her bringing them up from out of the back kitchen I stop'd her, and made her lay them down in the passage. She said, if we would forgive her she would allow us two shillings per week till the other things, which were lost, were paid for.</p>

               <p>There was nobody in the shop when I went in for a halfpennyworth of snuff. I at last saw a person, and asked leave to go to the vault. None of them saw these things upon me. I have been twelve weeks in gaol, but I did not think my trial would have come on so soon, or else I had had my master and mistress to give me a character. Please to give me corporal punishment for Christ's sake.</p>

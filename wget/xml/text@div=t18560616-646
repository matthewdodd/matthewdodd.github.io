                  </hi>. I live at Ealing, in the county of Middlesex. I went to bed on the night of 11th May, about 12 o'clock—I looked at the fastenings before I went to bed, and all was quite safe—next morning, in consequence of information I received, I went down stairs and found a little window on the first floor at the back of the house, the watercloset window, was open—I believe on the night before that window was not shut—it was a little window, but large enough for a man to get in at—a brewer's pulley had been placed up against the window—that is a sort of slide which brewers use to roll casks up into their carts; it forms a sort of ladder—the back door was also open—it had been shut the night before—I found in the kitchen a desk which was opened—it had been taken from the sitting room where it was the night before—a missionary box had also been conveyed there—it had been broken open, and it's contents abstracted I missed the cloak, the concertina, the coats, and some boots—this is one of the boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is mine—this is one of the coats (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>—it is also mine.</p>

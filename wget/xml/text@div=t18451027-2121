               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184510270143"></xptr>
               <p>live in Bishopsgate-street. The prisoner was in my service as town-tra<lb></lb>veller and collector—his duties were to go round and take orders, to receive money for goods already sold, and to come in the evening to the counting-house, to enter them in a book, and obtain my initials to them—he was to enter the orders and the payments in a book, and to hand the money to me, or to any one there for me—my clerk was authorised to receive the money—supposing he paid the money to any one else, he ought to have made the entry in the book—if he had paid Mrs. Millington, she would have received it, and he ought to have entered it—this is the book—here is an entry in it, "Cash from J. Hasted, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," on the 28th of August, in the prisoner's writing—I should say I did not personally receive that money, but I have had it—I do not find any entry of Mr. Cooper's or Mr. Cable's accounts in August, nor any entry of those amounts paid by them after August.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He had access to this book at all times? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He always knew where to find it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long has he been in your employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three or four years—I had a large business without him—it happens that these three customers have been obtained by him—they have been very small customers—the prisoner was paid by commission—the rate of commission varied—it was ten per cent, on varnish, and five per cent, on dry colours—there was no time fixed for the payment of the commission—we usually settled every Saturday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you made the agreement about the commission, was any time fixed for settling that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell—we had no agreement—I paid him as other servants, every Saturday night—there was no agreement that I should pay him every Saturday night—I do not recollect whether I took him without any agreement as to the time he should be paid—the first entry that I have of paying him is the first week after he was with me, and I have continued to pay him every Saturday night, as far as I was able—I paid him by calculating the amount of goods sold or paid for—he had commission on the goods told, whether paid for or not—I paid him the commission on the goods sold regularly till lately—he has lately been so irregular in his attendance that I have had no opportunity of settling with him—I should say that I did not get in arrears for his commission in consequence of that—I paid him what I considered was due to him every Saturday night—his calculation and mine did not disagree—he has not applied to me for a considerable sum that he says I owe him for commis<lb></lb>sion—he did not apply for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not before he left ray ser<lb></lb>vice apply for wages that I owed him—he applied for a settlement, and I told him to produce his account—he did not, to my recollection, say that by a settlement I should have to pay him money—he applied for a settle<lb></lb>ment, without knowing whether he owed me or I him—a settlement has been mentioned between us more than once, but mostly by myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you charged him with drunkenness, and in consequence of that he left your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I discharged him a great many times, and afterwards took him again when he promised to amend—the last time he left me he absented himself on the 29th of Sept.—if that was on Saturday I paid him a sum of money—I believe it to have been on a Saturday—it was about the 29th of Sept.—I did not know that he went to another person and got employ in the same trade—I know it now—I cannot re<lb></lb>collect</p>

               <p>the date when I gave him into custody—it was on a Monday or Tuesday morning, about three weeks ago—I have both a retail and whole-sale business—my wife is not well—she has been in bed nearly half the day every day—Dr. Bushey is attending her—I have a certificate from him—I know of her being subpœnaed here—I think it was last Monday week—this certificate was written on Sunday last, or sent to me on Monday morning—I was provided with a certificate last week—this is the second I have had.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has not your wife been down into the shop at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She passed through the shop to go out of the house—she has not been out of the house the last ten days—I do not know whether she has been in the shop since I have been here—I had not the curiosity to ask how she was—I could see how she was—a day or two ago she could not speak—she has a very bad cold—her illness is the reason of her not being here—I have never given any other reason—I know <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>—he is not in my employ—I saw him on the 1st of this month—I never said any<lb></lb>thing to him about my wife coming—eight o'clock is our usual time for closing our shop at night—the prisoner has been there as late as eleven o'clock, but there was no reason for it in my opinion—he had no carriage—he was obliged to walk—he had no money for carriages—he went where he liked—I live at No. 87, Bishopsgate-street Without—I think Mr. Hasted said Kew was only five or six miles—eleven o'clock was too late for him to arrive, in my opinion—there is no necessity for any one to call on painters at eleven o'clock at night—my wife is frequently in the habit of handing money to me, left by my clerks and other parties—I believe she once handed me a sum received from the prisoner—I cannot say to what amount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you not know that on several occasions, when the prisoner has come home late to his own lodging, he has sent money home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has the next morning, monies received previously—he has sometimes sent a memorandum of the places where they have been received, and sometimes not—I have entered it in my cash-book—"Jones's credit," in pencil, till I saw him—I have not made entries in this book that is here—I believe not at all—I do not know of any entries in bulk made in it—if he had received money from different people I have entered it in my own book so—this entry of the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is in his writing—when he entered a sum it was usual for me to put my initials to it in this book—that is not the case all through the book—this entry is not signed—I could not have received it from him personally—I do not charge him with keeping this 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but of keeping 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell from whom I received this—if I received it from another person or from him, I cannot tell why my initials are not to it—if I found this two years hence, and my initials not to it, I should not charge him with keep<lb></lb>ing this, because it is in my cash-book—I entered it in when I received it—I cannot tell from whom I received it, or what account was given of it at the time—here it is in the cash-book—"J. Hasted, on account"—I very frequently put "on account," when it is not a settlement—this is not copied from the entry in the other book—I find no entry in the cash-book of these other two sums—I think the last time the prisoner left me was in July—I frequently sent after him, to know if he was coming to business I discharged him several times, and took him on again.</p>

               <p>request him to come back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till after he was re<lb></lb>engaged—his daughter and his wife come to request, on several occasions, that I would take him on again—I did not send after him before they came to me—he did not say he would not come back till my account was settled.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> On the 4th of Aug. was any money accounted for at all to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot state whether any was on that particular date—I did not receive any money from him on the 4th of Aug.—I cannot tell, without referring to the book, whether there are any entries of money that he paid me—I used to enter for him when he was too ill—he was not tipsy, but his hand used to shake so much from having been tipsy—I only judge from seeing no entries of mine that he did not pay me money—I do not know that I have made mistakes over and over again, or have applied to persons to pay bills, and it has turned out that they were paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean you have not charged persons a second time for their bills, and found that the money has been paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not myself—I do not know anything about my roaster—the prisoner had a good round to make—he went where he liked with his orders—he used to say he took a very large circuit—it was according to how many he took in one day—he very often was not at home when I left—my master was not at home some<lb></lb>times, but I generally left him in the office—I have not received from the prisoner's little girl any sums of money in a mass—I have not seen my master do so.</p>

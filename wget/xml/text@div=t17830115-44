               <p>At half past eleven, I went to go to bed on the 28th of December, and I locked the street door, I was the last up, the windows were fast: a little after twelve, I was called up by some people that lived in the next room to mine, I went up stairs and missed a counterpane and sheet off the bed that belonged to Mrs. Thompson who lodged in my house up two pair of stairs forwards in a ready furnished apartment, she was not at home; I went down stairs and fastened the street door again, which was shut close with a piece of a poker.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the street door locked? - I cannot say, I had locked it before, it was entirely close, but I did not particularly examine it.</p>
               <p>That is very odd; then for ought you know the street door was locked still? - I know no more.</p>
               <p>Where was your husband? - He was in bed.</p>
               <p>Did he get up? - No, he did not hear of it he was asleep.</p>
               <p>You did not think it worth while to awaken him on this alarm? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Then you could not be much alarmed, neither to awaken your husband, nor see whether the street door was fast; did you go to bed again? Yes.</p>

               <p>What did she say she came in for? - She said she had had no supper, and she desired the woman that was in bed with me, to get up and fetch some bread and cheese, and beer; and she pulled out a handkerchief, and bonnet, and a shift, a petticoat, and a bed-gown she had on, and shewed them.</p>
               <p>Did she say where she got them? - She did not say as I understood, she talked very low: the woman's name that slept with me, is Goulden: I made a gown out of the petticoat on the Sunday; and I saw her send the woman on Monday morning to pawn the handkerchief and apron: I never heard whose things they were.</p>

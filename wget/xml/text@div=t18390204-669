I live at No. 11, Shepherd-street, Oxford-street The prisoner Danvers was in my service up to the 2nd of January—I had been ill ever since November; and, in consequence of that, I entrusted Danvers with my property—she had the key of my wine-cellar, and all my keys, occasionally—I missed a cap, and spoke to Danvers about it—she said she did not know where it was, or whether it was gone to the wash—a lady, named Ansley, came to me the same evening—I had dismissed Danvers before she came—Mrs. Ansley brought a hamper to me, with seven bottles of sherry in it, apiece of soap, and a paper of mould candles—I missed all these things, and a great deal more, when I went to look—I have seen a great many things at Bow-street which are here—some of these things are marked—I did not know M'Mahon; but, in consequence of inform<lb></lb>ation, I went to her house in Lincoln-court—she lived in an attic, at the top of the house—I found her there in bed—she got up, and let me in—I looked about her room, and found these carpets on the floor—these blankets and sheets and counterpane were on the bed, and some wine<lb></lb>glasses and other things were in the room—the officer took them—M'Mahon made her escape while I was there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Bainsley with any grains in a cart on Sunday October the 9th, about eight o'clock in the morning - A. Yes; I was in Guildford street, going by the Foundling hospital, and saw this cart stand loaded with grains, I knew it to be Mr. Smith's cart of Battle bridge;

             was shoveling the grains into a little cart from Mr. Smith's cart; I went to Mr. Smith and told him; Mr. Smith's man came up with me, and we came to Smith's cart, and we afterwards found the other which contained the grains that had been shovelled in; when we had seen Smith's cart, Smith's man returned back to find his master. Mr. Smith, the man, and me, found the cart standing standing at the man's door; his name is Humphry, he lives in Gray's inn lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of grains had been put in it before you left it and went away to inform Mr. Smith - A. About a couple of sacks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Whether there were grains in the cart when they first began to shovel them, you do not know - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Smith. Do you know of your own knowledge what quantity of grains were put in your cart - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is whether you were present when these grains were put in the cart - A. No; we have them from Gifford's; I pay for them three shillings a quarter; eight bushels makes a quarter. Humphry is run away. The horse and cart are in the yard; one claimed the horse and another the cart; the magistrate thought it not proper to give them up.</p>
               <p>COURT to Newsam. Are you sure sure there were three bushels in Humphry's cart - A. Yes; it appeared more to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Do not I understand you to say that although three bushels were put in this cart, you cannot undertake to say they came of this cart - A. They were found in this cart, and I think more than three bushels.</p>

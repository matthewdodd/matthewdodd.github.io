On the 13th of June I was at home, about nine o'clock in the evening; the prisoner came to my room, and said she wanted to speak to me - she went round by a small leaf-table, and sat down on a chair, by the side of which was a band-box, and a bonnet on it; she put her hand down, took the bonnet, and at the same time she got up and said, "I must go;" I had no candle in the house - I went to get my bonnet to fetch a candle and saw the bonnet in her right hand; I said,"Give me my bonnet, you hussey;" she opened the door, ran down stairs, and I after her - she ran into some alleys, where there are a great many low Irish people.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are not you and the prisoner well acquainted? A. No; I do not think I ever spoke to her above twice before this - I have seen her at the Goat; I gave her part of a pint of beer, which she begged of me the day this happened - I did not promise to lend her my bonnet that night; she was not in the room two minutes - my husband was in the room, but he saw nothing of it. <rs id="t18320705-296-verdict1557" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of Gossett Street, Bethnal Green—I first knew the prisoner about eighteen months ago or a little more, and from time to time discounted bills for him—he represented them—to be all trade bills—I discounted for him these three bills of March 2nd, 14th, and 25th, drawn by him and accepted by Graham—he said that they were trade bills and that the acceptor, Mr. Graham, was an outfitter of Windsor, and a very respectable man—I presented this one which is for 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the London and County Bank, London, and had it returned; I did not present the others—the prisoner carries on business at Hedge's Grove, South Hackney, his bill heads call him a canteen contractor appointed by Government—I wrote to Mr. Graham and got my letter back in seven or eight days, marked "Not known."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is one of my forms, it is headed "Private Loan Office; forms 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each"—I am willing to lend money to anybody who pays me good interest—the interest is 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound—I have discounted 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the prisoner in the eighteen months, he has taken up all the bills up to this time; he paid regularly, up to 11th August—about a dozen of the bills which were paid regularly were drawn on Graham; they were for from 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and amounted to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with those I have got left—they were all drawn on the same forms and made payable in the same way as these—I know that he has had to file a petition—his solicitor called at my house—I do not think I ever heard the name of Hatch mentioned—I believe my solicitor has proved my debt for these very bills—I was present at a discussion upon the prisoner's affairs, I do not recollect hearing a list of the debtors to his estate read out, nor did I look at it—I did not see the name of Hatch returned as a debtor to a large amount, nor did I hear the name mentioned in reference to the prisoner's affairs—I do not think I have ever discounted for the prisoner a</p>

               <p>bill drawn by Hatch, but I will not swear I have not—I do not know perfectly well that I have—I never knew that Hatch had absconded and let the prisoner in for a large amount of money—I have unfortunately seen the prisoner a number of times since—I know Mr. Barron, his solicitor; I have not spoken to him about Hatch absconding—I did not say that Freans, the biscuit people, would prosecute him—I could not see the prisoner after the bills were returned, he absconded; I saw the woman he was cohabiting with at Charlton, and I saw his wife at Eccles Road—I have not offered to take 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from his wife directly she gets a legacy under her grandmother's will; but she said to me that if, I would not prosecute her husband, when she got her legacy she would pay me—I dare say I saw her the day after the bills were returned, thinking to see Mr. Taylor; she did not make the offer then, but she did within a few weeks afterwards—I did not take out a warrant till last week, because I left it in the hands of my solicitor—it was not a little bit on account of the expected legacy—I never expected to get a farthing—I do not think I waited so long as seven months—I took the warrant out some time before Christmas—I waited all that time because I did not know where he was—I will swear that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> was not because I expected to get my money from Mrs. Taylor—I did not offer to do anything for them and their children, I have six children of my own—the signature to both these cheques produced is the prisoner's—I dare say the acceptances may be in a totally different writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I paid the former bills of Graham into the bank, and Taylor would come down in the evening and say "I have had a telegram from my friend and he is rather short, but you shall have the money to-morrow," and it was brought; the prisoner took them up in that way several times—he owes me now 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as near as I can guess—I have now a number of bills dishonoured, the acceptors of which I cannot find, such as Elliott of Portsea, and Graham of Windsor, but the greatest number of bills are in the name of Williams—the prisoner lived at Charlton in the name of Williams, but I do not know that of my own knowledge—when I found that the acceptors could not be found I put the matter in the hands of my attorney—I could not find the prisoner at Charlton or at Hedge's Grove—I was not in any way delaying the proceedings for the purpose of a settlement; whatever delay there was was the act of my solicitor.</p>

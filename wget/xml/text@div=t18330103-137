            ALLEY. Q. It was entirely to serve the lady you bought them? A. It was done with a good intention; I ran the risk of my sovereign, as I was out of place, and he said he was going to Brighton, and could not keep them - I thought the reward would be beneficial; he wore a brown coat, and blue apron like a butcher, and knee breeches; and when I took him he had a black coat - he told me he had changed his coat.</p>

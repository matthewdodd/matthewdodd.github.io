                  </hi>. I am a City detective-officer—previous to Monday, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> May, I received some directions from Mr. Sims, who is a looking-glass manu<lb></lb>facturer; and on that morning I went to his premises, 150, Aldersgate-street, about 3 o'clock—I had the keys, and let myself into the counting-house, which runs by the side of the gateway—I then fastened up the premises; we had seen every window secure on the Sunday—I placed myself where I had a view of the roof of the premises at the back—I remained there till about 6 o'clock, when the gates were opened by Mr. Burton's foreman to let the men into some other premises adjoining—about ten minutes past 6 the prisoner Ansell came up to the gateway with his hat and coat on; he went down the gateway, and returned at about twenty minutes past 6, with a white cap and white apron on, and his shirt-sleeves turned up, without the hat and coat—he ascended a pair of steps on to a ladder that was placed against a wall at the back part of Mr. Sima's premises, got on to the roof,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186405090039"></xptr>
               <p>and I could see him go along, through the skylight, till I lost sight of him—in about three or four minutes after that he came to the outer counting house door, with a key in his hand—I could see him through a glass panel; he apparently unlocked the door, entered, came towards me, and then turned to the private counting-house door, the first door up the gateway—he could not see me at all; I was in the inner counting-house—he went direct to the door and unbolted two bolts from the inside, he stood in the passage, and about three minutes afterwards Beaumont came by the win<lb></lb>dow to the door; Ansell opened the door for him, closed it again, and they both went out through the outer counting-house into the warehouse—I saw them distinctly—they were then out of my sight about a quarter of an hour—I heard them coming very slowly, as if carrying something towards the outer counting-house door from the warehouse—I saw them again; Beau<lb></lb>mont came into the door first, carrying one end of that load in that canvas bag; Ansell had hold of the other end—they came towards me, and then turned to the private counting-house door, which led to the gateway—I was still out of their sight, but could see them—when they got to the door one of Mr. Burton's men passed the window, which caused them to retreat to my hiding-place—they came to the door where I was, and tried to open it, and at last I was compelled to open the door upon them, and I caught hold of both by the shirt-sleeves, as well as I was able—Beaumont had no coat on—I had a very desperate struggle with them, and Ansell lifted up his fist as if to strike me—I said, "Mind what you are about, I have assistance here at hand"—after a struggle I got into the gateway with them, and called on some of Mr. Burton's men for assistance, but they thought I was the burglar at first, and not the prisoners—in struggling with Beaumont in the gateway I fell over; it was very slippery—Pavitt and Rowland were outside; they saw me pursuing the prisoners, and Pavitt went after Beaumont and I fol<lb></lb>lowed Ansell, through Bartholomew-close, through a coffee-shop, where I was stopped on the way, into Smithfield—I took him there, and handed him over to another officer—I went back to the prosecutor's premises, to see them safe, and put an officer in charge to protect them—I then, in company with Mr. Sims and Mr. Strickland, ascended to the upper part of the premises—we found a plank placed across at the back, from the roof to the wall, and above the plank was a step fastened by nails against the side of the wall, under the window—the slates were very much broken, and the upper part of the window in the joiner's shop was unfastened—I am quite sure that that window was closed and secured on the Sunday, and the doors also. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time was it that Beaumont came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between twenty-three and twenty-four minutes past 6—the premises had been watched before, but not by me—Burton's men come to work at 6 o'clock—there are a great many men employed by him—they have to go through a different way to Mr. Burton's premises; one is a doorway, and the other a gateway—the door that Ansell unbolted was a private door which led into Mr. Sims's private counting house—I don't know how long Ansell has been employed by Mr. Sims—I said I was a police-officer in the first instance, but Beaumont knew me as an officer—when he turned to the door he had his back towards me, but in carrying the load he had his face towards me—I was at that time facing the door, and facing them as they came towards me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sims—I was in Aldersgate-street—I saw Ansell go in about twenty minutes past 6, and about five minutes afterwards Beaumont went in—about a quarter to 7 I saw the two prisoners running away from Mr. Sims's yard, pursued by Smith—I joined in the pursuit, and followed Beaumont—I caught him in Bartholomew-close—he gave me an address—I afterwards went there, and found a hat and a coat which I showed to Ansell in Beau<lb></lb>mont's presence—Ansell told me they were there before I went there—when I saw Ansell go up the yard he was in his shirt sleeves, with a white cap and apron on.</p>

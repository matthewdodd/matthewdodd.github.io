When I first missed my money the prisoner had lived with me about three weeks; the day I missed my money she asked me to let her go to see a friend of hers in Lombard-street ; when she came back again I told her I missed more things; having mentioned the money to her before, she said she supposed they that took one took all. She pulled out a fine brussels lace tucker, and told me her cousin which she had been to see gave it her; this being so exceeding good a lace gave me a suspicon. I made it my business to find out her cousin, she told me she never gave her any such thing.</p>

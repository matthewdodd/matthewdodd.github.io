                  </hi>. I am a silk-dresser, in the employ of James Smith and others, in Horse-shoe-alley, Moorfields—I live in Bethnal-green-road—about a quarter to nine o'clock, on the morning of the 24th of March, I went up to the shop; the prisoner was there—he ought to have been at his breakfast at that time—I saw, by his side, four pieces of silk handkerchief and a pair of scissors—the handkerchiefs had no business there—I asked him what business he had there, he said, "Nothing"—I said, "What do you do with these pieces?"—he said, "I was doing nothing with them"—I said, "They have no business here, did you bring them up?" he said, "No"—I looked over them, and there were eleven handkerchiefs on each piece instead of twelve—I said, "What have you done with the other handkerchiefs?" he said "Nothing"—I took his hat off; and found four handkerchiefs in his hat, which corresponded with the four pieces, and I believe were cut from them—I examined them, they seemed to correspond in quality—I gave them to Mrs. Smith, who gave them to William Smith, in my presence.</p>

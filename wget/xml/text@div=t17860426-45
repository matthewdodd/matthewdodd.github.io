               <p>What did you loose? - All the things mentioned in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. Hand up the hat. (The hat produced.) The prisoner messed in the house, and had the use of every thing in the house; before the magistrate the prisoner discharged himself, and laid the whole upon Moore.</p>

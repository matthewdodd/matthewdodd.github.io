I immediately made my case known at the watchhouse; and the constable of the night and a patrole went in pursuit of her; they found her, with part of the money on her.

            . I am a patrole of St. Mary-le-strand. On the 8th of May, I was going my rounds at about half past twelve, and I saw Mr. Flogdell and the prisoner in company together; I followed them from Feathers-court down to the Cock and Magpye, where Mr. Flogdell was knocking, trying to get in. I left them then, and was going down White Hart-yard,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290054"></xptr>when I was called by Mr. Flogdell, who said, he had been robbed of eight pounds, and some silver; and I took him into the watchhouse, and after that I apprehended the prisoner going down Covent Garden, and found six one-pound notes and ten-pence in halfpence. The prosecutor was a little elevated in liquor.</p>

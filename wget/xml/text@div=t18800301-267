                  </hi>. I am now living at the Sailors' Home in Well Street—I was chief mate of the Standard Bearer, a British ship, of Swansea, sailing under the British flag—the prisoner was the master of that vessel—John Maclean was boatswain, William Jones carpenter, and the crew were 13 all told—we sailed from Swansea last March, and went to Monte Video and Buenos Ayres—on 27th July we sailed for Talcahano, in Chili, and arrived there on 1st September—while there we shipped a black man as steward called William Price—three of the crew, Lewis, John, and Greene, were im<lb></lb>prisoned there for refusing to join the ship, after an inquiry before the Consul—I was examined before the Consul as to the captain's conduct—I made a report—the three men were ordered to join the ship, and were released on 23rd September—while, we were at Talcahano I was in the habit of seeing the captain nearly every day, I frequently saw him drunk there—on 21st October we sailed for England—two or three weeks before Christ<lb></lb>mas it was my watch from 6 to 8 p.m.—at 8 o'clock the prisoner informed me that he had given me some orders which I had not heard—I am rather deaf, and was particularly so at that time—he also said he had given me two orders the night previous, and that I had not answered him, and he wished to know the reason why I would not answer—instead of directly replying that it was owing to deafness, I asked him if he did not know the reason—he said "No"—I said "What did you pour some oil in my ear the night before last for? why do people roar and shout at me round the deck the last few days, did not you hear that?"—he said that I was too good to answer, that he believed what I was saying was false—he said that he did not go speaking round the deck to other people—I said "Now I suppose we are coming to the two-faced business?"—he answered that he did not particularly single me out as being two—faced—I replied "I am two—faced, shall I give you a sample?"—he laughed and said "Yes"—I said "When the crew were before the Consul at Talcahano I told the Consul that you were a gentleman, and that was an infernal two faced lie n—he asked if I was alluding about his drunkenness, and said "I suppose you will say the same as the rest, that I was always drunk"—I said "I can't say you were always drunk, but that you were many times drunk is perfectly true"—he said he did not care a d—for me, nor the owners, nor the Consul, and he used some foul</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I last saw the captain on the night of the 24th, between 8 o'clock and midnight, on deck—up to that time I noticed nothing at all remarkable in his demeanour—he attended to the work of the ship as usual—after the report of the gun I saw nothing of the steward. William Jones. I am now bring at the Sailors' Home in Well Street—I was carpenter of the. Standard Bearer—about three weeks before this occurrence I heard some words between the mate and the captain—I heard the captain say, "You had best look out for yourself from this time out"—on Christmas morning about half-past 11 I was on the main deck with a passenger—the mate came up with his trousers on his arm and made a state<lb></lb>ment to me—I saw that his mouth was bleeding—he ran forward-afterwards the mate and the steward went down into the cabin—about three minutes after that I heard the report of a gun—I only heard one report—the mate then came up the companion streaming with blood—the men took him forward—I heard the boatswain call down the skylight and say, "Captain Davis," and the captain said, "Hallo"—he said, "The men have come aft to know if it is safe for them to go on with their duty"—the captain replied, "Safe enough on my part now, I shall not do nothing"—the boatswain said, "Shall I come down and speak with you, sir"—he replied, "Yes, you can come down one at a time"—the boatswain then want down and I followed a little afterwards—the captain sung out, "Who is in the companion there?"—I said, "It is me"—he said, "Is that you, carpenter?"—I said, "Yes, I hope you will not shoot me if I come in there"—he said, "You need not be afraid of that chip, I won't hurt you"—I went into the cabin but could not see the captain—he said, "Here I am up here, chip"—I then looked and saw he was up in the stern ladder against the rudder case, at the back of the cabin—I saw one of his feet was bare, and I saw the gun end on towards me—I said, "What is all this about, sir?"—he said, "God knows, capeuter, I would not hurt no one; but I had a cause for it"—I asked if he knew what he had done—he said, "Yes, perfectly well, and I can stand the law for it"—I asked, "What cause have you for it, sir?"—he said, "I</p>

               <p>was coming out of my room to go to the pantry for a biscuit, and I met the man coming out of his room with a revolver, and I twisted it out of his hand and shot him"—I said, "The mate came on deck and told us you shot him in his sleep"—he said, "No, no,"—I said, "It was a cowardly thing for you to go and shoot the man in his sleep"—he said, "I was bound to do it, carpenter; I could hold it no longer"—I said, "For God's sake give me up that gun and revolver before you do more harm"—he said he would not give them up, they belong to him—I did not see any revolver—I told him to come down from there, what was he doing sticking up there—he then said to me, "You beggar, if I come down you will shove me in irons"—I said, "There is nobody talking about irons; give me up the gun and revolver"—he said, "I will tell you what I will do: I will take them adrift; I will take one half and give you the other half, then they can't do no harm to nobody"—I said, "All right, sir, I will go and fetch some tools to open them—he said, "You don't require no tools; I can open them up here"—I then asked him to open them—he said he would not, they belonged to him—he said, "Look here, I can see people in this cabin now around me"—I told him there was nobody there only me and the boatswain sitting on the settee—he said, "Look here, I tried to get forward to the men, but I was watched; you were in your bunk making signs with the bolt, and Mr. Borland was at the table watching me, and the small boy was a policeman over me"—I said, "All nonsense, there is something on your mind, sir"—he said, "Yes, there is"—he then made a movement with the gun, and I jumped out of the cabin into the steerage—the prisoner said, "You need not be afraid, chip, I am not going to hurt you"—I said, "I don't know so much about that; it looked very much like it then"—one of the men shouted down, "Chip, see if you can see the steward down there, he has not come up"—I looked into the mate's room and saw a spot of blood on the floor as if it had been spat out of the mouth—I went across to the pantry door; it was three parts closed—I called out "Steward" twice—I got no answer, and I opened the door and saw the steward lying in the pantry—I called out, "My God, boys, he has killed the steward"—he was in a sitting position on the floor, with his back up against the bulkhead—I could see that he was dead—a poker lay alongside of him, and two or three loaves of bread—I sang out that the steward was shot, and ran on deck—the captain said, "It is only a yarn, the steward is all right"—I did not notice then where the steward was injured—when I left the cabin the captain was right up on the stern ladder—he was therethe whole time—he appeared to be sober—he remained below—the boatswain came on deck shortly afterwards with some canvas and a tin of linseed meal—later in the day I spoke to the captain again—I asked him to give up his arms, he would not—he said, "Tell the passenger I want to see him"—the passenger came aft after some time—the captain said to him, "Mr. Borland, come down here, I won't keep you a minute"—Mr. Borland said, "l am afraid; give up your arms and I will come down"—he said he would not give them up—he said to me, "I will tell you what I will do; you get the revolver from the mate and take it adrift and I will take mine adrift; I will give you the halves, and you give me half the mate's revolver, then there can be no harm done"—I then went to the boatswain for the mate's revolver—I got it and took it to pieces—I gave the barrel and six balls and the rollerto one of the men, and took it aft and hove it down the skylight to the captain</p>

On 5th February I went to Dunquerque and found the prisoner there detained in custody—I said to him "You are Captain Davis?" he said "Yes, Captain William Davis"—I told him I was an inspector, and that I was going to take him into custody and charge him with murdering Price, a colored man, the steward of the barque Standard Bearer, on the high seas on 25th December, and also with attempting to murder James Craig, the mate—he said "All I hope is the truth will come out; what I have done I did to defend myself. I saw the mate coming down the cabin stairs with a revolver in his hand; as for the steward, I know nothing about it; I did not know he was there, and when the crew told me he was dead I thought they were telling me lies to make me come out. I shall give you no trouble; I will go to London my self to meet the charge"—I received from the captain of the Sardinian this gun and this seven-hambered revolver—I found one empty cartridge case in it; the other chambers were loaded—in the prisoner's chest I found a box containing two tins of cartridges to at the revolver, one full, the other partially full—</p>

               <p>can safely say that it was not put on, but that he was speaking what he believed; I specially watched that—Dr. Forbes Winslow saw him alone, and I saw him once with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. From what I saw, and from the evidence I have heard, I do not think he was responsible for the act with which he is charged when he committed it; I mean that he was not aware what he was about, his mind was so deranged, he was labouring under delusions, and was not aware what the true fact was; that he really thought that what he was doing was in self-defence to protect his own life.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of Her Majesty's Gaol of New-gate, and have been so nearly 25 years—I have had a large experience in seeing insane persons there—the prisoner came in on 23rd February, and I have seen him since then daily—at the first interview I inquired what the charge was, I had not then heard or read one word concerning the case, and at the first interview I had with him I considered that he was suffering under delusions—that impression was quite confirmed by my subsequent interviews—in my judgment he is insane—one of his delusions was that he was nearly suffocated by sulphur in his room, and he had to place his face against the window in order to get breath, for nearly two hours—he like<lb></lb>wise believed that the crew had conspired to kill him, and that he heard them signalling beneath his room at the gangway, that he once saw the after hatchway thrown open, and there was a cloth there with nails and screws and hammers on it, and he believed they were about to cut him up and put him into this cloth and throw him overboard—assuming he was in the same state at Christmas last, I do not think he would know right from wrong—I think he was so powerfully under these delusions that they would completely control his conduct—I do not say that he is not now fit to tab his trial, he is able to know and understand matters very clearly.</p>

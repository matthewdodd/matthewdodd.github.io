               <p>I live in Red-cross-square, near Aldersgate-street, I am a cabinet-maker and constable: I was sent for about half after nine on the 12th of August, to take charge of that man and another, the prisoner owned to me he took these three plates out of the yard with intent to go to get some beef stakes.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you say to induce him to own that? - I said, perhaps he might find some lenity, but I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Did you say to him that it would be better for him? - I did not say any thing to him particular, I took him to the Compter; we went before Alderman Sainsbury, and he owned there before the Alderman that he took these plates, because he was hungry to go to the cook's, and get him some cook's victuals.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How came he to tell you he had taken the plates? - He said, he wanted some victuals, he said, he had none all day.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Did this man ever frequent your house before? - I never saw him before that I know off.</p>
               <p>Jury. After his coat was taken off were the plates found under him? - Yes, on the place where he sat.</p>

            , of Baxter's-court. On the 10th of October I was going to town across London-fields - I saw the prisoner, whom I had seen before; there were two men coming after him; they called to him, that he was carrying it uncovered; that attracted my attention - I looked round to see what it was, and saw the prisoner had a copper boiler on his shoulder; when he saw that I was at his elbow, he said he was going to take it to have a lid - I passed on, and the prisoner stopt behind with the two men who appeared to be bricklayers, and the pot was covered up.</p>

            . I am son of this witness, and am eleven years of age; I know the nature of an oath. I was with my mother on that day; I saw the prisoner with a pot on his back - I had seen the prisoner before at the Cock public-house carrying out beer - there were two bricklayer's men near the prisoner, when I saw him in the field, but I did not hear what they said to him - the pot was uncovered when I first saw it, and I suppose they covered it to conceal it.</p>

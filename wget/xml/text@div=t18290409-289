            . JUN. I am fourteen years old next month. On this day my father went out about six o'clock, leaving nobody that was engaged in the business but myself; the back door of the warehouse was open when my father left - I shut it directly; he went and locked it - the back door opens into a yard - a person could easily get to the yard without going through the house; all was safe then - I locked the doors, gave the light to the servant, and went out directly; the street door was locked also - nobody could get in except by force; the servant could not open the street door, for I took the key; I returned with my father about half-past seven o'clock and went up stairs - I was playing with the baby, and my father thought he heard a noise; I went down with a light, and found the back door shut and locked the same as when I left it; I did not examine the warehouse - I went up stairs again; my father afterwards sent me down stairs to fill the tea-kettle - the kitchen is on the same floor as the warehouse - and as I went by I saw the back door about half way open; I called to my father, went into the warehouse directly, and perceived some drawers lying on the counters - they had been in their places before; all the things were gone out of them; they were the drawers from where the silk or bobbins were taken - my father missed the property; the ribbons were kept in the drawers on the left-hand side - those drawers were not taken out of their places; I had the key of the back door in my pocket - nobody could have got in without forcing it; I know the prisoner, he came to the warehouse that same evening, about two hours before I left the house, to pay me 5s. which he owed my father for cottons he had bought; he knew the house, and often came there - he used to come into the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long did he stay in the warehouse that night? A. Two or three minutes; he has staid as long as that before; I did not suspect any harm of him; I locked the front and back door - the servant could go down a flight of stairs and go out without coming to the warehouse; it is a large house - there are four rooms and a shop.</p>
               <p>Q. A noise made in one part might easily be heard in the other? A. Yes; at night the servants were up stairs.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the prisoner's business? A. Yes; he is a silk-weaver, and has manufactured his own work; I have known him manufacture hatters' hands - that is never called ribbon; Towers had heard I had the goods to sell - he did not suspect me.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer of Worship-street. On the 17th of March I took the prisoner at his own house in Princes-court, Gibraltar-walk, Bethnal-green; I asked him if he had sold any ribbon or hat-hands to Appleby - he said he had; I asked him where he got it - he said he found it about a fortnight ago on Farthing-hill; I shewed him one of them; I told him I should take him on suspicion of the robbery - Towers was with me; he denied the charge - I went up stairs to the room which he said he lived in, and found a quantity of cotton and a small quantity of silk, some in skeins and some on bobbins; he said they were all his own, and he had bought them; I told him he had better produce the bill of parcel before the Magistrate; the prosecutor said he had lost things of the quality, but would not swear to them; he identified the pieces of hands before the Magistrate - I got one of them from Hicks, and the other from the prosecutor himself.</p>

            . These hat-bands were manufactured by a person I employed; I know the make, because it is one colour on the edge, and another on the body of the work; it was returned to my hands by Appleby's brother a month before the robbery - it was damaged, which was the reason I had them laying by me; I am certain they were in my own possession before the house was broken open - the person who manufactured them is not here; I had seen it that day in a large drawer, with thirty-two pieces, which were taken at the same time (looking at the hat-band); the drawer they were in was about half way open, and the lock hanging on one screw; it was in its proper state when I left the house - the prisoner's father was taken into custody, and discharged; he had never worked for me - some things were found in a room in the father's house, but the prisoner said he rented it of his father.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How many locks of drawers had been forced open? A. Only one; it had been done without much noise, for they had laid mats on the floor, to prevent their being heard - a noise would not be heard on the top story; we had a suspicion of the very man who manufactured these, but did not have him taken up; he had an opportunity of knowing the premises - he did not work for me at the time, and did not come above once a week - it is two years since he worked for me; he then worked in my shop - what I speak to this by is the difference in colour; it was a mistake of mine in putting two colours in - I never saw such before, nor has any other man I should think; I heard the noise about eight o'clock- I only heard one noise.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had you sold them to Appleby's brother? A. He ordered it of me, and returned it on my bands on account of the badness of colour; and after the robbery they were taken to his brother for sale; he knew it, and gave me information.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Is that the band you received from the prisoner, and offered to your brother, which he rejected? A. This is one of them - I did not take them to my brother, but sent them to him; he did not choose to have them; I could tell they were not well manufactured the instant I saw them; I shewed them to several hatters, who rejected them, as being badly made.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is that the first badly manufactured article you ever saw? A. No, nor the last.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you ever see any with the same defect in it? A. Never exactly, but very similar; it would be foolish to manufacture as this is - the body of the work is good, but the edges are another colour, thick, and clumsy; it is possible to make the same mistake.</p>

            . I remember the 14th of February. I saw the prisoner at half-past three o'clock that afternoon, and until eight in the evening, at the Half Moon public-house, in Bacon-street, Bethnal-green, which is no great way from Phoenix-street; I can walk it in five minutes - nothing particular occurred to make me remember the date; I left the place at eight o'clock, leaving him behind me there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What day was it? A. It was on a Saturday - I do not wear a watch; Spitalfield's church bell rings at eight o'clock, and it rang as I was going home; I left as it was ringing; it always strikes out at eight - I left while it was sounding.</p>

            . I am brother to the last witness. I saw the prisoner at the Half Moon; I was with my brother - I went there about a quarter before seven, and remained there with the prisoner till a little after eight o'clock; he then went away - it might be five minutes past eight; the bell rings till a quarter past eight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you look at the public-house clock? A. Yes, I am quite sure of that; I generally look at the clock - the prisoner went away about five minutes, or it might be two or three minutes after eight; the Half Moon is about one hundred or one hundred and fifty yards from the prosecutor's house.</p>

            . I am a broad silk-weaver. I saw the prisoner at the Half Moon on the 14th of February; I went about half-past six o'clock, and he went away near upon eight.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090135"></xptr>ELIZABETH SMITH. My husband is a silk-manufacturer. I have known the prisoner nearly six years, and he bore a very good character; I saw him at my house on the 14th of February; I live at No. 19, Fashion-street, Bethnal-green.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you see him? A. My husband had just come home from work; it had just gone eight o'clock when he came and knocked at our door, and remained there with my piece, while I went to market, and stopped with me, when I came back, till twenty minutes past nine; I then went with him to his mother's, to lend her my cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you go out to market? A. Just as the bell had done ringing eight - he came in as I went out: my house is about two hundred yards from the Half Moon; the bell generally rings a quarter of an hour - I left him in the house, and found him there when I returned.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On what day was this? A. Saturday, about a month before he was taken up; I was at Worship-street when he was examined - but was not called in; I recollect it was Saturday, the 14th, because my niece's birth-day was the next day - I do not recollect that Saturday by any particular name; he frequently visited us, being a neighbour's child - he came two or three times a week; I had nothing particular to induce me to recollect the day more than I have said.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was in the habit of calling on other days, why do you recollect that day? A. Yes; but that night he did not wish me good night, as I had to go to his mother's to take her a cloak; I do not keep my niece's birth day - I did not invite any friends.</p>
               <p>Q. What then makes you recollect it was the Saturday before her birth-day? A. I heard of this robbery being done on the following week - I did not hear he was suspected for a month after; I have no particular reason for recollecting his calling that night - he called on other Saturdays; his mother came that day to ask me to lend her a cloak, to go to their uncle's next morning - that was about six o'clock in the evening - she had never borrowed it before.</p>
               <p>Q. What enables you to say it was that particular Saturday? A. I have no particular reason; she returned it on Monday the 16th; I do not generally know the date of the month - I did not invite the prisoner or his mother to come on my niece's birth-day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then is there any thing particular to lead you to remember the day, besides it being the day before your niece's birth-day? A. No - only she named to me that it was that day; the prisoner's mother told me it was Saturday the 14th; I have no reason for believing it was then, except from what she told me; the prisoner was taken up on a Tuesday, and after that his mother told me it was the day she borrowed the cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have recollected it unless the mother told you? A. No - I should not.</p>

            . Q. Do you remember last Valentine-day, as you are a young woman? A. Yes, it was the 14th of February; the prisoner came to our house that day as the bell was ringing eight o'clock, and staid till nine, or a few minutes after; he never went out during that time: my aunt came in from market, and then I went out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was your birth-day? A. On Sunday, the 15th; the prisoner often visited me - he was paying his addresses to me; he generally came on Saturdays more than on other days - but not at my aunt's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where then did you meet him? A. Not particularly on Saturday - I was not always at my aunt's; I lived there - I do not recollect his visiting me any where else; he sometimes met me at the corner of the street - not always at my aunt's; I recollect this day, because it was Valentine's-day, and my birth-day was the 15th - he did not come the next Saturday, not that I recollect; he did not come every Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss him on any Saturday? A. Yes, but not on any particular Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you remember this Saturday? A. Because next day a neighbour's daughter told me Towers had been robbed overnight - she lives next door to Towers: I did not tell any body the prisoner was with me that night, because nothing was said about him - I heard of his being taken up on the day he was taken, and said he was with me from a few minutes past eight o'clock till nine; I told a good many people so - I told my aunt; I did not see him on the Sunday, as I went on the Sunday morning with a neighbour's daughter to Woolwich; I did not come home till Tuesday night, and then heard he was taken - I went to Worship-street, and saw him getting into the van: I told my mother and a great many more that he was with me on the night of the robbery - I did not tell any body at the office so; I did not know any one - I went to Clerkenwell on the Friday, the day after he was examined; I knew when he was to be examined again, but did not go to the office - my aunt went, and I staid at home; I did not think it would be of any use for me to go - I stopped at home to do the cleaning; my aunt went - she was not called - she knew I was in his company from eight o'clock to nine.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the King William the Fourth public-house. The prisoner was in my employ for three weeks—on the 24th of July I found my cash-box broken open, which I kept locked in a drawer in my bed-room—I found the drawer and the box both broken open, and fifteen sovereigns gone—I missed all the plate mentioned in the indictment from the drawer, and six silk handkerchiefs—both the locks were forced—I discovered it about a quarter before twelve o'clock in the day—I had seen them safe over night—the sovereigns and cash-box I saw at half-past eleven o'clock at night—about a quarter to twelve o'clock in the day I heard the landing door of the stair-case slam two or three times—I went up stairs to my bed-room, and saw the prisoner standing at the drawer which was broken open, and stood wide open—his arm was leaning on the drawer—he bad no business in my room at that time—when the windows wanted cleaning he had—I asked him what he did at that drawer, who sent him there—he was confused, and could not give me an answer for some time—he went to the window, and said at last, he went there because he heard a little dog barking—I said, "This drawer has been broken open"—he said, "You do not think I could do it?"—I said, "Who else can I think to have done it?"—I called for Mr. and Mrs. Browning, and said, I had been robbed, and when I made the alarm, the last prosecutor called out, "I have been robbed too"—I sent for a con<lb></lb>stable, and gave him in charge after some time, but I did not like at first to do so, for while he was with me he was always so just and accurate in his business—I found a knife in the drawer where the cash-box had been broken open—I had rang for the prisoner to come to me three or four times about a quarter of an hour before I found him where he was, and he did not answer the bell, which it was his duty to do.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook to Mr. Orchard. I made hit bed and left the bed-room about eleven o'clock on the morning in question—I dusted the drawer which the cash-box was in—the drawers were all per<lb></lb>fectly close—I then went down into the kitchen—at twelve o'clock when I went about my business, I missed a knife from the kitchen, which was afterwards found in the drawer—I had used that knife between nine and ten o'clock that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. The prisoner was given into my custody on the 23rd of July—as I took him to the station-house, I asked him if he had ever seen his master's plate—he said, "No"—I said, "Nor I have not seen any"—he said, "Don't say any more than you can help, or else you may get me remanded for a week or two."</p>

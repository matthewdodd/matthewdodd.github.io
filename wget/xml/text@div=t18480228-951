                  </hi> I am the wife of James Rayner, who is employed in the Tower—our house is in the parish of St. Olave, Southwark. On Monday, 21st Feb., we went out about twenty minutes to eight in the morning, I leav<lb></lb>ing the windows fastened in the middle and at the two sides with an extra fastening, and the door locked—we left no one ib the house—I returned again at half-past four in the afternoon—my husband let me in—he had got home five or six minutes before me—I went up stairs, and found the things out of all my boxes and drawers, and tossed all over the room—the top cash of the front parlour window was open—from below I missed nothing but a cloak which had been in the parlour—from the bed-room I missed seven dresses, four shawls, three waistcoats, four shirts, two pairs of trowsers, a hat, a gold ring, a watch, and a coat—I have since seen a shift which was in the drawer in the bed-room—my name was on it, but it has been picked out—a pane of glass was taken out of the window above the catch, which would enable any one to unfasten it and out the window up.</p>

On Monday, 21st Feb., I was in Sparrick's-row, about two o'clock, and saw the prisoner, Sutton, at Mr. Rayner's front window—I knew him before, and am sure it was he—there was another with him—the other got in at the window, and Sutton immediately shut the shutters which are outside—Sutton remained outside—he asked me what I wanted—I waited till rhe other man came out at the door—in about a quarter of an hour he joined Sutton, and they both went away together—I cannot positively say that Davis is the other man—I have not said he was not the man—I said I could not say that he was.</p>

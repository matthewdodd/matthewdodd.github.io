            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 19th of September, I saw Mr. Stamp beyond Hatton-garden, near Furnival's Inn, in the City; I saw the prisoners for ten minutes before, in company with a third- I saw them just before they came to Brook-street, following Mr. Stamp, who was with a lady; at the end of Brook-street, they all three went close up to Mr. Stamp; Sage laid hold of the left-hand skirt of the pocket, put his hand in, and took out a box - the other two were close behind him; Sage immediately handed it to Greenway - they then rushed up into Brook-street; I rushed on them immediately and laid hold of the two prisoners, without losing sight of them, and Greenway threw the box down on the pavement - I picked it up, lodged them in a shop and handcuffed them; I then went after Mr. Stamp, and told him of it - I have not seen the third since; I should know him again. The prosecutor described the box to me before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230013"></xptr>he saw it - it had a particular kind of snuff in it; I was on the curb, the same side of the way as them.</p>
               <p>MR. STAMP. This is my box - it contained some of the same snuff which I had put into it; it had come from the West Indies.</p>
               <p>SAGE'S Defence. A man came up and asked me to buy a box; I said I had no use for it - he came to this young man, (who is a stranger to me) and asked him to buy it; I followed him, and the officer took us.</p>
               <p>GREENWAY'S Defence. A man in a leather apron came and asked me to buy the box; I said I had got one - he took me to the light to look at it, and put it into my hand- the officer came and he ran away; the box dropped out of my hand.</p>
               <p>DANIEL RIORDAN. That is impossible; I was after them before they got three feet into Brook-street - he threw the box down.</p>

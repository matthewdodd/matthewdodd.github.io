               <p>CHARLES FREDERICK JAMES. I am a brewer, and live in Portland-town, directly opposite Mr. Baylis' private door. On Sunday, the 6th of December, I was in my brew-house, and saw two men standing before Mr. Baylis' private door, with their faces towards me - I took no particular notice of them, till I saw the prisoner Butler, who I knew before, by seeing him two or three times before; I saw him go to the private door, put his hand to the keyhole, and as I thought put a key in - he opened the door, went in, and shut it after him; I first saw him try as if the key did not answer the purpose, and then make a second attempt - I saw his hand at the key-hole, but saw nothing in his hand; the door was apparently shut before- I then ran into my parlour, told my wife, then went out, crossed over, looked up and down the street, and saw only a little boy, except the two men, who had shifted to the corner of the house; I went up to them, seeing nobody in the street, and said, "The sooner that man is out of the house the better;" I then went, and brought Webb, the officer - he went into the adjoining house to Baylis, and brought the prisoner out by the collar; I had observed him loitering about the house two or three Sundays previous, but never in the week-day - I went into the house in about two hours, and it was all in confusion; the bed-clothes, bed, and mattress were all turned over.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You saw the hand towards the door? A. Yes - I was across the street, which is narrow; from his position I suppose he was opening the door with a key - he might have been tapping at the door.</p>
               <p>ALICE BAYLIS. I am the daughter of William Baylis, and live at <placeName id="t18300114-9-crimeloc53">No. 53, High-street, Portland-town</placeName>

On Sunday, the 6th of December, my father and mother went out at five minutes past eleven o'clock in the morning, leaving me alone in the house - I staid there till twenty minutes or half-past eleven, and then locked up the house; there are four rooms - I locked them all but the back room up stairs: I am sure I left nobody in the house - I locked the outer private door, and put the key into my pocket; I came back a little before twelve - my father and mother were not with me; I found the private door open, and the front bed-room door, which I had left locked was broken open - the bed turned off the bedstead, all the things turned over in a chest of drawers which was not locked; two brooches, three gold pins, and an ear-ring of mine were taken from one drawer, and were afterwards found on the stairs - I had left them in a drawer in the front bed-room; I had not seen them that morning, but am sure they were left there - I found them in Jackson's possession; I had put them in the drawer myself - I cannot exactly say when; I always keep them in one particular place in the drawer; these are them (examining them.)</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH JAMES. My husband gave me information of this - I did not see the man go in; I saw a man at the first floor window, and alarmed the neighbours - the prisoner was brought out.</p>

            . I am an officer. About half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by my wife -I was asleep in the first floor room; I heard there was a thief in Baylis' house - I dressed, and got to the house in four minutes; I went round to the front door, examined it and found it closed - I then went through the shop of Mr. Pratt, a butcher, next door, and got over the wall into Baylis' yard, as the people surrounding the house said the thief was in the yard; I searched the wash-house and privy - he was not there, but on turning round I saw him through the staircase window, coming down the prosecutor's stairs - it was the prisoner; I went round, and posted two housekeepers at the front door - then returned over the wall into Baylis' yard; I found the back door fastened - I stepped five or six yards from the door, heard it open, and the prisoner came out; I collared him, and brought him through the house into High-street - I then got Jackson to mind the house, took the prisoner down the street, and met Soper, an officer - I then put my hand into the prisoner's coat pocket, and took out this crowbar; Soper took out this picklock-key - a small box-key, and a comb were found on him, and a large blue bag in his hat, with his handkerchief: I handcuffed him, and took him to the watch-house in Regent's-park - he was searched by the serjeant, but nothing more was found, except his handkerchief, which I gave him to wipe his hand which was bleeding very severely when I took him; I returned to the house, and found the front bed-room on the first floor broken open - here is the screw of the case the lock goes into, it appeared to have been forced off by this crow-bar; three bureau drawers were opened, every article taken on, and thrown on the floor - the drawers were open, they stood in the front bed-room; I then saw three boxes open, every article taken out, and strewed about the room - he made no resistance.</p>

            . I live directly opposite Baylis' house. On the 6th of December, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I went out, seeing a few people collected in the street; I saw Webb, and went through the next house over the wall with him - while I was on the wall I saw the prisoner coming down stairs, by the staircase window; he came out at the door - I jumped off the wall, and Webb took him; I went into the house to mind it - I found there three pins, two brooches, and an ear-ring in pasteboard boxes, at the foot of the staircase - I showed them to Alice Baylis, who claimed them; I gave them to the officer - those produced are the same; I found two skeleton-keys under the mat of the door, and gave them to Manning.</p>
               <p>JOHN MANNING. I am an officer. These keys were given to me; I produce them - I had charge of the prisoner during the night of the 6th of December and on the 7th; I held out no threat or promise to him - he asked me if James was in custody; I asked him what James - he said John James, or if Charley Box was in custody; I asked why he inquired - he said, "Because they were with me in it yesterday;" we had been talking about breaking into Baylis' house - he asked me what Baylis had lost; I told him I believed nothing was taken away, but some things were found on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search to see if any one might have been secreted in the house to let him in? A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140016"></xptr>I searched the house, and found nobody in it - I did not search every room.</p>

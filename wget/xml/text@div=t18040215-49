               <p>Q. What does your family consist of? - A. My wife, and my wife's sister, who is seventy-one; she can hardly go up and down stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You had so good an opinion of her, that you took her to the Castle, and gave her some dinner there? - A. Yes, I gave her some victuals; I did not eat any myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a good opinion of her? - A. Yes, and so had my wife.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. And you would take her home now? - A. No, I would not do that; I don't want to hurt her.</p>
               <p>Q. How many seven-shilling pieces were there? - A. They were all marked - the seven-shilling pieces, the half-guineas, and the guineas; my son-in-law marked them.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they marked with? - A. With a W, and a notch under the crown.</p>
               <p>Q. When you charged her with this seven-shilling piece, what did she say? - A. She said she had it not; the constable found it on her.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am a constable of Hatton-garden: Mr. Carter told me he had been robbed by a servant girl; I went with him to the prisoner's-brother in Laystall-street, where I found her; I searched her, and found the seven-shilling piece that Mr. Carter had described to me.</p>

               <p>Q. How many seven-shilling pieces were there in this money? - A. There were ten guineas in the whole; I cannot say how many seven-shilling pieces, or how many half guineas.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Carter.) You entrusted your son-in-law to mark them? - A. Yes, and I gave her some victuals, I thought very well of doing so, before she went to prison; she did not know, poor thing, where she was going to; I do not wish to be in any trouble.</p>

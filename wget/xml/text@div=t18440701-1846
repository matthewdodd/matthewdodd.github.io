                  </hi>. I am shopwoman to Frederick Metcalf, stationer, Marchmont-street, Brunswick-square. On the afternoon of the 17th of June I was at the back of the shop—in consequence of something I came forward, and found a customer there—the prisoner was there—he asked for a halfpenny pen—I served him—he paid me and went out—after he was gone I disco<lb></lb>vered the glass case at the end of the counter was opened, and the picture which was on it removed, these books taken out, and put at another part—they were in the case before—I sent the boy after the prisoner—he came back of his own accord with the boy—I asked him why he went to the case and took the books out—he said he did not—I said I knew he had—he said he begged my pardon, and said he wanted to buy a shilling prayer-book for his sister, and he took the Bible—I said it was not the prayer-book—he said he would buy it—I gave him in charge of the policeman.</p>

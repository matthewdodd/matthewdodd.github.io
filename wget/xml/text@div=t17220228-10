Mr. Kite depos'd, that the Deceas'd about 3 Weeks after the Accident, told him, her Husband and she had some Words in the Morning: that he depos'd her to come to Breakfast, which she refus'd, and after several entreaties, said, if I was sure to be killed for not coming, I would not come, using other provoking Words, and then sat down upon the Bed, behind the Curtain; that having the Poker in his Hand, he threw it towards her at random, and it unfortunately stuck in her Head. Other Witnesses depos'd, that the Deceased said she had provok'd him, and freely forgave him, and desired he might not be prosecuted. They added, that the prisoner was very good natur'd, and liv'd very lovingly with his Wife till this Accident. The Poker was produc'd in Court, was about half a Yard long, sharp at both ends, and not very thick. Mr. Sadler, the Surgeon, and his Servant, depos'd, that the Wound was prob'd about an Inch deep, the Poker having penetrated through both Tables of the Skull, and the Dura Mater, or first Membrane; that the Deceased said mild Symptoms for about 3 Weeks, but afterwards grew worse, and that they believ'd the Wound was mortal. The prisoner appear'd very much concern'd at the Bar. He said, that being in a Passion, and highly provok'd, he unadvisedly threw the Poker at random towards his Wife, who sat behind the Curtain, where he did not see her, and that he had no Malice against her, nor any design or thought of hurting her. <rs id="t17220228-10-verdict68" type="verdictDescription">

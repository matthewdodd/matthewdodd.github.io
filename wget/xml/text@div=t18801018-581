                  </hi>. I am a Justice of the Peace for the county of Middlesex, and live at No. 5, Queensborough Place, Cromwell Road, Kensington—in 1877 I banked at the London Joint Stock Bank—in August that year I purposed travelling on the Continent, and applied to the bank for 10 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. circular notes, which I received; to the best of my belief these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are eight of those notes—I received at the same time a letter of indication from the bank—at that time my name was in the body of the notes, where the name of Edward Austin now appears—they were then dated 13th August, 1877; they now appear to be dated 5th February, 1878—they then had the No. 16391 corresponding with the number of my letter of indication; they now have the No. 16615—there was no endorsement on them when I last saw them—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the letter of indication that I received; it contains my own signature with the No. 16,391 at the top, dated 13th August, 1877; it has my name, Frederick Young, in the body, and my own signature also—on 15th August, 1877, I crossed from Folkestone to Boulogne—I put the notes in a pocket-book in one pocket, and the letter of indication in a separate pocket—I missed my pocket-book containing the notes when I was at Boulogne; I did not lose the letter of indication—I went on to Paris, and from there telegraphed to the bank and received fresh notes—I</p>

               <p>never authorised any one to sign Edward Austin on any of these notes nor did I instruct anybody to cash them—as far as I recollect I last saw my pocket-book safe about five or 10 minutes before the vessel reached Boulogne; I had occasion to take it out of my pocket to get a boat coupon, which I tore off and put in the pocket-book—I was a witness here when Cherwood was tried in May, 1878.

I am head cashier of the Southwark branch of the London Joint Stock Bank—I know the prisoner by the name of John Watson—on 31st January, 1878, he opened an account in that name at our branch—he was a stranger; he gave a respectable reference—he described himself as a diamond dealer, of 71, Clapham Road—I produce the signature book which he signed on opening the account—he opened it by a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on 1st February he paid in 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the 4th 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. twice, and on 8th 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the debit side there is 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a stamped cheque-book containing 50 cheques, on the 4th February, Critchley 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on the 6th, circular notes, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 12th, Murray 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 19th, Hugal 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was the last debit; that was paid in the ordinary way—the account was closed by a debit to some solicitors—there was a cheque for 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 23rd February in favour of Charles Cherwood, and endorsed Charles Cherwood—that would, if paid, have overdrawn the account 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the amount of the stamped cheque-book, but I returned it—it came from Mr. Kino through our head office—I paw the prisoner from time to time—on 4th February he applied to me for 10 circular notes of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, as he was going on the Continent—I applied to the head office for them, as we did not issue them—I got them, and also a letter of indication—I have no means of identifying these produced; they are 10 circular notes in favour of John Watson for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, No. 16615, dated 6th February, 1878—the prisoner's endorsement "John Watson" is on each of them—the letter of indication I gave him corresponded with the circular notes; it would be in the same form as Mr. Young's, and would have on it the number that was on the notes, 16615—I afterwards received this letter</p>

               <p>from the prisoner, dated 6th February, 71, Clapham Road, acknowledg<lb></lb>ing the receipt of the notes—I afterwards heard of the letter of indication haying been improperly used, and I wrote a letter to the prisoner, asking him to call at the bank—I received this answer. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Paris, Monday 13th, 1878. Dear Sir,—Your communication left with my wife reached me to-day. Business of moment calls me to Marseilles, and I leave here this p.m. I wish to certify you at the same time that I have had the misfortune to lose my pocket-book containing your letter of indication. I believe it to have been stolen from me; therefore I shall call on you immediately on my return to London. Yours truly, John Watson.") The envelope to that letter had the Paris post-mark on it—he was after<lb></lb>wards written to again, but we got no answer—on 20th February he returned, through the post, the 40 unused cheques—I believe they came from Paris—as we did not pay the 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque the balance was left at our bank until Cherwood's trial—Watson has never had it, or ever applied for it—we never saw or heard anything more of him until July last, when I saw him in custody at the Mansion House.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">A Prisoner</hi>).

S.; payment had been refused—I had endorsed it when I gave it to Kino—I kept it in my pocket, and when I was arrested on 2nd March I gave it to the officer who arrested me—I never saw the prisoner afterwards; I don't know what became of him—I had not seen him at all between 23rd February and 2nd March—I saw him on 24th February; I said nothing to him that I know of having any bearing on this case—I destroyed the letter of indica<lb></lb>tion that I had altered after the last note was cashed—I have been to the prisoner's house, 71, Clapham Road; it was a private house—I don't know that he has a wife; a woman was there living with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Madame Fouchois Grace—this is a paper that she wrote and issued at our hotel at Boulogne; it was the Royal Hotel Durande—she now keeps the Bedford—my mother kept that hotel in February, 1878—I was at school then, but I used to come home to dinner—my mother is too ill to travel—I produce the book from which this bill was made out, with the original entries in may mother's writing—this bill was made out to Mr. Watson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an interpreter at the Grand Hotel, Brussels—I was there in 1878, but the hotel has since that changed management three times—this is the arrival and departure book for 1878; it is not in my writing, but I had access to it every day—it is a proper record of persons coming there; but there is another, because a stranger coming to</p>

               <p>Brussels has to be booked at the Town Hall, and I used to take the book there—I find here an entry of John Watson, arriving on 9th February, 1878, and his departure is recorded on the 14th—he was the first arrival on 9th February—the train from Boulogne comes in at 6 a.m.—I also produce the ledger, in which I find chamber No. 54 entered to John Watson every day between the 9th and the 14th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It takes six hours and a half to get from Paris to Brussels by train—there are two express trains a day, and one in the evening, but only two in the summer time—the first train comes in at 5.30 a.m., the next at 1.58, and the next at 5.30, and the next at 10.20—it takes about six hours from Calais or Boulogne to Brussels—this entry seems all to be by one hand, but it is impossible that it was all written at one time—the book does not appear to be a fair copy of the arrivals that day; you can see perfectly well that these are two different writings—these three entries to John Watson are room, service, and candle—nothing else is entered here, but he might have gone to the restaurant; you are obliged to pay there—the only entries on the 10th are room, service, and a bath—I have no recollection of John Watson—I do not know what time he came or whether anybody was with him or visited him—it takes 58 minutes to get from Brussels to Antwerp.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">He-examined.</hi> It the guest took his meals in the restaurant he would pay there at that time, but it is different now—if Mr. Watson took his meals in the restaurant I should not find it here—he is supposed to be the first person who arrived that morning—five names are entered, and then there is another handwriting—in February there was a train in from Paris at 5.35 a.m., which left Paris at 8.15 the night before—one Boulogne train arrives at the Nord station and the other at the Midi station—the Boulogne train does not come through Calais, but they, join at St. Omer—that comes in at 6.5—there is always a train at 5.35, but it is not so fast as the others, and the mail train comes in at 1.35 all the year through—it is impossible for a person to get up and go to Paris and sleep there one night and get back, because leaving Brussels at 9 o'clock he would be in Paris at 4 o'clock, and he would be obliged to leave there at 5.30 to get back.</p>

I saw him again when he came with his family in July, 1878—February was the first time I saw him when I came home from school; I was at my dinner and saw him in the restaurant of the hotel; I did not speak to him—I cannot tell the day—I did not know his name then—we do not have much people in the winter—when I saw the man in July I remembered seeing him in the dining-room in February—the dining-room is downstairs—I was not managing the hotel in July; I was at school—mamma told me his name in February, John Watson—I only saw him in February and July, 1878; the next time was in Court to-day—I came over from Boulogne last Monday with some friends.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a son of Michael Abrahams, a solicitor, whose firm was formerly Abrahams and Roffey—he has a French con<lb></lb>nection and an office in Paris; he was on gagged with reference to the original Edward, Austin, whose circular notes I produce; here are five of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and four of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—they are letters of credit on the Alliance Bank given to Edward Austin and endorsed in that name—they are all dated 9th January, 1878.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">CUSSE</hi>. I am cashier at the Hotel de Louvre, Paris—I know the convict Cherwood very well, and he knows me—this piece of paper bears the stamp of my office or the signature of my directory, by which I am able to say that they were cashed at my place after the signature Edward Austin had been put at the back and money given in exchange for them—we do not put the date—we exchanged them after<lb></lb>wards—Cherwood came to the hotel on 7th February at 10 p.m.; he had a bundle of circular notes with him, and asked me whether I would cash them; the manager said "We cannot cash all those; we have not suffi<lb></lb>cient money;" I said "I can only cash 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to-morrow morning the cashier will give you some more"—he said "I will come again; I am going to see some friends, and I shall come back and take a room"—he came back at a quarter to 1 a.m. and asked me for a room, which I gave him, and then he asked me if I could cash some more circular notes—I said "I have not sufficient money, but in the morning you may come to the cash office and they will take them from you"—I sent him to the luggage lift because the other was closed, but did not go up with him as I could not leave the office—they took him to his room—he showed me his letter of indication at the time; I told him it was a matter of busi<lb></lb>ness—I did not change any more notes for him personally, nor was I there when they were cashed—I have looked at the circular notes and find that they were cashed at the hotel—directly a note is cashed at our office the name of some one is put on it and it is sent to the cashier of the Magasin do Louvre—we send all the English notes we receive to him, and here is his signature—this is the receipt from the Hotel du Louvre—I never saw Cherwood at the time Watson was there; he came alone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The cashier of the Magazin du Louvre only receives notes which we get—he does not take credit notes from the persons because he does not know them and we do—I cashed this note for a man coming to the hotel for the first time because I thought the manager knew him—the Magazin do Louvre would not do the same because it is a rule not to do so—I was then clerk on night duty—I cashed notes for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but cannot say whether it was two notes of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; it may have been—as he had taken a room at the hotel I cashed them without his showing me the letter of indication, but when I gave him his room I asked him to show it to me, and he did so—these two notes bear the stamp of my office and the name of the cashier, Testie, but I cannot say that they are the two which I cashed—I never saw him again after he went up to bed.</p>

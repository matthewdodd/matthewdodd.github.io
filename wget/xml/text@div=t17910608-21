After the robbery they dropped from the side, and left the door opened; I saw no more of them. They swore a good deal, and used intimidating and gross language, but no other bad usage; there was a cart which I got behind, and I saw them no more. One of them gave one of the horses a blow; we proceeded to Ponder's-end, where there was some of the militia, we sent them to pursue them, they returned without success. We went to Enfield-highway, I went to the ale-house, and sent for the constable, I ordered my groom to go with him to town, to lodge an information at Justice Spiller's, and also at Bow-street: the officer's name was

               <p>To Mrs. Bristow. Was you in the carriage at the same time Mr. Adair was robbed, Madam? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any thing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. I object to this; that is the subject of another criminal charge in this court, and I am sure on having an opportunity, by another indictment which lays before you of inquiring into the loss of Mrs. Bristow will not multiply charges on this indictment; she has a charge before the Court, that is before you and the Jury to decide, and regularly, whatever she has lost, is the subject of inquiry on that charge.</p>
               <p>Court. What her evidence will be, I do not at present know; but in the present opening, it seems to me it will be material; the articles were afterwards found in the chaise, in which the prisoners were, and will have an influence on this trial.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You lost your watch, Madam? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you seen that watch since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>(The watch produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, another of the Prisoner's Counsel. It is not evidence at all for her to prove her property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Have you had that watch long? - About nine months.</p>
               <p>Are you able to ascertain the number? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor the maker's name? - No; it is a silver watch gilt, the chain and the seal, from the appearance of them all together, I can say I had such; it is a small antique, I had such an one.</p>

I searched Bates, but found nothing particular on him; then there came up three gentlemen and assisted us; then Gillekey came out second, and Mr. Lindo got into the chaise, and delivered to me these two watches; they are the same I received from him, there was a brace of pistols brought in by somebody at the gate, they told me they brought them out of the chaise, they were not loaded, and these pieces of a bullet I found in Bates's breeches pocket; a guinea dropped when I was searching Mackaway, but I cannot say where it dropped from; no more money was found on them that night only six pence. When they were searched on Friday morning, six guineas and a half in a bag, was found upon Mackaway.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How far is Tottenham-High-cross to the place where you took the chaise? - It is more than four miles.</p>
               <p>How soon after you took the chaise, did you come up to the persons you describe? - As near as I can guess, it was three quarters of an hour, or an hour.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you might have got three or four miles further? - I do not know, I am not used to these things. I have had the watches ever since I took them before the Justice.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Dundas. On the 2d of June I was driving my coach on the road to Enfield-Highway, about ten in the evening, much about the eight-mile-stone, three men met me; I saw them seven or eight yards before me, they came to my horses heads, and said stop, stop! damn your eyes stop, or I will blow your brains out; I did not stop immediately; but one of them was separate from the other two, he went right before the horses heads; caught hold of the near horse's bridle, and said, if you do not stop, I will blow your brains out; the other went up to rob the passengers; and after they had done, there was some signal given, and he that had hold of my horse, gave him a cut with a stick, and let him go; says he, damn your eyes, drive on, or I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Was you able to discern their persons? - One of them, the man on the right hand, that is Bates, he had hold of my horses, and presented the pistol to me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man that stood at the horse's head? - That is the man that stood at the horse's head.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of it? - I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you seen him any where any time before? - I have seen him several times before, but I cannot recollect where.</p>
               <p>Are you now certain that is the person? - That is the man who had hold of my horse's head.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Mr. Clayton, as you have ventured to say you have seen this man before,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080030"></xptr>and as there is a reward in this case, I think that you should tell us, where you have seen him; because if you do not do that, we shall give no credit to your having seen him at all? - I cannot say where I have seen him in particular.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear, you ever saw him before? - No, my Lord, I will not swear to that.</p>
               <p>Now, a little as to this night; this was ten in the evening, and as we have heard from your master, whom I would rather trust than you, it was a dark evening, he says he could not see? - It was so light, that I could see him perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Had this man on a round or a cocked hat? - He had a round hat on; he was at my near horse's head.</p>
               <p>Now I will venture to ask you, do you venture to swear to him, from a supposition of having seen him before, which you cannot prove; or whether you had at that light such a distinct view of him to know him again? - I had a distinct view of him.</p>
               <p>How long did this transaction take up? - About eight or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Now, as to his coat, will you venture to swear that his coat was not a black one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was not a blue coat? - No.</p>
               <p>It was not brown? - It was a dark drab colour.</p>
               <p>That you could see at ten at night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As well as you could see his face? - Better of the two.</p>
               <p>You say this was ten or twelve minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As we have heard the transaction stated, it does not appear to me that it would take up so much time; was it five minutes? - It was more than five minutes.</p>
               <p>Was it seven minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. During the time this man stood at the head of the horses, your attention, I suppose, must be engaged entirely in observing him and no other object? - I had him under my eye, for I was afraid to look off him, for fear of having my brains blown out.</p>
               <p>Therefore your observation was confined to his person? - My eye was particularly upon him.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to swear positively, that that man you speak of now, was at your horse's head, from the observation you made at the time? - Yes, he is the very man that was at the head of my horses.</p>
               <p>Unassisted from any observation you made of him before? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am groom to Mr. Adair, I was with the postchaise in pursuing these people, I got some information of them at the Golden Fleece, I came up to them on this side the Ship at Tottenham.</p>
               <p>What passed on your coming up? - Before we came within thirty yards, we cried London, hoy, for to take up passengers; when we came along-side of them, they halloo'd out, and asked what he would take for them to Shoreditch; the boy said eighteen-pence a piece; they said that was too much, the boy agreed to take two shillings; the constable came out; they said, do not let us disturb you; they got in, and the constable got out, and pretended to give him a shilling, and bade us all a good night, and we wished him a good night; we staid a little that the constable might get on; the gates flew open, I saw no person at the gates; as soon as we got half way through, the constable stopped the chaise, and took the three young men; the prisoners are the three young men; I saw the pistols, a gentleman, Mr. Lindo, brought the pistols first, and then the two watches.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What time was this? - To the best of my remembrance, it might be between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>How far off the turnpike from Tottenham-high-cross? - I really cannot say, from Enfield Highway I believe it is five miles, as nigh as I can guess; it was half after eleven or twelve before we finished the job.</p>

               <p>I came up to the turnpike when the chaise came up, I got into the chaise as the third man was getting out, and found a brace of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179106080031"></xptr>pistols in the front pocket, and I found two watches close together under the cushion of the seat; I delivered the pistols to the postchaise-boy: when I found the watches, I carried them in my hand till I got into the turnpike-house; then I took down their numbers, and delivered them to Mr. Law, they were the same watches which I found in the chaise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. You know pistols are commonly put into the pockets of a chaise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In travelling, is it not a very common thing to take the watch out of your pocket, and put it into a place of security? - I never did myself.</p>
               <p>Have you ever travelled at night? - I have all hours.</p>
               <p>Can you judge what other people do? - No, I cannot; as I never did it, I suppose they do not.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to answer me? - I do upon my oath; I never knew that any body did do it, and therefore I must suppose they do not do it; I never heard of any person who hid a watch in my life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not be alarmed, you are just in the same situation with me, for I never did neither.</p>
               <p>(The watch deposed to by Mr. Adair.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Adair. It is a new watch which I have had by me some time, it is scratched in the opening, which I observed before I lost it: it has my seal of arms to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you been into this post-chaise, and hid your watch? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. You do not know the number of this watch? - No, I do not, I have not had it above nine months.</p>
               <p>It is a very common watch? - It is a very dear one, it cost me forty-seven guineas.</p>
               <p>You do not mean by saying it is a dear one, that it is an uncommon one? - No.</p>

               <p>Was there any pistols in the pockets? - No.</p>
               <p>Any watches under the cushions? - None at all, I turned the cushions.</p>
               <p>When you came towards the hill, did you see any body? - We came up with three men about one hundred yards on this side the ship; I saw them in going along the road, and halloo'd out, London, hoy, once or twice; and they said, stop, my lad, are you going to town; and they asked me if I would take them to town; I said yes, at one shilling a piece the tall one said, I cannot afford a shilling a piece, we will give you two shillings for the three; well then, says I, jump in, somebody that can afford must pay another time; Law got out, they would not have had him he said he was going to Stamford-hill, he got out there, when he came to the turnpike gate, and halloo'd out gate, I drove the horses through, the constable came and opened the chaise door, and clapped his hands round them, and said, you are all three my prisoners; the constable said, I know it very well my lads, I hired the chaise for you, I had a suspicion of you; they said they would not get out, they would be searched in the chaise; he could not search them properly, so the groom said, he insisted on the constable doing his duty, and they were searched, one at a time, in the turnpike house. This gentleman, Mr. Lindo, jumped into the chaise, and I with him, as close as I could, he put his hand into the pocket of the chaise, and gave me a brace of pistols; I delivered them to Law, they were the same I saw Mr. Lindo find in the pocket of the chaise, which he delivered me; and then he got the watches, and I delivered them to Mr. Law.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you search your chaise in general? - When we deliver a gentleman we sometimes search when we come in, and sometimes when we go out.</p>
               <p>You did not find any watches in the last journey? - No, I searched for my short whip.</p>

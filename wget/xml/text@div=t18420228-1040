                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, living in Frying-pan-alley, Middle sex-street, and am waiter at John Lane's coffee-house, in Church-lane, White chapel. About three o'clock in the morning of the 3rd of March, a sailor, named John Hale, came and had some coffee—the prisoner was sit<lb></lb>ting in the next box—there were three females with him—the prosecutor called for his coffee, and the prisoner came to the box where he was the prosecutor treated him and the girls with coffee—the prosecutor is lame in his right arm—he took out a purse, opened it, gave it to the prisoner to take a sovereign out—he shut it up again, and gave it to the prosecutor, who put the purse into his right-hand waistcoat-pocket—I did not see any money—I saw the prisoner go over the prosecutor's pocket, and take out the purse with his crossed hands—I was called directly—the prosecutor was half asleep and half awake—he had been drinking a little when he came in—the prisoner then went out—I saw him come in again in about's quarter of an hour—the prosecutor scratched his head, and hallooed out, "I am robbed, I am ruined; now I must go begging; I have not got another halfpenny"—the prisoner said, "You don't think I have robbed you, for I have only been out for a necessary purpose"—he was going out Again with the three females—my master touched the prosecutor on his shoulder, and said, "There goes the man that has robbed you"—he went out after him—I followed, saw the policeman, and gave him in charge.</p>

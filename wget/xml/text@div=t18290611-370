            . I am waiter at the Spread-Eagle. On the morning of the 23d of April, the prisoner came into the coffee-room, took breakfast, and desired me to get him a ticket-porter to take a note - I got Scott, and he took it; I did not observe where it was directed; when the prisoner went out, he said there would be a parcel or two come in the course of the day, and requested me to take care of them; two parcels came - one I took in, the other the porter would not leave without seeing the gentleman; I gave the parcel I took in to the prisoner: I did not see it opened.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH MARTIN. I am a constable. I went to the Spread-Eagle on the 23d of April, about half-past four o'clock, by desire of Mr. Devas, with his porter, and was desired to take any person in custody who might apply for the parcel; the porter left the parcel, and I waited till about a quarter before eight o'clock in the evening, when the prisoner came and asked the waiter if any parcels had been brought for him: he said Yes - one was left, and the other was taken away; the prisoner said, "Get me my tea," but in a minute, he said, "Give me the parcel, and I will take it somewhere;" I did not hear where - I permitted him to take it, and go into the street; I then went to him, asked him if his name was Day - he said Yes, but then recollecting himself, he said, "Not exactly Day; my name is Cannon - I married Mr. Dasy daughter;" I said I had authority to take him into custody- in going to the Mansion-house, he made an attempt to get away - he got a few yards, fell down, and was secured.</p>
               <p>GEORGE LEWIS. I took this parcel to the Spread Eagle; I took it off Mr. Devas' counter in Watling-street, in Mr. Devas' presence - I saw it packed up by a gentleman named Hainson, in Mr. Devas' presence.</p>
               <p>MR. DEVAS. These are the articles I sent packed up in the parcel; I know Mr. Day; he lives at Stansted Mountfitchet, and is a customer of mine. I sent the parcel, with orders that the person should be taken up, because the wafer of the letter was rather wet, which struck me as singular; and it was dated the 22d of March, which was the day before - I did not place any confidence in the letter.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL TAYSPILL DAY. I live at Stansted Mountfitchet, about thirty miles from London; the prisoner is not my son-in-law, but he lived servant with me two or three years. I did not write this letter, nor give any body authority to do it.</p>

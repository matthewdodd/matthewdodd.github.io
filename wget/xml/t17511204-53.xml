               <p>Q. How came you to suspect, or tax the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Spendal. There was one missing, which was not finished, the button-holes were not made. The woman that was at work on it came down stairs and complained; upon which we made enquiry. They had got the prisoner into the parlour, taxing her with knowing which way it was gone: She owned she had took it. Said I, Very likely she has took more. Then she owned to 2 more, till at last she owned to 8, which she said she had pawned to 6 different pawnbrokers: This (holding one in his hand, with the 2 button-holes not finished ) she owned she pawned to Mr. Erwin, for 6 shillings.</p>

               <p>Erwin. I believe, last Thursday was a week. He described it, as the prosecutor did, by the buttonholes ; and the prosecutor deposed to it.</p>

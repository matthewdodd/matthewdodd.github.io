            . On Thursday, the 10th of July, I sent Leavins into Tottenham-court-road for a pair of shoes, at ten o'clock at night; he did not bring them back. On the Sunday following he pointed out the prisoner to me, and I asked him if he wanted a job. He said, Yes. I said I would give him one; he saw Evans, and said he would go no further until I told him what job it was. I secured him.</p>

I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100073"></xptr>bringing the shoes to Mr. Ackerman, and just by King's-square-court, Carlisle-street, I met the prisoner. He asked if I would go on an errand for him, and he would give me 2 d. He said, it was not far, and took me into a dark street in <placeName id="t18230910-157-crimeloc876">the Strand</placeName>

He said he would wait at the top of the street, and said I must let him hold the shoes, and I gave them to him; he then gave me a bit of paper; I went and gave it in at the door, and when I came back he was gone. I was afraid to go home - it was ten o'clock at night. A gentleman took me home, and on the Sunday following I met him in Portland-street, Soho, and shewed him to my master - he was secured.</p>

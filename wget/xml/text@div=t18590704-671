                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he say he had received 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Fisse in the morning, and given the cheque in the afternoon; or did he say that he received the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. previous to giving the cheque? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My impression was that he had received the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Fisse previous to his having given the cheque—he stated that he had received the money from Mr. Fisse previous to his having given the cheque—I give my impression of what he said, but do not profess to give his words—I will not pledge my oath to any precise words that he uttered—I cannot swear to every word that was uttered—there may have been other words uttered which did not alter the sense—I did not take any note of the evidence—there was a Counsel engaged—I don't know Mr. Hawkins—I live at Southampton—on 6th October, I was at Mr. Twynam's place of business—my name was then on the door—it has been erased since—the 24th of June was the time when I had nothing more to do with the house at all—the rent was paid up to that time from the profits of the business, and now, having nothing whatever to do with it, my name is off and I am living at Southampton—I have no recollection whether Mr. Castrique when he gave his evidence had his cheque-book in his hand, and whether he looked at the counterpart, and said, "I see four cheques were drawn that day, and as this stands here I must have given it in the afternoon"—I don't know whether he said there were two other cheques drawn the same day in favour of Mr. Fisse.</p>

                  </hi>. I was present at the trial of the action—I heard Mr. Castrique sworn as a witness—he said he had received 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Fisse before he gave the cheque for the 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he used the word "before"—he said he had paid the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with another sum of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into hit bankers—I think he said he had received it in the morning: I cannot be certain—he said that the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he received from Mr. Fisse formed no part of Mr. Twynam's cheque for 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I can't remember what time of the day he said he had given the cheque for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are quite certain of all those words he used? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> yes, because the point turned on when he received the money—Mr. Twynam was called, and the Judge said that as the plaintiff could not prove that the defendant had received any money, there was no case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the Judge say there was no case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What I understood was that there was no evidence to prove that Mr. Castrique had ever had the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Mr. Twynam called, and did he say he gave the cheque to Fisse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the Judge said there was no evidence to prove that Mr. Castrique had received any of the proceeds of the cheque—I can't say that he did not say when Mr. Twynam produced the account, "That puts you out of court"—I will not swear that Baron Bramwell did not say there was no evidence of Fisse's agency—he might say so—I can't say whether Mr. Watson took any notes—there was a count added to the declaration after the countermand—I think it was countermanded because we found out that the cheque was post dated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not sworn before that it was because Mr. Fisse had absconded? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said at Guildhall that it was because Mr. Fisse had absconded, but I have thought over it since, and have arrived at a different</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185907040035"></xptr>
               <p>conclusion—I think the account was sent in after the countermand—I have been with Mr. Watson about two years—he has been employed by Mr. Fisse—my impression is that he went away in November—I know that he had absconded and fresh notice of trial was given—I have not my call book with me—Mr. Watson is not professionally a bill discounter; he may do it for a friend.</p>

FRANCIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You were at the court when Mr. Twynam produced his book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he was examined as to a conversation he had with Mr. Castrique—I think that was before he produced his books—he said he had a conversation with Mr. Castrique, and Mr. Castrique told him that Fisse ought to pay the cheque—I think that was the very word used—I can't remember the exact words the Judge used.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the attorney in the action—I was present at the trial—the last time I saw Fisse was in the month of December—I after wards made endeavours to find him—he has left England, I believe—I remember Mr. Twynam being examined, as to a conversation he had with Mr. Castrique—Mr. Twynam said he saw Mr. Castrique and he had conver<lb></lb>sation with him about the cheque, and he said, "You can get it from Fisse"—in cross-examination he said he would not swear that Mr. Castrique did not say, "You must get it from Fisse"—I saw Fisse in December in consequence of a letter sent by him to Mr. Twynam's, dated 24th December.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When was the countermand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think on 11th November; I am not certain—I had seen Mr. Fisse between 11th November and 1st December—I was in the habit of seeing him—I took his evidence after the notice of the countermand—Mr. Twynam went with me to the bank directly after the trial—we went before we had the banker's clerks to trial—I was acting as Mr. Fisse's attorney for a long time—I was aware he was in difficulties two years before—I was not aware that he was in diffi<lb></lb>culties at the time; certainly not—I had discounted for him, and several times lent him money—when he came to me with cheques I gave him the money—he repaid me a large sum of money that he owed me—he repaid me by occasional deduction—I have, when I received cheques from him, charged him a commission or interest—I can't say to what amount—I never acted for Mr. Twynam before this transaction—Mr. Fisse came to me with a letter.</p>

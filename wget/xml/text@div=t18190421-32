            . I was filling a drift cart in the road, between two and three o'clock, and saw three chaises coming along towards Barnet; they were a very little way from each other. The one that did the accident was going at a very moderate pace, the other two drove faster, and passed it. There was a gentleman in each of the chaises.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they driving faster than the usual pace - A. After the accident they mended their pace, as the rattling of one chaise passing the other appeared to frighten the horse of the chaise that did the accident; the horse glanced off; I did not see the child till after it was picked up. When the chaise came up to me, I heard the gentleman in the two first halloo out, and then the postboys mended their pace; the other chaise pulled up directly the accident happened. I held the horse, while the gentlemen got out, and the chaise went on for a surgeon. I stopped till Mr. Booth, the surgeon came; I saw Evans take the child up, and take it to a house opposite the road, where the child belonged to; Giddens drove the chaise that rode over the child - the spot where the accident happened was about two yards from the side of the road, but when the horse took fright it turned quite off; it appeared to me to be going at a very proper pace. Both the gentleman and the postboy got assistance immediately.</p>

            . I saw the chaise pass as I stood at my own door. A man named Veals drove one, he passed Giddens, who was going at a moderate pace - Veals got by about twenty or thirty yards. Then Townsend's chaise was passing Giddens's, and Giddens's horse threw out of the road, and ran against the child - it knocked it down. I ran over, and Evans picked the child up; it was carried to its grandmother's house just by, and left in her care.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210017"></xptr>It was hurt about the head; Evans tried to sit it on its feet, but it could not stand.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did it appear to you that Giddens was driving improperly - A. No, he was driving at a steady pace, as he ought to do - it appeared to me to be quite an accident. Veals drove one of the chaises, and Townsend the other - they were going faster than the prisoner's.</p>

               <p>HENRY LANOY HUNTER, ESQ. I was passing in the road on horseback, when the accident happened, and saw three chaises coming towards me, some of them were driving very hard; I got a little out of the road, in order to let them pass, and saw one of them drive over the child, but cannot take upon me to say that it was one of those that were driving fast. Immediately after the accident I rode into Barnet for a surgeon, another man ran by the side of my horse all the way. I sent the man for a surgeon, and Mr. Booth immediately went in the chaise that caused the accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the horse startled - A. I did not mark that circumstance - I should think the men were not driving very hard.</p>

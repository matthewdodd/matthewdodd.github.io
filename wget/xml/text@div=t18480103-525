                  </hi>. I am the wife of Luke connor, a labourer, at Deptford. In Nov. last I had a sister, named Johanna, in a hospital in London—I went to see her, accompanied by a married sister named Julia—we returned in the evening, and went into the Noah's Ark public-house, between eight and nine o'clock, to get some refreshment—my sister had a child with her—we went into the tap-room, intending to have a pint of beer, but we had not time to call for anything—a lodger of my sister's was there, and he told her to bring her child to him, and he would have a kiss at him—she went over to him for that purpose—the prisoner came in out of the yard while she was talking to the man, and said had no business to go over to his companion—there was no dispute, that I know of, between my sister and the other man before the prisoner came in—he and another man owed her some money, and she said it was worse than highway robbery, because they did not pay her—the prisoner came in then, and said she had no business to come to interrupt his company—she said she did not speak to him; that she was speaking to the two men that owed her money, and let them answer for themselves—he called her a wh—; I made over to him, and asked him what he had called my sister such a name for—he said I was no better myself, and if I did not leave he would knock my b—y eye out—I took up my umbrella and made a knock or two at him, but never hit him—I am quite certain I never touched him—I then turned away from him, for fear of his hitting me, and he hit me three or four blows on the head—I turned down, and put my hands to my face to save it from being disfigured, and he gave me a most unmerciful kick on the right side of my* * *—my back was towards him—I held up for one or two moments, and then dropped quite insensible—I was taken home on a stretcher, blood came from where the kick was, and I fainted away—I was confined in consequence of the kick, and am now very weak indeed—Mr. Dowling attended me.</p>

             . Do you know the Prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes, my Lord; as I was coming along the Street, this Woman asked me to give her a Dram; I said, you are rather too old; she said, she was as willing as any body.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Davis. It was the Day after Christmas-day .</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Davis. It was at the House of one

            ; it was in the Back-lane by Rosemary-Lane, she asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160006"></xptr> me to drink a Dram, I said you are not worth a Dram, you are so old. If I am never so old, I am as willing as those that are young, so we went up Stairs, and had a Pint of Hot; I was fatigued in walking; sitting down , I happened to fall asleep, the mean time she picked my Pocket, and went out and locked me in.</p>
               <p>Court . You say you fell asleep?</p>
               <p>Davis. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that she picked your Pocket then?</p>
               <p>Davis . She owned it before the Justice, I think it was Justice Jones .</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say?</p>
               <p>Davis. She owned I gave her half a Crown, and half a Crown more she picked out of my Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Davis. I lost one Guinea, and 3 l. 7 s. in Silver.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you carried her before the Justice of the Peace?</p>
               <p>Davis. I took her the Day after she committed the Fact.</p>
               <p>Court. Then she did not own she took all the Money that you lost?</p>
               <p>Davis. No, my Lord, she owned she took Half a Crown?</p>

            . What have you to say to this Matter?</p>
               <p>Alexander. I know nothing of it, any farther than that I was with him when he took up the Woman, and had her before the Justice, and she owned that he gave her Half a Crown, and she took Half a Crown more from him, that's all I know of the Matter.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoner. Will you ask this Witness any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was never there; there was none there but the Headborough.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Now is your Time to make your Defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please your Lordship , I was in my Lodgings, this Man comes in about eight o'Clock at Night; I was at Home by the Fire-side, he said can I have a Dram, I said we sell none, but if you will give me one, I will tell you where you may, so I did; we had a Quartern of Gin: he said I am very much in Liquor, I would freely give Half a Crown to lay down; I said I would speak to my Landlord, which I did, and the Maid brought a Candle for him; he goes up and sets himself down at the feet of the Bed, then he gave the Maid Six-pence to get a Pint of Hot, with that she locked him in, and shut me out, and he never walked, as they said, till three o'Clock in the Morning. I never was a Street-walker in my Life .</p>

            . Are you sure you had the Money in your Pocket, when you went into that Woman's Company?</p>
               <p>Davis. I am sure of it, I was in no House, but walking the Streets before I came there.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time did you awake?</p>
               <p>Davis. She was not gone out of the Room a Quarter of an Hour before I awaked.</p>

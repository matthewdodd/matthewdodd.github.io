            . I am an officer. I apprehended Henry Farmer on the 28th of June, in Holborn; I went with him to Birch, who keeps a marine-store shop, No. 15, Short's-gardens; I there found a number of books in sheets, which I produce; I took Sarah, his mother, in Great Wild-street; she said she had given a bag to take something to Birch's; H. Farmer said he had lost the sovereign, and spent 1s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did he not say the books were safe? A. No - he said his mother would settle about them, and she said her son had lost the sovereigns; she did not tell me the books were placed at Birch's while she was moving. I found them in a chair, near the bed; he said, the second time, that the boy's mother left them there till he returned from breakfast; he did not say the boy was going to call for them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not that as a security for his appearance? A. He said, "I shall be locked up all night," but did not offer it as security, I am certain - Campbell is not here. The books had been found before.</p>
               <p>W. H. WRIGHT. I believe these to be the same books - they are twenty volumes of Don Juan, and ten of Kirk White's poems.</p>

The officer came in a quarter of an hour, and took them - about nine o'clock at night the officers came, quite drunk, and said I must go to the watch-house; I said I would give them security till to-morrow; I offered them 10l. - they said that would not do, and I asked if 30l. would do- they said, "Let us see it;" I produced it - they clapped the handcuffs on; the boy was frightened, as he had lost two sovereigns.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow and keep the Globe public-house, Black-wall. The prisoner came into my service on the 23rd of January, and left on the 13th of April, when she was given in charge—she occasionally came in the bar of an evening to clear it up—in consequence of suspicion, I marked some shillings, half-crowns and sixpences, on the 14th of April, about nine o'clock in the evening, and put them into a bag where I kept my silver, not in the regular till—I left the bar for a few moments—she went in and staid about ten minutes, came out, and went through the kitchen—I did not lose sight of her—the bell rang, and she came out to answer it—I went to the bag in the till, and missed some money—I called a constable, and put him into a room on the same floor with the bar—I then called the prisoner, and locked her in—I told her she had robbed me—she shook her dress, and said she could not have robbed me—I said, "Yes, you have, I know"—she said, "No, I have not"—I then called the officer, and gave her in charge—she turned round, and went to get some water at a pipe there—she came away again—the officer took a light, and looked in the place where the water came from—there was a bowl there with some soap-suds in it, which I had been using shortly before—the officer found 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was all my marked money—he said, "Whose money is this?"—she said, "8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is mine"—he said, "The rest, I suppose, is your mistress's?"—she said, "Yes."</p>

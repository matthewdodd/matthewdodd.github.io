About one o'clock in the morning, on the 19th of June, I was near the slaughter-house of Mr. Hyron—I had placed some pieces of paper on the wall, and observed they had been moved within the last twenty minutes—I heard a noise within Mr. Hyron stable—I waited till Graves came up, and mentioned it to; him—Mr. Hyron came and let us in—I found the prisoner there—I asked Mr. Hyron, in his presence, if men were allowed to sleep there—he said no—Graves took him into custody—there was found on him an apron and two duplicates, one of which directed me to Cordwell's, and one to Hawes'—I received another duplicate from Freeman—I found on the prisoner a tin tobacco-box, with the name of John Douglas marked on the outside, and a little tobacco inside.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, James Charles Hyron, who keeps a butcher's shop in Mile End-road. In the back kitchen was an apron belonging to me, and in the slaughter-house a tray of my fathers—they were both safe the last thing on Friday night, the 13th of June, and were missed early on Saturday morning—I have seen the apron since, in the pawnbroker's hands—this is it—the tray is not here—the prisoner was in my father's service by the name of John Douglas.</p>

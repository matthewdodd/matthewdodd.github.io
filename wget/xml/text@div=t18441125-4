                  </hi>. I live in St. Nicholas Olave Churchyard, Bread-street Hill, and am a coal-dealer—my shop is opposite my private bouse. On Saturday, the 16th of Nov., about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner come out of my house with this coat under his arm—I was just coming out of the door at the time—I immediately ran in, and called to my lodger, to know if anybody had been up stairs—I then ran out, and saw him return with the coat—I found the coat under the rail<lb></lb>ing of the clergyman's house—I knew it to be the same coat as I had seen under his arm.</p>

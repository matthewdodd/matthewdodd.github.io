                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Alexander Morgan, and live in Hadlow-street, Burton-crescent. The prisoner was at my house nearly a month, and left on the 8th of November—she was very ill and I took her in, knowing her before—she left without telling me she was going—about half an hour after she left, I missed a cloak and some pieces belong<lb></lb>ing to it, a pair of stockings, a towel, a diamond ring, and a coat—I did not see her again till the 21st, when she was in custody—these stockings, cloak and towel, I know to be mine (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>

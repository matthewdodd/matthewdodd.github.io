               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHER. Q. Were you not to have a medal presented to you that night? A. I was, but I got the money instead, from the landlady, and put it into my purse, in my left hand pocket; the prisoner sat close to me - I had no gin - I found him next night in Swan-street, where there was another Lodge to be held; he slipped off his handkerchief, and ran away, but I followed, and took him - I never offered to drop the prosecution, if he gave me half.</p>

            . I saw my father receive a sovereign, and put it into his purse; he took out 1s. and paid for the beer; he put the 6d., which he received in change, into his pocket - I saw the prisoner put his hand into my father's left hand waistcoat pocket, and draw it out shut; there was something bright in it; he directly took up his hat, bade them all good night, and went out; my father came out in three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not you been asking your father that evening for money to buy bread? A. Yes - he put his hand to his pocket, and said, "My purse is gone" - I told him of this, when we came out; several people were in the room.</p>

I caught this man on the other side of Hampstead, with his load of hay, I passed him, I thought I saw a sack of corn on the load of hay, covered over with a cloth. I then came down to the middle of Hampstead town, enquired for a constable, and soon procured him. We came up to Burgers, I saw him speak to a man of the name of Giles, I asked him where the corn was that was on the hay, he said he had none, I said I was sure he had, I had seen it on the load of hay, I asked Giles if he saw the man unload a sack of corn, he said he knew nothing about it, I went into the house and Giles followed me, I said to Giles you may as well tell me where this corn is, I am determined to find it, he denied having it, I went into the yard, I could not find it, I saw a door which led to the cellar, I went down the cellar, there I found a sack of corn nearly full, and the sack that was not full was shot into a tub. I said to Giles,</p>

               <p>"this is my corn, I could swear to it almost," Giles said,</p>
               <p>"I am very sorry, I bought it of this man, and gave him a pound note for it," I said,</p>
               <p>"why did not you tell me of this at first, I shall be obliged to send for another constable for you." I sent for another constable, and gave Giles in charge. I got in the load of hay, and found an empty sack, then the constables and myself set off with these men to a magistrate at Edgware, where the prisoner said, he was very sorry. I can swear to the sack so far, they are sacks that belong to the man that I hired to bring this corn for me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The man came to me at my stable, and desired me to take two sacks of corn, I was to sell them for what I could get, I did not steal the corn.</p>

            , the warehouse is in the Old Bailey. On the 2d of June, the prisoner was their carman; it was his business to receive the money for the parcels which he delivered; he took six bags of wool to Mr. Hazard, but never accounted to me for the money; I settle every night with him - He said it was not paid, and returned a bill to me. I saw Mr. Hazard on the 4th of October, and had the prisoner apprehended.</p>
               <p>JAMES SNOW. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner; he said he was very sorry for it, and did not intend to defrand his masters, but to pay it in time. He said his wife had been ill, which made him in distress.</p>

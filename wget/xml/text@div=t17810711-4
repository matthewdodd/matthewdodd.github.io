               <p>On Saturday morning last, the 2d of June, between the hours of twelve and one, as I was going in my chariot to my house at Stepney Causeway, having been at Ranelagh, the chariot was stopped just opposite <placeName id="t17810711-4-crimeloc23">St. George's church</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17810711-4-crimeloc23" type="placeName" value="St. George's church"></interp>

There was a violent noise, and I saw, through the blinds, a kind of flash upon the chariot's stopping; I drew my watch out of my fob, and concealed it in the best way I could under my arm. Immediately the door of the near side of the carriage was opened, and two fellows with cutlasses and pistols demanded my money: I believe the prisoner is one of them, but can't be positive. I gave my money to the comrade of the person I take to be the prisoner; he kept his pistol to me: they uttered horrid imprecations the whole time; they then demanded my watch: I said I had no watch; upon which the little fellow, the prisoner, put his hand into the carriage to attempt to search me. I very imprudently caught at his hand, and he immediately snapped a pistol at me, which missed fire; in that struggle the chain of the watch unfortunately hung out. I cannot charge my memory whether I gave the watch to the prisoner's comrade, or he took it; but I remember particularly the chain hanging over his hand. I thought he was lame, as he did not shut his hand. Upon that seeming resistance, the other door of the carriage was</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110101"></xptr>opened, and there were two fellows at it, both armed with pistols and cutlasses, or hangers, threatening to pull me out, and to cut me to pieces. I kept my eye particularly fixed upon the men on the left-hand side; and at that time, being surrounded by four fellows, I was a little alarmed: I desired them not to use me ill, I had given them every thing I had. One of the men on the near side of the carriage insisted I should not be hurt: he said to the two fellows on the left-hand side, D - n your blood! you would not hurt the gentleman after you have got every thing he had? upon which they shut the door, and we drove on.</p>

               <p>Was it a light night? - It was a very star-light night; and I believe the moon was up, but I do not recollect particularly.</p>

               <p>You say you can't swear positively to the prisoner? - I cannot; the blinds of my carriage were up, and from the little view I had of him I cannot swear to his person, but I believe in my conscience he is the man. I went immediately to the Public Office; I found no person there: I went to the watch-house in Shadwell parish, and got one of Mr. Sherwood's runners, and went to the different places where they told me their haunts were, but did not meet with them.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I am footman to Mr. Shakespear. My master was coming home from Ranelagh. As we came through Rosemary lane, between that and the sail-cloth manufactory, the carriage was stopped. The first I saw was a flash which seemed to be from the pan of a pistol; but the pistol did not go off. As soon as I saw the flash of the pistol, the carriage door was opened on the off side. I only saw two men at first on the off-side of the carriage, the other door was opened in a little time after; they demanded my master's money and watch; they had each of them a pistol and hanger, and they were very bright. I heard one of the men (which is the prisoner, by his voice and the appearance of him) say, Blast you, murder him, cut him to pieces! I would cut him to pieces as soon as I would a dog; or to that purpose.</p>



               <p>Do you know it was the prisoner? I know him by both his voice and his person. The others, on the other side the carriage, swore, D - n him! search him, search him, we will search him; search him well. When I heard the expression of murdering my master, I cried out, For God's sake do not use my master ill! In a little time a tall man shut the door; after he had shut the door, a man on the other side the carriage said to the coachman, D - n you, drive on.</p>

               <p>What sort of light was it? - It must be moonlight, because I could see the persons of the men, and their pistols and hangers very plain, and could see the colour of their clothes.</p>

               <p>Did you take particular notice of the prisoner? - I took particular notice of the men on the off side of the carriage; the prisoner is one of them: the one that is not yet taken, stood with his back to me; the prisoner's face was towards me.</p>

               <p>Did you observe him a great deal? - I did during the time they were at the carriage.</p>

               <p>Was he dressed as he is now? - The same; there was a man on the near side of the carriage said, D - n you! you would not use the gentleman ill after you have got all he has? and I believe him to be the man that told the coachman to drive on.</p>

               <p>Can you swear positively to the prisoner? - I can.</p>

               <p>You say you could see the colour of his clothes? - Yes; I was very near to him; I can swear to the other that was with him, if I saw him: but as to the other men, I cannot swear to them; I did not see enough of them.</p>

               <p>I suppose the only distance was, you was behind the carriage, and he at the carriage door? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am Mr. Shakespear's coachman. We were stopped by four persons about 70 or 80 yards from the turnpike; the prisoner I suppose to be the man that opened the carriage door on the off side.</p>

               <p>Can you swear to him? - I cannot swear positively to him; but I think in my conscience<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110102"></xptr> he is the man: I observed his voice, his size, and dress; and from thence I believe him to be the same person.</p>

               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was moon-light.</p>

               <p>Was it light enough to distinguish the difference of colour? - Yes, I think he had a brown coat on: I had not an opportunity of observing him much; but his voice, and every thing about him, tell me he is one of the persons: I think he opened the carriage door, and desired my master to deliver his money; and he said he would not mind killing him any more than he would a dog: then another opened the carriage door on the other side, and said, D - n him! kill him, if he will not give his money. Upon that my master gave his watch and money; then one said, Search him, see if there is any thing else about him. At last one came up, and said, The gentleman has given you his money, what would you have? Then they shut the carriage door, and bid me drive on. I drove on directly.</p>

I was called up on Saturday morning, about two or half after two o'clock, to go after some people that had robbed Mr. Shakespear. I went along with the footman. In going down Salt-Petre Bank I saw the prisoner, and another along with him: I laid hold of him; upon which the other ran away. I asked the footman if he knew that man: he said he was the identical man that presented a pistol to his master.</p>

I got up, and went down to the watch-house; and saw Mr. Shakespear's servant. We went to seek after the people: we could not find them that morning; but the evening following we went down Salt-Petre Bank: we saw the prisoner and another standing at the door of a public-house: we apprehended him.</p>

I have nobody to call but my mother. Mayne came to the prison to me, and said I need not be afraid; for I was innocent of the robbery.</p>

               <p>To Mayne. Did you say that? - No, it is false.</p>

               <p>[The mother was called, but did not appear.]</p>

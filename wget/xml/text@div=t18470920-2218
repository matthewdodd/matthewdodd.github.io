I was on duty at half-past two o'clock in the night on the 1st. of Sept.—I came up to the prisoner, and asked what he had got under his jacket—he made no answer—I took him by the collar, put my hand under his jacket, and pulled out this quart pot—I put my hand under his other arm and pulled out this other—I asked whose they were—he said, "I believe they belong to Mr. George Mason, of the Windmill public-house"—he said he had picked them up under the hedge—I asked if he worked for him—he said, "No"—I asked how he came to take these pots, if he did not work for him—he then said he did work for him—I asked where he lived—he said, "In the brick-field," which is about a quarter of a mile from the spot—I said I must take him to the station—he became very violent—I threw him on the ground and made an alarm—my brother officer came, and we took him to the station.</p>

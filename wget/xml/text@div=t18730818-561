                  </hi>. I am a grocer, at Noa. 106 and 108, High Street, Clapham, and have a large number of persons in my employ, and have several carts to go rounds, under the charge of men in my service—Gurr had been in my employ four or five years, or more, and his wages were 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—his duties were to go out with a cart—his round was Tooting and beyond Wandsworth—he had to collect orders, to enter them in a book, and deliver them in the afternoon, and come back to the shop—he did not see the orders executed—he gave the particulars in the shop—he was also supplied with butters, lard; and eggs as surplus stock, to supply what might be wanted at the moment—he was not allowed to go elsewhere, except his round—he resided at 3, Bellamy Street, Balham, and had no right in that street—I had occasion, some six or seven months ago, to give an order with respect to refreshments going to their own houses—no man was to go off his round under any circumstances—if they required refreshment, they were to drive home and take their dinner or tea hour, and if the horse required refreshment, they were to bring it home and place it in the stable—they were not to call at their own homes—they could buy goods in the shop under certain circumstances, but, would have to pay for them, or have them booked in the regular way—I use a waste-book, a jour<lb></lb>nal, a small rough ledger, into which every small account is posted, and an ordinary ledger—if a man in Gurr's position had purchased a ham, or any article of that sort, it would have gone into the waste-book, and from that into the rough ledger—it would have been booked to him in the rough ledger—about the 10th of May I had a communication made to me, and in consequence of that, I had an interview with a man named Spearing, who resides next door to Gurr's, in Bellamy Street, Balham, in consequence of which I communicated with the police, when a room was hired three doors from Gurr's, in the same street, and two detectives, Mellish and Panther, were instructed to attend there—on the 31st of May my attention was called to something in reference to Gurr—I gave him into custody—it was Saturday night—I paid him myself when he was given into custody—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187308180184"></xptr>
               <p>then went down to his house, 3, Bellamy Street, which was searched—I saw the whole of the things found, at the station, afterwards—they were my property, to the best of my belief—I had a customer of the name Delay, who lived at Tooting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I employ from 40 to 50 hands altogether—I should say there are from 20 to 25 or 30 in the shop—about a dozen I should think would be authorised to supply goods to anyone who asked, or to one of my own men—Jolly is not a shopman—I had a man named Judd, but he died I think, at Christmas—it is possible that he died since the 30th May, and he may have been in the shop on the 28th May—I am only speaking from memory—I am not very dear on that point—I should not object to the men having goods if they paid for them, or they were properly booked—if a ham were ordered and the person ordering it did not want it after all, it would be the duty of the man to bring it back—if such a thing had happened with Mr. Delay the prisoner's book should prove it—I do not look after such a matter myself—I know of no such errors as things being en<lb></lb>tered to the wrong person—I have twelve or thirteen carts for the delivery of goods to customers—it might happen that a man taking out one of these carts would be ill, and his place would be supplied by someone else—I have no doubt it may have occurred towards the end of May, probably it was so—I prosecuted one of my men for embezzlement about May, I believe shortly before this time in question—I do not remember discovering any other peculations in my establishment—I had not had confidence in the prisoner quite up to this time—I had always had confidence in the prisoner—I had no proof to the contrary—many of the goods found in the house were such as any grocer would sell—it is my belief that my men generally as a rule dealt with me for grocery, and they pay for what they have—that is understood—I have looked in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and find no entry of a ham either taken out, or returned, and no grocery of the description on the 24th or 30th—if a ham had been ordered by Mr. Delay, and not wanted, it would have been the man's course of business to have brought it back—it ought to have been given credit for.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant in the employ of Mr. Wright—Gurr was a fellow-servant—about 28th May he asked me for a ham for Mr. Delay, who was a customer—I wrapped the ham in paper and wrote on it "Delay, Esq., 11 1/2 lbs. at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb."—I saw a ham afterwards which had been found in the prisoner's house—this piece of paper is what I wrapped it in—there is my writing on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have sent hams to Mr. Delay before, and I always do them up in paper—I believe it was on or about the 28th May this occurred; it was about the time of the races—I had often served Gurr with things before—it often happens that goods are returned—the ham would be charged in the waste-book first—it would be entered in the order-book by the man who took the order, and then copied into the day-book—Gurr might have had some provisions for himself about that time, but if he did they were paid for—I was always paid for all goods that he had—I have no doubt he had some goods at the end of May.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). I watched Gurr's house from the early part of May—on 28th May, about 9 o'clock a. m., I saw him drive up with another man—I made notes at the time—I was at Rose Cottage, a few doors from his house—he took some oranges from the cart, stopped eight minutes, and drove away—he drove up again at 1. 8 o'clock, took a</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Bellamy Street is about a mile and a quarter from Mr. Wright's shop—it is a thoroughfare, and runs parallel with the main road—Rose Cottage is a detached house, about five or six doors from the end of the street, and on the same side as Gurr's house—there are only two houses in between—there are steps up to the front door of Rose Cottage—the window was open at times—I was sitting close to the window, but the people passing in the street could not see me, because there were curtains—they were open knitted curtains—I could not see Gurr's door from the window, nor the gate—I could not see anyone going in and out of that gate—I could see the roadway—I took the direction he went in—I could see him going in the direction of the gate—I saw him going into the house once—that was on 31st May at 9. 10 a. m.—I was in the road—he took in some stout—there was no concealment in his taking in the things—he generally came about 9 o'clock in the morning first.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> On all these occasions I could see that the cart drove up opposite the house, and things were taken from the cart, and he returned without the things—the distance between the cart and the front door of his house is about 7 yards, the distance of the path and the forecourt.</p>

             sworn. I am a journeyman to Mr. Fortune. On Friday the 14th of February, about a quarter after six o'clock, I saw the prisoner at the bar in Portland-street, he was carrying the copper which had stood in the shop; I asked him what he was going to do with it, he was in such a state of intoxication he did not know how to give any answer; I stopped him and the copper; I brought it back to know whether it was sold, or whether he had been sent out with it.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Had you sold that copper, or given that man any directions to take it out any where. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I worked four or five months with my master, I was very often by myself, day and night; it never run in my head to take a halfpennyworth from any body, I was sent out to a file-smith; I met a young man who was a shipmate of my son's, who has been pressed eleven months ago; my son was my only support, he told me he saw my son, he gave me a pint of beer, with that my head<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190031"></xptr>was cracked; I am an old man, I was never in a court before, I leave myself to the mercy of the court.</p>

               <p>Q On the night of the 3d of April at what time did you retire to rest - A. About eleven o'clock; my shop was shut up between ten and eleven; when I went to bed my shop was secure. About three o'clock in the morning I was called up by a violent ringing of the bell, and Mr. Sapwell called out to me; in consequence of what he said I came down stairs and examined my shop window; I found the glass broke on the inside, and the broken glass had fallen on the shawls in the window; I saw ten or a dozen holes in the shutters, they seem to have been made with a large gimblet, rather to represent a of kind half square; the pannel is in court; and provided they had gone on, they could have taken goods out. We had a considerable quantity of goods in the window.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN CROMAN. I am a cit patrol. On the morning of 4th of April I was in Bishopgate-street about two o'clock, Horton and Bates were with pie; when we came within a dozen yards of Mr. Styles' house, I saw three men standing at his window, as to drew nearer they split from one another; one went towards Sun-street, and the other two men came towards Bishopgate-church, Horton followed him that went towards Sun-street, the other two, Miller and Pether, came by us; Pether said, what o'clock is it; my partner said, past two; I went up to the shutter and found by feeling it was shagged and tough; Horton called to me that he had got Hanfield; we went up to his assistance and took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you stop the others - A. We did not know that they had been doing any thing then. When we got Hanfield to the watchhouse we searched him, I found a piece of candle, and this black patch, it is about the colour of the shutters; I judge it was to cover the hole of the shutter.</p>
               <p>JOHN HORTON. I am a patrol. I was with the other patrols on the night that we have been speaking of, I saw these three prisoners, I knew Hanfield before; as soon as we got with ten or a dozen yards of them they split; Hanfield went towards Sun-street; when I got to the corner of Sun-street he made a motion as if he was going to ease himself; I took hold of him, I knew him directly; after we had taken him to the watchhouse I went with my partners in search of the other men, and towards Widegate-alley I fell in with Pether and Miller; I am sure they are the same men; I seized hold of Pether by the collar, and stroked him down, and found this gimblet in his pocket; my partner seized the other. I have not the least doubt that this is the gimblet that made the holes in the shutter.</p>

            . I was with the last witness. I saw three men by Mr. Styles's shop; I was with Horton in apprehending Miller and Pether; I am sure they are two of the three men I had seen at Mr. Styles's; there were no other persons in the street; they addressed me by asking what o'clock it was; I could see them by the light of the lamp, they passed me quite close; I could have spoken to them a twelvemonth afterwards if I had seen them.</p>

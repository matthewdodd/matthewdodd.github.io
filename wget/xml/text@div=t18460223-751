                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 215.) On the 17th of Feb. I went to Miles's Lunatic Asylum, in Hoxton Old-town—I saw the prisoner there—I said to her, "Mary, you know what I am, and who I am; I must take you into custody and search your boxes; have you any objection to that?"—she said, "None at all"—I then left her for a few minutes, and she came to us with a bonnet and cloak on, and we went to No. 38, Brunswick-street, knocked at the door, and went in—the prisoner asked me to explain to her sister, Mrs. Cook, what we had come upon, which I did—her sister began to cry very much, and said we might search the place—she opened a cup<lb></lb>board by the side of the fire, and in that cupboard I found a sheet, marked "J. C., No. 12," and by the side of that mark the letters "W. T. M." had been picked out, but the mark was very legible—I asked the prisoner if she knew anything of that, and told her she had no occasion to answer me the question unless she thought proper—she said she did not—I found a pillow-case in the tame cupboard; and in a cupboard on the other side of the fire-place I found a bed-quilt, a quantity of new calico, and three dusters—I asked if they could tell me how they came by that bed-quilt—Mrs. Cook said she had bought it of a tallyman, and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for it—I went into the back place, and found three knives and five forks, which were identified by Mr. Cocksedge, the steward, as belonging to the establishment—we then left with the prisoner, and she was taken, to the station—we went before Mr. Bingham, and she was remanded till Friday—she was allowed out on bail, and on the Saturday she went to fetch her boxes and things away from the establishment—a short time after she had left I was shown some things by Mr. Cocksedge—I took them with me to the station—the prisoner was store-keeper in the establishment—I brought away the things from Mrs. cook.</p>

                  </hi>. I am steward to the trustees of the Lunatic Asylum at Hoxton—it is called Sir Jonathan Miles'—he is notalive—I saw this sheet at the prisoner's sister's house, Mrs. Cook—I believe it to belong to the Asylum—such articles were under the prisoner's charge at the Asylum—it had not been missed—Ellen Miles Wastell, and others, are the trustees.</p>

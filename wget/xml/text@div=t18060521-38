               <p>Q. Do you remember having a servant of the name of Lake. - A. Yes, William Lake had been a servant to me for a number of years. I knew the shoes when I saw them at the police office, Hatton Garden, and

             said that she had them of William Lake to sell for him.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this. - A. On the 24th of February last I swore to the shoes being my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon her telling this story of her having the goods from William Lake he was taken up. - A. Yes, he was tried for stealing them.</p>
               <p>Q. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to be transported. - A. Yes, that good woman was not well at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found in possession of the prisoner. A. Six pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand that she upon their being found, said that she had them to sell for Lake. - A. She did say so.</p>
               <p>Q. She said at the police office that Lake was a servant of yours, and that he lodged in the same house with the prisoner. - A. Yes, and as you press me so close I must say that she knew they were stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. That is your conclusion; this poor woman was taken up, the magistrate admitted her to bail. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The reason that she did not appear last session was, because she was far advanced in pregnancy, she was brought a-bed lately, and this session she comes here voluntarily. - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. On the 24th of February I was fetched by Mr. Page the pawnbroker, saying he supposed there was a woman in his shop with some stolen shoes, he could discern the marks on the toes of the shoes had been scratched off; in our way to his shop we saw the woman coming with the shoes wrapped up in her apron; we watched her to Mr. Armstrong's in Baldwin's Gardens, she went in at the shop door and we went in at the private door; I went round the shop and stood a little behind her, while Mr. Armstrong and she were discoursing about the shoes; Mr. Armstrong asked her who made the shoes, she said her husband, I then told her I should take her in custody and the shoes likewise, I suspected they were stolen; going along I asked her where she lived, she hummed and sung to herself, and seemed quite saucy; she says you know, why do you ask me this question; after I got her to the office she did then say that she lived in a court on Saffron Hill; I went there and was informed there was one Lake a shoemaker lived in the house, and one Tiller a hackney coachman lived in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210024"></xptr>the same house.</p>
               <p>Q. You discovered a person of the name of William Lake, that was tried last sessions, and the prisoner lived in the same house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you understand from Lake, the person that was convicted last sessions, that he had given these shoes to this woman to sell. - A. Yes, after some hesitation.</p>
               <p>Q. Never mind the hesitation, he did say it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To sell for him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In going to the house did you find Lake there. - A. Yes, and I found some more shoes in Lake's apartment in a box, I was obliged to break it open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find where the prisoner's apartment was. - A. On the next floor in the same house, I found some new leather there, in a drawer, the prosecutor would not swear that they were his; I produce the shoes.</p>

             sworn. I am a pawnbroker, I live in Liquorpond-street. On the 24th of February, the prisoner brought a parcel of shoes to sell, I looked at them, and observed some marks had been scratched out of the toes, I told her they were not a kind of a shoe that I wanted; I took no farther notice, but went out of the shop to fetch an officer; I saw Trott on our return, I saw her coming from my shop, I pointed her out to Trott, we followed her to the shop of Mr. Armstrong, Trott there took her in custody; she brought all these shoes to my house to sell, I refused buying them; I had bought shoes of her before, and used to suppose that her husband made them, which I thought was Lake, he used to come to my shop.</p>
               <p>- ARMSTRONG sworn. Q. Do you remember the prisoner at the bar coming at any time to offer some shoes to sell. - A. Yes, on the 24th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the shoes with her. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do these appear to be the same shoes. - A. Yes, she offered to sell them in consequence of Mr. Trott following her; I asked her who made the shoes, she said her husband (I had bought shoes of her frequently); Mr. Trott immediately said, I suspect you have stolen them, and took her into custody.</p>
               <p>(The shoes identified by the prosecutor's workmen.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This young man (Lake) and his apprentice lodged in my house, they used to board with me, he had a deal of work on his own account; he used to cut out in my room, I used to go out of his errands, and carry home his work, he gave me these shoes, and asked me to sell them, which I did; Lake told the officer that I was the person he had sent with them; I should have appeared last sessions but I have laid in, I have five small children.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>

The prisoner was in his employ from sixteen to twenty years; if he got any wood of any tradesman, he was to give my father an account of it, either at the time, or on the Saturday afterwards, at the farthest; Mr. Sykes, a timber-merchant, gave us in an account after the prisoner had been taken, which is about a fortnight ago; there were some veneers in the account, of which the prisoner had given us no invoice.</p>
               <p>RICHARD LOADER. I was out of town at the time the prisoner had this timber - he never delivered any invoice to me; I paid him his wages weekly - if he got goods of any tradesman, he was to give an account immediately, or at latest on the Saturday following; he was taken up some time in June - he heard the charge made against him; I made him no promise, but he said, "I stand as a felon before you. I hope you don't mean to hurt me;" I searched his father-in-law's house, and found some mahogany veneers, and some table-tops.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Has your son any concern in your business? A. No Sir; I had not had any conversation with the prisoner about assisting him to set up in business - I did not allow him to get goods of the persons who supplied me; the timber in question was never brought into my possession - I never saw it, nor the veneers, either to my knowledge; we have no materials on our premises - I can swear that the wood in this invoice has not been manufactured into articles, and brought to my premises; for nothing has come in there for some months - I cannot tell what had been worked up for three months; I did not return to town till the latter end of May.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. As he was an old servant, has he ever got wood and worked it up for you, and afterwards acquainted you with it? A. He generally used to say,"I want such and such articles" - I do not know whether he ever got any without saying that.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. To your knowledge have any articles made of this wood been brought in by the prisoner? A. Never - and he never gave me any invoice of this timber.</p>

             re-examined. Q. During your father's absence did the prisoner ever bring you any articles made out of Mr. Sykes' timber? A. Not of this timber.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Can you swear to timber, you have not seen? A. No - he has not brought any work in since he received this timber; it could not come in without my knowledge - I am always in the house; he may have brought in articles in my absence, but if he had I should have seen them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he give you any reason for not bringing in the articles? A. Yes - he said Mr. Sykes had not got the wood.</p>
               <p>MR. SYKES. I am a timber-merchant. I have supplied the prosecutor; I supplied the prisoner with some wood in March, for Mr. Loader - I gave him the invoice at the time the goods were sold; since the prisoner left his service, Mr. Loader applied to me for his account - I furnished the prisoner with mahogany and veneers on the 8th of March, 14th of March, 28th of April, and 17th of May, for which I debited the prosecutor; I saw some veneers at Hatton-garden, but they are not what I supplied to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You served the prisoner with veneers and other things? Yes; I do not know that he ever had articles from me on his own account - I was most likely in the yard when these goods were furnished to him; I did not deliver them myself - some of these might be deliverd by my servants; this bill is only a copy from my ledger: I speak to the fact by refreshing my memory by my books, which I keep myself - I suppose the entry was made on the day the goods were furnished.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you deliver the goods to the prisoner? A. I am pretty confident he took some of them; he generally took some away with him at the time of making the purchase - he always bargained, and sometimes took the goods and sometimes sent a man; sometimes we sent them: I am sure he bargained for all the goods stated in this invoice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you state that you were present on the 8th of March, when the veneers were delivered? A. I cannot state that: I have no doubt they were sold to him; I cannot recollect that he bargained about any veneers about that time - he has come and bespoken wood on one day, and taken it away on another; I can speak positively to his bargaining with me on all the dates in this invoice; I suppose I was in the way: I must have been in the way, or he could not have bargained - I can speak positively to all of them; I believe I was present when they were taken from the yard: I can swear they were taken from the yard by the prisoner, or by his servant - I cannot take upon myself to state that I delivered any of them to him.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my father's service - a person named Hoar used to supply us with goods; the prisoner furnished us with an invoice of the goods stated in this indictment, two or three days after the date, but he never brought the goods to the premises - I asked him about some tables which ought to have been made of Mr. Hoar's wood, and he said they were not quite finished, because he was waiting for some goods from Mr. Sykes' - he never delivered any invoice of two double-table catches and two screws, and I was not aware of his having them: they ought to have been in the tables made of Mr. Hoar's wood, and they never came in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the invoice of the articles, furnished by Mr. Hoar, was given to you? A. Yes; the prisoner had permission to procure materials, and manufacture goods on our account only, but he did not manufacture these articles; if he had wanted a few articles from the ironmonger's, he would have gone for them, but they would have been entered in the ironmonger's book; they were entered in the ironmonger's book, but not in ours - he might have got those things without telling us, but he ought to have come for our book and had them entered; it has happened perhaps half a dozen times, that he has got goods and not taken our book, or told us of it, but we have reprimanded him for it.</p>

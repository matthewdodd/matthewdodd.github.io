            , who is now at Margate. When the coach was stopped the glasses were both up. There was a tap at the glass on the left side with a pistol. Mr. Silver, who sat next to that window, let down the glass; immediately another came up with a pistol to the other window; my wife sat at that window.</p>
               <p>Who sat on the left side opposite Mr. Silver? - Mr. Julion; my brother sat in the middle. The two Mrs. Gibsons sat on that side; my brother and I sat in the middle.</p>
               <p>Are the ladies here? - No. My wife is pregnant; she has never been well since. They neither of them could swear to the prisoners. I let down the other window, and said, Gentlemen, there are two ladies in the coach, one with child, I hope you will not behave rudely; you shall have our money. The man who was next to my wife said, I will not do the ladies any ill for the world.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - There was very little moon, but it was a very clear night; the new moon was the 6th I believe.</p>
               <p>Was it so light you could distinguish one person from another, to know them? - We could see their clothes, they had both white handkerchiefs over the lower part of their faces. The man on the right-hand side was the shortest of the men. After he said he would not use the ladies ill, he added, but your money I must have. He put a pistol into the coach all the time my wife gave him her purse. I gave my money to the man on the left-hand side. He took three guineas and a half and some silver out of my wife's purse and threw the purse into the coach again. The taller man of the two had coloured clothes; he held a pistol at different times to every one in the coach he could reach. He held it to my breast, and said, Sir, your money, or this shall be your end directly, quick, quick! or words to that effect. He repeated it several times. I gave him some silver and my watch; it was a remarkably small watch, in a chased case. I have never positively sworn to either of the prisoners. The tallest one (Weldon) to the best of my recollection, is the man. The shortest I have not so much knowledge of. The only reason I have to believe him to be the man was his behaviour, the colour of his clothes, and his voice. He attempted to speak in a feigned voice; but, speaking several times, he could not help speaking in his natural voice. I did not observe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050054"></xptr>the features of his face, therefore I cannot take upon me positively to swear to him. I am less certain to the other. At Sir

When the prisoners were brought up I said I believed they were the men. Weldon had on a cocked hat and the same coloured clothes he has on now, but not the same buttons.</p>

               <p>I was in the coach at the time of this robbery. After the coach stopped there was a tap at the window; Mr. Silver let it down. After the window was let down, another person came to the other side of the coach; my brother said, Gentlemen, there are ladies in the coach, I hope you will be careful, as one is with child. The man on my righthand said, Upon my honour I do not mean to hurt the ladies, or words to that effect. The man on the left side seemed to smother his natural voice, and said, D - n you, your money, quick, quick, or this shall be your end! I gave some halfpence to the one on the left hand side; he said, What is this you have given me it is halfpence, it will not do for me, and threw it into the highway. My wife gave the man on the right side, her purse, with three guineas and a half and some silver; he took the money out and threw the purse into the coach again. I saw my brother give his watch to the man on the left-hand side.</p>
               <p>Was it a light night? - There was a little moon, it was a light night; I could observe the shape of their persons and their clothes. The man on the left-hand side had a surtout coat on, and a coat under it with large metal buttons. Upon the first sight of Weldon, at Sir

            's, I said to the gentlemen, I really believe that to be one of the men; the other I was not so positive to. Weldon I believe was the man who came on the left side of the coach, and behaved so rudely. I do not mean that I can swear positively to him. I leaned forwards and had a view of the profile of his face. I thought I could almost swear to his face; and from his voice, which is another circumstance, I believe he is the man.

On the 21st of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, my boy rang me down; I found the prisoner in the shop - my lad said he wanted a morning-ring; I turned the gas on full, unlocked the case, and looked out a card containing six or eight morning-rings, which I gave him - he took them out of my hand, and walked to the door, (which was open.) as I supposed to look at them; he immediately ran out with them - I told my lad to run out and cry Stop thief! I had to go round the counter, and should have left nobody in the shop if I had gone myself; he was brought back in about an hour or three quarters - I saw him at the office next morning, and swore positively to him; I am now sure he is the man, but will not swear it - he had his hat on then; I am confident of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Do you swear positively to him? A. No, but I am sure he is the man; he was brought back to my shop that evening, and I knew him then - there was not less than six rings, nor more than eight; one of them was worth 3l. - the weight of the gold was 1l. value, but it was an expensive pattern.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If there were only six, what would the value be? A. Not less than 5l. 10s. or 6l.; I should have sold them for about 8l. - he was searched in my shop, and a shop-ticket taken from him, with my handwriting on it.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Were there not several other tickets about your shop at the time? A. Yes, but not on that part; they were at the end of the counter - I saw the Policeman take it from him, and lay it on the counter; they had been cleared away before he was searched.</p>

            . I am shop-boy to Mr. Fenn. The prisoner came about seven o'clock and asked for a mourning-ring; I rang master down - he said he believed he had some mourning-rings, if he knew where to find them; he produced a card of rings - I am sure there were from six to eight on it; I noticed them - the prisoner ran out of the shop with them; I attempted to follow him, and was knocked down as soon as I got about a yard from the shop - he went across the road I got about a yard from the church. I went with the constable, in about three quarters of an hour, to the Pavilion, and saw the prisoner there, just at the back entrance to the gallery - he was coming out; I gave him in charge of Lewsey - I saw him searched at master's shop, and saw the card taken from his pocket, with some money; Lewsey put it on the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you in the shop all the time? A. Yes - I ran out as quick as I could; when I was knocked down, the blow came from behind - I did not run against anybody; I am sure there were no cards on the counter, for mistress swept it down before, and I saw it taken from his pocket - I am quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I went with Wood to the Pavilion theatre; I got there about seven o'clock - I cannot be exact to the time; I saw the prisoner at the entrance of the pit door - he was coming out; I took him to the prosecutor's, and took from his trousers pocket this card, with a shilling and 8 1/2d - I am sure the card was in his pocket; I was in Whitechapel-road before I saw Wood, and saw somebody run away from the prosecutor's shop-door, but cannot speak to his features - it was a person answering the prisoner's deseription; I did not see his face - it was getting dusk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did the prosecutor tell you he had lost? A. A card of mourning-rings; they had not been on this card.</p>

            . My hand-writing is on this card, and the wire attached to it I believe to be my own work - this card had been attached to a scent-box, which was laying in my window: I had just commenced business there, and had not sorted my goods - some of the tickets were off the work.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen the card shortly before? A. No - I only know it by the hand-writing; it would not be fastened to the card of rings, but having a hook to it, most likely it attached itself to the card.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN WOOD. I know this card - I had seen it fixed to a scent-box that morning, before I put the things in the window, with the rings which were taken out of the window-case to be shewn to the prisoner.</p>

On the 15th of August the pirosoner came to the shop, with another person, who seemed to be a foreigner, (as the prisoner interpreted for him.) The prisoner asked to look at some gold seals, which I showed him - he then asked to look at a diamond ring - I showed him some; he then produced a letter from his pocket, and read from it an order, which he said was from South America, and would be for three dozens of gold seals, three dozens of gold fancy rings, one diamond ring, and six pairs of brilliant ear-rings; he said Mr. Mainwaring's name was given to him by a Mr. Askill, of America, and said, "I do not know whether I have the pleasure of addressing Mr. Mainwaring or not;" I said, my name was Brown; he said it was of no consequence, as we might rely upon having the order, and named the following Monday morning, at nine o'clock, to see a better assortment than I had then before me - he appointed that time himself; I showed them the whole of our diamond stock, which they seemed paricularly to admire. They asked the price of various articles, and then went away; I immediately put the things they had looked at into the drawer and case from whence I had taken them, and as they did not keep their appointment on the following Monday morning, nor indeed ever came again, we had some suspicion; Mr. Mainwaring and my self took stock, and missed the articles stated in the indictment - I had shown them the pin and rings, and I am certain I had seen the other things two days before they came. I have seen the diamond pin at Marlborough-street - it is worth above 5l. The property altogether is worth 43l., at a very reduced calculation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MCDOWELL. Q. How many persons had been in your shop from the time you had seen the other things? A. Probably thirty or forty - I had no conversation with the other man; they talked in a foreign language, but I doubt his being a foreigner, for he looked at a very fine sapphire brooch, and I heard the word No, from one to the other - I will not swear it was No - it seemed to be a signification of No - I do not know whether the negative term in the French language sounds like No - I did not observe any conversation between them till after they had been into the warehouse - I looked at the things  - the prisoner produced the letter from his pocket; I swear he did not say he wanted the articles for the gentleman who was with him - that man did not look at more than one or two articles - I showed them some pearl suits; the prisoner immediately said, "I do not deal in that, but my friend deals largely in it" - I did not mention this circumstance at Marlborough-street, as they thought I had stated enough; that was my only reason for not stating it - I did not see to whom the letter was addressed.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Barton, a pawnbroker, of Princes-street, Soho - the prisoner came to our shop on the 15th of August, about four o'clock, and pawned a diamond pin for 3l. - he said the stone weighed three grains - he pawned it in the name of John Johnson - I have it here; it is worth 5l. 5s. in the trade, and would sell for a good deal more - I sent notice to the Magistrate at Marlborough-street, in consequence of a hand-bill.</p>

            . This is the pin - I know it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it? A. By the peculiarity of the setting, and the tint of the colour - it is set with the stem angleways, which is unusual-there are two grains, and then one, which is unusual; it happened to be the very largest pin we had, and was on a piece of velvet, with about thirty others - I did not tell the Magistrate, that the person who came with him appeared an excellent judge of the articles, nor say any thing to that effect.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, being called upon for his defence, read a long address to the Court, respecting his having simply acted as interpreter to the other person; the particulars of which will be found in his subsequent trial, on the Seventh Day of the Session.</p>

             re-examined. I saw a Frenchman in company with the prisoner on one occasion; he had some things, and gave them to the prisoner to pawn with me, one at a time; the prisoner asked more on them than I could lend, and he returned them back to the Frenchman. I think this was two or three days subsequent to his pawning the pin; one of the articles was a diamond brooch, and I think there were some rings, but I am not positive; the prisoner was alone when he pawned the brooch in the name of"John Johnson, 17, Oxford-street" - it was a diamond sapphire brooch; he had brought me something to pawn about a week before, with the Frenchman, but I did not take it in.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in St. Martin's-lane; the prisoner has been to our shop more than once, accompained by a Frenchaman; he once brought a diamond and sapphire brooch to pledge - the Frenchman took it from his pocket and gave it to the prisoner, who spoke English, and interpreted to the Frenchman; things were generally given to me by the prisoner, who asked the sum for them - he sometimes communicated with the Frenchman previously.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did he come to your house with the brooch? A. About a month ago; he wanted more than I could advance on it - that was the first time that I remember; he came the last time on the 22d of August, and offered a gold watch for 5l. I offered him 3l. - before he would take it, he went and spoke to the Frenchman, who was at the door, then came back and pawned it with me in the name of "John James, 18, Castle-street." I do not remember their coming at any other time.</p>

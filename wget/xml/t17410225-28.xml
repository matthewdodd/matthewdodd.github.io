               <p>Gerrard Brooks. On Wednesday Night last, about ten o'Clock, I was coming from the Play, and had the Misfortune to meet the Prisoner in James-Street, Covent-Garden, and she prevail'd on me to go with her to the Rummer Tavern. We went up two Pair of Stairs, into a Room, in which was a Bed, where we staid the Drinking of 4 Pints of Wine: At last, I grew warm, and she desirous, and we went to Bed. I had not been in Bed ten Minutes, before I heard the gingling of a Purse, upon which, I suspected that she had pick'd my Pocket, for I had 19 Guineas, and a

             in my Purse, in my Breeches Pocket, when I went to Bed. Immediately I got up, and took the Candle, and light it by the Fire, and in that Time, she took an Opportunity to take out of the Purse 4 Guineas and the Sequin, which was worth about ten Shillings. I call'd for Assistance, and search'd the Bed, and we found the Purse with only 15 Guineas in it, between the Sheets and the Bed. I charg'd her with robbing me, but she said she knew nothing at all of it, upon which I sent for the Beadle, and 2 or 3 more, to search her; but before we went away, the Money was found in the Room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, Did he not make me a Present of the Money?</p>
               <p>Brooks. No, on my Oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had he his Purse in his Pocket when he went to Bed?</p>
               <p>Brooks Yes, I am positive I had, for I took it out to change a Guinea just before I went to Bed, and I never slept at all.</p>

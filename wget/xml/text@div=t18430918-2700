                  </hi>. I live with my mother, Sarah Brooks, in Marchmont-street—she keeps a green-grocer's shop—about twenty minutes before five is the afternoon, on the 18th of September, I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner come up stairs from the kitchen—I asked what he went down for—he said "For some water"—he had lived in our service since last Whit Monday—I then sent him out on an errand and he came back about a quarter after five—before he came back I had heard about a watch, and I told him the watch was missing, and I did not know who could take it but those in the house—he said he knew nothing about it—I spoke to him about being searched, and he said he had no objection if it would be more satisfaction to me—I searched him, but found nothing—I gave him into custody—he still denied any know<lb></lb>ledge of the watch—this is the watch.</p>

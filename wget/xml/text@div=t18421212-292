I knew Nathan, the deceased, by sight—on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, the 23rd of Nov., I was at Foster's sale-rooms in Pall Mall, and saw the three prisoners going along the passage leading to the sale room together—I heard Rason say to the other two, "Call him out to have something to</p>

On Wednesday, the 23rd of Nov., I was in the sale-room, and saw Nathan, the three prisoners, and Hart there—I heard Rason say to Nathan, "Nathan, we are going out to have a drop of gin, come and have some"—Nathan replied that he did not want any, and he would not go out—Ranson said, "Oh, come along, it won't harm you, we are all going together"—Mountain went out of the room, Nathan followed, and Rason after—Davey and Hart went out together directly after—I afterwards heard a heavy fall in the passage—I opened the glass-door, and saw Nathan lying on his face, on the ground, in the passage, with his head against the skirting—I did not see either of the prisoners doing anything to him at that time—I afterwards saw Rason trying to keep Mountain away—he was standing under the portico of the door, with his back against him, keep<lb></lb>ing him from Nathan—Mountain was in that rage that he was more like a person out of his mind than anything else—he then flew into the passage, got Nathan by the collar, pulled him over on his face, hit him in the head and shoulder, and kicked him in the side—Rason said, "Go it, give it him, serve him right"—Davey was outside, on the pavement, at that time—I did not hear him say anything—Mountain then dragged Nathan from the passage, right on to the flags of the street—I saw Davey trying to part them—some gentlemen then came out of the sale-room—Shepherd got Nathan away from Mountain's grasp, took him into the sale-room, washed his eye, and wiped the blood away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called in to attend the deceased on the 25th of Nov.—I found him in bed, labouring under severe contused blows and wounds about the eye, with extensive inflammation of the parts about—I continued to attend him until his death, which took place that day fortnight—I saw him on the Monday morning preceding his death—he was then in a dying state—we expected that he could not get through the night, and that was the opinion of Mr. Callaway of Guy's-hospital—I had not told him that I thought he could not live through the night—I told his wife and daughter so—I did not learn from anything he said, that he was aware of his state—he had extensive sloughing of the cellular membrane of the neck—matter was form<lb></lb>ing to a very large extent under the facia of the temporal muscle, and extend<lb></lb>ing behind the ear, so much so, that we were apprehensive from the inflam<lb></lb>mation, that it would burst under the clavicle—there was gangrene and mor<lb></lb>tification from imperfect circulation of the parts—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> exa<lb></lb>mination—I found in the lateral ventricles of the brain, effusion of, not direct blood, but of a sanguinious character, blood mixed with the fluid—there was nothing else remarkable—I believe death was caused by the external inju<lb></lb>ries he had received about the head, and the extensive inflammation that en<lb></lb>sued,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184212120023"></xptr>
               <p>as a consequence—violent blows with a man's fist about the head would account for the appearances, and I believe that was the cause—when I first saw him, the injuries of the head were so great, and he was in such a depressed state, that I was apprehensive of danger in making any further examination—I saw no material injury about the body after death, no marks or bruises—there was extensive suppuration of the integuments under the skin on the head—matter forming and burrowing all about, extending to the occipital bone—there were two wounds on the orbit of the right eye—the extensive inflammation was an after consequence of the injury sustained—when the facia of a part takes on inflammation, it is very serious, and he was not a young man—blows would produce inflammation of the cellular membrane, which is tantamount to erysipelas—after contused blows we generally have diffused inflammation of the cellular membrane, and in this case such was the fact, without anything denoting that it was really erysipelas—it is very diffi<lb></lb>cult to draw the line between diffusive inflammation and erysipelas—it is that sort of inflammation which we have after blows—if the body is not in a good state, the mischief would of course be greater—his depression was great, but he was perfectly conscious—I thought very seriously or it at first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Marlborough-row, Marlborough-street. I was in Foster's auction-room on the 23rd of Nov.—the three pri<lb></lb>soners, Hart, and Nathan, were in the room—I saw Rason go and speak to Mountain, and saw them talking together in the room—I then saw them go from the left-hand side of the room to the right, where the fire-place was—Nathan was near the fire-place, and Mountain said to him, "Did you say that I was a * * * * gentleman?"—Nathan said, "Yes, you are a s——, you know you are; it is right enough"—Mountain turned to Rason, and said, "You hear what he says, and you know I am not"—he appeared very angry and very excited—he asked Rason to go out and state the case to a police<lb></lb>man, for him to give Nathan into custody—Rason and Mountain went out together to state the case to a policeman—they came in again in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and Mountain went to the left-hand side of the room—Nathan went across to him, and nudging him with his finger, said, "How is your temper now? what I said is right enough; it is right enough; you know you are so"—Mountain turned to Rason, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> I can't stand this any longer; I must go and have something to drink"—Nathan said, "Oh, something to drink; aye, something to drink; <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> something to drink, and we will say no more about it"—Rason went towards the door leading to the passage, followed by Mountain, Nathan next, and Davey next—I fol<lb></lb>lowed close behind Davey—I saw Mountain turn round, seize Nathan by the collar with one hand, and strike him over the eye with the other—Rason said, "I can't see this," and seized Mountain by the collar, to drag him away—Davey seized him as well, to drag him away—I was there during the whole of the struggle that took place—neither Rason or Davey used any expressions of encouragement; far from it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a picture-dealer, and live in Great Wild-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields. On the 23rd of Nov. I was at Foster's sale-rooms, and saw the three prisoners and Nathan there—I saw Davey come up to Mountain and Rason, and say something to them—they were standing, talking to me—in consequence of what he said, Mountain and Rason went over to Nathan, and said, "What do you mean by telling Mr. Davey that I am a * * * gen<lb></lb>tleman?"—Nathan tapped him on the arm, and said, "I mean s——y"—I then went to another part of the room—about a quarter of an hour after I heard a cry of "Murder"—I pulled open the folding glass doors, and dis<lb></lb>tinctly saw Nathan bleeding from his head, and Rason and Davey trying to pull Mountain back from Nathan, trying to prevent him from striking him—I was taken in charge about this, but was dismissed the moment the Magistrate heard the case.</p>

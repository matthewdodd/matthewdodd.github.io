                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 112). About half-past 1 o'clock on Monday, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> May, I was in Mr. Walter's, pawnbroker's shop, Aldersgate-street, and saw the prisoner in one of the lobbies—he saw me, and imme-diately started out of the shop—I followed him—he was stopped by a gentleman—I went up and asked him to give me the watch that he had been to the pawnbroker's shop with—he did not speak—I searched him, and found there was something in his mouth—I took this watch with some force from his throat—I took him to the station, the inspector read over to him the charge of unlawfully pawning the watch, and asked him to account for the possession of it—he said that he purchased it of a Jew in Petticoat-lane on Sunday morning, for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and had kept it ever since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plasterer, of 28, Gravel-street—this is my watch—I lost it last Sunday week, May 1st, in the evening—it was taken from my pocket when I was passing from Snow-hill to go up Holborn<lb></lb>hill—the ring was broken but a new one has been put on—I saw the prisoner on the opposite side of the crowd immediately after I lost it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see me when you lost it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, you were within three feet of me; you dodged round the crowd to the opposite side or I should have given you in custody—I followed you up Snow-hill, and gave information to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with my husband on the Sunday evening, and had a chain round my neck—I felt the prisoner pull it, and told my husband to beware of his watch, and it was gone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see me pull it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but I saw your hand move from the chain directly you had pulled it—you then passed between the crowd and my husband—we followed you up, Snow-hill, but could not give you in charge, because we did not meet a policeman—there was one in the crowd, but he was engaged with some women.</p>

I did not put the things under the rick"—that was before I had had time to speak to either of them—I told them that they were the two I had been waiting for, and took them into the barn, where there was a bundle, containing five blankets, four large plated candlesticks, and all these things produced, except the work box and tea caddy—I said, "I shall charge you on suspicion of stealing these things"—Silcock said, "You will not be able to bring it home</p>

I never put the things under the rick"—I was examined before the Magistrate—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>) it is "there" in this, but Mr. Fell might have misunderstood me—I have been twelve years in the force—Silcock said that he and Ford had got over there for a natural purpose.</p>

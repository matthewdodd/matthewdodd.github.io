            , Constable, thus depos'd: On Tuesday Night last, I took the Prisoner at Sadler's-Wells. When I seized him, he clapt his Hand to his Pocket, and I thought he was feeling for a Pistol; but instead of that, he dropt this Purse with these two Gold Medals in it; one of them has the City of Hamburg upon it, and the other the Effigy of the Princess Sophia; this Silver Snuff-Box, this Toothpick-Case, and this Diamond Ring. Then I carried him before a Magistrate, where he confess'd the Fact, and what he had done with the rest of the Jewels.</p>

I found a little Fire in the Chimney, with which I lighted a Piece of Wax-Candle that I had in my Pocket. I endeavour'd to open the Scrutere with my Knife, but could not effect it. I looked about for something else, and seeing a Key hang by the Looking-Glass, I took it down, and it answer'd my With. I stole from thence all the Goods that I am accused at: Some of them were taken upon me; and at that time I dropt two Medals into the Pocket of

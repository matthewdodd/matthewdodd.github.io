                  </hi>. I keep a broker's shop in Old-street-road. On Saturday morning, the 12th of October, as I was opening the shop, I missed eighteen stair-rods, which I had seen safe in the shop on Thursday evening before—I saw them at Worship-street on the Tuesday following, and knew them to be mine—I know nothing of the prisoner, but I know his parents.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ginger-beer maker, and live in Cradle-court, Red Cross-street, Cripplegate. On Friday, the 11th of October, between eight and nine o'clock, I was in Old-street-road, and saw the prisoner and another lad standing together by the side of the prosecutor's shop—in about a minute I saw the prisoner go into the shop and come out with the rods in his hand—the other lad stood before the door—I followed them to a marine-store dealer's in Virginia-row, where he offered the rods for sale through the window—I went for a policeman, brought him to the shop, and gave the prisoner into custody—he was at the door in the act of leav<lb></lb>ing, and had not the rods with him—the policeman took him into the shop, and the owner of the shop then produced the rods—the prisoner said he had offered them for sale—the man said he had not bought them, but had detained them, and told the prisoner to fetch the owner—the prisoner said he had found them near Shoreditch church.</p>

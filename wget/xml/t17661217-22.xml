            . On the 23d of October, between seven and night in the morning, the boy at the bar came and took a loaf out of the window (I am servant to the prosecutor) and set it on a basket; then he came to me for the ash-tub; he took the tub and loaf, and away he went; I told my master of it, and he followed him immediately.</p>
               <p>Frazer's defence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thompson told me to bring him a loaf on the Wednesday; I did not on that day, so I took one, thinking my master would be angry that I did not, so I took one and carried it on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Thompson's defence.</p>
               <p>The young man brought me a loaf, and desired to leave it with me till he called again; he did not call for several days; at last he called, and asked me if I wanted a loaf, and said, I should have it for a groat, which I gave him; three or four days after he brought another, and left it, which I gave him the same price for; that I think was on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176612170016"></xptr> Tuesday, and I think on the Friday following his master followed him; I did not handle it; he asked where the loaf was; the boy turned, and gave him it.</p>

               <p>Emerton I know Thompson; he lives in a court by St. Martin's church, and has a stall in Leicester-fields; he had two loaves, they were very much picked; what he gave for them I do not know, they were not saleable; they must certainly be second-hand, they were not fit to sell to a good customer; I have known him seven years; he has four children and a sick wife; he is a botch ng taylor, his character is very good in the neighbourhood.</p>

            . I am a servant at a public-house; the boy at the bar came for two loaves, which he had left; he said they were in the cellar; the boy that received them of him was gone out; I went down and carried them up; they were picked in a very great manner; I shewed the people how they were picked.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Perkins. This was the Tuesday before Thompson was taken up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brady. I used to employ the prisoner Thompson; one time in particular I was going out, and in my hurry I left a 36 s. piece and half a guinea in my pocket, and sent my breeches to him to do something to them; and in the afternoon, when I came home, he was at my house, and brought the 36 s. piece and half guinea, and told me he found them in the pocket. I said, Thompson, you are an honest fellow; have you any credit; he said, no; I told him, he should go to my draper, and I would give him 10 l. credit; I look upon him to be as honest a creature as can be.</p>

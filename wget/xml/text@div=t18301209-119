               <p>STEPHEN HAYWARD. I live in Goldsmith-square, Hackney-road. On Sunday morning, the 7th of November, between one and two o'clock, I was in <placeName id="t18301209-119-crimeloc687">Slater-street, Bethnal-green</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many public-houses had you been in? A. I had been to the Red Lion, where my club is held; I drank there - I had not been to the Flower Pot; I had been drinking at the Grey Eagle - I was not turned out of any public-house for blacking people's faces, when they were tipsy; I had been at the door with two Policemen - I was fresh, but not drunk.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I was in Slater-street, and saw a scuffle with the prosecutor and three men - I waited, looked at them, and all on a sudden I heard Murder! called; I ran up, and saw the prisoner on the body of the prosecutor, in a kneeling position - the other two men, who were on either side of him, ran away; I went to seize them, but in my hurry I fell - I got up, and so did the prisoner; he ran up the street - I sprung my rattle, and pursued him: two of my brother officers were at the top of the street - the prisoner passed one of them, but the other crossed the way to meet him - I was not far behind; there is a court, into which he turned, and I lost sight of him - in half a minute the other officer came up with the prisoner, and I identified him; there was no other person.</p>

Yes - there was no one else about there - I came back to the public-house, on the spot where I had first seen them; the prosecutor said he had been robbed - I asked if he knew by whom; he said No.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I heard the rattle, and saw the prisoner running - I met him; he turned across the road - I turned, and ran after him till I took him in a court, by the Knave of Clubs; it was not more than a second or so after I turned the corner - he was running before me.</p>

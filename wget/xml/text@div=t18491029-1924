                  </hi>. I am a wheelwright, and let out trucks for hire. On 21st Sept., between seven and eight in the morning, Chalk came to my house for a truck to move some goods from Durham-street; he said he came from the ivory man in Durham-street, and would bring it back in an hour or two—he was to pay twopence an hour—he never came back, or the truck either—in consequence of something my son told me, I went to the house of a man named Beach, and there saw the red wheels, springs, and axletree of my truck—it had been taken to pieces—I spoke to Mr. Beach about it, and afterwards went with Beach, and Newill, the policeman, to Spital-street—I staid outside while they went in; when they came out again we went to the Black Lion, which is 150 yards off—we found Ellis there, and Beach said, in his presence, that that was the man that had the truck—Ellis said nothing; I gave him into custody, and he was taken to the station—we then went back to the house in Spital-street, and found the iron-work belonging to the body of the truck in a cupboard—I saw Chalk there, and gave him in custody for stealing my truck—he said nothing—the truck was worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On a Saturday, about five weeks ago, I was at my brother Robert Beach's, a coach-maker, in Willow-walk—he was ill in bed—the prisoners came there and asked me if I would buy some springs, axle, and wheels—I said I would inquire, as I did not belong to the place—I afterwards went for my brother to 9, Spital-street, with the prisoners, and they showed me the wheels, springs, and axle, which appeared to belong to a truck, and some iron attached to the springs—they asked 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—at last they agreed to take 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, and they brought them with me to my brother's—I paid Ellis for them, and they went away together—Mr. Lovegrove after wards saw them—I afterwards went with him and the policeman to the Black Lion, and saw Ellis there—I am sure he is the person I bought the wheels of.</p>

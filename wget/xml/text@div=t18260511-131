               <p>ROBERT NEWTON. I know the nature of an oath. My father sent me with three pairs of shoes, in a handkerchief, to Mr. Stokes' - as I went along the prisoner came and took them from me - I screamed out, and Mr. Savage gave me the shoes. I took them to Mr. Stokes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there any more lads there in the same dress as me? A. No - he was by himself.</p>

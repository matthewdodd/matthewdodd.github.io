                  </hi>. I keep the Richmond Arms, Blundell Street, Caledonian Road—on 9th May my servant Lewis absconded, and I missed 2 gold watches, 3 gold chains, an Albert chain, some rings, seals, silver spoons, money, and old foreign coins; value altogether 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were locked up in a chest of drawers—one of the gold watches was chased, and had a seal attached—I was present in the front room of the prisoner's father's house when the detective, in the prisoner's presence, had a conversation with his father; the father said "Very well, if I had not been a gentleman why did you ask me to have something to drink?"—the constable said "You recol<lb></lb>lect you told me you sold a coat to a young man you believed to be Walter Blewitt"—the father said "When he was there buying the coat he pulled out a chain and a chased watch"—the constable asked him if he would have anything to drink and he refused—from the description of the watch I should say that it wad my daughter's watch—I prosecuted the young man, and he pleaded guilty at the Sessions.</p>

I am nineteen years old—I was in Mr. Arlett's service—on 9th May, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, I took the keys, opened the drawer, and took away the jewellery—I had seen the prisoner three times before, at a public-house in Woodgate Street—I went to that public-house after I had taken these articles and saw some men there, but I had no conversation—I came out and was passing the prisoner's shop; he said "Good evening," and I said "Good evening;" he said, in a low whisper, "Have you anything to sell? "I said "Yes;" he said "Go inside till I have shut up"—I went in, and he came in and locked the door—nobody else was there—I then took the jewellery out and laid it on the counter—he said "I hope it <hi rend="italic">aint a by</hi>"—I did not understand that—he said "Where did you get it?"—I said "From my master, Mr. Arlett"—he said "It is the first I have bought"—I said "It is the first I have stolen"—he asked me how much I wanted, I said "12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said that he had not</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer Y</hi>). I was instructed to make enquiries, and on the 14th Blewitt told me that if I went down to Woodgate Street, to a shop where they sold ties, that he had taken the property there, and it was tied up in a handkerchief, and he had received 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it on Friday night, and that he had taken a watch and chain there on the following Saturday night—I won't be quite certain whether he said that he had received any more money, but he said that he had received a tie, and that there were tome ties in the window the same as the tie on his neck; that the man had got a father a little lower down, who kept a clothes shop, and he had taken him there and introduced him to his father, to buy a hat and coat—I went to 12, Widegate Street, which leads into Petticoat Lane—the shop corre<lb></lb>sponded with the description which Blewitt had given me—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner's wife, and the prisoner afterwards came—he appeared to be in a very agitated state, and said "What does all this meant"—I said "There is a young man in custody for stealing a lot of jewellery, who says that he has left it with you and received 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from you, and that he bought a tie of you"—he said that he did not know what I meant, but acknowledged that he remem<lb></lb>bered the young man coming in after a tie—I saw ties in the window like</p>

               <p>his—I also said that Blewitt said that the prisoner took him to his father and bought a hat and coat, and that he left his old tie behind him, and that I had come for the property—he said that he could not understand what I meant—I afterwards served a notice on the prisoner, and he attended before Mr. Cook on 21st May and gave his evidence—this is his deposition, signed by him and also by the Magistrate—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Abraham Nathan on his oath saith 'I live at 12, Widegate Street, Bishopsgate, I am a hosier; my father keeps a clothes shop opposite; I have never seen the prisoner, to my knowledge; he never brought me any jewellery; and I never lent him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon it. I have never advanced money on jewellery to him or anyone else. I never received a watch and chain from him. I have purchased no jewellery or watches and chains. I had no dealings with the prisoner on 10th May.

Blewitt pleaded guilty, and on 3rd June I went to the prisoner and told him that I had come to take him in custody for receiving the jewellery I had been about before—he made no reply—his father came in, and I said "You remember when I was here before you said that the young man who brought the hat and coat had a watch in his possession; you said that it was a gold watch chased at the back, and had seals attached to the chain"—the father said "Yes, I know he did"—I said "I suppose that is the young man you saw at the Police Court?"—the father said "I have no doubt but what it is"—the father was present on the 21st, and wanted to make a statement to Mr. Cook.</p>

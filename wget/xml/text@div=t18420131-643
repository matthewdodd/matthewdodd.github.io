                  </hi>. I am in the employ of George Stagg and another, linen-drapers, Leicester-square. About six o'clock in the evening of the 13th of January, I was in the middle of the shop, which was lighted up—I saw two men come to the shop—I opened the inner door, and one of them came in—I asked what he wanted—we had some things hanging up in the lobby, about two yards from the door—the prisoner pulled down a cloak that was hanging in the lobby, and ran away with it—it was almost the last cloak in the lobby—I followed him into the square—about 100 yards from the shop he turned round and saw me following him—he threw the cloak at me—I cried "Stop thief," and followed a short distance—I then turned round and picked up the cloak—he was stopped by a young man in our establishment—I saw him brought back about a minute after—I am certain he is the man—the cloak is worth 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,</p>

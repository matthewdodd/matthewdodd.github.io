I am one of the principal clerks in the Post-office, the prisoner was a letter-carrier, employed in the south-eastern district office, Borough—in consequence of a communication made to me I made up a letter, in which I enclosed 44 postage-stamps, and a half sovereign—I marked each stamp, fastened up the letter and addressed it, "MR. Bendy, oil and colour merchant, 154, Snows-fields, Bermondsey"—If fastened it up and gave it to Mr. Willis Clare, the inspector of letter-carriers, to post—on the same day, at half-past four o'clock, I went to the south-eastern district office, High-street, Borough—the prisoner was brought into a private room there, and I said, "A letter, containing money and postage-stamps, ad<lb></lb>dressed to Mr. Bendy, 154, Snows-fields, which should have been delivered by you to-day about one o'clock, is missing; do you know anything about it?" he replied that he did not—I then directed Rumbold to search him, and he produced from his pocket a purse containing 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and forty-four penny-stamps in one sheet—I took them in my hand and said, "Where did you get these postage-stamps from?"—he said, "I have had them for a week, they were sent to my wife from the country"—I said, "By whom?"—he replied, "By my father"—I asked him what his father was and where he lived—he said, "James Colby, Bletchington, Oxford"—each of the stamps had my private mark on it—I said, "These stamps were enclosed in the letter addressed to Mr. Bendy, and were in that letter to-day between twelve and one o'clock, where did you get them from?"—he said, "I have not had a letter for Mr. Bendy to-day"—I said, "The letter is known to have been in your posession when you left the office for your twelve o'clock delivery, what did you do with the half sovereign?"—he said, "What half sovereign?" I said, "The half sovereign which was enclosed in the letter with these postage-stamps"—he said, "I have not seen it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I had no letter for Mr. Bendy at all that day, and after Mr. Gardiner took the stamps from me he took something out of his pocket and marked them. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No; I applied solution to them to make the marks visible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. William Thomas and another, warehousemen, No. 128, Cheapside; they have a small shop in Gray's Inn-lane, the prisoner lived at that shop. On 1st Nov. the prisoner called at the warehouse, in Cheapside; he had two pieces of paper in his hand, and he said, "I want 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for land tax"—I said, "Leave the receipts"—he said, "I will not leave you the receipts till such time as I have the money"—Mr. Lewis Thomas was standing by, and he inquired what Maidment wanted; I told him he had applied for a tax, and Mr. Lewis Thomas made the reply, if it was their tax it must be paid—with that I went with the prisoner to another part of the warehouse, and he showed me the receipts—he held the receipts in his hand, and there appeared like 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on each receipt—I gave him the money, and he handed me over these receipts—he went away—I did not see this indorsement on the back of these receipts before I paid the money—I paid it out of some money I had received—I looked at the figures again, and they had the appearance of being altered—I drew Mr. Thomas's attention to it, and told him what I had done, and he desired me to go to the tax collector and make inquiry—I looked at the receipt in the presence of the prisoner; he had before asked me for the money for the land tax, and I said, "I see it is for property tax," and he said, "Yes, it is."</p>

                  </hi>. I am partner with my brother Lewis; we are ware-housemen in Cheapside; I am owner of the house, No. 113, Gray's Inn-lane. I do not know how long the prisoner had been in possession of that house; my brother has the management of it—when the prisoner left the house, there was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due for rent—I do not know whether applica<lb></lb>tion was made to the prisoner for that; Mr. Pollen had the business in his hand—there was a summons sent in for fixtures; I never knew what was the amount—I did not see the receipts on 1st Nov.—my brother did, and I called on the prisoner on 2nd or 3rd Nov., to ask him how it was he had paid 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the property tax, when the rent was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, it would not amount to that—he said that he had paid it, and he had always paid the same amount; and in addition he had paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the broker's man, which, if I did not pay him, he would immediately take out a summons and compel me—I told him I did not believe that he had paid it—he reiterated again that he had paid it—I told him I had sent to the tax collector, who had stated that he had only paid two 1 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he did not care what the collector said, he had paid the 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which he should make me pay—he was very intemperate, and very abusive—I said either the Government officer or he had stated what was not true, and it must be in<lb></lb>quired into—I sent for a policeman, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you take the policeman in with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had never seen the prisoner but once before in my life—there had been no misunderstanding between us—I think it was his ignorance more than anything else that made him so abusive—he did not tell me he had put up some fixtures—I know under what tenancy he held, because he applied to me about the tenancy, but I did not let it to him—he had rented the shop of the previous tenant, and that tenant died, and he took the house—he paid the rent monthly—I refused to let the house unless he did—when I called on him in reference to these two receipts, he did not tell me that he had paid 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in all—he did not say that he had charged me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., including the expenses—he said he had paid the two 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he had paid, in addition, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he never made mention of any other sum whatever—I had summoned him for the rent, and he put in a claim about the fixtures—he was nonsuited about that, and he paid the rent—that was a month or six weeks before this transaction.</p>

                  </hi>. I am collector of the taxes for the district of Gray's Inn-lane. I made application at the prisoner's house for sums several times—I was not able to get them—the first of these receipts was due on 20th Sept., 1853, and the second on 20th March, 1854—I took Mr. Pullen, a broker, there, and gave him these two receipts—there was then 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on each—I have been collector there nearly two years—I have never known the collection to be 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the half year—the first collection was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I think the Commissioners made a reduction in consequence of Mr. Thomas's paying the land-tax—if these receipts have been altered to 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., it was not done by my knowledge—I was present when the levy was made—I left the man in possession.</p>

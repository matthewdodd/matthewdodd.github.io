                  </hi>. I am carman to Daniel Levy and Sons, fruit-mer<lb></lb>chants Botolph-lane, Lower Thomas-street, I received five boxes from their warehouse to carry to Mr. Badger, a confectioner in Bishopsgate-street—I went to several places with my cart—the last place was to my own house, in Fashion-street, Spitalfields, to have my dinner—I left the cart at the corner of the court where I live, and left my little boy in it to mind it—he came running in-doors to me in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I went, and missed two boxes out of five which were in the cart when I left it—in consequence of information from a young woman, I went up a court opposite, and met Bouvir in the court—he asked me what I had lost?—I told him two boxes of fruit—I went on, and met a little girl, and, in consequence of what she said, I went and found one box on the stairs of a house in Union-court—I was coming out of doors with it, when the officer came and took it from me—when I met Bouvir, he went up the court into the house where I found the box.</p>

                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. I am eleven years old, and live with my father in New-court, Fashion-street. On the Tuesday in question I was going up Fashion-street, and saw the cart standing just at the end of Fashion-court—it had five boxes in it—I saw a man in a light coat take two boxes out of the cart, and take them down Union-court—I only saw one man—the prisoner Banks is the man—I did not see any body near him, or running—I do not know him by his face, only by his coat and his height.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter.

In consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion I went to the second house in Union-court, about two o'clock on Tuesday, and in the passage saw Stowers, with the box in his hand—I took it, and have had it ever since—before I got there I saw Banks walking away from the house the box was found in—somebody outside said the man had gone into that house—I waited in the passage till my brother-officer came to assist in searching the house, and while waiting heard somebody come up the cellar stairs very softly—I made towards the top of the staircase, and observed Bouvir just as he got to the top—I said, "What have you been doing down there?"—he said, "I have been to see a friend"—I said it was a strange thing to go to see a friend in a cellar, and took him into custody—I went down into the cellar afterwards with a candle, but found nothing but a parcel of bricks and rubbish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the door of the house open, or shut? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Open—Stowers was coming out—I stated before the Magistrate that it was a curious thing he should go to see a friend in a cellar, but it was not put in the deposition, and I did not think it material to tell clerk he had omitted it.</p>

                  </hi>. I went with Rowland to Union-court, and directly I got in I saw Banks walking up the court, as if he was passing through—Alcock said, "This is the man"—I ran after him, and told him I wanted him—he asked what for—I said concerning a box taken out of a cart in the court—he said he thought I must he mistaken—I said he had better come back, and we should see—I took him to Alcock, and he said, "That is the man"—I then took him to the station-house, and returned to the house, where I found Rowland with the other prisoner and this box.</p>

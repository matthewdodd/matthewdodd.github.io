On the 20th of September, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner take a book off my stall-board; it was Boyer's French and English Dictionary. I went after him - he began to run, and when he got about fifty yards he dropped it. I called out Stop thief! and picked it up. He was gone some distance - several pursued. I lost sight of him, but am certain of him - he was brought back, and said,</p>
               <p>"You know me, Mr. Wilton, my name is

            ; you had me transported before, and I have done this out of revenge" - I immediately said,</p>
               <p>"I do know you, and am sorry you should have come back again." He had been sent to the Penitentiary, about May, 1819.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Might he not have said,</p>
               <p>"I am not likely to have done this, when I have been transported before" - A. No. I did not notice his face - it was done in broad day-light. I stood at the door at the time, and he at the other end of the window. There were three persons looking at books.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prisoner running, and secured him. Mr. Wilton gave me the book - he said he had stolen it.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is true, I have been sentenced to transportation by the same prosecutor - I was sent to the Penitentiary, and after four years restored to society; since which I have been employed as writer, to Messrs. Marshall and Co., of Carey-street, and had on this day got into the service of Mr. Russell, of Long-acre, and was about his business at the time. Is it likely I should again go to the shop, when I had been imprisoned so long for a former transaction? Without giving himself time to think whether I was the person, he concluded that I was. Any one dressed the same as me might be taken.</p>

             re-examined. He said Wilton had transported him before, and he supposed he wished to do so again. I asked Wilton what he had done, as I only took him because he was the first who was running - he said,</p>
               <p>"I suppose you mean to transport me again." I did not hear him say he had done it out of revenge; he might have said so. I was present all the time, close to him, but took very little notice of the conversation.</p>
               <p>MR. WILTON. I cannot say that he took the book, only from his own words. I believe he was discharged from the Penitentiary three weeks before this transaction.</p>

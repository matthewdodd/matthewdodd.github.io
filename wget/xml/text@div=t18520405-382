                  </hi>. I am a surgeon by profession, and have for some years carried on an extensive business—I now carry on a business in Berners-street, connected with the silvering of glass—I have carried it on since the autumn of 1848—in 1849 I formed a partnership with Mr. Varnish and Mr. Cookney—that partnership ended in May, 1851—in the autumn of 1849 I engaged the prisoner Mellish—he was recommended to me by Mr. Powell, of the Whitefriars Glass-works—I knew nothing myself of the cutting or engraving of glass, I never had anything to do with it—I sent for Mellish, and he called on me—I told him that having a process for silvering glass, I wished to obtain the assistance of some individual who could superintend at the glass house the making of the different specimens of the glass that I wished to apply the silvering process to—he seemed very willing to under<lb></lb>take the conduct of the matter, and agreed to go down to the glass house for me, and to carry out any suggestion I could desire, it was necessary I should have a person on the spot with the workmen, as I could not go myself, and he agreed to do so at the rate of six guineas a week—the engage<lb></lb>ment we entered into was ultimately reduced to writing—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. James Cookney having proved his attestation to this agreement, it was read, it was dated 26th Dec, 1849, and was between Messrs. Thomson and Varnish, and Thomas Robert Mellish, by which Mellish was engaged at a salary of six guineas per week, so long as he employed himself in the business eight hours per day</hi>)—I did not understand anything at all as to the rate of wages that were to be paid—I hired Mellish entirely to conduct that part of the business—he told me he had been accustomed to regulate the wages for a long period, and that he perfectly understood it, and that he would do so on ray behalf—he then entered into ray service—he required that he should have the sole control of the hiring the men, of their rate of wages, and that he should keep their accounts entirely, and that I should in nowise interfere either with the hiring or discharging them—I never knew what the rate of wages agreed upon was, I did not know many of the men by sight—he had an office in which he had a double desk, through which office every workman had to pass who came to work on the premises—he occupied that desk for the first few weeks, or I think for some months, himself; and he eventually had a clerk—that clerk was the prisoner Douglas—I did not engage Douglas, Mellish engaged him—he told me that he knew a very clever clerk in Birmingham, whom he had known all his life, and whom he could rely upon, and he would send for him—after he had done so, he told me who he was—I knew nothing about him before—I allowed him to hire a clerk—after Douglas was hired, he and Mellish occupied the double desk—I believe Douglas at first had between 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and I think Mellish afterwards rose them to 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Mellish fixed them and rose them—some time after Douglas came, an adjoining room was fitted up for Mellish, and called his own private room, where the accounts and vouchers were always kept by him—he had boxes for that, purpose—amongst the workmen engaged by</p>

               <p>Mellish there were a class called glass-cutters and mounters—they worked on the premises—there were also several out-door workmen engaged—they did their work out of doors, and were paid their wages by Mellish at the factory—he delivered their work out from the factory, and regulated the price paid for it—he received it back again himself, and inspected it—there was a wages book kept from the time of Douglas coming as clerk—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in Douglas's writing—it contains the names of the men that Mellish hired, the days on which they attended, and the number of hours they attended—at the end of the week the number of hours were added up by Douglas, and entered in another column, and the amount they had earned was put—this book laid always on the desk of Mellish, and was in his custody—it was his duty to ascertain the correctness of the amounts charged in this book, and he always quoted it to me as a proof of the cheap<lb></lb>ness with which he got the work done—he referred to it in that way—this hook had, once a week, to be taken to Mr. Dean, the cashier, and if Mr. Dean was satisfied, he would have to give the moneys for the amount—at the end of each week, every man's name being down here, and the number of hours he had worked, the sum due to each man was put down in the column, that was added up, and every Saturday they were paid—the men received some on the Wednesday, but on Saturday the whole was paid, and Mellish sent for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he wanted it—I have repeatedly heard from Mellish that that was the mode in which the business was done—I knew generally what the course of business was with reference to this book—I knew from Mellish.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you arrange with Mellish what the course of business should be? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I understood that he superintended the wages book—the men were paid weekly under his direction, and whatever was wanted at the end of the week he instructed Douglas, and between them they got the money from Mr. Dean, and paid the men; that was entirely, as I understood, under Mr. Mellish's direction—I was daily at the office where this book was kept.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you seen this book on Mellish's desk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes! fifty times at least; time out of mind: I have seen it open—I have seen Mellish sit at this book with his pencil in his hand, going over it, over and over again—I did not give Mellish any particular instruc<lb></lb>tions with reference to it; it was his own book, and he managed it in his own way—I did not* know of any double vouchers being kept, until I detected these frauds—Mellish was entirely answerable for the accounts of the workmen—he had the sole control over it; nobody else had anything at all to do with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, at different times, speak to him about how the business was going on? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After some months had elapsed, I found a very great expendi<lb></lb>ture was taking place—I repeatedly spoke to him on the subject, and he always told me that if I would wait until the Exhibition opened, it would be proved that he had expended the money properly, and it would be all right; that there was no doubt at all about his management if I would only give him time—that was what I was always told by him—I discovered these frauds in conse<lb></lb>quence of receiving a private letter—I made an investigation, and the result was that Douglas was given into custody—the boxes in Mellish's private room were searched, and a great many papers were found there—after exa<lb></lb>mining them Mellish was given into custody, and was ultimately committed and tried with Douglas, who at that time pleaded "Not Guilty."</p>

               <p>the time Mellish entered my service I was in partnership with Mr. Varnish and Mr. Cookney—I believe Mr. Varnish attended to the commercial part of the business, and to the accounts until Mellish came—Dean came into my service as accountant in the spring of 1850—up to that time Mr. Varnish had attended to the accounts—Mr. Varnish was examined at the last trial, I believe on the part of the prosecution; I was in Court and heard him exa<lb></lb>mined—I saw him here just now—I am not aware that I knew Mellish at all before he was recommended by Mr. Powell, but I am not sure whether Mr. Lund, of Cornhill, about the same time, did not introduce him; which had the precedence I do not recollect—I had been trying experiments in the silvering of glass twelve months before I knew him—I tried some experi<lb></lb>ments afterwards—I had no dispute with him before he went away—I took out a patent conjointly with him—when the patent was taken out, it was understood that Mellish was to give up the patent to me for a consideration, and that was never carried out; he on two occasions refused to do it—he refused to sign an agreement which Mr. Cookney prepared—I am not aware of more than one—that was about six weeks or a month before he left my service—when Mellish came into my service he had premises of his own in Great Portland-street—I am not prepared to state whether he carried on my work there—I believe he did not carry on any work there on my account—I have been to his workshop in Great Portland-street when I first knew him—the workshops were not kept at his own place in Great Portland-street for many months; on the contrary, as soon as I knew him he had works put up on our premises—they were put up immediately Mellish came there—Mr. Varnish used not to attend to this more than me—a number of Mellish's tools and men were removed from Great Portland-street, I believe immediately we got to Berners-street, as soon as the shop was erected; it was not more than a few weeks—he was to go to Mr. Powell's glass works to superintend the preparation of the glass for silvering—that continued all the time he was in my service—every evening, at 8 o'clock, he was supposed to go down there to superintend the workmen—that would take him an hour, or an hour and a half—I have been there myself occasionally—I do not know how long it would take him; as soon as the pattern is made, I suppose the work is done—I suppose there might be twenty or thirty workmen under him, and some<lb></lb>times, I believe, as many as forty—the arrangement with me was, that he was to relinquish his own business in Great Portland-street when he came to me—how far he carried that out I never understood—he had the general superintendence of the workmen on the premises, as well as the out-door workmen—after some time I established a shop in Regent-street for the sale of these articles—it was arranged that Mrs. Mellish should go there, with a relative of hers to assist, or a person whom she knew—it was one of the stipulations that Mellish should go and live there—it was principally at his suggestion that the shop was taken—it was carried on, I think, in Mrs. Mel<lb></lb>lish's name; Mr. Varnish principally arranged that—I had nothing to do with the taking of it, but I did not object to it—Mrs. Mellish was there twelve or eighteen months, up to the time of Mellish leaving in May—she was not paid anything in money for her services; it was understood that she was to have the house, and candles and coals, rent free—Mr. Varnish made the arrangement—the goods were invoiced to her—when they left, Mr. Var<lb></lb>nish settled with them—I have been in considerable practice—when I com<lb></lb>menced this business I resigned Westminster Hospital, where I was one of the principal surgeons, and I relinquished a great portion of my practice to attend to this—I still carried on my practice, but in a very limited manner—I</p>

               <p>know that while Mellish was in my service he went twice to Paris with Mr. Varnish—he also went to Birmingham and to York, at the banquet, to super<lb></lb>intend some things that I had sent there—that was, I think, somewhere in Oct. or Nov., 1850—I do not recollect attending him on one occasion when he had met with an accident to his leg; I do not recollect any accident—I do not recollect attending him for anything at all serious—I did not live it the premises in Berners-street—I live about four miles from town—I do not know whether Mr. Varnish has come among my witnesses to-day—he has received no communication from me—I have seen him here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a glass cutter, and live at 9, Duke-street, Lin<lb></lb>coln's-inn-fields. I know Mr. Mellish—I worked for him when he was in business on his own account at Pimlico—that was a long time ago—he told me, when I worked for him in Portland-street, that I was to go to see him at Mr. Thomson's—I cannot say when that was, I never kept any account; it might be two years ago—I went, and agreed with him for the price of my work—I cannot state at what part of the year I first began—Douglas was not there when I first went, or when I arranged the price—the first time that anything was said to me about the two accounts was by Mr. Thompson, after Douglas was taken into custody—I see my signature to this bill of 22nd Feb., 1851 (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I did that work, and this is the amount I received—I suppose I must have received it on that day—I always received my money on a Saturday—on that Saturday I received 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot say whether Douglas or Mellish paid it me—I cannot say whether they were both present—these are the prices that I agreed for with Mellish—this other account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my writing—this purports to be for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and bears date 22nd Feb., the same as the other—I receipted both this and the other—when I signed this second one it was only for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been added since—I do not know these initials (<hi rend="italic">these two accounts were marked "A"</hi>)—these three (<hi rend="italic">marked "B"</hi>) all bear my signature—I receivesd 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on that occasion—they bear date 15th Feb., 1851—one of these purports to be for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I signed it, and the reason of that was that Mr. Douglas, when I went there a fortnight after, said, "Suttie, I have lost one of your bills, it was for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think, I won't be sure; I will make it out, and you sign it," and I signed it—these others are my two hills that I made out—I do not believe Mr. Mellish was present when I signed the one for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the initials at the corner were not on it when I signed it—these two bills (<hi rend="italic">marked "C"</hi>), dated 12th Oct, 1850, both bear my signature; one purports to amount to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there has been a"9" altered—that was made out in the same way as the last; it was made out for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot say whether I gave two accounts then—I did not give two accounts, I believe, until Douglas came—I believe he had come at that time—I always gave two accounts after Douglas came—when I signed the receipt that now purports to be for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it was for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. only.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> There are some receipts, I think, without the initials of Mr. Mellish, are there not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe so—I have looked through them all, over and over again—there are several—many of them have the initials of Mr. Dean, the cashier—I have not seen any of them since the last trial—this one of 19th July, 1850, has Dean's initials, "B.D."—that means that those initials were to be placed on the bills of Lee before they were paid by him, as a sanction that he had paid them—I cannot say whether Dean's initials are on all the bills—I believe not on all, but I cannot ay positively—I have seen several of those that have "T. R. M." on them, and examined them with the books—I cannot say that I have examined the whole of them—I have examined very many—some may have escaped me—I believe the object of Dean's putting his initials on those receipts was to verify to the firm that they were paid by him—I believe Mr. Varnish gave him directions as to what his proper duties were—he engaged him—I never had any conversation with Dean as to what he should do—Mr. Varnish was the principal person in engaging him, and I believe settled his duties—I believe Mr. Varnish did not settle the whole matter with reference to what receipts were to be given, and what initials were to be put upon them—I believe the whole of the receipts for the work of the glass cutters in and out of the establishment were arranged entirely by Mellish—I never heard from Mr. Varnish that it was arranged between him and Mellish that there should be two vouchers—I have never heard that from Mr. Varnish—for eighteen months the business was carried on by vouchers before I ever heard of it in any way, before I knew that vouchers had been demanded by Mellish of the workmen at all—Mr. Varnish and Dean attended to the accounts—Dean never told me that vouchers were presented to him until very nearly the period at which Mellish left the business—about six weeks before Mellish left there was an inquiry as to the vouchers, and that was the first time I had the slightest idea such a thing had been carried on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I ask you distinctly whether Mr. Varnish had not the whole superintendence and management of the accounts and the vouchers over Mellish and over Dean? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my knowledge and belief, Mr. Varnish had nothing whatever to do with them—Mr. Mellish was the sole and entire person who engaged the people, fixed their wages, received their bills, and superintended their payments, and I believe Mr. Varnish knew nothing whatever of the concern so far as that went—his business was the out door commercial duty, to go into the City to see people who might require the manufactures, and to deal with merchants and others, to recommend the silvered goods, and to treat it as a mercantile affair—Mr. Varnish never told me that he knew there were two vouchers till about six weeks before Mellish leaving the concern—I have stated before that within six weeks of Mellish leaving the concern, the subject of vouchers came before the partners, and it was not till then I heard of any such thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not said, in your examination in chief, "I had not been informed of two bills up to the time of Douglas being given into custody?"</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I bad not been informed of two special bills—I meant to confine it to information that came to me then—I have since received communications from different workmen of which I had no conception—there were some books kept by Dean, of which I bad no knowledge—I believe I knew all the books that were kept by Douglas—to the best of my knowledge, I knew at the time what books were in his possession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever go over the books whilst Mellish was in the employment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I frequently saw the wages book, and the book in which the diagrams were drawn as patterns I frequently saw, because it was essential that I should see them—I saw the wages book at least fifty times—I looked at the pages, and saw what was entered—I saw it continually before Mellish left—I have no doubt I have seen the cost price book, but I cannot say that it came within my inspection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any knowledge at the time of the quantity of work done by the persons out of doors, to enable you to detect any errors, or did you rely upon Mellish? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I hired Mellish entirely to do that work, and I trusted to him implicitly—I hired him to conduct and manage the business, and I implicitly relied upon him—I had no other authority to rely upon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk and cashier to Mr. Thompson, and was so at the time Mellish was in his service—it was my duty to examine the wages book with the documents, and then pay the amount of the wages over to Douglas to disburse to the men—he came to me on the Saturday for a sum, which was his estimate of what the wages would come to—I gave him that sum, and on the Monday the wages book was produced to me, and I saw whether it was right or not—I knew nothing myself of the value of the work, or of the nature of the engagement of the men—Douglas was the person who produced the wages book to me—he was also in the habit of bringing me vouchers with it, that was so from the commencement—I required those vouchers, and checked the wages book by them, that is the out door work—after examining the vouchers, I marked them—all these vouchers produced, except five, have my initials to them—I am not able to account for those five, not having them—I have referred to the wages book with the accounts that I marked—I referred to it weekly, and I have looked at it since—these sums are entered in the wages book as paid to the men—I find Mellish's initials upon some of these vouchers; that was to assert the correctness of the account.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that by your desire, or how did it happen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot recollect the circumstance, it was not so from the commencement—after it commenced I should not knowingly have passed any vouchers that did not have his initials—it is the larger sums that appear throughout in the wages book.</p>

               <p>own satisfaction—Douglas merely brought me those vouchers—I compared them with the book, and finding them right, put my initials, without looking for Mellish's—I sat in an entirely different part of the premises—all Mellish's papers were left behind when he went away—this account of Lee's, dated 19th July, 1850, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., has my initials, that is merely a reference to the wages book—it has not Mellish's initials—I merely looked at the wages book, saw that the entry was there, and then put my initials—these receipts that were produced to me may not all be in Douglas's writing, but the greater portion of them are.</p>

I come from the gaol—I was formerly in the furniture line—I am twenty-five years of age—I first knew Mr. Mellish about fourteen or fifteen years ago—he knows my family—my mother is alive, he knows my mother—I have a brother and two sisters, he also knows them, and has done so as long as he has known me—they are in respectable positions—they were residing in London at the time I first went into the employment of Messrs. Varnish and Thompson—I was then down at Birming<lb></lb>ham conducting a house in the furniture line; Mr. Mellish wrote to me to come up—my family had not communicated with me before that—I came up, and Mellish engaged me; I was to have 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week at starting—some time afterwards it was raised to 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I attended to the wages book, and the cost price book, and a petty cash book—I have pleaded guilty to the present indictment for forging this receipt (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I recollect this receipt being signed by Suttie: it was then for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it was altered by me to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the initials "T.

               <p>I generally filed those bills—there was no direction given on the matter—it was about two days after the detailed bill was got that I pat it on the file—in the meanwhile it would be lying in Mr. Mellish's room, or on his table—it was first given to Mellish to examine, to see that the items were correct: in the first place he would have to see that the charge was correct—the party was under an agreement with him for the drilling of these goods at a certain price, and I was obliged to appeal to him to know that the price against each item was correct—Mellish had to see that the work was accurately and properly done; he would have to see that the charges were correct according to the agreement; it was placed on his table for that purpose—he used to hand the detailed bill to me, signed, with this, in order for me to make a true entry; both of them remained on his table till the wages book was made up, when I took them both away; the short bill, or memorandum, was gives to Mr. Deane with the wages book—when I took them off his table they both tallied with the item book—as soon as I had taken them away from Mr. Mellish's table, the short one was altered to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I then made the wages book up, and gave it to Mr. Deane, with the short bill, and the detailed bill was then placed on the file—Deane used to return the abort one to me with the wages book in the course of the day, after he had ticked off the wages book with the vouchers, and the wages book with the short vouchers was then left on Mr. Mellish's table—they remained there, and in the course of the day I should have them myself, and place them in my own desk—the short bills would remain, and in the course of a week or so they would be put on the same file—Mellish never got any part of the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I got by altering this receipt—there are some other receipts for this description of work, which have been altered in the same manner—all these receipts signed by Mr. Suttie (<hi rend="italic">looking at several</hi>) have been altered by me; Mr. Mellish did not know that I altered them—he did not get a farthing out of the additional sum which I got by altering them—these receipts (<hi rend="italic">looking at others</hi>) have all been altered by me—Mr. Mellish did not know that I had altered them; he did not receive a farthing of the proceeds—I recollect his leaving—I think there were one or two receipts, which I altered after he left—I was taken into custody in Oct.; I was still in the employment of Mr. Thomson—I was examined at the police-office before Mellish was taken; Mr. Lewis was acting as my attorney then, and after Mellish was taken he was feed for us, but he did not appear.</p>

The prisoner was a boy that lived with me a fortnight; I had a recommendation with him. I missed money at different times out of the till. On the 20th of June I marked ten shillings; I put them in the till; the next morning I missed them. I immediately followed the prisoner to the kitchen, and demanded the money that he had broken open my bar and robbed me of. He told me he did not break open my bar; he had only pushed up the shutter, and he had only robbed me of a few halfpence; I told him to produce them, which he did; he produced the halfpence. I told him I wanted the silver. He pulled out a purse; I turned out of the purse from nine to twelve shillings, in shillings and sixpences. I told him that was not the money. I thought it was my money, but it was not the money I wanted. He turned to a cupboard, and brought me some shillings; seven of them were the marked money. He said he was very sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did he bring out of the cupboard - A. Eight or nine; seven of them are the marked money. This is the marked money; there is a little dot upon it, marked with a nail. The prisoner said he hoped I would do nothing more with him than discharge him.</p>

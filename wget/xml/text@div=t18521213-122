                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Lawrence Levy and others—the prisoner was also in their employ, and was about to leave last Friday—in consequence of something I made a communication to Messrs. Levy; and as the prisoner was leaving about half past 2 o'clock on Friday, he was called into the counting house where I and Mr. Levy were—Mr. Levy taxed the prisoner with robbing the firm; he denied the charge, saying he had carried an inch of stuff off the premises—Mr. Levy asked if he had any objection to his seeing what he bad in his pockets; the prisoner made no objection, and said we might search him if we thought proper—he then pulled some trifling things out of his pockets which were not. our property, and then Mr. Levy put his hand into his coat pocket and drew out these two pieces of lining (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner said they bad been put there in a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> by some of his fellow workmen, and he knew nothing about them—I do not know that he said they "<hi rend="italic">must have</hi> been put there by some of his fellow workmen," he might have said so—an officer was then sent for; he came, took off the prisoner's hat, and found this piece of black cloth in it—the lining of the hat was turned out; the cloth turned put with it—I suppose it was under the lining, but I cannot say—the prisoner said he knew nothing about it; it must have been put there under the same circumstances as the lining—this is the cloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it has the buyer's mark on it—I cannot swear to the lining, but we have a great deal like it; it is an article generally used in the trade.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 564). I was sent for, and found the prisoner in Mr. Levy's counting house. Mr. Levy stated that the prisoner had been robbing him—the prisoner said he had not; that the piece of lining must have been put in his cost for a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>, or villany, on the part of some of his fellow workmen—I then took off the prisoner's hat, and found in it this piece of black cloth—the prisoner said it must have been put in his hat for villany on the part of the men, and he did not take any notice of the weight of bis hat, because he was in the habit of carrying a bottle of beer in it.</p>

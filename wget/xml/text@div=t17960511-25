               <p>I am servant to the prosecutors, who are the proprietors of Sadler's Wells; I have lived with them thirty years; a fortnight before Easter, I engaged the prisoner as a <rs id="t17960511-25-deflabel125" type="occupation">lamp-lighter</rs>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing further of the matter? - A. I was present the second time he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110087"></xptr>searched, on Tuesday the 26th of April, and he had a tin thing tied round his body full of oil.</p>
               <p>Q. That oil you could not ascertain to be your masters? - A. In all likelihood it was, because the prisoner was not off the premises all the day, only to the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had any oil about him in the morning when he came? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He might have oil in the morning for what you know? - A. He might, but it is not reasonable he should come to <placeName id="t17960511-25-crimeloc126">Sadler's Wells</placeName>

               <p>Court. Q. Could the bringing of oil in the morning be of any use at all? - A. No; I used to pay him 18s. a week for lighting the lamps.</p>

               <p>Q. How much might it contain? - A. I suppose five pints, and seven pieces of candle in his pocket.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of the parish: On the 25th of April, I went to the public house, and saw, in the false ceiling, in the privy, three tin cans full of oil, and I had a suspicion they were stolen from Sadler's-Wells; I went and spoke to the Manager, and he desired me to watch it; the next morning, Mr Hughes and I both watched the prisoner; I saw him come out of the oil-house, and come up the yard, and went through this public house to the privy; I saw him put something out of his pocket, but I could not tell what, it was a great way off; I went and looked, and found it was the same, three bottles again; I watched to see who took them away, and saw the prisoner go and take these three bottles of oil away.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you stand to watch him? - A. About twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you where you could not be seen? - A. I was in my own parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you, from your own parlour, see him take out the oil? - A. I could see him go to the place and take something; I immediately went out of my own house into the tap-room, I stopped him and took him down to Mr. Hughes's, with the three bottles of oil upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see whether they were gone from the privy? - A. Mr. Carter had marked one of them, and that one was found upon the prisoner,(produces them).</p>


               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never took any oil but what Mr. Gyland gave me; he gave me, I suppose, about a gallon, at different times, and I deposited them in that place to take home for my own use.(The prisoner called four witnesses who all gave him a good character.)</p>

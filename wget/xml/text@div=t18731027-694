                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Artillery Place, Woolwich—on Tuesday morning, 28th October, I was walking in the Borough between 1 and 2 o'clock—the prisoner came up to me and said "Good night, dear; are you going for a walk?—I said "I don't mind"—we went down the Borough, and through Suffolk Street—we turned again into the Borough, and when we got there, he suddenly struck me in the face, and snatched my purse out of my hand—it contained a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, a farthing, a pawnticket, and three songs—I have not seen it since—he struck me in the face, and thinking he was going to hit me again I put my hand up—he tried to strike me a second time, and I found my earrings were broken—I then cned out "Police!" and ha ran round the corner and got away—the police<lb></lb>man came up and I made a complaint to him—I never saw the prisoner before—I saw him about an hour and a half afterwards—the policeman brought him to the Glass House in the street where he struck me—I am sure he is the man—he had no waistcoat on, he told me so while he was walking with me—he had a kid-glove on his left hand (<hi rend="italic">glove produced</hi>)—that is the glove.</p>

Last Tuesday morning I was on duty between 1 and 2 o'clock in Lant Street, Borough, near William Street—I heard cries of "Police!—I came up and saw the prosecutrix, she was crying, and she made a complaint to me—I looked about with my lamp for a short time to see if I could see her purse—I could see nothing of it, and about an hour and a half afterwards I saw the prisoner in William Street—he was roving about, very drunk—I turned the lamp on him and saw that he answered the description that the female gave—he had one glove on and no waistcoat—I took him to the woman, I turned the lamp on him, and she said "That is the man"—he pretended to be very drunk, and did not take any notice at all of her—he walked very well to the station.</p>

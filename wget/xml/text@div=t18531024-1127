On Monday, 19th Sept., at a quarter before 10 o'clock, he went out—he said he was going to the shop to get some work, and he would be back in half an hour or three quarters of an hour—he did not come back—I went to look for him—he afterwards brought in the work, six dozen of chairs, and he went out again with the intention of asking the master for some money to get some materials—he did not come home, and I went out; I think it was then about half past 10 o'clock—I found him at the Spanish Patriots, in the Lower-marsh—his mother and one or two friends were there, and they were having some beer; I bad some beer, and he and I came out of the house together—I said to him, "George, willyoucome home to breakfast?"—he gave me a shilling, and said he should be home in half an hour—he went into the public house—he asked me to come in; I said I should neither come in nor go home, I should stop outside—I stopped out about five minutes—I then went in, and stopped about ten minutes—I had some beer with my husband and his mother—I asked him to come home to his place, as the children wanted their breakfast; he said 1 was to go home, and give the children their breakfast and have mine, and he would come home in about half an hour—I said, "I will not go out till you do come"—I asked him if he would come out, and go towards the Westminster-road—he did, and we went to a house in the Westminster-road with another man, of the name of Barnes—J changed the shilling my husband had previously given me, and we had a pint of beer—we drank the pint <hi rend="italic">of</hi> beer, and we all three came out and came down to the Cut, and went to the Spanish Patriots again—my husband said he should go in with his mother—I went in with him, and stopped a little while—he said, "You had better go home to the children, and have your breakfast;" I said I would not go till he came—he said I had better <hi rend="italic">go</hi>, as I had left the baby so long; I said I would not go till be came—he then asked me to give him the 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and he would go and give the children their breakfast, and bring the baby to me if I would stay at the Spanish Patriots—I said if the baby cried ever so much, I would not go home—he said if I would give him the 10yd. he would go and fetch it; I said, "No," I would see him d—d first, and he lifted up his foot and kicked me in my back part, in the private parts—I had only my shift and gown on, no petticoats—I felt pain—some one went with me to the doctor—I was taken to the hospital; I remained there a fortnight—I was not sensible when I got to the hospital—when I came to myself I felt weak, but I felt no pain in the private parts—I bled much from my private parts—I had been confined six weeks that day.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You have sold saw-sets of different sorts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the only person who serves in your shop? - A. Me and my son; but that was stolen out of the window by my vise-bench.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those screws of your own make? - A. No, they are made by one Watson, of Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you venture to swear that he only makes such for you? - A. I can shew his handwriting, where he says he does not.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot I in many shops get screws of this sort? - A. I rather think not; they are certainly my property; they are turned under as it is called; the saw-set is my own make, and is not such as are sold, it being figured, and is only used by sawmakers; I have no difficulty in swearing to it, because it is not finished.</p>

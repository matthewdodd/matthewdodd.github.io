                  </hi>. I live in Granada-place, Old Kent-road, and am a baker. On 8th Dec. the prisoner came for two halfpenny currant rolls—my wife serried him; I stood by the side—he laid down a shilling—my wife said, "Young man, this is a bad one"—he said, "I think not"—she showed it to me—I bent it in the detector, and then beat it with a weight—I made such a mark on it as to know it again—the prisoner told me, and my wife, and the policeman, that he had it given to him for carrying a box—the police<lb></lb>man did not know the prisoner, and I let him go—I told my daughter to tell the policeman to throw the shilling in the road—I saw it thrown—I after<lb></lb>wards saw it in my house; I knew it again by the mark I had made on it—my children had it about the house till it was taken by the policeman—I am quite certain it was the one I had defaced.</p>

On Monday, 5th May, about two o'clock, I was on duty in Drury-lane—I saw two persons whom I knew—I and another officer watched them—I believe they saw me, and they separated, one went one way and the other the other—I followed one of them into a house—I went up-stairs, and saw the man whom I had followed and another man, come out of the two-pair of stairs front room—I went into that room, and saw Joseph Farrell in bed undressed, and Ellen Farrell was walk<lb></lb>ing about the room with a child in her arms—I saw shillings, and sixpences on the bed—I was going up from the foot of the bed to get the money, and Joseph Farrell kicked me with his feet as I was going up—with his kicking the clothes went off him, and his feet came up to my breast, and Ellen Farrell held me by the back of my hair while Joseph Farre He was swallowing the coins—while he was kicking he took up the coin and swallowed it till it all disappeared—I cannot tell how many handfulls he took up, there were several pieces of coin—I told him to get up and dress himself, for I should take him into custody—when he had dressed himself I pulled up the bed<lb></lb>clothes, and one shilling, and one sixpence fell on the floor—I took up the sixpence, and Ellen Farrell picked up the shilling—she gave it to Joseph Farrell, and said, "Here <hi rend="italic">Joe,</hi> here <hi rend="italic">Joe,</hi>" and he took and swallowed it like a pill—when I took up the sixpence, Ellen Farrell said, "Never mind; he has only got the b y <hi rend="italic">tanner</hi>"—I said I should take them both to the station—I took Joseph Farrell, and my brother officer took Ellen—after taking them to the station, I returned to the same room with another officer—I searched the room, and found two packets in a tub in the room; there was some dirty linen, and napkins over the packets—one of them contained forty sixpences, and the other twenty shillings.</p>

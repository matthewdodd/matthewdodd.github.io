                  </hi>. I am the son of the last witness. I was assisting him on Saturday night, 31st March; the prisoner came and bought some mutton, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some halfpence; she gave me a coun<lb></lb>terfeit half crown and a good shilling—after she was gone I found the half crown was bad—I was there on the Saturday night afterwards, when she came and asked for some pork—I had not got it, and she had a bit of beef—I handed it in to my father to weigh, it was 5 lbs., and came to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she tendered a crown piece, which she took from her left side—I did not notice any paper—I desired my father to show me the crown, and I found it bad—I told the prisoner so, and showed it her—she snatched it out of my hand; I laid hold of her hand directly, she would not give it up—an officer came and took her hand with the crown in it—my father produced the half crown, and said that she had passed it the week previous; she denied it—the constable took the crown from her hand at the station—I saw a mark on it near the rim, where I had bitten it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

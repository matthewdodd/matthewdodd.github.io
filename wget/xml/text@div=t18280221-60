I was then in possession of the bill I now hold in my hand: I had it is my hand, and said to the prisoner "Mrs. Myers, your son has brought me this hill to be discounted, it is drawn by yourself on Walker, Parker, and Co., for 488l. 2s. 2d.; is this correct" - she answered</p>
               <p>"Perfectly so; we sold them a lot of pig-lead for it, and if you wish to be further satisfied, Daniel will throw open the book and show it to you;" Daniel opened a book on a desk, which was placed against the window: it was a common waste book, with only a brown paper cover; he turned over to July, and there I saw an entry between Parker and Co. and Mrs. Myers.</p>

            , on behalf of the prisoner, here admitted a notice to preduce her books, and tendered four.</p>
               <p>Witness. Neither of those are the book - it was made out of a quire of paper, and merely a waste book; I saw an entry, dated the 28th of July, to the amount of 488l. 2s. 2d., for so many cwts. of pig lead - it corresponded in date and amount with the bill; I said, "I am quite satisfied;" I took Daniel home with me, and gave him a bill on the same parties, for 397l. 3s. 4d., due the next day, and the balance, 82l. 16s. 2d. I think, after deducting the legal interest, 8l. - I was induced to take the bill, from the representation of Mrs. Myers, and her alone - I would not have discounted it, but from her representation.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT ANDREWS. Q. Have you been many years in business? A. Since 1814 - I first commenced in the wholesale way, as a manufacturer; I keep no shop now - it is a private house; I do not carry on any other business; a great portion of my business is in bills - I give credit, and take bills - I occasionally discount - Messrs. Curtis and Co. are my bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the day were you at Mrs. Myers'? A. In the fore part of the day - it was before dinner, certainly- when I first went up to the warehouse, there was a boy there, and Daniel told him to go - I should think it was about twelve o'clock that I was there; Daniel said to the boy, "You may go down," and he went down before the business began; Mrs. Myers does not live at the warehouse, but I believe it communicates with her house - I was never in the warehouse before; I do not know the boy's name; I most likely should know him again, if I saw him - I suppose he was not more than nine or ten years old; I produced the bill open, in my hand; Mrs. Myers did not take it in her hand - she had no spectacles on; I said, "Mrs. Myers, your son has brought me this bill to be discounted, drawn by yourself, on Walker, Parker, and Co. for 488l. 2s. 2d. is it correct?" she answered, "Perfectly so - we sold them a lot of pig lead for it: if you wish to be further satisfied, Daniel shall show you the book," and it was shown - I said I was fully satisfied; I took Daniel over to my house, and gave him the money; the book was laying on the desk in the same room - it laid outside - I had no occasion to notice whether it was on the desk when I went into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure it was not fetched from a distant place, by the boy? A. Certainly not - the book might contain more than a quire of paper, but I should suppose not; I saw no writing on it; Mrs. Myers stood by it - I do not know whether she looked into it; I went from Parker and Co's. to her; Daniel Myers asked for Mr. Parker - his name was sent into Mr. Parker's private room, and Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210067"></xptr>Parker came out - I have seen Mr. Parker since, and it was him - Mrs. Myers was taken up about four months after - I found her at the Mansion-house, on a Thursday, I think; she was remanded till Monday; I cannot say whether she went there of her own accord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you before you saw her there, that if there was any suspicion, she would be there to make her defence to it? A. She never said so to me, nor in my presence; Mr. Charles Isaacs attended at Mr. Gates', and said Mrs. Myers would be ready to make her appearance whenever it was necessary; Mr. Gates told me of that on that morning; Mr. Elias Isaacs attended there, as my friend, not as my solicitor; Mr. Gates attended as solicitor; when a remark was made about a Jew witness, Mr. Isaacs interfered, in a manner that was creditable; I always considered Mrs. Myers a woman of substance; I should think her brother, Mr. Joseph, is a respectable and substantial man.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK here declined proceeding further in the case.</p>

               <p>Have you ever promised this man any favor, if he would make a confession? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Have you ever threatened to punish him if he would not confess? - No, I have said, whoever had the ring, had better give it to me at once.</p>
               <p>By that you gave him to understand you would be milder, if he confessed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen the ring since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Not in the state in which you lost it, I believe? - No.</p>
               <p>Who produced it to you? - Mr. Phillips the Jew.</p>
               <p>- ALDUS sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What are you? - I am a pawnbroker; I live in Berwick-street, Soho; the first time I saw the prisoner at the bar, was, on the 8th of June; he came to my shop in the day-time with a ring, and said, he wanted half-a-guinea upon it.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - Very genteelly.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - I cannot tell exactly.</p>
               <p>Was not he dressed in livery? - I do not know; he said he wanted half-a-guinea upon it; I saw it was a ring of value; and I said how came you by it? he said, my name is Grant; and I keep a house in Tornstile, Holborn; there was another man with him; and he said, you need not have any hesitation about it, it is Mr. Grant's ring.</p>
               <p>So he said he wanted no more than half-a-guinea upon it? - Yes, and he said he lived at No. 1, Turnstile, Holborn; seeing it a ring of value, I desired my servant to write a duplicate, which he did; he took the half guinea, and I ordered my servant to go with him, and see that he lived there, and kept the house, and that his name was Grant; he did go with him, and he came back again, and said his name was Grant, and that he kept a tobacconist's shop there.</p>
               <p>The ring is a ruby, set round with diamonds, is it not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now what is the worth of it? - It is not worth more than four guineas.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, is it worth less than ninety guineas, and will you venture to swear that it was of less value than ninety guineas at the time it was brought to you? - Upon my oath I did not think it worth ten.</p>
               <p>Then upon your oath, will you swear that at the time it was brought to you, it was of less value to sell in a silversmith's shop, and of less value in workmanship than ninety guineas? - I do swear that.</p>
               <p>Court. You lent only half a guinea upon it? - No, I thought it was a garnet set round with diamonds; it had very much the appearance of a garnet, set round with bad diamonds; this was on the 8th; on the 22d, the second time I saw the ring, my servant was selling of it to Mr. Jacobs; it then was my own.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present? - No, my man will inform you it was sold to Mr. Jacobs for six guineas; I saw it sold; it was marked at the window for six guineas.</p>
               <p>How came you to mark it at the window for six guineas? - My servant will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120149"></xptr>tell you; he will inform you that the prisoner sold it to him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Had you bought it? - My man bought it.</p>
               <p>Did it hang at your window marked? - It was marked at the window six guineas; it had been bought of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>How long had it hung at the window marked six guineas? - No more than part of the day.</p>
               <p>Had it been marked before that day? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you first discover it was marked six guineas? - The day it was bought.</p>
               <p>Then you knew that the same morning it was marked six guineas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath, after this man went out of the shop, did you not call him back again, and press him to sell it? - I never saw him, till I saw him with the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Then it was bought without your knowledge? - It was.</p>
               <p>You had given no directions to your man to give four guineas for the ring if he should come? - No.</p>
               <p>You had never consulted together about it? - No.</p>
               <p>Then he gave the four guineas for it without consulting you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And afterwards marked it six guineas without consulting you likewise? - Yes; I was not at home at the time he bought it.</p>
               <p>Is it usual in the course of your trade to let your servant buy a thing that has been pledged without more enquiry, and then six a price upon it without consulting you? - It is done.</p>
               <p>Is that the course of your dealing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long has he lived with you? - He has lived with me above ten years, and I have lived there above twenty.</p>
               <p>Is the course of your dealing, when a man pledges something for half a guinea, that your servant is authorised to buy it for four guineas, and afterwards to put any other price he pleases upon it, and put it into the window to sell? - It happens frequently.</p>
               <p>Then it happens frequently that when a thing is pledged for a small sum, your servant afterwards buys it for a larger price, and without consulting you, puts a price upon it, and hangs it at the window to sell? - It does happen.</p>
               <p>Does it happen frequently? - It does happen, but I do not recollect such a thing these three or four years.</p>
               <p>Has it ever happened since this man lived with you? - Yes, he has bought things.</p>
               <p>Has he bought things pledged for a small sum, and afterwards put any price he pleased upon it without consulting you? - It has been done.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it the course of your dealing? - It is the course of the trade.</p>
               <p>Tell me whether this is the course of your dealing? - I come here to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>My question to you is, Is the course of your dealing in your shop, that when an article is pledged for a small sum at your shop, it is afterwards bought by your servant, and a price put upon it without consulting you? - It is done.</p>
               <p>Is that the course of your dealing? - It is the course of the trade, but it does not happen very frequently.</p>
               <p>You have said, you do not recollect an instance of the kind within the last three years; now will you venture to swear that there has been an instance of the kind within that time; will you swear that? - No, I will not; things have been pledged, and bought afterwards very frequently.</p>
               <p>Has such a thing been bought by your servant, and afterwards sold without consulting you? - Yes, he has.</p>
               <p>He has, then, without consulting you how much profit he ought to put upon it, put any price he pleased upon it? - It has been done, and is done commonly in business; I presume Mr. Heather does so.</p>
               <p>Is it done in your shop? - It is of course, but we do not do it now.</p>
               <p>This is but two months ago, recollect a little? - There is an act of parliament<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120150"></xptr>lately passed, which says, that all things unredeemed of the value of above ten shillings, shall be sold by auction.</p>
               <p>Is not this a single instance within the last three years? - We have bought things, but never any thing of the value of above ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Recollect an instance now; it does not often happen where a diamond ring was treated in the same way? - I have not bought a diamond ring, nor my man for some time.</p>
               <p>Then you have not bought a diamond ring for a long time past except this? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Has he ever brought a diamond ring in his life? - I do not recollect he has; all the articles of above ten shillings have gone to the auction for the last year.</p>
               <p>Why did not that go to the auction? - It had not been pawned long enough, you observe that is after the twelvemonth is expired.</p>
               <p>Then for the last year you have not bought a dimond ring? - I do not recollect that I have; I am no great judge of them.</p>
               <p>Has your man ever bought one before? - I do not recollect he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Who did you sell it to? - Mr. Jacobs.</p>
               <p>That day you bought it? - That very day; I did not buy it, I sold it the same day for six guineas; I thought it to be a garnet ring.</p>
               <p>How much did your servant give for it? - Four guineas.</p>
               <p>Did you know he gave four guineas? - I was not there when it was bought.</p>
               <p>Give me an answer, yes or no; did you know before it was marked six guineas, and put up in your window for sale, that your servant gave four guineas for it? - I had seen it by the books, and he told me so, but I had not seen the books before.</p>
               <p>When did it come to your knowledge then that it was bought for four guineas? - I was come home, and it was while Jacobs was buying it, that was the first time I saw it after it was bought.</p>
               <p>I understood you had seen it up in the shop, and seen it marked for six guineas? - I saw the paper upon it.</p>
               <p>Before Mr. Jacobs came into the shop? - Not before, but at the same time.</p>
               <p>When did you see the mark first upon the ring? - I came in, and Mr. Jacobs was then in the shop bargaining for it; I was in the parlour, and my man came in to me, and says this ring Mr. Jacobs offers six guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Before that moment that your man came in to you, and told you this, did you know that six guineas was marked upon the ring? - I went into the shop, and saw the paper on it.</p>
               <p>I will have an answer to the question; and I will not quit you till you give me a direct answer; before your man came into the parlour to you to tell you that Jacobs had offered six guineas for the ring, did you know that six guineas was marked upon that as the price of it? - I did not know that before then, because I went into the shop, and saw the paper that came off it.</p>
               <p>Did you know before that moment that four guineas was given for the ring? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you think it worth six guineas? - I did not, but I asked six guineas for it.</p>
               <p>What did you think it worth at the time? - I thought it was not worth above five guineas, or some where there away.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do you mean to tell me that you thought it was not worth above five guineas? - I thought six guineas was a very good price for it.</p>
               <p>Did you think it worth six guineas? - I thought it was a pretty looking ring; I thought it was a garnet, set round with brilliants.</p>
               <p>Did you think it worth six guineas? - If he had offered me five, I should have taken it.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it worth six guineas upon your oath? - Upon my oath I did not.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell me just now, that you did not think it was worth more than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120151"></xptr>ten pounds? - I do not recollect saying that.</p>

               <p>But you did say so; now tell me what you meant by saying that you did not think it was worth more than ten pounds; you said you did not think at the time it was worth more than ten pounds, what did you mean by giving that answer? - I thought it to be a garnet; I did not think it was worth ten pounds; I did not think it was worth six, and I would have sold it for five.</p>
               <p>You said it was not worth more than ten pounds; I asked you this upon your oath, was not this ring worth ninety guineas, upon which you answered that you did not think it was worth more than ten pounds? - It was not worth ten pounds; I did not think it was worth five.</p>
               <p>Was not you surprized that Jacobs would give you six guineas for it? - No.</p>
               <p>What occasion had your man to come, and ask you any questions about this ring, or the price, if Mr. Jacobs offered as much as was marked upon it; six guineas was marked upon it; he had no occasion to consult you if Jacobs offered as much as was marked? - He offered five guineas first, then five guineas and a half, and he came in to tell me.</p>
               <p>My question to you is this, if Jacobs offered what was marked, what occasion had your man to come in to tell you; why did he not sell it without coming in to tell you any thing about it? - He offered five guineas and a half, and he came in to ask me if he should take less than six; Mr. Jacobs said it is a venture whether I get a guinea or lose a guinea, and I will give you six.</p>
               <p>As he had worked himself up to give the six guineas, he had no occasion to tell you that? - I was there then; then I went into the shop.</p>
               <p>Did not you say just now that your servant came in to you in the back parlour, and said, Sir, Mr. Jacobs has offered six guineas for this ring, and that was the first time you knew it to be marked six guineas, and the first time you knew any thing about it? - You misunderstood me.</p>
               <p>Did you say so or not? - No answer.</p>
               <p>Did you say so in course of your evidence or not, that the first time you knew of its being bought for four guineas, or being sold for six, was when your servant came in to the parlour to you, and said, Sir, Mr. Jacobs has offered six guineas for this ring? - That was not the first thing he said, he said he has given six guineas for it.</p>
               <p>What was the first thing he said when he came into the parlour? - I am sure I told you exactly.</p>
               <p>Tell it again, a man can always tell the true story? - I have been in this Court before, and I have had the thanks of this Court many times.</p>
               <p>But you will no have them now, I assure you; my question is, what was the first thing that your servant said when he came into the parlour? - I think the first thing he said when he came in, was, that Jacobs had given six guineas for the ring; Jacobs was in the shop bargaining for the ring, and I was called out; he said Jacobs had offered five guineas, or five guineas and a half, but that he had agreed to give six guineas; then I went into the shop, and saw the mark upon the counter.</p>
               <p>Court. Did your servant consult you before he told you the ring was sold? - No, my Lord, that is the first I heard about it.</p>
               <p>Then you knew nothing about it, till he told you he had actually sold it to Jacobs? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the first thing you heard from your servant about Jacobs was, that he had sold him the ring for six guineas? - Yes, that was the fact, that Jacobs had given six guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Was Jacobs gone out of the shop at the time? - No, I do not think he was, perhaps we were all three in conversation together.</p>
               <p>Did you see Jacobs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then Jacobs was not gone out of the shop; because you say the first thing you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120152"></xptr>heard was, that he had given him six guineas for the ring? - I believe that was the first.</p>
               <p>Was Jacobs gone out of the shop? - When he came to tell me so he was.</p>
               <p>Did you see Jacobs? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see Jacobs after your servant told you so? - No.</p>
               <p>What did not you know it before? - He said Jacobs was in the shop looking at the ring; I went into the shop, and saw the mark upon the counter six guineas, and Jacobs looking at it, and Jacobs said five guineas, or five guineas and a half was sufficient; I was very busy with other people in the shop.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to Jacobs about it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know Mr. Jacobs before? - Yes, he has dealt with me very often; he has dealt with every one in the trade I believe.</p>
               <p>Has he dealt with you often? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How lately? - I cannot recollect; it is his trade.</p>
               <p>It was very lucky that he should come by just at that nick of time? - Somebody else would have had if it he had not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Jacobs sell it afterwards? - I never saw it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear afterwards that Jacobs sold it, and to whom? - I heard no more of it till the 21st of July when Mr. Hyde sent word about it, Mr. Hyde asked me if such a thing had not passed through my hands, and I told him that I had had it from Mr. Grant.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath, did not you send to Jacobs to buy this ring? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that it was not worth above five or six guineas? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that Jacobs sold it for fifteen? - I heard so when the prisoner was taken up, never before.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you know enough of this ring to be able to tell me what is the value of it? - I believe it is worth ninety guineas.</p>
               <p>Did you buy it yourself? - No, it was given to me by Sir

            's lady.</p>
               <p>Have you been at the East-Indies? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the value of diamonds? - I have had a great many in my possession.</p>
               <p>What is the lowest value you conceive can be put upon this ring? - The Queen's jeweller is here, and he will tell you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Aldus. Do you mean to swear positively, that after this man had pledged this ring, he was not called back, and told that it would be better for him to sell it? - I do swear that I never heard any such thing pass.</p>
               <p>Court. When you really got six guineas for that which you had on that day received for four, had you no suspicion that the ring was stolen? - No.</p>
               <p>Not when you got six guineas for a ring for which you had given only four, and which had been in your custody but a single day, and from a passer by merely looking at it in your shop, and being willing to give six guineas, had you no suspicion it was stole? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Do you expect the Jury to believe that? I had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to the prisoner as being the man that sold this ring? - That is the man, I described him at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did he keep a house? - He had a house unknown to me in Turnstile, Holborn, when I took him; I never knew any thing but that he was a single man till three months afterwards.</p>
               <p>Aldus. He had his name on the door.</p>
               <p>Did you know that he kept a shop before you missed the ring? - No, nor did I know he was married man, and had a house.</p>
               <p>- CROUCH sworn.</p>
               <p>(Examined by Mr. Garrow.)</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am servant to Mr. Aldus.</p>
               <p>When did you first see the prisoner at the bar? - On the 8th of June.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120153"></xptr>On what occasion? - In the afternoon, he came in with another man to pawn a ring for half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Was your master in the way? - He was in the shop; I took the ring of him first, and asked him if he knew the value of it; he said it was a ring of value, but he wanted only half a guinea upon it; at the same time my master came up, and looked at the ring, and he desired me to write a ticket for half a guinea, and to go home with the prisoner, and see where he lived; he gave me a direction at No. 1, Turnstile, Holborn, a tobacconist's shop; accordingly I wrote a ticket, and went with him, and seeing his name on the door, I gave him the ticket, and the half guinea; I knew it was his house by his calling his wife out, and asking her if some people had been there, which I cannot recollect; seeing me come in, she asked me to come in, and drink tea, which I refused.</p>
               <p>Court. Who asked you that? - His wife I suppose.</p>
               <p>Is there any reason besides that, why you suppose he kept the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon that you gave him the duplicate, and away you went? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it very odd that a man who kept a shop in Turnstile, Holborn, should come as far as Berwick-street, to borrow money, and then suffer a pawnbroker's servant to go back with him to his house, did not you think it strange? - If we have any doubt of any body we do it.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you had a suspicion? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If you have a suspicion, you go home with the party? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now if I was to come to your shop to pledge a diamond ring, should you want to go home with me? - Not if I knew you I should not; if I did not know you, probably I should.</p>
               <p>Did you suspect this man? - No further than to go home to see that it was right.</p>
               <p>What made you suspect him? - I had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>Then why did you go home with him? To see that the direction was right.</p>
               <p>What if you did not suspect him, you might have taken his word you know; do you walk home with every body that comes with a half guinea pledge? - If they are things of value.</p>
               <p>Then its being a thing of value, made you suspect him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What value did it appear to be of? - I thought it was worth four guineas and a half, or five guineas.</p>
               <p>Had you gone home with any body in the course of that week? - I cannot say, most likely I had.</p>
               <p>Tell me whether that happened or not? - I dare say I have.</p>
               <p>So he left the ring for the half guinea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon did you see him again? - On the 22d of June.</p>
               <p>How was Grant dressed at the time he came to pledge the ring? - Just as he is now; he had on a jacket I believe.</p>
               <p>Was there nothing else remarkable in his dress? - He was just as he is now.</p>
               <p>Had not he a laced hat on, with a cockade in it? - I believe he had.</p>
               <p>A round hat trimned with lace, and a cockade in it? - I believe he had.</p>
               <p>He had a jacket on too? - I believe he had.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was not it a riding jacket? - It was made in the same way I believe.</p>
               <p>Go and look at it? - I do not think it was so long.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see he was a servant? - I supposed he was.</p>
               <p>Then let me ask you this question, did you ask him to whom he was servant? - No.</p>
               <p>Why did not you? - I thought it was not necessary as he kept the house.</p>
               <p>A servant bringing a diamond ring of value, the first thing you ought to have asked, was to whom he was servant? - I did not think the ring of any such value, as it turned out to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120154"></xptr>You said before you thought it to be a ring of value? - Yes.</p>
               <p>If you thought it to be a ring of value, and believed him to be a servant, why did not you ask him to whom he was servant? - I took every precaution I could.</p>
               <p>There cannot be a doubt, but that the most obvious precaution was the moment that you saw he was a servant, to have asked him to whom he was servant? - Servants have very often very costly things, and it did not occur to me.</p>
               <p>Servants do not usually wear diamond rings? - He said it was his own, and that he had it with his wife when he married her.</p>
               <p>Court. You said that he told you that his wife kept a shop there, and that he went there? - Yes, he told me that in the hearing of my master.</p>
               <p>Why did not you say then, you have two directions, and you live somewhere in service with somebody else, did not ask that? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you not say; pray Sir where do you live besides? - I went home to see where he lived.</p>
               <p>Why did not you ask him who he was livery-servant to? - I thought he was a livery-servant out of place.</p>
               <p>Now upon your oath, did not the man tell you not to tell his wife of it? - No, Sir, he did not; when I was going home with him, he said three or four young women were come out of the country to see him, and he desired I would not expose him to the young women, as he did not wish them to know he had pledged the ring.</p>
               <p>Did not he desire you not to say any thing about it in the hearing of his wife? - No.</p>
               <p>How came he then to have a laced hat and a cockade on, if he was a livery servant out of place? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he tell you he was out of place? - No, he said he only slept at home; and I thought if that was his house, it was his own ring.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to tell the Jury that you thought it was probable that a servant should have such a ring as that? - I certainly do; I thought it had been his wife's.</p>
               <p>Jury. He has laid great stress upon his caution; I would wish to know if it is usual to send a person home? - We very often do.</p>
               <p>When did you see the prisoner again? - On the 22d of June.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you seen Mr. Jacobs in the mean time? - Often; Jacobs called almost every day; these Jews that deal in these kind of things, go their round very often, and come and ask if there is any thing that suits them.</p>
               <p>They don't look about at the windows? - Yes, they look at the windows, almost always.</p>
               <p>How lately before had you seen Jacobs before you bought this ring? - I might see him that very day; may be not for a week.</p>
               <p>After this pledge had been sold to you, how often did you see Jacobs? - May be every day.</p>
               <p>How often? - I cannot pretend to swear that.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you see him on the 20th? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>On the 21st? - I cannot say; if I did, he did not see the ring.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was he not there on the 21st? - No, Sir, he was not; I have got the receipt for the ring in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Let us look at the receipt; was not Jacobs there on the 21st? - Not to my knowledge; he might be, very likely; he generally calls every day.</p>
               <p>You are sure you had not shewn him the ring? - No.</p>
               <p>On the 22d the prisoner sold it to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What passed? - He came and fetched it out of pledge.</p>
               <p>Court. What time of the day did he come? - Between eight and nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>What did he do when he came? - He came and fetched it out of pledge.</p>
               <p>What did he say, who saw him? - I.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120155"></xptr>Was any body present besides you? - One of our men.</p>
               <p>Was your master? - No, he was out; he came in about half an hour after it was fetched out.</p>
               <p>Court. What did the man say when he came in? - He gave me the duplicate my Lord, and I went and fetched the ring, and he paid the principal and interest.</p>
               <p>Out of his pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much did the principal and interest amount to? - The principal was half-a guinea, and the interest two-pence, or twopence halfpenny.</p>
               <p>After he had paid the principal and interest you gave him the ring? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What passed next? - He asked me if I would buy it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Without any thing more being said by you? - Yes; on which I asked him how much he asked for it; and he said six guineas; and I offered him four pounds for it, as I thought the diamonds were not worth above four pounds, or four pounds and a half, or five pounds.</p>
               <p>How much did you allow for the ruby and the gold? - I did not know it was a ruby; I offered four pounds; he said, he would not take it, and he was going out of the shop, and I offered him four guineas.</p>
               <p>He went out of the shop and returned again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who called him back? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Then he came back of his own accord? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Without being called or beckoned by you or any body? - Yes, he came back and said he would take five pounds for it; but he begged I would keep it an hour after I had bought it, in order that he might see whether he liked to have it back.</p>
               <p>Then you agreed for it and bought it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much did you give for it? - Four guineas.</p>
               <p>You wrote a receipt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is this the usual way of writing receipts? - Yes.</p>
               <p>"Being my own property;" is it usual to state it to; do you always put that in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he left it with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now what did you do with it? - I kept it some time, and then marked it, and put it up in the window for sale.</p>
               <p>How long did you keep it first? - I suppose an hour, or an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>What mark did you put upon it? - Six pounds six shillings.</p>
               <p>Did your master come home first? - He did not come home till after I had marked it, and was going to sell it to Jacobs.</p>
               <p>How long was that before your master came home, and after it was marked? - It might be an hour or two, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What time of the day did Jacobs come? Between one and two.</p>
               <p>What happened between you and Jacobs? - My master was in the back parlour when Jacobs came in, and asked me to let him look at the ring that lay in the window.</p>
               <p>Had you told your master that you had bought it? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had you told him that you had marked it for sale? - No; Jacobs offered five guineas for it; I told him I could not take less than six guineas; at that time my master came out of the parlour, he heard me bargaining with Jacobs, and he came out himself.</p>
               <p>Now when he came out, what did he say to Jacobs? - He looked at it, and Jacobs said he would have it at that price.</p>
               <p>That was all that passed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When Jacobs first came in, your master was in the back parlour? - Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>He came out seeing you dealing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You were then behind the counter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never left the counter with the ring? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You staid there shewing it to Jacobs? - I was serving other people as well.</p>
               <p>Then Jacobs was never in the back parlour with your master about the ring? - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120156"></xptr>went into the back parlour to my master, just after Jacobs had bought the ring; I forgot that.</p>
               <p>How came you to forget that little circumstance; for what occasion did you go into the parlour? - To call him out to look at the ring.</p>
               <p>Then your master came out and Jacobs gave six guineas for it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to put this in the window without consulting your master, and to put six guineas upon it as the price? - When we buy a thing, we always do so; it is the course of the trade.</p>
               <p>How many diamonds have you marked in the course of the year? - Many-a-one; I bought diamond rings in the same way, in the last year; I do not say large ones, but small ones.</p>

               <p>Court. Has your master never known you have marked those diamond rings afterwards? - Yes, when they are sold.</p>
               <p>Then you sold them too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But your master has known it after they are sold of course? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What value of diamond rings may you have bought in the course of the last twelve months; how much have you laid out in diamond rings? - I cannot pretend to say; not to a very large amount, smaller or greater; I suppose to the value of ten pounds; if you please, I will fetch the book.</p>
               <p>Court. Could we have the book, are you sure that the number of rings you have sold are in that book? - Yes; we have a bought, and a sold book; but I cannot tell exactly when the last begun; it began, I believe about four or five months ago.</p>
               <p>Count to Aldus. Give a note, that all your books of bought and sold plate, and other things for the last three years, may be brought here for the inspection of the Court and Jury.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Aldus did so; but the books did not arrive till after the trial was over, and therefore they were not looked at.)</p>
               <p>Now Mr. Crouch, you see we have got to this, that within this last twelve months, you have bought diamond rings to the amount of about ten pounds? - In the shop; not me alone.</p>
               <p>I want to know during the last three years, how many diamond rings you may have bought, and in the absence of your master? - I do not know that before the last twelve-month I bought any.</p>
               <p>Court. How many have you bought during the last twelve-month? - May-be five or six pounds worth, may-be three or four.</p>
               <p>Have you bought any? - I bought one last week.</p>
               <p>How many had you bought before this thing happened? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>I ask you how many you yourself bought and sold without your master's knowledge? - I may have bought, three, four, or five.</p>
               <p>Before you bought this of the prisoner? - With that.</p>
               <p>How many had you bought before that of the prisoner? - Two or three.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you have bought any? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you have bought one? I believe I have.</p>
               <p>How many have you bought? - I cannot pretend to say.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you have bought any since this? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you bought any before you bought this? - Most likely I have, but I cannot identify the man.</p>
               <p>You swore readily enough just now; take care what you say; you are now very near being committed for perjury? - We have bought many diamond rings, and marked them for sale within the last year, and sold them without consulting my master, but he has been consulted afterwards, and the other man has bought other things.</p>
               <p>Then you have bought some? - I have bought one last week.</p>
               <p>Now between the 8th of June 1786, and the 8th of June 1787, how many diamond rings have you bought without the knowledge of your master? - I cannot recollect that; I and the other man have bought rings.</p>
               <p>Now hear; will you swear, that you and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120157"></xptr>the other man in the absence of your master, have bought any diamond rings, between the 8th day of June 1786, and the 8th day of June 1787? - I may have bought one; I cannot recollect; I shall see when the book comes.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you mean by saying we have bought many diamond rings, and marked them for sale within the last year? - When we buy them we always marked them.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have you and the other man, or either of you, in the last twelvemonth, from June 1786, to June 1787, bought any diamond rings in the absence of your master? - I cannot recollect; your Lordship will see the book.</p>
               <p>Court. You have told the Court and the Jury you have bought many diamond rings, and marked them for sale, and sold them, without consulting your master, that is to account for your so doing; now, I tell you fairly, if you have not so done, I shall commit you for perjury; let us know whether you have done so or not? - I have told you every thing I recollect.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you recollect that you have not bought any diamond rings in the absence of your master? - No Sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>And that this is the first you ever bought? - I think it is not.</p>
               <p>When you buy them you always take a receipt? - We always set that down in the book.</p>
               <p>Don't you take a receipt? - Always.</p>
               <p>Have you ever took a receipt for a diamond ring in the absence of your master? - Never but once since; small spark rings I have bought.</p>
               <p>I ask you between the 8th of June 1786, and the 8th of June 1787, have you bought diamond rings of any sort, little or large? - I have bought stone rings.</p>
               <p>Have you bought diamond rings? - I cannot recollect I have.</p>
               <p>Have you ever bought any diamond rings of any body besides this man? - It is impossible to recollect.</p>
               <p>Can't you recollect whether you ever bought one in your whole life before this? - I think I have.</p>
               <p>You said just now, that you had bought a great many in the course of the last year, to the amount of about ten pounds? - In the course of business I have bought a great many diamond rings.</p>
               <p>Rings that have been pawned? - Very seldom.</p>
               <p>Have you bought them without the knowledge of your master? - Many things we buy I don't recollect, as to the diamond rings, I may not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have you ever bought and sold any without the knowledge of your master? - I don't know that I have.</p>
               <p>Have you ever bought any in the whole course of your life till you bought this? - I cannot recollect: Yes, I have bought some, but you confound me so much that I am not able to give you an answer.</p>
               <p>I ask you, Sir, and I will not confound you; upon your oath, did you ever buy, a diamond ring in your life before the 8th of June 1787? - I cannot recollect, I think I have.</p>
               <p>Will you have that taken down as your answer; you are not confused now? - I think I have.</p>
               <p>You said just now that you could not recollect you ever had; but when you saw my Lord astonished, you said, yes I have, which is the answer? - I think I have.</p>
               <p>How lately? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>You said you never bought any till within this twelvemonth, between June 1786 and June 1787; have you ever bought a diamond ring? - I cannot recollect, I think I have.</p>
               <p>If you have bought any, how many do think you have bought? - Not many.</p>
               <p>You must recollect it, if it is a single transaction? - I cannot recollect it; I have taken many in pledges.</p>
               <p>Have you ever sold any without consulting your master? - I have sold many diamonds.</p>
               <p>Did you ever mark one? - Yes, such as come back from the sale.</p>
               <p>Without consulting your master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120158"></xptr>But you have sold a great many? - Some.</p>
               <p>How many within the last twelvemonth? - I cannot recollect that.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, has there been a single diamond ring bought in your shop by any body during the last twelvemonth? - I think there has.</p>
               <p>Between the 8th day of June 1786, and the 8th day of June 1787, has there been on diamond ring bought by any body in your master's shop? - I think there has, but I cannot swear it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear you think you have? - I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Upon the oath you have taken, has there been a single diamond ring bought by any body in your master's shop between June 1786, and June 1787? - At the sale there has.</p>
               <p>Have you bought any in the shop? - I cannot recollect; we have several diamond rings now lying in the window of my making.</p>
               <p>Court. You say that there have been diamond rings bought and sold between the 8th of June 1786, and the 8th day of June 1787, you seem to speak doubtfully; then if you speak doubtfully, I want to know why you answered that gentleman so positively and readily this,</p>
               <p>"we have bought many diamond rings and marked them for sale within the last year;" why did you in the former part of your examination swear to it so positively and readily, and now have a doubt about it? - I said, I think I have.</p>
               <p>No; you said we have bought many diamond rings and marked them for sale within the last year, and referred to the books to prove it; now, another thing you have told me in your examination, that you told the Jew you would not take less than six guineas? - Yes, I told him so.</p>
               <p>That was the same day you bought it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You told me before that you thought it was of the value of four guineas, or four guineas and a half? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, if you thought four guineas was the value of the ring, and you had told the Jew that you would not take less than six, and the Jew thought it worth six, did it not immediately enter into your head that the ring must have been come unfairly by; - No, my Lord, it did not indeed.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, did you really believe that the man kept a shop? - Yes, my Lord, I did.</p>
               <p>Could he write? - No.</p>
               <p>Then if the man could not write, could you possibly believe that a man wearing a livery hat and cockade really kept a shop? - His name was on the door.</p>
               <p>Have you ever taken any thing of this man, before or since? - A pair of sheets, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Have you any thing in pledge belonging to him now? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Have you ever taken any linen of him? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear you have never taken any shirts of him? - To the best of my knowledge I have not.</p>
               <p>Court. The books are coming, therefore I caution you to be on your guard.</p>
               <p>Whether before the 8th of June, 1787, you ever took any thing of that man in pawn? - No, I did not, nor know his person.</p>

               <p>(Examined by Mr. Garrow.)</p>
               <p>You deal in jewels, I understand? - I do.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time buy a ring of Mr. Aldus? - I happened to pass Mr. Aldus's door on the 22d of June, and happened to look into the window, and there laid that there diamond ring that I bought.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the ring before? - No; seeing it in the window, I went in and asked the price; the price was marked on it, six guineas, and he said he could take no less, and after a long to do, I gave him six guineas for it.</p>
               <p>Who treated with you about it? - Mr. Crouch.</p>
               <p>What did you do with it? - I sold it to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120159"></xptr>Mr. Phillips for fifteen guineas; I sold it the Monday following; it happened to be a ruby; I am no great judge of these things, and I went to look for Mr. Phillips at the Orange coffee-house; he was there; I asked him if it was a ruby, he said yes; what is it worth? says I; says he I will give you ten guineas for it; says I, if you offer me ten guineas for it, it is worth more; finding I would not take it, he wanted to go half profits with me, but I refused that; then, says he, whatever you are offered by any body else, let me know, and I will give it to you; and I told him he should have it.</p>
               <p>Was this the same day you bought it? - I went to Mr. Phillips in about half an hour or an hour after I had bought it, but I did not sell it to him till the Monday.</p>
               <p>You heard from Phillips, the moment he saw it, that it was worth ten guineas? - He told me it was a ruby of great value.</p>
               <p>A little suspicion came into your head? - Yes, it was a suspicion that it was a ruby.</p>
               <p>But a little more suspicion I mean? - Did not you suspect that it was stolen goods? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You thought you had bought a very good bargain? - That is no rule; these things turn out cheaper or dearer; I did not buy it for a ruby, I will take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>You have been long acquainted with Mr. Aldus? - I am acquainted with all the trade.</p>
               <p>How much did you receive of Phillips at last? - Fifteen guineas.</p>
               <p>Did you know at any time that Mr. Aldus had any part of that fifteen guineas? - No.</p>

               <p>You have kept it all to yourself? - Yes; I have a large family to maintain, he never received any part of the fifteen guineas, no more than what I bought it for.</p>
               <p>You paid the money directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. Aldus upon the occasion? - Crouch went to ask his master if he would take the six guineas.</p>
               <p>Did Aldus see you at all? - I don't know whether he did or no, I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>You had some share in this good bargain? - I had.</p>
               <p>You bought this ring of Jacobs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is this the same ring you had of Jacobs? - Yes; it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>When did you buy it? - On the 22d of June; I was sitting in the Prince of Orange coffee-house when Mr. Jacobs came in and said, I have bought a ring just now, and I want your opinion upon it, whether it is a garnet or a ruby; I looked at it, and says I, it is a ruby, you may depend upon it, what did you give for it says I, says he, I have given six guineas; then says I, I will give you ten, says he, I am much obliged to you, but I do not want to sell it now, if you would give me twenty; then says I, if you have a mind to sell it, I will give you ten, and you shall go half profits with me, what it fetches; he said he would not take it, but he would give me the preference, in case he sold it; then, says I, all I beg is this, that you will let me have the preference, whatever any body offers you I will give a like price; this was on the Friday; he promised to give me an answer on the Monday following, at twelve; on the Monday he came according to his promise, and said he had been offered fifteen guineas; upon which I agreed to give him that sum, and bought it.</p>
               <p>Is not it a very capital ruby? - It is not, if it was, it might be worth three hundred or four hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>How much is it worth altogether? - Not thirty pounds; I have shewn it to the king's jeweller; I have shewn it to Mr. Rundell, and he would not give me thirty pounds for it; it may fetch forty pounds, but I would not give it.</p>
               <p>What are the diamonds worth? - Not above four guineas, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Then something about fifty pounds you agree it may be worth altogether? - I do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120160"></xptr>not know that any body in the trade would give that for it.</p>
               <p>Court to the prosecutor. How did you find out where the ring was? - I desired Mr. Mason, silversmith in the Strand, to advertise it; and immediately afterwards, a gentleman came to Mr. Mason, and said he had seen such a ring.</p>
               <p>Look at that ring, and tell me whether you believe it to be your ring? - I have no doubt about it; it was a ruby of that sort and size, and set in that manner.</p>

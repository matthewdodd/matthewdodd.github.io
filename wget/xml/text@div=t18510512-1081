                  </hi>. I am clerk to a merchant in Tooley-street. On 3rd March I was in the parlour of Neighbour's coffee-house, in Cannon-street, about half past eight o'clock in the evening; I had a great coat—this is it—it was hanging over the ledge at the side of the seat—I did not leave the room at all—I was sitting at the table talking to a friend—after I had been there half-an-hour I missed my coat—it had been close to me—I saw a man like the prisoner, there, but I could not identify him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at Neighbour's coffee-house. I remember seeing the prisoner in the parlour on 3rd March—I did not see him come in—when I went down about seven o'clock, he was sitting by the fire smoking a cigar—Mr. Shane came in between seven and eight—I saw him take his top coat off, and lay it across the end of the settle by the entrance of the parlour-door, as he was in the habit of doing—in twenty minutes or half-an-hour the prisoner shifted from the fire-place and came towards the door—there is a seat on each side of the entrance—the prisoner stood between the two settles, and leaned his arm over the coat—it is a narrow entrance, and I was coming in with a tray of grog—I said to the prisoner, "Allow me to pass"—in his moving be drew his arm, and the coat fell down on the ground, and as I turned round from delivering the grog I saw him walk out with the coat—I ran after him, but could not catch him—I had never seen him before—I am quite sure he is the man—he was quite sober.</p>

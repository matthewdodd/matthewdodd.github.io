Oakingham had a 6d. and 4 1/2d., and in his hat I found a pair of gloves - he began to sing - I told him they were charged with a highway robbery, which I thought affected their lives - the girls answered "Then we shall have a holiday at the tread-mill if it is so;" I took them to the watch-house, and, on returning to the Red Lion, the servant of the house gave me a red silk handkerchief, which I produce.</p>

On the evening of the 7th of November the prisoners came in between six and seven o'clock, and remained their drinking till between eight and nine - I went to the door just after eight, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070032"></xptr>saw a man come up - he opened the door, and walked in- he staggered about, and was drunk - the prisoners were then in the tap-room - the man looked round, and said,"I am done," and walked out - the prisoners could not hear that, as he was at the bar at that time, and they in the tap-room - he walked away towards London; there is a window between the tap-room and the passage - persons in the tap-room might have seen him come in - the prisoners went away about ten minutes after he went out; I went up the road in a quarter of an hour with the newspaper, and saw the two women run down the lane towards Gunnesbury-lane; I was just opposite to them: Hance said to Page, "Go it;" there was a man behind running after them; he was without a hat, and very muddy - he ran towards Kew-bridge in a different road to them.</p>
               <p>Q. How then could he be running after them? A. He was close behind them; I do not know what made him go a different road - when I delivered the newspaper he was in front of a house, and when I came back, I found him standing there - he was the man I had seen before in our passage - two men stood by the side of him - he was telling them something - he appeared very much intoxicated, and very muddy, as he had been falling down - his clothes were very dirty, and he had no hat on - his left breeches pocket was cut; the prisoners were all gone away then; he afterwards went into our tap-room, and slept at our house that night.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live at Brentford. On the 7th of November, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock at night, I was coming on the road from Chiswick towards Brentford - when I came to London-stile-lane I saw a short man standing with his back towards me, and, as I came further, I saw two women with a respectable man sitting between them on the bank of the road; I saw that the women had hold of him - he was without his hat, and I wished to speak to him, but my wife, who was with me, would not let me - he appeared very much in liquor; I went on about thirty yards further, turned round, and saw the man falling back against the bank, and the prisoner Page upon him; Hance was at his side; I said I would go back and see what they were doing - a gentleman came up, whom I asked to go with me; I went up at last, and asked the two female prisoners what they were at with the man, if they wanted to rob him, or what - they were on the bank then, but when I spoke they had got up - the man staggered nearly under the wheel of a waggon; I jumped into the road and pulled him forward - the women took him up in the path, and Page had hold of him; Hance pointed to her, and said to me, "Walker, it is her lawful husband;" I knew them both before; the people did not like to interfere, and we all went home leaving them there with the man - he said nothing to me; I said, "My friend, leave their company; they assuredly will rob you;" he appeared in liquor, and so did both the girls.</p>

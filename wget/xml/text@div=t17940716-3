               <p>I am a leather dresser. On Sunday before last, in the evening, about nine o'clock, as I was standing at my own door, I heard the cry of stop thief! and I went out immediately.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to know any thing about the hat? - Because some neighbour came up and said, there was something the matter with our little boy. When I asked the prisoner about the lad's hat, he said, what more do you want with me, if I let you know where it is? and he had not spoke the word hardly a minute, but a woman came and brought me the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing else? - No; but they took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He has spoke two or three words that are not right, about my shewing where the hat was.</p>
               <p>Clarke. He certainly did say it; I laid hold of his shoulder, and said, where is the hat? and he said what more do you want with me, if I let you know where it is?</p>

               <p>Last Sunday was a week I was coming over Stepney Green, about nine o'clock in the evening, or a little after, I saw the prisoner at the bar run or walk away from the little boy who belonged to the hat; immediately the little boy ran after him and called out stop thief! I had my wife with me, I desired her to walk on, and I would pursue the prisoner, which immediately I did, and stopped him, and searched him; he had no hat on him then; as I was bringing him to the watch-house, he sadly wanted to stop, and begged that I would go round a turning in order that he might find the hat.</p>

               <p>Q. Where is captain Scott's house? - In Stepney Green; and this man and two more coming by they stopped about five minutes, and the other two went up into a little place belonging to Mr. Jones's boarding school, and I spoke then to the prisoner, says I, this is very pretty music; yes, says he, it is; and then he took my hat off my head and went to the other two, and went down to the turning at the ship, and there he dropped it, and I went after him, and he went and stood behind a tree, and when I got close to him, as I am to you, I hallooed out stop thief! then this gentleman, Mr. Tipper, coming by taking a walk, he heard me cry stop thief! and he took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the manager of the gunpowder-mills at Houn<lb></lb>slow Health—they belong to charles Benwick curtis and other—there are three partner—they farm some land there, and, among them, a field sown with peas—the prisoner was originally their watchman; but, at his own request, was employed as a labourer, to drill peas. In consequence of information. I went along the road on the 13th of April, a little before six o'clock in the evening, and overtook the prisoner with a bag, about half a mile from our gate—I said, "No I have not, sir"—I put my hand on the bag and said, "I am sorry for what I have done; I have; I have done wrong: I only took a few peas to boil"—I said, "You have got a good many for that"—he requested me to look over it—I said could not, he must return with me—the pass were compared with those in the bin and corresponded.</p>

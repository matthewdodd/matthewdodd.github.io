               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>H. Urlander. I was a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>H. Urlander. In Newmarket-street. The prisoner wanted me to go into a house with her; she went in: I wanted her to give me my watch again, and there was a coal-heaver there who took her part, and told me if I did not go away, he would knock me down, so I was obliged to go away; I went into old Gravel-lane to get a watchman to take her up. I found one, but he would not go with me, then I went home; and last Tuesday I took her by a warrant, before a justice, and she was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the watch?</p>
               <p>H. Urlander. She has got it I suppose, I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor went by me with two women about ten or eleven o'clock; he had given one of them a handkerchief; I was at my door, which is opposite admiral Matthew's house in Silver-street. They were quarrelling about the handkerchief; he wanted it again, and the woman said she would not give it him, because he had been using her. He stopt at my door, and said let me come in, and pulled out a silver half crown, and said he would give it me if I would let him lie with me. I said, master go along, I have got a husband of my own, and pushed him from the step of the door, and shut the door; then he called out, you have got my watch: then a watchman came, and he told him a woman had got his watch; then I went out and said here I am, take me if you think it was me. The watchman to be sure would not touch me; I never hid myself, nor never saw the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Had you two women with you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No I had not, I saw none but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in a house with any woman?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you into that alehouse ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I went there to call for a pint of bear to drink with my landlord; I had used to go there now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. What company was there in the house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw none at all.</p>

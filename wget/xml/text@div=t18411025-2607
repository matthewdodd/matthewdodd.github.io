I think I hear it now!"—and he said, "I did not intend to kill either Mr. Burdon, or his wife; I did not intend to hurt them, or touch them at all; I intended kill my own wife, and then myself; and had not Burdon got up between me and my wife, he would not have been hurt at all; but after I stabbed my wife the first time, he got up, and the second thrust I intended for my wife took him"—I frequently cautioned him, and said, "You are not like an ignorant man, and of course know what you say I shall be obliged to repeat again"—this was about ten minutes to one o'clock, in the morning of the 26th of September.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's father, he is twenty-seven years of age—he has been brought up in my establishment in London—I am a Blackwell-hall factor—he had a very violent illness, when between four and five years old, from which he was not expected to recover—I observed a material effect produced on his constitution by that illness, so much so as to paralyse his limbs several times, at distinct periods—when he was recovering from the indisposition, he went down to the coast with my wife and family, and he would at times drop down, and his limbs be perfectly useless, and continue so for many hours—I can scarcely state, at this distance of time, at what intervals these attacks came on—he has not been subject to attacks in the limbs since he has grown up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He has grown out of that paralysis, but have you observed any effect produced on his mind, his intellect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We have ever considered and treated him so—his mother, his sisters, and in fact every body who knows him, considers so—he has been in a state which we considered as weak, and foolish in his remarks, and we could not get him to do as other children would do—we could not reason with him, we gave it up—we let him alone till his reason came to—in fact his reasoning facul<lb></lb>ties appeared at times to be completely gone—it remained so till he went to school, which was when he was between seven and eight years old—while he was at school I was sent for by the schoolmaster, to see how my son would stand by the wall when the other children were at play—I looked through the blind, and I saw him stand there for, I think, half-an-hour, while the children were all frolicsome and at play together—he left school, I think, as early as thirteen—he was brought up to my business, and lived with us—I have a paper with me, taken from my day-book, which proves his absence from business—it is from the day-book he en<lb></lb>tered goods in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what state has he appeared when he returned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Almost inde<lb></lb>scribable—his embarrassment of mind for a day or two would be awful in the extreme, and when he became composed, he would acknowledge he did not know what he was doing—I have reasoned with him quietly, knowing it was nothing but weakness—I have questioned him, and never could extract from him what he had done while he had been from home—he said, yes, he had been from home, and was very sorry, and would he very glad to be reinstated, which I am proud to say I have always done—I have never touched him in my life from his birth—he had a a pulpit-desk behind mine, in the warehouse, and at times, when I have come in, I have seen him agitated, some scores of times, with his eyes starting, and his lips quivering, and I have said, "Halloo, Robert! what are you about?"—he has looked and said, "Oh, papa! nothing parti<lb></lb>cular"—I venture to say that has been so scores of times, for the last five</p>

               <p>years—I can give no reason for that but what I have stated—he could not have been agitated in that way from any domestic feeling—there was always every attention paid to him, that he should never have question put to him at all at home—in 1835, or 1836, he attempted to make an arrangement for opening a brewhouse—he had not the least knowledge of that trade, or any means of carrying it on.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Except at the times you mention, his absence, and so on, was his conversation rational? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not, repeatedly it was not; I could not collect his meaning when he attempted to explain himself—when I asked him for an explanation of his conduct, and the way he had been going on—at other times, when living with his family, his conversation was rational—little aberrations of mind would drop in, but not such as I can relate—I always thought him very far from a strong mind—about five or six years since, I sent him into Somersetshire, on some particular business, and after being there about three days, when it ought to have taken him ten or twelve, to my astonishment I heard of his being at Birmingham—he had abandoned the object I had sent him for altogether, but, by way of a blind, to prevent my knowledge of his having been to Birmingham, he went back into Somersetshire to come back to London—I know that as a fact—I had sent him into Somersetshire for the purpose of extending com<lb></lb>missions which I held for the sale of cloth, and for the purpose of opening new accounts—I entrusted him with money to pay his expenses—he did not require much—when a gentleman goes into that part of the country they generally receive him from house to house—he returned, having quite abandoned my objects; in fact, he did not open a single account, or extend one—I think that was in the year 1836.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you sent him into Somersetshire, in order to extend your business and open new accounts, you of course thought he was competent to do that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was as much a disposition to let him see the necessity there was of paying attention to business, because I knew he would be kindly received, and to make a man of him—being twenty-one, I wished to introduce him, as a matter of course, but I certainly had more of hope in it than I had of the other—he is my only son now—I lost my eldest son when he was twenty years old—he left my house in April, 1841—that was before his marriage—there was no occasion for his leaving—I never heard either of his marriage or of the family till after it had taken place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From whom did you hear of the marriage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My son wrote to his mother, to say "I am married"—I have never seen him since till now, except one evening, when he passed my house.</p>

I have been acquainted with the prisoner's family about eight or nine years—in 1839, at the instance of his friends, I went down to Footscray, in Kent—I found him there—he told me he had come there to open a baker's shop—I saw the house he had taken for that purpose—it was a gentleman's cottage, with a garden in front, and a carriage-drive</p>

               <p>round it—he was not living at the house at that time, but at an inn in the village—the house was about three-quarters of a mile out of the village, and stood by itself—it was not a place in the least adapted for the busi<lb></lb>ness of a baker—I was shown the house—he was not with rue at the time I saw it—I spoke to him afterwards on the subject—I inquired of him what had been his motive in taking such a house to open a baker's shop in—his answer was, that he thought it very pretty—I afterwards walked up to the house with him, but did not go in—he admitted it was the house he had taken—I conversed and expostulated with him, for about two hours, on the folly of the proceeding—he seemed to have no know<lb></lb>ledge of the process of making bread, beyond the fact of its being baked in the oven, and he said he had engaged a bricklayer to build an oven in the house for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that he had obtained a loan from a gentleman in the City of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was his whole money to begin with he had spent 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. already in expenses, and he proposed to bake bread, and carry it to London in a cart, for which he would hire horses from a livery-stable keeper in London—I endeavoured to show him the impossibility of carrying out such a scheme, even at the first step, on the money that should remain after he had paid for the oven, and I asked him if he had any further prospect of money—he acknowledged that he had none, save a promise from the same gentleman, that if this could be proved to be bene<lb></lb>ficially employed, he might then advance him as much more, and that this was to be returned in twelve or eighteen months—I can hardly remember now what he said when I remonstrated with him, but he seemed utterly insensible, and unable to apply my arguments—I asked him if he meant to get credit for flour—he said no, but he thought any one would supply him with flour who knew he was going to open a baker's shop—I asked if he had any means of getting customers, if he had any connexion—he said no, but any one would buy his bread if he drove from door to door, and said it was baked in the country—I was not able to induce him to abandon the scheme, or to make any impression—he did not appear in the least capable of comprehending my reasons—I understood from him that there was no furniture in the cottage; the only articles he had purchased were some knives and forks, and, I believe, a coal-scuttle, or something of the sort—he did not say any thing about how it was to be procured—I then left him, and came to London—he had been acquainted with me for years—I think he remained at Footscray two or three days after I left him, because I found he had written to his family, at the end of that period, from Dorking, having gone there from Footscray—I went to Dorking, and he bad gone to Hastings—I waited at Dorking till he re<lb></lb>turned there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he was convulsed, describe what you mean by that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A violent nervous irritation in his limbs, and he stamped most violently; although this took place in the street, he stamped on the pavement with the utmost rage, gnashed his teeth, and his face became livid with rage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He showed strong marks of passion and resentment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What became of him after that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After endea<lb></lb>vouring for two or three hours to bring him to a calmer state of mind, I left him; I should perhaps state that he used a number of threats of the most ridiculous description, in one case stating that he would endeavour to tell dog's-meat in the street, and the next moment threatening to hang himself on a lamp-post before his father's door, and a number of speeches of that sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the opportunities you have had for some year of observing him, did his conduct appear to you that of a rational person, or the re<lb></lb>verse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Prior to the time I speak of, his conduct was usually sane, sufficiently sane; he was domestic and moral in his habits, apparently, and, from the opportunities I have had of seeing him with his family, he appeared to live on terms of the greatest affection with every member—that is down to the time I speak of—after that I have had no opportunity of observing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before that time you had no reason to think there was any aberration of mind about him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he appear to you a person of strong mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the time you speak up to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> October, 1839.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you seen him since October, 1839? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have only seen him twice in the street, but never to speak to him since that period—I have continued my intercourse with the family—I have seen them elsewhere, but have not been to the house—I have not conversed with him since.</p>

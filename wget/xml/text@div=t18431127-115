                  </hi>. I live in Norton-street. Between one and two o'clock in the morning of the 3rd of Nov. I was walking in Regent-street, and was accosted by the prisoner—after walking to the corner of Margaret-street, she put her hand round me—I felt her hand draw from my right-hand trowsers' pocket—I felt, and missed my money—I accused her of robbing me, and held her hand till the policeman came, and found a portion of the money in her hand—on the way she dropped a crown-piece, which the policeman took up—I then missed my pin from my stock—we had stopped at the corner of Margaret-street and Portland-street—this is my pin.</p>

I heard a cry, and came up—the prosecutor said he was robbed of a crown-piece, two half-crowns, and one shilling—I took the prisoner's hands—in one she had a half-crown, and in the other a half-crown and a shilling—we took her to the station—on going about 100 yards she said she would sit down, she would be carried—I in<lb></lb>sisted on lifting her up, and the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece dropped from her person—I took her to the lamp, and my brother officer took the pin out of her bosom.</p>

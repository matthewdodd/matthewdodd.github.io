               <p>On the 25th of June in the evening, as I was coming into my lodging, I was assaulted by the prisoner and robbed of my watch: I stop'd to make water in the court; she came up and asked me if she should assist me; I said I wanted no assistance; she came forward and thrust her hand into my left hand breeches pocket; I was buttoning up my flap, and she drew her hand across my breeches and laid hold of the chain of my watch; I clap'd my hand to it, but could not prevent her taking it; I laid hold of her; there was a man behind her, who immediately made off; she cried out that I held her so fast; I said she had taken my watch, and desired her to deliver it; she said she had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712150025"></xptr> taken it; I asked her who the man was that was with her; she said she did not know. A person that I knew happened to come up, and we took her to the watch-house; they told me to attend at Justice Durden's in the morning; I went, but the prisoner was not there; then I went back to the watch-house, she was not there; I went again to the Justice, and he said, perhaps they might have taken her before Justice Smith; I went to Justice Smith, and found she had been before him, but for want of evidence was discharged; she was not taken again till six months after. I am sure the prisoner is the woman.</p>

               <p>I am a sawyer. In December last, a Mr. Black pointed out the prisoner to me, and said she had robbed a friend of his of a watch, and asked me to speak to her about it; I went and asked her if she knew any thing of the watch; she said she did; I told her if she would produce it, she should have something more than it was pawned for, and no further trouble about it; she said she would get it.</p>

               <p>I was coming home one night at eleven o'clock, by the Pantheon in Oxford-road; Bruce had hold of the prisoner by the arms; he said she had robbed him; we secured her and took her to the watch-house. I am sure she is the woman.</p>

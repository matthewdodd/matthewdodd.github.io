             sworn. - I am a green-grocer, No. 10, Moor-street, Soho: On the 28th of January, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner asked me to lend him three shillings on his watch; I asked me to lend him three shillings on his watch; I asked him how he came by a watch; he said, his father had received his brother's prize-money, and had made him a present of the watch; I lent him the three shillings, and took the watch; about ten o'clock the same evening, he came and demanded another shilling; in the mean time I had been at a public-house, where I had seen him in liquor, and drinking; he said it was his, and his father would give him the money in the morning; I lent him another shilling; I began to be very uneasy, and I found out where his father lodged, and then I found that he had come by the watch in a clandestical manner; I then found the boy, and took him to Bow-street; I told him he had stole it, and he had better own where it was. (Produces the watch).</p>
               <p>Pearce. I know this watch by the number and name, it was made for me a great many years ago, and the outside case is wore at the knob; I can positively swear it is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The maid left the keys in the desk, and I took the watch.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

             is my partner. On the 24th of May, Dart and Douglas came into the shop between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and asked to see some lace; Markham shewed them three pieces - they bought nothing; they had not been in the shop, five minutes before Collins came in - I saw looks exchanged between them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182207030015"></xptr>and after Collins came in we missed a piece of lace - I said one of the three must have taken it; Collins denied all knowledge of the other two, or that she had taken it; they staid in the shop. Only three pieces were shewn to them, and there was no more within their reach. The officer searched them - I was not present then; the officer afterwards produced six yards of lace, which had our shop mark on it, and was one of the pieces which had been shewn them,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. They staid in the shop half an hour, though they knew it was missed - A. Yes. It was not on a card; I thought it might have stuck on their clothes, and looked, and am certain it had not; the officer brought it in from the street. Dart offered to be searched before the officer came.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for, and searched them, but found nothing; I searched Dart and Douglas more particularly than Collins. No conversation passed between them. I was in the room for quarter of an hour. It could not have been on any part of the outside of their clothes. I fetched Brown, who examined their shoes, but found nothing. We took them to the watch-house, that they might be searched by a female. I took hold of Collins, and kept her out of the regular pathway, to avoid the crowd. Somebody called out that it was found; the lace was produced; it was found in the way Collins went; the others did not go in that track. Collins was about three yards from the spot where it was found; the prosecutrix offered to let them go if they would give it up.</p>

            . I am an officer. Hill sent for me; I asked them all three to take off their stockings and shoes, which was done. I took Douglas to the watch-house; Bridges had Dart. I went out of the shop first, Bridges next, and Hill last, with Collins; I turned round to see where Hill was, and as Collins stepped off the pavement something dropped from her clothes which was found to be lace.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to the last witness; on the 1st day of December, I saw the prisoner M'Donald in my master's shop, it was between eight and nine in the morning, when he came in, he asked for a pair of stockings, I shewed him several parcels, he went out without buying any, the stockings were laying on the counter, twelve pair and an odd one, when he came in; and about half an hour after, we missed them, and between the time we missed them and the time of his coming in, there was nobody there.</p>
               <p>Did you see him take any stockings while he was in the shop? - No, I had no suspicion of him; then Mr. Archer went and gave information at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan, Prisoner M'Donald's Counsel. When was this? - The 1st of December.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you missed the stockings, that the prisoner was taken up? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>What, without the officer looking at you or giving you a single hint, or speaking to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is this a pretty public street? - Not very public.</p>
               <p>Had you breakfasted when the man that took the stockings came into the shop? - No.</p>

               <p>Did you butter them yourself? - No.</p>
               <p>Who buttered them for you? - The maid, she came without coming through the shop, there are two doors into the parlour, one into the shop, and one into the passage, I am very sure the girl did not come through the shop.</p>
               <p>Did none of your family go into the shop while you was at breakfast? - No.</p>
               <p>And will you say you never turned your eyes off from the shop during the whole time of breakfast? - I am positive nobody was in the shop.</p>

               <p>Was there any odd stocking with them? - No, here are nine pair which the prosecutor has looked at, and two were delivered to the prisoner's wife back, that were not owned; I carried the stockings I found to the office, they were advertized, and the prosecutor come and searched them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Morgan. What were the two pair of stockings that were returned? - Two pair of French ones, I returned them to Tatham's wife.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I hope you will do me the kindness to inspect into this matter; I have been very unfortunate, and am but young in business, and inexperienced; but I really had purchased these things in my shop, not knowing them to be stolen by different people.</p>
               <p>Court to Archer. Did you describe these things? - Yes, on Wednesday the 8th of February, the stocking trimmer, whose name is Thompson, gave me information, and I went with him, there were eleven pair produced, nine of which were my property, I knew them by the welt, and two letters, and a figure which distinguishes the quality; I am perfectly clear that they are mine, I am sure these stockings were in my shop on the night before the robbery when they were missed, they were there ready to be sent to the trimmers.</p>
               <p>Court. Describe the marks? - B. A. and 6. worked in the welt, the meaning of the mark is, when my father was in partnership, his name was Beckett.</p>

               <p>I was very ill with a sprained ancle, five weeks before Christmas, ever since the 28th of November; I had a letter from Counseller Pile in Essex, on the same day that the boy came up, when I was taken up, and he said he believed I was the man, and the man said, are not you sure he is the man, and he looked at him with a stern countenance, and he said, he was.</p>
               <p>Court to boy. You have heard what the prisoner now says? - I said, I was not very positive, but I believed it was the man.</p>

               <p>Macmanus. My Lord, the prisoner says I looked at the boy, and said, he must say it was him; when the boy went in the prisoner M'Donald was walking towards him, he went to the fire, and took the poker and stirred the fire.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was no poker.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was a poker, I saw him stir the fire.</p>

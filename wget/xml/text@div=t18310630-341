            . I am a Policeman. On the morning of the 21st of June, a little after one o'clock, I saw Holloway, (who has been tried,) in Phillips'-buildings, and watched him; he watched another constable who was on his beat in Isaac's-place, into the New-road - he stopped at the corner of Isaac's-place, and the prisoner came up and spoke to him; I followed him down Isaac's-place, and met Holloway with a sack, containing this harness - I collared him, and asked what he had; the prisoner then came up, and knocked me down; I was left insensible, and they both got away - when I came to myself I found the sack and harness by my side; I had known the prisoner for three months, and am positive he is the man - I apprehended him afterwards, and accused him of this; he said,"Stuff and nonsense, come and have a drop of gin, and let me go;" I knew him well - I have often been called into the Crown and Anchor to turn him out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q.Then you have had some scuffles with him? A. Yes: I never had a spite against him; I believe he and Holloway spoke to each other, but I was not near enough to hear - it was a nice star-light night, and there was a lamp just over; he resisted when I took him - I am quite positive of him.</p>

            . I am a carver, and live in Salisbury-street, Lisson-grove, Portman-market. On Monday night, the 20th of June, I saw the prisoner at the Goat and Compasses, Fitzroy-street; he was not out of my company till three o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is Salisbury-street from Chapel-street? A.Between one and two miles - my wife called at the public-house at half-past eight o'clock, and the prisoner carried my child home; I asked him and Lambert to go up and have some supper - we left the Goat about eleven; we made them a bed on the floor, and they were not out of my place till eleven o'clock next day - I have known the prisoner about twelve months - we had cold pickled pork for supper; we had had no fire for several hours; we had cold tea to drink, but no beer, for the houses were shut up - the prisoner and Lambert break fasted with us next morning; I lodge in the house; it was last Monday fortnight - I sat up till about three o'clock; I was never in custody, except for a noise in the street about four months ago - I was not detained.</p>

            . On the 20th of June I went to the Goat about six o'clock, and staid till about eleven; the prisoner and Cummings were there, and we went and helped Cummings and his wife home with their three children - he invited us to supper; we sat there till three o'clock in the morning, and had cold pork; we had beer to drink, and stopped all night - we had been at the public-house, but I had nothing but water at Cummings'; I do not know what the others had; they made up a bed in the front room, and Parkin and I slept there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Where do you live? A. In Milton-place. The prisoner is a carpenter.</p>
               <p>MRS. CUMMINGS. On Monday, the 20th of June, Parkin and Lambert supped at our house, and slept there; they remained there till eleven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did you get home? A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock; some beer was fetched from the public-house at the corner of the street for supper- I do not know who fetched it, as I was putting the children to bed in another room; I found it there when I came in, and drank some - we had no fire; I made tea about three o'clock, and lighted the fire then - there was some cold tea drank before that; they were smoking, and drinking beer.</p>

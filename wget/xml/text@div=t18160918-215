            . I lost this money on board a barge, with the prisoner. I went on board the barge, about two o'clock, and I said I was rather fatigued; and I lay down to go asleep. I had then in my possession two ten-pound notes. I awoke at about twenty minutes after four, and the prisoner then was on board the barge. I missed one of the notes; the prisoner was then with me; I told him I had missed it, and he said, that be damned, for there was nobody there but himself and me, and it could not be done. The Lord Mayor Shewed me the note again, and I knew it by its being the following number to the one I had in my possession.</p>
               <p>LEWIS LIVICK. I took a ten-pound note from the prisoner, on the 18th of July; be bought two pairs of speckled cotton stockings from me; he paid me with a ten-pound note.</p>
               <p>HENRY TURNPENNY. I apprehended the prisoner. I found on him eight one-pound notes, two pair of stockings in his coat pocket, and one pound eighteen shillings in his watch fob.</p>
               <p>William Appleby. I believe that to be my note.</p>

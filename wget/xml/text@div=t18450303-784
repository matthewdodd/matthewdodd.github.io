                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Hawkins. I was in the parlour on Saturday, the 1st of Feb., and saw Miller there about half-past six o'clock—he was going to have his tea—I had been undressing the child, and put its shoes and stockings on the cash-box, which was on the side-board—I am sure of that—it was where the cash-box was usually kept—Miller was there at tea—I was in the room with him three minutes, then I went out and left him there—I went into the shop—he came out in five minutes afterwards, and went out—there was no other mode of going out but through the shop—he had this basket with him when he went out, and a rabbit in it—he took the eggs off the counter and put them into it—it was covered with this cloth—he returned in about a quarter of an hour—about five minutes after he came out of the parlour, I discovered the cash-box was gone—I went to put some coals on the fire, and saw the child's shoes were in the scuttle, and its stockings were on the floor—I had laid them on the cash-box on the sideboard—the coal-scuttle was under the sideboard—I was in such a position as to see if anybody went into the parlour, and nobody had been in the parlour but Miller.</p>

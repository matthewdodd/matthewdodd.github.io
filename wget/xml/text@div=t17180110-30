Mr. Wootton deposed, That when he was apprehended first, he had one of those counterfeit Shillings about him, which was produced in Court; and that he owned he had been putting off several others. Mrs. Culpepper , who was Servant to the Messenger, to whose Custody he was committed, deposed, That he told her, had he as much Time out as he had within,(being then confined , and having nothing to do) he would stock the Nation with bad Money; but he would make no more Half-Crowns and Crowns, but Half-Guineas and Guineas. Mr. Smith, the Constable that apprehended him the second Time, deposed, That when he was taken he had 27 counterfeit Shillings found upon him; and that he enquiring of him, whether he was not afraid of being discovered when he was a coining; he answered, that he used to hang a Blanket up against the Door, and when he had done broke the Moulds. The Prisoner denied the Fact intirely, and said, that the counterfeit Shilling which he had when apprehended first, he had took in Holborn in Gaming; and the 27 Shillings which was taken upon him when he was apprehended the second Time, he came by as follows: That he having got away from the Messenger, he was going along St. Paul's Church-Yard, and there met with a Woman, and he had then not one Farthing of Money She gave him the 27 Shillings to hold, saying she would go and buy a Bun or two, and put off some of it, and in the Interim he ran away with it. As to the Information he had given of his Accomplices, he knew nothing of it, for he had drank hard; the Constable,&amp;c. had plied him with Drink and Geneva, that he was drunk, and put Names to him, and persuaded him that he must of necessity know them, and so had led him into injuring innocent People: That the next Morning he was surprized at what he had done, and was much concerned in his Mind that he had gone about to take away the Lives of so many innocent Persons. But all these Allegations of his were denied by the Persons on whom he fixed the vile Aspersions ; and they being Persons of such Credit on whom they could rely, what he said bore but little Weight with the Jury. The whole of his Demeanour at the Bar bespoke him a hardned and incorrigible Villain; and the Jury were so well satisfied with the Evidence, that they found him <rs id="t17180110-30-verdict159" type="verdictDescription">

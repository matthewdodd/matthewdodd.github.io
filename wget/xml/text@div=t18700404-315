                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, of 43, Newgate Street—my father keeps the Guilford Arms, Guilford Street, Russell Square—on February, about 4 o'clock, p.m., I was assisting him in his bar, and served Clifford with 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of rum—she tendered a bad shilling, I bent it and returned it to her—she appeared surprised and said that she had taken it a few doors off at Lansdowne Place—she went out one way, and I the other; I met her in Brunswick Square, when Tanner joined her; they were together a very short time, they separated, and one followed the other—I followed them to St. Pancras Church, but they joined before that and walked to Euston Square—I told Clifford I wanted her for passing bad money; she was very indignant, and I gave them both in custody—I saw Tanner's hand going towards the railings, the constable stopped her and took from her left band eight bad shillings, with paper between each—I had bent the shilling tendered to me, I gave it back to Clifford—I saw it again at the station.</p>

Jackson gave Clifford into my cus<lb></lb>tody, she was told the charge but made no reply—Tanner, who was about four steps off, asked Clifford what was the matter—I took eight bad shillings from one of Tanner's hands, and 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper from the other—she tried to shove them down some railings—at the station I received a bad shilling from the female searcher, which Mr. Jackson identified.</p>

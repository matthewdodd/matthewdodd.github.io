            . I am a widow, and live at Hoxton. On the 22d of June, about ten o'clock, the prisoner went with me to fetch some linen. I got a bag of clothes from Mr. Cotton, in Basinghall-street, and put it on his back. I had another parcel, which I got from Cheapside, he walked on very quick before me; I thought he was making haste home to return and assist me with my bundle. When I got home, I found he was not returned; I suspected all my things were gone. I went to several houses for him, I returned and found he was at home. I examined the linen, and missed the shirt and shift; I have never found them.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's daughter. I was at home when the prisoner brought the linen. I told him my mother was gone to look for him; he went out. About nine o'clock at night, I met him in the Kingsland-road, and told him my mother wanted him; he said he knew very well what it was for, and would not come. I followed him to Mr. Tipple's workhouse, where he was taken.</p>

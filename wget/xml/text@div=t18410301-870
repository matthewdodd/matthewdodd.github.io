                  </hi>. I am a slop-seller in High-street, Shadwell. On Monday evening, the 15th of February, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner came and asked if I would cash her husband's advance note, which she produced—I asked where her husband was—she said, "He is at home"—I said, "Why did not you bring him with you?" she said, "He has been working very hard all night, and is going off very early in the morning; I want some clothing for him"—she said her name was Ellen Smith—when she produced the note, she said, "My husband has put his name on the back of it; I want two of the best blue twilled shirts, two pairs of drawers, a Scotch cap, and a pocket-handkerchief—I looked at the note, and from what I saw on it, I said, "Going in the <hi rend="italic">Bullfinch</hi> to St. Petersburgh?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "It is very early for St. Petersburgh this time of the year"—she said, "Yes, but the ship is going to discharge part of her cargo at Elsinore, and lay there till it is weather to go to St. Petersburgh"—I gave her the articles, which were worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money—when she had got the money, she said, "A friend of mine is going away on Friday or Saturday, will you cash his note?" and that is the way I detected this forgery, as she afterwards brought me another note—on the Thursday morning I went to Leaden-hall-street where this note is made payable—I did not present it for pay<lb></lb>ment, but went to ascertain whether it was a genuine note—I could find no No. 41, Leadenhall street—I found 38—it is made payable at Frazier's, 41, Leadenhall-street—I found 42—I found the firm Frazier and Co., at No. 30,—I presented the note to know whether it was correct—I did not ask for the money—there is nobody here from Frazier's—I went to Threadneedle-street, to Sclden and Johnson's office, and presented the note there—the <hi rend="italic">Bullfinch</hi> was lying in the dock at that time, under repair—there was no crew on board her—I saw Mr. Gunter, the owner there—I have known him some time—I do not know the prisoner's writing.</p>

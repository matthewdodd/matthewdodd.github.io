                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police, stationed in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood of Hillingdon. On Thursday, the 5th of Jan., I went to Mr. Austin's mill with a sergeant and a constable—I got there about twelve o'clock—Mr. Austin had then gone to market—I waited till half-past one—I then saw a horse and cart driven by Lutman come down the Green-lane, into the Green-man-road, leading to Mr. Austin's mill—I saw him go to the mill with his horse and cart—he got out of the cart, and went to the mill-door—I could not see from where I was placed, whether he went in or not—in a few minutes he came out, and took his horse round to the window, at the end where they deliver goods—after a few seconds the aft-door was opened, and a miller came to the door—Lutman was in the cart, and received a sack full of something, placed it at the bottom of his cart, and then received a second sack full of something—he then took an empty sack, laid it upon the top of these sacks, and drove off, not in the same direction that he came, but still that was through Cowley, the main-road, to his home—he had not come the main-road—directly I saw him drive away from the mill, I ran after him, and overtook him—I laid hold of his cart, and said, "Lutman, what have you in your cart?"—he said, "Beans"—I said, "What quantity?"—he said, "Two sacks, one of split beans, and one of whole beans"—I said, "You have just got them from the mill, have you not?"—he said, "No, I received the sack of split beans at the mill, but the sack of whole beans I brought with me in the cart"—I got on the cart, and took him—I told him he need not say any thing to me, I should have to mention it again—we rode some distance, and before we got to the station he said, "I don't mean to say that I took the beans to-day to the mill; I took the two sacks there some days ago to be split, and to-day, finding they had not split both sacks, I brought them away"—on opening them at the station, I found one sack of whole beans, marked "John Saunders," and the other of split beans, marked "Bourn, Brentford"—this is a sample of split beans from Mr. Austin's mill—here are the split beans and the whole beans I found in Lutman's cart, and there were a few small black beans at the mill, but none of these sort.</p>

I clapped my hand to my fob and missed my watch; I followed her and catched her; I asked her for the watch; she denied taking it; she was searched, and no watch found upon her. I lost sight of her, but I am sure she is the woman that took my watch. There was another woman that the prisoner ran to.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnesses to her character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the lessee of house in Well-street, Hackney. It is a large boarding-school—I occupy it myself—I missed about 14 feet of gutter-lead—I had not seen it for many days, but I have no doubt it was safe on Wednesday the 16th of November, because we had a great deal of rain, and it ran off—I found out that it was stooled on Saturday the 19th—on the following Monday I went to the lead shop, and found part, I fitted it with what was remaining, and they corresponded exactly.</p>

On Sunday, the 20th of November, I went to Mr. Simpson's roof and examined it—a large quantity of a lead gutter was gone—on the next day I went to the warehouse of King, Meaking and Co., in Kingsland-road, and found a quantity of lead, I compared it with some I had taken from Mr. Simpson's—it corresponded I have no doubt it was brought from the house.</p>

On Thursday, the 17th, the prisoner Brewer brought a quantity of lead in a truck—there was another person with him whom I cannot swear to—Brewer said he wanted to sell that lead, and he should want some new lead in the beginning of the week—he has dealt with us before for glass—I asked his address, and he gave it, "Jenkins, Church-street, Stoke Newington"—I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt., which is the value of it—I showed that lead to Mr. Bedford and Mr. Simpson—to the best of my knowledge it was the lead I bought of Brewer.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Grove-street, Hackney, and am a gardener. I have known the prisoners Grigg and Brewer about there for eleven years—about a month or six weeks ago Grigg came to me and said, "We will get that lead off Mr. Simpson's place"—I said, "I will not have any thing to do with it"—I never had any thing to do with such things before—our garden joins Mr. Simpson's, so that if any body took the lead it would have been the most convenient way through my garden—on the Monday he said, "We will take and get the lead to night"—I said no, I would have nothing at all to do with it—on the Thursday morning Grigg called me up soon after five o'clock to come—I did not want to hear him'—I got up, and Grigg said, "Come, and get this lead"—I went with him—there was nobody else—we then put it into the truck—Grigg said, "You had better draw the truck, they will not notice you," and I did—he said he would meet me up at Cambridge-heath Bridge—I did not meet him there, and went up towards Bethnal-green-road and waited—Brewer and Grigg met me just against Bethnal-green church—I had seen Brewer before about—he had never said any thing to me about the lead—the first time I saw him that day was at Bethnal-green church—he then went on with Grigg a little way—Grigg came back and helped me with it—Brewer went on a-head, and we were to meet him against the Green-gate, Hackney-road—Grigg said so—we all three met in the Hackney-road—I dragged it a little further, to the corner of Union-street, and then Grigg took it—this was a little after ten o'clock—I started from the house a little after seven o'clock—I was to have my share, but nothing was said about it then—Brewer and Grigg went together and sold it—they would not let me o, because they said it looked so—I do not know which said that—they went into Mr. Mg✗'s, and I staid about a hundred yards off towards Newington—they both came back to the Green-gate, and Brewer paid me 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

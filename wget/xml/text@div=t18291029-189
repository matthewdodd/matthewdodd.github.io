             re-examined. I was a porter in the prosecutors' employ; I slept in the same room as Metzger in another bed - I was disturbed in the night by a noise resembling a hammer and chisel knocking against the wainscoat and the door - there was valuable property kept in the room I slept in - there was cloth to a very considerable amount; my masters have a very extensive business; I got out of bed, directed my eyes towards the spot where I heard the noise, and saw a man with the whole of his body through the pannel of the door except one arm and one leg; (I awoke rather after Metzger) he had one hand through the pannel, and in that hand was a large tallow candle a light - it was the same kind of candle as our Journeymen use; I said, "Who are you?" using a vulgar expression - he said to me, "Silence! you old***, or we will shoot you;" I swore at him again, and told him I would shoot him with a blunderbuss which I had in the room, and was feeling for it at the time I was speaking - I found it, and presented it at him - he drew back immediately through the hole and ran away; the candle was in his hand all this time - I had an opportunity of seeing his person; the prisoner Sandford bears a strong resemblance to the man in point of stature, clothing, and dress; I only saw the white of his eye - his face was in the shade; I immediately ran out at the front door, and called Watchman! Thieves! and Murder! as loud as I could halloo; I was in my shirt - I saw Bannister the watchman at a distance - he came running towards me; I directed him down the mews; he ran towards the mews which our workshops come into - there is no other entrance to it; the men are never allowed to go through the house - I still kept calling for more assistance, and saw another watchman; I think it was Pethers - he ran towards the spot; I went in again directly at the front premises to dress - I examined the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290066"></xptr>premises, and the inner door leading to the cutting-room, the pannel was cut through; I heard the piece of wood fall which awoke me - they had entered the premises by breaking away two wooden rails which are over the door in the mews; in the upper workshop I found a piece of was candle burning, and a large candle of the same description as the man had in his hand, burning also in the same candlestick; we never use wax candles - it is the first time I ever saw such a thing in the shop; we use very large tallow candles - the tallow candle was one such as I saw in the man's hand, and one was gone from one of the candlesticks; I saw a crow-bar and a chisel picked up, and the pieces of wood belonging to the door; I saw a phosphorus-box case produced by somebody on the premises - it was only the case; I knew Lesslie by his working at Mr. Stulzs' in the middle of last summer, in May or June - I never saw Sandford before.</p>

Murder! Thieves are in the house! they have broken into the back premises at the back of the mews:" I returned from there, and when I got to the entrance of the mews, I saw the prisoner Sandford coming up the Coach and Horses-yard mews - he was running, and coming up towards Boyle-street; I laid hold of him, seized him by the collar, and told him he should not go another inch from me - he levelled a pistol at me, and pulled the trigger, it burnt the priming in the pan; I saw that it flashed and missed fire in my face; I had hold of his collar at the time - it produced no effect on me; I did not let him go, and he then knocked me down; I cannot say whether it was with his fist or the butt end of the pistol - he struck me above the left temple, it did not turn out a contused wound; he got from me and went up Boyle-street, and I lost sight of him there because I was on the ground; I saw

               <p>Q. Can you say whether the man McDonough secured, was the man who you had collared, and who presented the pistol at you? A. Yes, I am certain of it; I had a very good view of him, by a light at the corner - he was in custody within three or four minutes of his knocking me down; I found a handkerchief in Regent-street, laying on the flag stones, and saw it picked up - it was in the course the prisoner had ran, when I saw it, and on being picked up, the prisoner said it was his; he was searched at the watch-house - a half-sovereign, a half-crown piece, a free-bottle and phosphorus-matches were found on him; there was no case for the bottle - there was part of a case, and a piece of wax candle; Buckland, the beadle of the night, searched him - the fire-bottle, matches, and candle were in his right-hand waistcoat pocket - I gave him in charge, returned with the officers, and examined the prosecutors' premises, with other persons; I found nothing, but saw the implements picked up, and two pieces of wood which came from over the fanlight of the back door, where they had got in, and a crow-bar - that is all I saw picked up; I examined the door, and parts of the back premises - we thought they had got in over the door, where the fan-light bars were taken down; it was large enough to admit a person - I saw, in the workman's room, a piece of wax candle found- it corresponded in size and appearance with that found on the prisoner. I saw Lesslie that evening, first about half-past eleven o'clock coming down Old Burlington-street, into Clifford-street; I know the Burlington Arms- he was not doing any thing there then - he asked me if I had seen a serjeant of the guards standing there with a girl; there had been a sergeant there with a woman - I told him I had seen him there, but they had not been there long; they were gone off my beat, and I had nothing more to do with them - he said, "I think they wanted to make a job of it to go down the mews, but the sergeant had not browns enough;" he went away up Clifford-street, turned round to Savill-row, towards Boyle-street, which is the nearest way to this mews; I saw Lesslie again about half-past twelve o'clock, or a quarter to one, coming round the same quarter as before, out of Old Burlington-street, by my box - he accosted me, and said it was a find night; I said it was - I came out of my box, and heard a noise, which I thought was some window shutters falling down (I did not ask his business at that time) I went to the top of Clifford-street - he followed me, and when I got to Savill-row, I saw

            , and told him what I had heard, and where I was going; I heard Evans say to Lesslie, "I think you are a Police-man, and are come to see what you can find out, before you come on duty;" Lesslie said, "I am not - I am a tailor, and working for Mr. Stulz;" Leslie asked if we would have anything to drink, meaning both of us - I told him there was no house open; he said, "If you will get the landlord up, Mr. or Mrs. Barry, I know them perfectly well - we have been spending the evening there - they know me well, and I will treat you with ale, if it is a dozen pots, or any thing you have a mind to drink;" this was at the Burlington Arms - I told him it was no use, for the house was shut up, and the people gone to bed, and would not open for any body; I then left him, went and called my rounds - I saw him again about ten minutes before two o'clock; I was in my box, and he wished me a good morning - I passed the compliment to him again, and saw no more of him; I did not ask what he was doing there - when I parted with him at a quarter before two o'clock, he turned up the top of Clifford-street, down towards Boyle-street, leading to the mews; that was a little before two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were not you a little frightened during the transaction? A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290067"></xptr>No; I was rather burnt at first, by the priming of the pistol - I cannot say whether I was struck with the pistol or hand; I was not alarmed at all - I should not be alarmed in the least if a man fired within half an inch of me; I have fought for my country twenty-two-years - I should not be alarmed at being fired at - if I had a stick I would knock him down; I received a blow, either from the pistol or his fist - I was struck above the temple, and the blow knocked me down; I was not much hurt - I had my hat on, and my night-cap; I should not have gone to the public-house with Lesslie, if it had been open - I could have found plenty of houses open. if I had chosen; I am not on the beat now, the new Police have come there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did you know Lesslie before? A. I never saw him before to my knowledge - it was about half-past eleven o'clock; it was not very light then - there are gas lights - I do not know whether he came out of the Burlington Arms, when he first spoke to me; I saw him come to the corner of my box- I did not see many other persons about there then; I saw the soldier and woman, but nobody else - I saw nobody else pass in that direction after this; it is not a great throughfare - I saw other people going a different way, in the course of the night; many persons observe to me about the night, as they pass - it was Evans told him he was a Police-man; he said he was a tailor, and worked for Mr. Stulz.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he say, "I am a tailor, and worked for Mr. Stulz," or "I am a tailor, and work for Stulz". A. He said, "I am a tailor, working for Stulz."</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Are you satisfied, whether he said he had worked for Stulz, or that he was then, at that time, working for him? A. He said he was working for him; he led me to suppose he was at that time working for Stulz - that is what he said to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.This conversation with Lesslie happened before you were knocked down, by the man you say is Sandford? A. Yes, two hours; my box where he spoke to me is, I suppose, two hundred yards from the mews, leading to Stulz's back premises - I always go into that mews, every half hour; I was then the watchman of that mews - I did not see the pistol picked up; I have seen it since - I could not see it sufficiently when it flashed, to see the size of it; I heard the cry of "Murder! Murder! Thieves are in the house!" as near as I can recollect it was about twenty minutes before three o'clock.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you seen it since? A. No - it was not produced at the office; McGill is not here - I did not take the prisoner into custody myself; the person who took him, met him - he was not between me and the prisoner; the passage is in Regent-street - it is a very short passage, and has three or four houses in it; when I turned I saw the person turn into King-street - I saw him in the passage, and saw him turn out of the passage into King-street.</p>

Stulzs' house; I was coming home a little after two o'clock and heard an alarm of thieves and murder given from Stulzs' premises - I saw Bannister, the watchman, going down towards the mews, as he was directed, after the prisoner; I saw a person running from the mews towards Boyle-street - it was the prisoner Sandford; I heard Bannister desire him to stop - I saw him seize him, and saw Sandford present and flash a pistol at him; I saw him struck to the ground, and saw Sandford run - I pursued and joined Clark in the pursuit, over-run Clark, pursued him through Burlington-street into Regent-street, and saw a girl near the chapel; Sandford was running near the centre of the road - when he came up to the girl, he called out to her, Poll, and threw, apparently, a pistol towards her; I did not stay to see if she picked it up, but pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time you saw the watchman struck to the ground, till you got to Marlborough-street, did you lose sight of Sandford? A. I did not - I saw him taken by McDonough, and assisted to take him to the watch-house; I never lost sight of him at all till he was taken - on our way to the watch-house with him I saw a pocket-handkerchief found, and he claimed it; on our road to the watch-house he said to me, "D-n and b-r your eyes, if it was not for you I should not have been apprehended" - when I got to the watch-house I saw him, searched by Buckland; a phosphorus-bottle and matches, half a sove<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290068"></xptr>reign, half a crown, and some bread and cheese were found on him, and a piece of candle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many examinations were there at the office? A. Five, I believe - I never said I had lost sight of the person - I was examined twice; I believe it was the first and last time, and swear I did not say I lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.About what time did you hear the cry of murder? A.About a quarter after two o'clock - it might be a few minutes later.</p>

            . I was on duty as a watchman in Savill-row, and was met by Clark and Bannister - in consequence of what passed I accompanied them to search the prosecutors' premises, and found two doors broken at the back of the house, towards the mews; I picked up a crowbar in the house, on the steps leading to the workshop behind - Schofield has it; I produce a piece of wax candle, which I found near the same spot - it was not burning; I also picked up the case of a fire-box on the premises - Schofield has that; it was in the passage, nearly on the threshold of the door leading to the back workshop; I found also a broken wooden rail.</p>
               <p>Q. About half-past twelve o'clock at night, did any thing happen on your beat? A. Yes; I recollect seeing Lesslie - he came up to my box, accompanied by Bannister - Bannister came to see what was the matter, as I had slipped over my half-hatch door by an area; I asked Lesslie who he was, and said, "I suppose you are one of the new Police?" he said, "No, I am not;" I said, "I think you are;" he said, "No, I will bet you a sovereign to a shilling of it;" he wanted me to go to the Burlington Arms, and said, "I will treat you with a dozen pots of ale; I know Mr. and Mrs. Barry very well - I have been spending the evening there;" he said he was a tailor, and worked for Mr. Stulz; he went away - I will not be positive which way he went: the clock struck one about that time. I saw Lesslie again coming from Savill-passage, about half-past one; the passage crosses Boyle-street, which leads down into the mews; he came from the passage to the corner, and surveyed me from head to foot, and said,"Talking of my being a Police-man, I should think you were one;" he again invited me to drink - I told him he knew very well there was no shop open, or he would not be so free to ask me; I left him at the corner of Boyle-street and Savill-row - on my return from the passage I saw no more of him.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I produce the pistol and the charge which I drew from it, also a piece of tallow-candle, with a bit of red cloth round it; Clark, the watchman, gave them to me - a common crow-bar, with a piece of stocking tied round one end of it, to prevent a noise, I suppose; here is a piece of railing and the case of a phosphorus-bottle given me by Evans - a chisel and small saw given me by Rossiter Buckland has the phosphorus-bottle; I went to the prosecutors' premises some time afterwards, but did not examine the manner it had been done. On the Friday after the robbery I detained Lesslie at the office, and told him I had been after him for some days - I held out neither threat nor promise to him; I told him I had been after him respecting the robbery at Mr. Stulzs' - he said he was out of the way that he should not be taken into custody, which he expected; I said I should detain him, and about an hour after that he remained with me in the waiting-room; Bannister and Evans came in - I overheard them say, "That is the man that was where Sandford committed the robbery;" I desired them to point the man out, as several were there - they pointed Lesslie out; I then told Lesslie I must search him - he said I might; he made no reply to what was said - he said afterwards, as I took him backwards and forwards to prison, at different times, that he had known Sandford for upwards of eight years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Had you not previously been to Lesslie's house? A.

            . I know Lesslie - he worked for Stulz and Co. for two or three months last summer. On the 16th of October I was at the office when the prisoners were being examined, and in consequence of a proposition made to me, I was locked up in the same cell with Lesslie - Sandford was at that time in an opposite cell, as his voice echoed from there.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see Sandford in the cell? A. No, but Lesslie hallooed out "Sandford!" and Sandford called out "Halloo!"</p>

Lesslie then said, "What a bl-d fool you were to send that letter;" I did not hear any answer to that - Sandford called Lesslie! he hallooed out Halloo! and Sandford said, "I have just seen my wife, and she says we are to be remanded for another week;" Lesslie said, with a bad expression, "Welcome, but how is that?" the voice said, "Because there has been a robbery in Clifford-street;" (I knew myself there had been a report of a robbery in Clifford-street, since ours) - Lesslie then said,"What! another robbery in Clifford-street - welcome; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290069"></xptr>wish there had been a dozen, so as they got to the right house;" a voice from the opposite cell said, "I understand old Edge has sworn to the pistol," with a bad expression - Lesslie said, "Has the old b-r? why it was not his, was it? I thought it was Dickey's;" the conversation stopped between each sentence, for a little while, but at this time longer than usual, and then Sandford called Lesslie! and Lesslie said, "Hold your tongue, you b-r; a plant, a plant" - Lesslie knew I was in the place when he first came in, but it was so dark he could not recognize my features; the voice from the cell called out, "Shall you say any thing, Lesslie?" Lesslie then said, "No, not here: what will do you will do me;" Lesslie called Sandford! Sandford called Halloo! Lesslie called out Halloo! and said, "Oh, won't I give those b-g-r-d old watchman a pepper" - Lesslie said, "I have been to the

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.What were you to get for it? A. Not any thing; I swear that - nothing of the sort was proposed; there is a wide stone passage between the cells - the officers were two or three long passages off; the prisoners spoke quite loud - they hallooed, or they could not hear each other; every body passing and re-passing must have heard what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. Has this conversation ever been read over to you? A. Yes, the solicitor read it over to me once or twice - I think altogether he may have read it to me four or five times since I made the communication.</p>

Not that I am aware of - I gave the same evidence to the Magistrate as I did to the solicitor; no alteration was made in my evidence by the solicitor - I was in the same cell with Lesslie; I knew him by his working at the shop - this conversation took place about twelve o'clock in the day, through the bars over the door of the cell; I suppose there is two or three inches between the bars - there is a little light coming from there; he could see there was a man in the cell - I could see him sufficiently to swear to him, because he got up on a bucket in the cell to speak through the bars to the voice, and the light was on his face; there was light enough without that for me to see him walking about, but I do not think I could distinguish his countenance except when he was at the bars - the light came through the bars on his face quite sufficient for me to know him when he was on the bucket.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You made a memorandum of what passed before you saw the solicitor? A. I just told him I had been in, and said I would write it down - I have the memorandum I wrote at the time, (producing it.)</p>

               <p>Sandford's Defence (written.) - My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I am accused of committing a burglary alone, which must appear to your minds almost impossible to be accomplished by one man - and had I gone with the determination of committing such a desperate burglary, I am certain that it must occur to your minds that I should not have retreated armed, as it is stated that I was, because a man happened to raise an alarm: had I been sufficiently desperate to have attempted such a dangerous enterprise alone, it must strike your minds that that desperation would not soon have forsaken me; besides, had I been so well acquainted with the premises, as the witness, Evans, states that the person must have been, who broke into the premises, is it likely that I should have broken into a room in which a person slept? you will please to recollect that one of the witnesses states that he saw the legs of three or four persons - had this been the case, more than one person must have been seen; as the watchman, Bannister, states that he came up the instant the alarm was given, and that he only saw one person, and when he came up to that person, he made, as the watchman states, a desperate resistance - whereas it is not attempted to be proved that I made any resistance.</p>
               <p>Lesslie's Defence (written.) - My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I beg to declare most solemnly that I am wholly innocent of any connection with any person or persons who were concerned in committing the burglary on the premises of Messrs. Stulz, and the fact of my coming forward in a voluntary manner to give such evidence as might be required of me by the Magistrates of Marlborough-street, will, I trust, carry conviction to your mind of that fact; for had I been the guilty man it is attempted to make me appear, I could not have had the audacity to have acted in this manner; on the contrary, is it not more probable that I should have attempted to secrete myself, or to leave the country, which I might have done, as more than a week had elapsed from the commission of the crime and the apprehension of Sandford, to the time I surrendered myself, which I did on a summons being left at my house? There is one point in this case to which I think it necessary to call your attention; the public press gave out that I had absconded on the apprehension of Sandford - I therefore beg but a moment's time to explain this, in order to remove any prejudice that that aspersion may have made on some of your minds; the facts are these: - the first examination of Sandford took place on Saturday, the 26th day of September - his wife was apprehended on the Tuesday following, and on which day, for the first time, I left my house, and went to work for a Mr. Tyndale, of Market-street, Westminster, and returned and slept at home on that night; the following day I again went to Mr. Tyndale's and resumed my work, and slept at his house on that and the following nights, namely, Wednesday and Thursday nights, in consequence of our continuing work until very late hours, and considerably after midnight, so that no time might be lost in getting the work in hand finished, as it was to be done by a certain time. On the Wednesday night (the first night that I slept at Mr. Tyndale's) the officers from Marlborough-street went and searched my house: on the following day, Thursday, the officers came again, and left the summons which I have before alluded to, which my wife brought to me at Mr. Tyndale's - in pursuance of which I went to Marlborough-street, where I was taken into custody, and kept under examination for twenty-one days, deprived of my liberty, and also of any legal advice; an order having been made that I should not have communication direct or indirect with any person, and it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290070"></xptr>with difficulty that my solicitor obtained permission to see me, and that in the presence of an officer, who was placed there to hear every word that passed. Although I was thus kept so long under examination, yet no other evidence than that adduced on my first examination was brought forward, except that of the witness,

               <p>Seven other witnesses gave Lesslie a good character.</p>

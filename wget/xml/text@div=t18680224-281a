               <p>not go till half-past one—I did not know McCarthy or Richardson before—they were strangers to me—in the presence of all of them, O'Leary asked me if I would take the Fenian oath—I told him I should like to hear it—we had a little to drink, and I told him I should have to be getting home—he said, "Oh, you must not go home, we will go round to the King William, in Wellington Street"—we went there—there was a little bit of disturbance there, as regards my being a detective—Lyttleton said there was a sneak in the room—he asked me if I would take the Fenian oath—I said, "I did not know what it was, I should like to hear it"—he asked whether we could go into a private room—I told him I did not mind—he said, "You ask the landlord for the key"—I asked the landlord if he would let me have the key of the parlour—he came with the key, and we all went into the room—McCarthy, his brother, Richardson, O'Leary, and myself all went into the room with Lyttleton—we had a conversation about Fenianism, and then he asked me if I would take the oath—I said I should like to hear it—and Lyttleton repeated the oath to O'Leary—before this, they asked me if I was a detective, and I said, "No; I will swear by my God that I am not a detective"—Lyttleton took a book out of his pocket and placed it on the table, and wrote something in it—it was this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) or one like it—he read what he wrote in the book—Lyttleton repeated the oath to O'Leary, and he took a small Testament out of his pocket and kissed it—the oath was "You shall foreswear all allegiance to the Sovereign of Great Britain, and take up arms against the British Government, and overthrow them, to protect the rights of Ireland, So help you God"—after that O'Leary kissed the book—he then told me to take hold of the book, which I did whilst he repeated the words to me—I told him I did not exactly understand what he said—he asked me if I was a d—fool—I refused to kiss the book—McCarthy tapped me on the shoulder and said don't be a d—traitor—I still refused to kiss the book, and he said I was a b—traitor—during the whole of this time Richardson, McCarthy, his brother, Lyttleton, O'Leary, and myself were in the room—I am positive of that—about three o'clock the landlord or pot<lb></lb>man came to the door and said, "You must be getting out here, it is getting on for three o'clock—at that time the door was locked—I did not lock it—I unlocked it—I don't know who opened it—we all went out one after the other—I don't know who came out last—when I went out I went into the passage—we all went out the back way, and O'Leary turned round and gave me in charge to Richardson and McCarthy—I asked them what the charge was—they said, Fenianism"—I said, "Very well, I will go" and they took me to the police station—McCarthy was on one side of me, and Richardson on the other—O'Leary came besides—Lyttleton did not—when they took me to the station they made a charge of being concerned in Fenianism against me—I told them who I was, as I had made a report previously about Lyttleton to one of the inspectors—I think his name is Hibbs, the inspector at Deptford—I do not think there was anyone present when I reported it to him—they charged me with "Fenianism—I told them I had got a cousin a detective, named Ling, who they knew very well; I was no Fenian—I gave Richardson, McCarthy, and O'Leary, my address—at that time I was staying with my cousin, Ling—he is a detective and an officer at Deptford—I was then discharged—in the course of the evening I went to the same public-house, the King William, about five o'clock, by myself—I was talking to the landlord, and telling him about it, when O'Leary, Richardson, and Lyttleton came</p>

I am landlord of the King William the Fourth, Wellington Street, Deptford—I know the prisoner Lyttleton by his coming to my house several times—on Sunday, 19th January, I saw McCarthy and Richardson at my house—I had not seen them before—they came about a quarter to two o'clock; Lyttleton, O'Leary, and several others were with them—Boutall was there, I believe, when they came in—O'Leary, Richard<lb></lb>son, and Lytlleton came in together, and McCarthy a few moments afterwards, and some one with him—I do not know whether it was his brother, or who it was—Richardson came in with McCarthy—there was a third party came in, and one man came round deliberately to Boutall, and said, "I heard you pass some remarks about America last night, and I think you are a b—y liar;" and after Boutall had spoken to him, and remarked on what happened in America, which made him believe he had been there, the same man said to Boutall, "I think you are a b—y Fenian"—Lyttleton said to the man, "I think it is very wrong for you to live in our company and come round to a strange man and interfere in his business that you know nothing about"—Lyttleton advised him to leave, and he did so—when he left, Lyttleton came back, and said, "Gentlemen, I believe we have a b—y sneak among us, you must dispense with it"—he got so excited that I was obliged to stop him, and he walked deliberately round to the man—they came round to test Boutall about America, and in the meantime Boutall, O'Leary, and McCarthy went into my back passage, which is a public thoroughfare right through—Boutall came beck to me. and said, "Seal, give me the key of the parlour"—I said, "I have not got it; I will call my postman"—I called him, and he gave it to him—the door was opened, and Boutall, Richardson, McCarthy, and O'Leary, and I think one or two others, I do not know which, came in at the same time with them, I did not take particular notice of them—I said, "Gentlemen, what business you have to transact do it as quickly as you possibly can, for my time is near for closing"—I came back to my bar, and heard the bell ring and a pot of stout ordered, which I served, and received 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from them—my postman took it in—Richardson went in with them—I was in my bar, and O'Leary came out, and said to Lyttleton, "I want you to come in with me," and they went in together—Lyttleton denied going in at first, but he went in by the persuasion of O'Leary, and being a few minutes to three, I said to my postman, "Hunt those men out of the room, I want my place closed"—I shut my front door up at three; in a short time I went to the parlour</p>

               <p>door, and found McCarthy outside the door, and the door locked inside—he was standing listening, it appeared—there is a division between my bar and my room—I knocked at the door moderately, and said, "I want my house cleared; I will have it cleared if I find Boutall, O'Leary, and Lyttleton inside; out you come"—nobody else was inside to my knowledge—I do not know who opened the door, but it was opened from inside—I believe Richardson was one of them, but I did not see him at the time; he was not with McCarthy at the door, and he was not inside the room—Boutall, O'Leary, and Lyttleton came out, and I said, "My front premises are closed, you must go out the back way"—they did so, and the back gate was closed—they were in the room about half an hour from the time the key was fetched till I saw them out—I did not see what became of them—I saw Boutall again at a few minutes after five, when I opened my house again, and O'Leary, McCarthy, and Lyttleton came in about five or ten minutes after him—Boutall said to O'Leary and McCarthy, "Old boy, you were sucked in about not taking me, were you not?"—that was all I heard; a scuffle took place; I was obliged to interfere, and I had a severe hit on the jaw by Lyttleton—O' Leary quietly walked off, but Richardson did not—he took off his coat, and said, "I think you did very wrong in striking the landlord, who has no intimacy in this affair at all"—I did not see anybody strike Boutall—I know McCarthy's brother now by sight—I cannot recognize him as one of the parties who went into the room; I cannot swear one way or other, but I know him now by his coming to my house since—I did not know him before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you first see Boutall before Sunday, the 19th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two or three times—I did not say before the Magistrate that I saw him every day in the week before; it was not every day that I saw him, and it would be very wrong for me to say so if I had not—I had not seen him at my house once or twice a day for a week before Sunday, the 19th—(<hi rend="italic">The witness' deposition, being read slated</hi>: " I had seen Boutall at my house every day for a week.")—I believe I may have seen Ling with Boutall at my house, it may have been two or three times—I do not believe Boutall had been at my house once or twice a day for a week before, but he had been in my absence—the statement in my deposition is erroneous—on the Saturday night prior to Sunday 18th, I saw O'Leary, Boutall, and Lyttleton at my bar—Boutall was then charged with being a detective, and got very angry—I put out the man who said that Boutall was a detective—Boutall had not been a customer of mine before, but I knew him slightly some week or so before this event—I do not know whether he had been in the habit of treating persons in my house; I believe he had—he paid for some<lb></lb>thing, I know—on more than one occasion he has supplied beer to persons at my bar—I have seen him supplying beer to Lyttleton on more than one or two occasions—I heard Lyttleton say, "We have a b—y Fenian among us we want to dispense with"—I did not hear any person say to Boutall, "You b—y old Fenian"—I have not just said that I did, or that Lyttleton retorted, and said that he was a b—y s—.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said that a man came round and said so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was the man that came round from the front of my bar—I am quite certain that a person said it, but am not certain of the remark—I believe it was that Boutall was a b—y Fenian, or something of that kind—it was in reply to Boutall being an American, and doubting his being in America—when I saw McCarthy standing outside the door, I did not see Richardson.</p>

               <p>standing there—when the door was opened, Lyttleton, O'Leary, and Boutall came out—I swear that those three came out, and I did not see any others—Boutall had no account with me for beer; I never have any account with anyone—he owed me, I dare say, for a pot or so, whatever he might have had.</p>

I am postman at the King William the Fourth—I have known McCarthy ten years; he works at Deptford Dockyard—I have known Lyttleton two months—on Sunday, 19th January, I came back from my dinner to the King William just before three—as I was going in, my master called for the key of the parlour; I gave it to him—I saw some men in the passage, but did not notice who they were—I heard the door unlocked, and the men go in—shortly after they went in, the bell rang; I answered it—the door was then open; I went in, and saw McCarthy, Richardson, O'Leary, Boutall, and another stranger, who I believe to be McCarthy's brother—Lyttleton was in front of the bar—I went into the parlour, and Boutall called for a pot of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. stout, and while I was calling for it in the bar O'Leary came out and took Lyttleton in—when I took the stout in I told them there was not much time to drink it, as we closed on Sundays at three o'clock—when I took in the stout, Lyttleton, Richardson, McCarthy, his brother, O'Leary, and Boutall were in the room—McCarthy paid for the stout, and I came out—after a few minutes I went to the door by my master's orders, and found it locked—I knocked, and the answer was they would not be above three or four minutes—I told my master; he said, "Well, they must get out, it is closed at three o'clock—I did not see any<lb></lb>one outside; all six parties, I believe, were in the parlour—I did not remain by the door; I went out to lock the back gate—I let them out the back way—Lyttleton and Richardson came out first, O'Leary, Boutall, and McCarthy's brother came out afterwards—I did not see where McCarthy went to, he must have gone out the front way—only five persons went out at the back gate.</p>

I am stationed at Greenwich—Boutall is a cousin of mine—on Monday, 20th January, soon after five in the morn<lb></lb>ing, from information I received, I went with a constable to Lyttleton's lodging, 103, New Street, Deptford—I waited till a lodger came out, and then I went in—I knocked at the door of one of the rooms, and said, "Maurice, I want to speak to you"—a voice said, "He is not in; he has not been home all night"—it came from the room where I had previously seen him in bed—I said, "Open the door"—a voice said again, "He is not in"—I went to the front windows, pulled open the shutters, and distinctly, saw him in bed with his wife and an infant—I called to him, and said, "Maurice, open the door, or I will break it in"—he said, "All right; I will open it;" he did so—I said, Maurice, you can consider yourself my</p>

               <p>prisoner; dress yourself"—he commenced to dress himself, and his wife said something—Lyttleton said, "Tell me the charge"—I said it was one of treason-felony—he said, "I will go with you"—after he had dressed, he went outside into New Street with me—before leaving, when I mentioned treason-felony, he turned to his wife and said, "It is you that has done this; you ought to be gibbeted"—I took him outside, and he said, "I ex<lb></lb>pected this," and in Evenly Street he said, "I suppose this was my Yankee friend that has done this"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his right-hand coat pocket—there are some manuscript verses inside it—it is in the same state as I found it—across one of the pages is written, "I am not a detective; I never was, by my God"—I searched Lyttleton's room with Yardley, and I found a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Irishman</hi> newspaper—I assisted in searching McCarthy's place on the morning of the 20th, about eight o'clock, with Inspector Digby—I was not there when he was taken in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you first see Lyttleton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the night of 22nd December last—I began to watch him then—I was not watching him specially when Boutall came to reside with me, I began to watch him specially about the time of the January Sessions commencing here—Boutall came to my house on 31st December—I had seen him at the Greenwich police-court, but I did not know it—he slept there that night—he had been away, in London, some time; that was his home when he liked to come to it—I only saw him once about thirteen years ago, and once about seven years ago—I never saw him but twice before; I did not know him from an utter stranger—I did not tell him I was watching Lyttleton—I first saw him with Lyttleton on 10th or 11th January—I said before the Magistrate I thought it was on the 10th, I would not be positive—they were at the lower end of High Street—I met two persons—I think they were close to the White Swan—I do not know how long I had left Boutall before I saw him with Lyttleton, it was more than ten minutes—I did not tell Boutall that I was watching, till after he had made a communication at the station; that was on the Wednesday or Thursday—he did not make the com<lb></lb>munication to me—I think I and Yardley were at the station when it was made—Inspector Digby was not there—I think that Yardley and I were at the station then—Inspector Ebbs was—I have already told you that I knew prior to Friday the 19th that Boutall had made this communication to the police—I was there when he was speaking to the Inspector—I think so—I took little or no notice of what communication he made—I certainly did not ask Boutall what it was—I had not conveyed to him what my ideas were—it is not likely, nor to anyone else—Boutall was still staying at my house, he might have stayed there that night—occasionally he was away—I did not ask him what communication he was making to the police—I took little or no notice—I knew very well what he was doing—I gave Boutall no in<lb></lb>structions—I was not with him on Saturday evening 18th January; certainly not—I swear I was not with him at the King William—I left him about five o'clock and never saw him again until after I had returned home at twelve o'clock at night, when I was in bed—I had been about my duty; where he had been to I don't know—I was not with him at the White Swan, or any public-house that evening—he did not tell me where he was going—I never asked him—I had enough to do to look after my own duties—I don't know what time I went out on the Sunday morning; it might have been eleven o'clock—I know I went home to dinner, and Boutall was</p>

I can hear that from the sergeant," and he went out, and I did not see him again till about seven o'clock.</p>

On Sunday, 19th January, I was on duty at the Deptford Station—Boutall was brought there in custody about half-past three in the afternoon by McCarthy and Richardson, and a man named Daniel O'Leary—O'Leary charged him with being a Fenian—he said he had had a conversation with him on the Saturday night, and he believed him to be a Fenian—I asked him why he had not given informa<lb></lb>tion at the station about it—he said that he did not think it was necessary, as he had a special constable in his house—I took the names and addresses of the whole of them—I had seen Boutall before—I did hot know that he was a relation of Ling's—Boutall stated that if I wished for any reference respecting him, he would refer me to detective Ling—McCarthy stated that he was at the William, in Wellington Street, and was called upon by O'Leary to take Boutall into custody, with Richardson as well, he and Richardson being special constables—I did not take the charge—I gave Boutall's name and address to O'Leary—about ten minutes after that, Boutall returned to the station, and made a further communication to me—it had reference to something that took place at the King William on the Sunday afternoon—I reported the matter to Inspector Digby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you seen Boutall about with Ling? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Once; I think he was talking to him—when Boutall was brought in custody he did not make any countercharge then—he did not make a statement to me after five o'clock—Ling came to the station after Boutall was in custody, and after the communication was made to me by Boutall—I acted on that communi<lb></lb>cation—I communicated it to Inspector Digby, and also to ting—I told Ling about four o'clock, as near as possible—they gave their addresses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">A long statement made by Richardson before the Magistrate was put in and read: in substance it amounted to a denial of the statements made by the witness Boutall, and asserted that he and McCarthy, as special constables, were watching the witness as a suspected Fenian, and that it was not until they had taken him into custody that he made the present accusation</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am McCarthy's brother, and am a shipwright—before 19th January this year I had not seen either Richardson or Lyttleton—I first saw them at the King William public-house, Deptford, about two. on that afternoon—I entered the public-house with my brother Florence—I had come straight from his house, 35, Princes Street, and had not been at the King's Head public-house that morning—when we entered the King William there was no one in the compartment we went into, but there was another compartment on the left, and another on the right: altogether there are four compartments at the bar—I saw Boutall on the left, in the midst of seven or eight men, proclaiming himself an American and a citizen, and praising America—a man with a moustache in the right compartment came round to me, and asked me for a book—I asked him what sort of book—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186802240098"></xptr>
               <p>said, "Any sort"—I afterwards heard that his name was O'Leary—I told him I had been to church that morning, and I had got a prayer book—he said that would do, and I lent it to him—this is it—Boutall then came into the compartment where I was, and we spoke about America—he asked me about different parts of America inland, Ohio, Cleveland, and so on; but I told him I had only been to the seaport towns—directly after that he left the compartment, and went on the right, immediately returning and saying to me, "Come in here; we have got some gin"—I went in, but there was so much confusion that I returned to my compartment—soon afterwards we all went into the parlour, Boutall, the man with the moustache, O'Leary, myself, my brother, Lyttleton, Richardson, and there might be two others—I did not take any particular notice as to the number—I cannot say whether Lyttleton went in with us, but I saw him in the room—we all went in in a straggling sort of way—there were several in the room when I went in—when I got in somebody ordered a pot of stout, which came—I cannot tell who paid for it—Boutall stood in the middle of the room; in fact, he stood all the time, and so did O'Leary—Boutall took his coat off, and laid it on the table, with the inside upwards, and said that he paid thirty dollars, I think, for making it; that he cut it himself, and he seemed to praise it as an American-made coat—he then extended his arm in this manner to O'Leary, and said, "May this arm be paralyzed; may I be struck dead on the spot, if I am a detective; I am with you, boys, willing to take any oath, or anything"—I will not be certain whether he used the word oath, I think he did—McCarthy then left the room, saying that there was something wrong, followed, I think, by Richardson and Lyttleton—they only left Boutall, myself, and O'Leary in the room; O'Leary and Boutall were standing together, and I was taking no particular notice of what they were doing; I was sitting down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Lyttleton there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he had gone at that time; McCarthy went first, Richardson next, and I think Lyttleton followed—O'Leary then found the book I had lent him, and said to Boutall, "What is your name?"—he said, "My name is James Boutall"—O'Leary then said to him, "I, James Boutall, solemnly vow;" Boutall repeated the words—I then said, "There is something wrong, I must leave the room too;" I got up, the door opened against me, the landlord entered, and I went out—immediately afterwards O'Leary and Boutall came out, and we all went out the back way, because the front doors were shut.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>a note of something that Boutall said; I did not not me what it was, I was not paying any particular attention—I do not know how O'Leary came to ask me if I had a book, I had never spoken to him when he asked me for a book and said that any sort of book would do—I lent him the book—I do not live with my brother; I am upon sick leave from Chatham, and was staying in the house with him, not lodging there, and he and I went to this public-house together—I asked O'Leary what he wanted the book for; he said nothing, but put it in his pocket, and walked away—my brother left the room when Boutall began "I solemnly vow," I thought there was something wrong then, and perhaps they must be up to something illegal—I have never taken any oaths except here and at Greenwich—I heard nothing more, I left the room then and went out the back way, and my brother and Lyttleton and Richardson were all out in Collin Street—I saw Boutall given into custody, I did not go to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was Boutall given into custody for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know—I did not hear it said, and I did not ask—I did not see them take him prisoner—they walked near together; they did not lay hands on him—I had not the slightest notion why he was taken into custody—I think O'Leary said, "Take this man in charge"—I felt surprised, but I never asked anybody the reason; I did not feel that way inclined—I thought I would leave them—I have been out in ships to seaport towns in America, and got this book presented to me in America by the Rev. J. W. Allen—I had been in chapel on this morning from eleven to one at Deptford, and had been home since and had dinner—I generally carry the book in my pocket, pretty well at all times, because we have evening service as well as service on Sundays—it is a small book, and I generally keep it in my pocket—it is a book that I should take to chapel during service—you will see the prayers there for mass, and such like—I don't know where O'Leary is—he was quite a stranger to me; I had never seen him before—the whole of them were strangers to me.</p>

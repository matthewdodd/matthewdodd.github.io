               <p>Q. Did that lead you to look after the prisoners, Collett and Frewin? - A. Yes, on Saturday morning, I found them at the Buffalo's Head in the New Road; Spencer was with me; we were waiting outside of the house; they both came out together, and Collett had Marcham's hat on his head; on our endeavouring to take them, Frewin ran away; Spencer pursued him; I laid hold of Collett, he struggled very much and dragged me across the road; he pulled a knife out, and he stabbed at my face several times; I drew back and he stabbed me in the sleeve; I nevertheless secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he cut you at all? - A. No, he cut at me with full vengeance, I let go of him, I drew back and he ran the knife against a brick wall, and broke it; and with the assistance of

             I took him and brought him to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any message you received from Collett did you go to the prisoner Lander? - A. I went to Lander on the 17th of June; his father told me, he would tell me where the things were if I would go with him.</p>
               <p>Court. There is a father coming; I do not like to introduce a father; it is not the nature of a father to go and give evidence against his son, unless he thought his son would be benefited by it; here one man makes a promise, and then that man is not a witness, and the other witness makes a confession who is a father; the prosecutor ought to produce that man who heard the original confession from the prisoner who is not a father; we will not make the father the instrument to convict his son.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Were you present when Collett was brought to Marlborough-street office, the day after he was taken? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what Collett said a search warrant was taken out and Lander's premises were searched? - A. Yes, and at Lander's apartments, No. 11, Compton-street, St. Giles's, I found two snaffle bridles and a chaise bridle; I asked him if he knew any thing of buying two saddles; one of the saddles was with spring stirrups, and it had got W marked on the buttons, and the other saddle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100071"></xptr>had new stirrup leathers; he said he knew nothing of any saddles; I looked over the room, it is up two pair of stairs, I suppose there were twenty saddles there; he went to Marlborough-street office with me; he was discharged that day to come the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you any thing that day? - A. Yes; at the Marlborough's Head he asked me to have something to drink; he said, I shall get up in the chaise and ride with you, and as we were riding together, he said he recollected very well the saddles, he sold them to one Mr. Williams, he lodged at the Black Horse in Little Rathbone-place; he recollected buying them of a little short man.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that, did you go to Mr. Williams? - A. Yes, he had sold them to a gentleman's coachman; Lander went with me to him, and there I found them; the next day Lander came to the Office, and Collett was brought there.</p>

On this saddle there is W on the buttons; Lander told me he sold the saddles for 3 l. 5 s.</p>
               <p>Q. First he told you he had bought none? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. He did not recollect it then; afterwards, instead of putting them out of the way, he produced them to you? - A. Yes; he said he recollected who he sold them to.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did you hear Lander say what he gave for the things? - A. He said he agreed to give 25 s. Collet said he never had more than five shillingsworth of halfpence for the whole lot.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Williams). Did you buy any saddles of Lander? - A. Yes; I gave Lander 3 l. 5 s. for them, I sold them for 3 l. 15 s. I delivered them to Shurety.</p>
               <p>Collett and Lander left their defence to their Counsel.</p>

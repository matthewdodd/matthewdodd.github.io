                  </hi>. I am married. I am an Irishwoman, and so is the prisoner—we have always been very good friends—she stood for my child—on the afternoon of the 13th of May I was coming in with a sauce<lb></lb>pan of water—the prisoner and her sister were sitting in my way—I asked one of them to move, but neither of them moved for me—I then passed in between them as well as I could—I did not spill any water upon them—some was spilt on the boards behind them, but it did not reach them—the prisoner said, "Bad luck to you, you b----b----," and "Bad luck to you," said the pair of them—I went up stairs with the water, and came down again to go on an errand—they were both <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> me, and calling me all manner of names—I did not return it to the prisoner, I did to her sis-ter—the prisoner hit me on the head with an iron stand, again with a cul-lender, and again with a saucepan—she swore she would have the b—b—'s life—I was in the hospital for a fortnight, from the wound that was struck with the saucepan—my head is bad now.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the North London Hospital. The prosecutrix was brought there, on the 13th of May, between four and five o'clock, she had received a severe wound on the side of the head, and was considerably bruised—I dressed the wound—she went out that day, returned the next, and then remained for a fort<lb></lb>night.</p>

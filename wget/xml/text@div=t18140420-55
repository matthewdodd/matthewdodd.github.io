On the 15th of April, I was returning home, about twelve o'clock at night, I went into Mr. Rogers's, the Swan and Hoop public-house, on the Pavement, Moorfields; I think it was before I went into Mr. Rogers's. I went into the tap-room to a box, there were four men sitting drinking there out of a pot of porter; the prisoner was one; there were three other men besides him sat in the same box; one of the other men was dressed in a short jacket, another in a long coat, he appeared like a coachman; there was a person in a straight coat, similar to my own, he was of a sandy complexion. I staid there about an hour and a half, or more perhaps. While I was drinking a glass of rum and water, which I called for, the coachman asked me to drink with him; I refused. The prisoner made an observation, that he had no right to ask me to drink when he had not paid himself for what he had drank. The prisoner addressed himself to me, and called me a tailor, and a great many other names that I do not recollect; he was rude to me. After I had drank up my sixpennyworth of rum and water, the coachman proposed to have a shillingsworth; which we had in. After that I declined having more; I said, it was time to go home. The prisoner and the man in the short jacket went out together; in about three minutes the coachman and I went out together. I turned to the left hand to go home; the coachman to the right. When I came out of the door I went up the Pavement, along Finsbury-place to Finsbury-square, and when I came opposite of Dr. Jones's, I was going across over the road, I was attacked by three men.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of the three men - A. Yes, I amsure of it. Immediately they came upon me I turned round; before I got quite round I received a blow in my mouth, which knocked me down; that blow was with the fist. After I was down the third man took my property from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your property - A. In my left hand breeches pocket; that was five one-pound bank notes, and nineteen shillings in silver; I put it in my pocket the very same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you shortly before the time you were robbed - A. Yes, I counted my money in the morning, and I took it out at Mr. Rogers's. I took six notes out, gave Mr. Rogers one to change; I put the other five notes back. I am sure I had five one-pound notes and nineteen shillings in silver; that was in my pocket at the time I was knocked down. I got up; and called watch, and the watchman took the prisoner; he met him as he was coming to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it soon after you called out watch - A. Yes. The watchman took him into custody. He shewed me the man; I immediately recollected him to be the man with whom I had been drinking in the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the other persons that knocked you down - A. The other two were the men that had been in the box with me; the coachman who came out with me was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not get your money again I take it - A. No. I have no sort of doubt the prisoner is the man. The watchman is here that took him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200034"></xptr>Q. Vasey, where had you been drinking before you came to his house - A. At Mr. Vaughan's, in Coleman-street. I drank two sixpennyworths of rum and water, and a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. You were near two hours in this public-house A. Yes. At Mr. Rogers's I had sixpennyworth of rum and water, and the coachman and I had a shillingsworth of rum and water between us.</p>

            . I am an officer. I live at No. 10, Lanthorn-court. I am a ward officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into Mr. Rogers's that evening - A. Yes, about ten minutes before two; I saw Vasey there; he sat in the box as he has described. There was only three there when I went in; the prisoner, the man in the short jacket, and coachman; the other had gone out when I went in. I was drinking a glass of porter at Mr. Rogers's. After I drank my porter I sat down two or three minutes; the prisoner and the man in a short jacket went out; they left the coachman and Vasey; they might go out three or four minutes after them. I went out before Vasey and the coachman. When I went out I saw the prisoner and the man in the short jacket standing against the Globe, on the pavement, at the corner of Fore-street. I had suspicion of the man in the short jacket; I thought I might have seen him before on the Pavement. I went over the way to facing of Fore-street; I waited there about two or three minutes; Mr. Vasey and the man, supposed to be a coachman, came out. When they came out, Vasey went towards his home; the coachman went the other way; he passed by these men standing against the Globe; in half a minute he returned back to them again. Vasey had gone on by himself; the other three were about a minute or two talking together; they went from there across Moorfields, and came out again facing of Short-street. I was going up the pavement. I saw the three men facing of Short-street; one of them went down Little Moorfields, and the other two went up the Pavement. I went up to the top of the Pavement; it was out of the ward of Coleman-street. I did not trouble myself any further. As I was coming down again afterwards, in about a quarter of an hour, I heard the call of watch; I ran up to where I heard the cry proceed from, to Finsbury-square. When I went up I saw the watchman had the prisoner in custody. I am sure he is the same person that I had seen before in Mr. Rogers's public-house.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILSON. I am a watchman. On the morning of the 15th I heard a man call watch a little before half past two; I directly came out of my box, and ran towards the sound, into Finsbury-square. I met the prisoner running towards me; I seized him, and then I sprang my rattle for assistance. The prisoner was in a flurry. The patrol and Mr. Vasey came up; Vasey bid me hold up the lanthorn to his face; I did; he said, that is the man that knocked me down. I took him to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there anything the matter with the prisoner's little finger - A. The skin was knocked off the little finger on his right hand, as if fresh done, and bleeding. The prisoner is the man I took in custody, and the man the prosecutor charged with knocking him down.</p>

            . I keep the Swan and Hoop public-house. On the morning of the 15th, I remember the prisoner and Vasey being at my house, and also the witness Girton. I have heard the account the other witness has given, it is correct; they went out as has been stated. Vasey appeared to be the worse for liquor. He had one sixpennyworth of rum and water in my house, and part of a shillings-worth.</p>

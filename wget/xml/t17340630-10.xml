            . As I was changing a Guinea, for a Customer, the Prisoner came in, and desir'd me to change her Guinea too, for she said, she wanted Sugar and Plumbs I saw she had Silver and Halfpence in one Hand, and told her, she had more Silver than would pay for what she wanted; but she said, she had occasion for more Silver. I had some Silver and Gold in a Paper. I told her I had never a half Guinea, and with that, she thrust her Hand among the Money, and said, Here's a half Guinea; and here's another. I ask'd her, What she meant by that? And catching hold of her Hand, I took two Guineas out of it, and then bid her go about her Business, for I would change no Money for her. Well, says she, give me my Guinea again. I told her, I had no Guinea of hers. Yes, says she, but you have, for one of these you took out of my Hand was mine. I told her, I knew what was in the Paper, for it was set down, and if I found a Guinea too much, she should have it. I cast up the Money, and miss'd some, but being a little in a Fluster, I could not exactly tell how much. It's hard, says she, that I should lose my Guinea, and so she went away very quietly. A Friend of mine, who was in the Shop, said he believ'd she had got something, or she would not have gone away so easy, and so he went and brought her back. I was now a little more cool, and cast up the Money more carefully, and found I wanted 20 s. or a Guinea, tho' I reckon'd the two Guineas I had taken out of her Hand, and so I call'd a Constable.</p>

About a month ago, I went out to work at six o'clock in the morning, taking the key of my room with me; I returned at eleven o'clock at night, and found the room broken open - I missed a dish and a basin, and three shillings out of my breeches-pocket, which hung on the bed; the prisoners lodged in the house - I got an officer, went to their room next morning, and found the basin in their cupboard, and the dish in a drawer in the back-room, covered with a carpet - the man was out at work; the woman said we were welcome to search for them; I lodge on the third-floor, and they on the first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did not she claim them as her own? A. Yes, but I told the officer what mark was on it before I saw it - they were both let out on bail; the man afterwards came and wanted me to make it up - I drank a pot of beer with him twice, when he came to ask me to make it up; he used to go to work at six o'clock, and return between six and seven - I was on good terms with him, but not in the habit of going into their room; I came home tipsy one night and he charged me with some indecency - he recommended me to avoid it in future, and so I did.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Wyburne. On Monday evening, about seven o'clock, the prisoners came into the shop. Mr. Wyburne gave the information to attend the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. After they had been in the shop sometime you suspected them - A. Yes, Mr. Wyburne ordered me to take charge of Steadman; I immediately took hold of Steadman's arm and moved her from the counter; she then dropped a piece of sheeting from under her petticoats; I desired her to walk up stairs and I went for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they been in the shop - A. About two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Wyburne said he went up stairs and desired you to bring up the other woman - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see her take the sheeting - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did they come in together - A. I believe they did.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you believe they came in together, you did not see them - A. No.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

I went into the shop, there were several people waiting to be served; this gentleman laid hold of me as I moved from the counter; there was a piece of sheeting, half on the counter and half off; I never saw it with my eyes, nor yet the other prisoner; the shop was amazing full.</p>
               <p>Wood's Defence. I was not in company with the prisoner; I never saw her before; seeing the shop full of people I went in to look at some flannels; the gentleman asked me to step up stairs with him; he says you have got something about you; I said no, if you please to bring any one into the room and search me; then he picked up a bit of cotton. I could not get to the counter to take any thing for the crowd of people.</p>

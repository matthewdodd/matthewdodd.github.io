Nine Guineas, 11 Shillings, and 12 penny worth of Halfpence; a Silver Punch-Ladle, 2 Silver Spoons, 3 Gold Rings, 2 Pair of Silver Buckles, a Pair of Shoes, 4 Pair of Gloves, a Silk Hood, 3 Knives, one of them was a Pen-knife, and several other Things that I can't remember.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you leave the Box when you went up?</p>
               <p>M. H. It stood on a Trunk in my Bed-room, on the same Floor with the Publick Room in the Cellar. The Door of my Room was left open, but the Box was lock'd.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you find your Goods again?</p>
               <p>M. H. I found the Box, and some of my Goods, at the Bull-Head in Wells's Yard in Tottenham-Court Road, where he had taken a Lodging; but all my Money, 2 of the Gold Rings, and other Things, were quite lost. This honest Man here apprehended him, and he was admitted to Newgate ; and as he was going thither, he sent a Messenger to the other Prisoner Gore, to desire Gore to bring him all the Money he could raise. The Messenger shewed me the Directions, and we got a Warrant and search'd Gore's Room, where we found a Pair of Gloves, and two Knives, that I had lost. Gore was frighted, and said if we would not hurt him he would tell us where the Box was. We promis'd to be favourable if he would confess all he knew; and so he directed us to Emerton's Lodgings. Upon that we discharg'd Gore, only the Justice bound him over to be an Evidence against Emerton. But after this Gore sent my Punch-Ladle to pawn (which he told us before that he knew nothing of) and so he was taken up again. I and my Husband are poer old Folks, we had taken a great deal of Pains to scrape a little Money together; and that Rogue Emerton ( tho' I had given him a good Dinner that Day) robb'd us of all, and left us but 3 pence ha'peny in the World.</p>

               <p>C. Where did the Box use to stand?</p>
               <p>M. H. In the inner Room just by the Door, and near the Chimly Corner; He had it partly under his Coat; but I saw the Lock.</p>
               <p>Nathaniel Lake. On the 19th of December, Mrs. Holder, told me, Emerton had robb'd her, I wish you had told me so before, says I, for I had an Opportunity of taking him. However, I met with him in St. Giles's, on the 26th of December, and carry'd him to her House, tho' he run from me by the Old Playhouse, but I catch'd him again. As we were carrying him in a Coach to Newgate, he pray'd me to go to Gore's Lodging, (in Colston's-Court in Drury Lane) and desire Gore to send him some Money. I told Mrs. Holder of this, she got a Warrant, we search'd Gore's Room, and found a pair of Gloves and two Knives there, which she own'd; when Gore saw that, he said, Don't hurt me, and I'll tell you where the Box is; and so he directed us to Emerton's Lodgings where we found it. We asked Gore, if he knew where the silver Spoons and Ladle were? and he said, he knew nothing of them.</p>
               <p>Gore. There were Things in the Box of greater values than the Ladle and Spoons, why should you ask after them only ?</p>
               <p>Lake. Mrs. Holder did ask for several other Things, but I did not.</p>

I insisted Mr. Lake in taking Emerton, and as we were carrying him in a Coach to Newgate, he writ down Gore's Name with Chalk upon my Hat, and desired me to tell Gore to bring all the Money he had to him directly. We got a Warrant, and found the Gloves and Knives at Gore's, and he told us where the Box was: I remember in particular this broken Ring and this Snuff Box, which Mrs. Holder owns, were found in Emerton's Room.</p>

            , of whom I had some Knowledge, the Handle was broke off; says I, you have made strange work with this Ladle? Ay, says he, a sad Accident happened when this was done, for a China Punch bowl was broke at the same time. So I jump'd over the Counter, and seiz'd him, What do you mean 'Saule me? No, says I, but I'll pepper you, if you don't tell me how you came by that. He told me, he had it from Gore, who was at an Alehouse (the Sign of the Theatre) in Drury-Lane ; I went thither, and found Gore a playing at Cards; but he play'd the wrong Card then. Says Tool, that's the Man I had the Ladle from, and Gore after some Shuffling, and pretending that his Wife save it to Tool, at last confess'd that he himself delivered it to Tool.</p>

            , Headborough. Gore let us search his Room readily, and told us where the Box was, at Emerton's Lodging in Wells-Court by St. Giles's Pound; there was a Shirt hanging in Gore's Room, and says he, When Emerton sent you to me for Money, I suppose he meant I should pawn this Shirt.</p>
               <p>Gore. They took away a pair of my Shoes, I hope I may have them again?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Holder. Yes, there was a pair of Shoes that are none of mine, and they are in the Box there.</p>
               <p>Court. Then as they are not yours, and he claims them, let him have them: Officer, give those Shoes to the Prisoner, and if there's any thing else that belongs to him, let him have it.</p>
               <p>Gore. I thank your Lordship, I claim nothing else.</p>
               <p>Emerton. I had used Mrs. Holder's Cellar 3 Weeks Night and Day, and I happening<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173301120016"></xptr> to meet with a young Man of my Acquaintance, John, says he, I can't come out for fear of being arrested; but there's a Box of mine in Mrs. Holder's Room, which I want very much, and if you will be so kind as to bring it to me, I shall be much obliged to you. You may take it away without any more to do, for no Body will ask you any Questions about it. So I took the Box and carried it up. The Girls called after me, and I told 'em I was coming again presently.</p>
               <p>Court. And why did you not return according to your Promise, or at least acquaint the Prosecutor with it?</p>
               <p>Emerton. My Friend kept me to drink with him longer than I expected, and besides I ow'd her a little Money, about 3 s. which I could not pay her till I had Remittances out of the Country, which I afterwards received indeed; but my Friend hearing of it, he desired me to lend him 15 s. upon the Ladle and the Rings, which I did, and then he told me he had some other odd Trifles in the Box, which I might make Use of if I had occasion, and so I took the Box to my Room; but he not returning me the 15s. at the time he promised, and I wanting Money, I gave the things to Gore's Wife to pawn, and she brought me 6 s.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a lodging-house in Upper East Smithfield—I saw the prisoner with a comrade on 29th March, about ten o'clock in the evening—when I returned home he was arguing with my wife about t a shirt that had been left for his shipmate's lodgings a night or two previous—I said if he gave the money for the shirt he should have it—he said if it was I not given to him he would break and smash everything in the place—he repeated that two or three times—I said if he meant to do anything of that sort, it would be best for him to go outside, or I should be under the necessity of putting him out—he and his companion went out, and were arguing outside for about five minutes—the prisoner then called me to the bottom of the court—he said, "Do you wish to fight? God—you"—I said, "No,"and he made a stab at me—I warded off the blow with my left arm, and my left sleeve was cut—I had received a cut in the breast—I went up to him and said, "Do you mean that?"—he made no answer—I struck him, and his shipmate dragged him away towards the London Dock gates—I got assistance, and stopped him about one hundred yards off—I left him in custody—I was told that I was stabbed; I was not aware of it; I looked and found the blood trickling down from my breast—I had not seen any instrument—I was taken to the doctor's.</p>

                  </hi>. I found this dagger on the 29th March, about ten yards from where Roberts was stabbed, in the road opposite the London Dock entrance, covered with blood and mud—I took it home, and gave it to my landlady—it was given to the officer—the prisoner bad passed over the spot. <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES JOHNSTON BROWN</hi>. I am a surgeon, of Upper East Smithfield—Roberts came to me with a punctured wound on the chest, between one and two inches deep, striking the fifth rib, and glancing downwards—it was dangerous—if it had not glanced off the rib, the probability is that it would have punctured the heart—such an instrument as this dagger would no doubt have produced it</p>

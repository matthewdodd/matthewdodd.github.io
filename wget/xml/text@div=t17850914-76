               <p>Was any thing removed out of its place? - I do not know that there was, I was on the outside; and I was informed there was a person at my window, and when I came I found him in the situation I have described; he did not seem to say any thing till after he got to the watch-house, then he shammed drunk a good deal.</p>
               <p>Was he in liquor? - Yes, I believe he was, he appeared so at the watch-house.</p>

               <p>On the 25th of July, about nine in the evening, I was coming down Denzell-street, and I saw the prisoner reaching in at the window, I came round, and spoke to Mr. Bowers, and he went round and caught him; I do not know whether he could have got in or no.</p>
               <p>Had not he time to take any thing? - If there was any thing within his reach he might.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutor. Was there any thing within his reach? - Yes, but I did not miss any thing.</p>
               <p>How was your window fastened? - There is no regular fastening, the shutters were not put up, the sash was not fastened; it was pushed up by somebody; it was down a quarter or half an hour before; we do not open it once in a quarter of a year.</p>

               <p>I came by this place very much in liquor; I do not know whether I was in the window or not, I guess I was leaning on it; I have not a friend in the world.</p>
               <p>Was day-light gone? - I could see him perfectly well in the position he was by the remaining light of the day.</p>

That when he came to the Stair Head, Mrs. Butler was there; and he went into the Room to the Deceased, and Prisoner, on the outside of the Table, to take away their Swords, and she following him, went into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172407080007"></xptr> the Room, and on the inside of the Table.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner in his Defence, pleaded, That he had no Malice against the Deceased, but that they had been together most Part of the Afternoon, and had been at Marybone, and having return'd, in the Hay Market, the Prisoner Ann Butler was going along, and Mr. Southwel would have have had him gone to her, and engage her to go with them; but he refusing it, he went himself, and forced her to go with them; and that being there at the Tavern, a drinking, he was talking to Mrs. Butler, at which the Deceased took Exceptions, and grew very Quarrelsome, and said, D - n him, he did not know what he meant by engrossing her all to himself, and took up her Gloves and Fan, and oblig'd her to sit next to him, and swore she should go with him that Night, and lend him a Guinea. That thereupon he told him it was hard he should force a Woman to go with him whether she would or not. Upon which his Rage increased, and the Deceased bit him a Slap on the Face, and soon after drew his Sword, and advanced towards him, and he was oblig'd to take to his Sword, in his own Defence, and had almost fallen down in getting himself ready to receive his Attack. That he received a Wound in his Hand in the Encounter. The Prisoner call'd several Persons of Reputation and Honour, who gave the Deceased the Character of a very quarrelsome Person, of which they gave Instances, and that he himself was of a very quiet and peaceable Disposition and civil Behaviour. Ann Butler in her Defence pleaded, That as she was going along in the Hay Market, the Deceased came to her, clapping her on the Shoulder, swearing that she should go with him; that she desired him to excuse her, telling him, she was going to pay a Visit to a Gentlewoman, and drink a Dish of Tea with her; But the Deceased was Outragious, and swore, if she did not go with him he would Mob her: That she reply'd, rather than her self and he should be exposed she would go drink a Pint of Wine with him. and did go to the Busy Body Tavern, and while they were there drinking, Mr. Lutterel being talking to her, Mr. Southwel said, D - n him, he was a quere sort of a Fellow to engross the Woman all to himself, telling him he would have Satisfaction; Mr. Lutterel reply'd, Another Time would be better; the Deceased reply'd, No Time like the present, and drew his Sword, and that Mr. Lutterel had like to have been down, falling backwards before he could get his Sword drawn, and himself in a Posture to defend himself, that not being able to pacify him, she immediately ran to the Stair Head, and called out violently for Help, and the Servant came up and took away their Swords, as had been before depos'd.

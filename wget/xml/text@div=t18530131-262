The prisoner came to my shop on Friday, 7th Jan., about 8 o'clock in the evening, for a pennyworth of hooks and eyes—she offered me in payment a bad shilling—I cut it in halves and returned the pieces to her—I asked her where she got the shilling; she said a gentleman gave it her—she came to my shop again the same evening, about twenty minutes afterwards—I was called into the shop the second time she came, and I found her there—I asked what she wanted; she said a reel of cotton—it would come to a halfpenny—she said a young lady was going to serve her—I told her I would do so—she gave me another bad shilling—I told her it was bad, and asked her where she got it from; she said a gentleman had just given it her—I told her that was what she said before, and I should not let her off that time—she had come half an hour before—I gave her into custody, and gave the second bad shilling to the constable.</p>

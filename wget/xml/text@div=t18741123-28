I am a widow, and reside at East Dulwich—on" the evening of 29th October, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I was at the Ludgate Hill Station, going to Peckham Rye—the train was drawn up, and I was going to get in, when two or three men hustled in front of me, and prevented me getting into the second-class carriage I was going to get in—I found my bag open, and missed my purse, and ran after the prisoner—my purse had been in my bag not five minutes before—the prisoner was one of the men who hustled me—he got into a first-class carriage, and I</p>

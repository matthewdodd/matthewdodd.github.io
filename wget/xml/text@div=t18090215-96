               <p>Q. When did you lose your watch - A. Last Monday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150048"></xptr>week, about four o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by some person in the room; the prisoner laid in that room; he was not at home when I went to bed. About four o'clock I was awoke by some person at my bedside; I called to know what it was; the person answered so low I could not tell who he was; I put my hand over the bed side and felt the prisoner, and I felt for my watch in my hat; I found it was gone. I put my hat under the bed, and my watch in my hat; I called to the prisoner again, he said he was looking for something of his own; I told him there was nothing about my bed that belonged to him. I got up, and found my clothes in different directions to where I had left them. The prisoner asked me if I was going to get up; he said it was too early for me at present; I told him I knew my business, I must go and call my master up. I got up, called my master up, and gave charge of the prisoner; the watchman secured him; by that time my master was up; he came out with a light. I saw the prisoner's hand move; the watch was picked up by my master about two or three yards off, in the direction that the prisoner's hand moved.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. How many lodged in that room - A. Four; my bedfellow was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. You and the prisoner had been very good friends - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not friends, you were very great enemies - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went out of the house first, you or the prisoner - A. I went out first, and the prisoner closely followed me.</p>
               <p>Q. You never complained to the prisoner of his taking your watch - A. I did not, I was afraid of the prisoner; I knew there was another man in the room besides. I never had any quarrel with the prisoner.</p>

            . At four o'clock on Monday morning I was alarmed by a knock at my door, I thought it was the man come to his work; there came a second knock. I went out undressed. The moment I opened my door, my man exclaimed the prisoner had robbed him; I asked him of what, he said his watch, and he was afraid of some money, but he was not certain, as he found his clothes misplaced. I told my man and the watchman to see that he did not throw any thing away. The moment I spoke the word, I saw the prisoner's hand go back, as if he threw something away; I told the watchman that he had thrown something away. I got a candle and looked for what he had thrown away, in that direction; I picked up a watch four yards from him; then I went with the watchman to the watchhouse and left him there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I suppose the glass of the watch was broke - A. No, it was not, it was bruised.</p>
               <p>JOHN - . I am a watchman. Soon after four the prosecutor came to me in a very great hurry, with his clothes half on; he said a man had robbed him, he said this is the man, he has got my watch; I laid hold of the prisoner with my left hand, he gave a struggle to disengage my hand; he immediately up with his fist; I gave him to understand that if he did not deliver himself to me I would knock him down. We got him nigh to Mr. Warner's door, Mr. Warner opened the door; the prosecutor told him the man had robbed him of his watch; he said take care of him that he does not throw any thing away; instantly he threw his left hand back and let the watch fall in the street. Mr. Warner said he has thrown it away now, watchman. Mr. Warner brought a candle, looked in the direction he saw the hand go, and found the watch three or four yards behind him.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had met some friends, they kept me late; I came home about four o'clock in the morning, I could get no light; I began to tussle about the room; this man began to abuse me, he got up, I asked him where he was going, he said to get a light; I said do not get a light, I can find out my bed; I followed him down, he said he would be up to me some how or other.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

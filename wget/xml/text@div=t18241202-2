            . I belong to this Brig. On the 15th of November I was on board while the shipwright's went to dinner at one o'clock, to watch that no person took anything. I saw the prisoner abaft the vessel. I went forward, and when I came back he was gone. I heard a jingling of the copper under the ship. I looked round and saw him going up the ladder from the bottom of the dock. I asked him why he had been in the dock - he gave me no answer. I saw a sheet of copper in his hand, and sung out "Thief, here is a man stealing copper;" he ran away, and Mr. Hope stopped him. I saw him heave the copper down a sawpit - I jumped down and picked it up. I gave it to the steward - he was quite a stranger.</p>

            . I was in the dock-yard, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I turned, and saw the prisoner running towards the gate followed by Richards; he had a sheet of copper which he threw into a saw-pit. I took hold of him, and the boy jumped into the saw-pit, and took out the copper - it may be worth 5 or 6 s.</p>

            . I was mate of the vessel. I took the prisoner at the gate with Mr. Hope; he begged me not to be too hard, as he had a wife and family. I took him on board - he attempted to jump over the quay; we struggled, and his hat fell off - a quantity of nails fell out of it; they were the same sort as are used for vessels. I saw the copper, it was such as was in the yard.</p>

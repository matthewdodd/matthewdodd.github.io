I had been making too free with drink; I was out some<lb></lb>time before I went in the second time. I was coming home and I met my wife, and all I had I gave to her previously to going in. We went and had something to drink, and the only money I had on me was the twopence which the officer found. The one that the policeman took from my right hand was the one I gave to the barman, and he gave me back. The policeman knows I have a good character.</p>

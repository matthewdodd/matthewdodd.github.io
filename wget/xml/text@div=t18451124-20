I employed the prisoner to take a cow to Mr. Gurney's—he was to deliver it to him to sell, and to bring the money back to me—he did not return—I saw nothing more of him till he was taken into custody—he has not paid me any part of the money—he had worked for me at different times, but had never driven anything for me before.</p>

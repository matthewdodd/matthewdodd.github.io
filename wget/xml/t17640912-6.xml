The next morning, I got up, and left her in bed; I went out, and when in the street, wanted to take a chew of tobacco out of my pouch, and I missed half a guinea; I keep my money in that. I went back, and met her coming with another woman; they were going to get a glass of gin: I asked her if she would give me one? she said she would, and we went in at the Black Horse: then I told her I missed half a guinea; we went back to the house where we lay, and searched the bed, but could not find it; I said, she must have it: we came down stairs; the mistress of the house got up, and I fetched a constable to see if I could make her confess, but she would not. She said, she had no more money about her than half a crown: she was searched before the justice, and half a guinea was found upon her.</p>

            . I was the officer that had the prisoner in charge: she strongly denied having the half guinea, both there, at the watch-house, and before the justice: she wished her eyes might roll about the floor like two marbles, if she had it. When I came to search her, I found 1 s 5 d. farthing, and half a guinea in her pocket.</p>

               <p>That half guinea was given me before I was in trouble, by a man who sailed away the morning before I was taken up.</p>

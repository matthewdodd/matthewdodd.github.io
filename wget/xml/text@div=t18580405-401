(<hi rend="italic">The pieces having been pasted on a sheet of paper, were read as follows:</hi> "24th March, 1858.—Please send word what you are going to do—a small amount, for I consider I have as much right to a share as you; and a share I mean to have, or I shall open the—he sent to you—bothyou, and <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> Jones, and Frank, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> used me scandalous, inasmuch as you have cheated me; I shall be one with you, so don't be surprisedd if—providedyou make some mends—come yourself to the Jacob's Well")—Williamsasked me if I knew what would satisfy Jeffries—I told him I did not know, but I had heard Jeffries say something about a sovereign—he said he could get that sum, but he would have me to know that he was very short of money—he was in difficulties—he had 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make up for this quarter's rent, and if he let Jeffries have any mosey, he must go out and borrow it; and he promised to meet him at the corner of Old Street Road, in the City Road, the same evening—I believe that it a public house.</p>

I am a porter, and five at No. 3, Mew Court, Cripple<lb></lb>gate—Iknow Jones and Jeffries—I remember seeing Williams in the Jacob's Well last Snnday fortnight; he and Jones were together—I spoke to Jones and called him on one side—on the Saturday night before I was at Jacob's Well, I saw Jones there and his brother, and they had some quarrel—Jones' brother said to him outside the house, "If you strike, me, I will <hi rend="italic">split</hi> about the robbery in White Street"—Jones struck him and run away—I saw Jones and Jeffries at the Jacob's Well, on 16th March, they were quarrelling, and Jones threw a piece of coal at Jeffries—Jeffries said to him, "Don't be so fast"—Jones said, "You are telling people you are going to <hi rend="italic">lag</hi> me"—Jeffriessaid, "You will have the collar put on quite soon enough"—Jones wanted to fight, and he said to me, "I will tell you all about it."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, H</hi> 20.) On Thursday evening, 2nd Dec., about half-past eight o'clock, I heard a cry of, "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running in Denmark street, about three minutes' walk from the Swedish Flag—he had nothing in his hand—I stopped him, and asked what was the matter—he said they wanted to stab him with a knife—several per<lb></lb>sons came up and said he had stolen a jacket—I took him to the station—the prosecutor and Brown came there, and charged him with stealing it—I have not seen the jacket since—I have searched at the pawnbrokers.'</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he complain of being ill-used? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I could not understand a word he said, only by the interpreter—he said he had been struck—I looked in his face—there appeared no mark of violence—I could not see that he had been struck—he had no jacket on—he was in his waist<lb></lb>coat, trowsers, and shirt-sleeves—he had a cap on—the prisoner understands English a little—he heard the interpreter give an explanation of what had occurred to the prosecutor, and he said he knew nothing about it—I could not find any reason for his running away.</p>

We went to the Justice's House, but he was not at Home, so that we waited for him at an Ale-house till 2 o'Clock in the Morning. The Boy then own'd that he took 3 Cows from the Common, but that one of them got away at Kingsland-Road ; and that the Keeper of the Green-yard gave him Money for driving one Mr. Gran's Horse-thither</p>

            , again The Cow that got from the Boy came Home again The Day before I lost these Cows. I had 2 Horses taken away in the same Manner, and conveyed to the Green-yard, where they made me pay 6 s. 8 d. for one Night, before they would let me have them again. When the Boy was taken, I desir'd the Woman of the Green-yar to go with me, to see if he was the same Boy that brought my Horses to her, but she would not go, tho' I offer'd her a Coach. Not only I, but all my Neighbours round me have had their Cows or Horses carried to the Green-yard in this manner, which has been a great Charge to us; for we are forced to pay extravagantly to get them out again. The Owner of the Green-yard gives a Shilling a-piece to any Body that brings Beasts thither, which is a great Encouragement for these Vagabonds to take them out of our Fields, or off the Common.

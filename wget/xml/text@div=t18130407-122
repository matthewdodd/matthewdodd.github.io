               <p>Q. On the 24th of February, did you happen accidentally to go the private front door of your house - A. Yes, and I saw the porter take a roll of carpeting; he turned towards the left. Upon seeing this, I called out stop thief; the prisoner told him to go on; he went on, and when he returned, I asked him where he had taken it; he said to Marr's, the prisoner's lodging. I desired the porter to bring it back; he did not bring it back, nor did I ever get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070078"></xptr>it back again, although I sent the porter back for it, nor I never saw the prisoner after he went away with the carpeting. In consequence of this, I wrote to my husband; he was in town; and informed him of the transaction. I never saw any more of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did not the prisoner give you a note of the goods that were taken - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor stick it up in the shop - A. I never saw it. I know he took himself off.</p>

            . I am an upholsterer; I carry on business at Reading. In the month of February I hired the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you hired him, after you and he agreed for wages that he was to receive, was anything said about the mode of payment - A. Yes; the prisoner said he should like to take it when it was something considerable, once in three months: that he had a freehold estate of fifty pounds a year; therefore he should not want his wages but once in three months, but in the interim, if he should want a pound or so, he should always ask for it. He came into my employ on the 1st of January. I came to town on the 24th of February, and on the next day, I received a letter from my wife, which induced me to look out for the prisoner. I went with a coach to the corner of Sloane-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was the amount of wages he was to have due to him - A. The balance was about six pounds. He was only five weeks in my service. I was to pay him two guineas a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he left the country did he make any application to you to discharge the balance - A. None whatever. I went in an hackney coach to the corner of Sloane-street. I saw a gentleman's carriage go down he road; I saw the prisoner in that coach. I got out of the hackney coach; I then went to the gentleman's coach; there I found the prisoner, and the carpet; I immediately said, you infernal rascal, I have a letter in my hand, and it is just enabled me to stop you. I immediately pulled the carpet out of the coach, and the prisoner got out likewise. I then said, I would take him to the magistrate; he said he would not go. I went to a magistrate; and when I returned the prisoner was gone. I afterwards watched daily for the prisoner, at Basing-lane. I found him there on Monday, the 1st of March. Immediately as the prisoner came into the Inn-yard, I went up to him. I told him, he had given me a great deal of trouble, but now I hoped he would go with me, as I was determined to take him to Bow-street. At first he said he would not go. I told him I had that in my pocket, that would make him go, but I did not wish to make any noise in the street, if he would go quietly. I told him that to induce him. I had neither fire arms, or warrant. He agreed to go with me; and I wished to go the nearest way. I told him if he would go quietly with me, we would go to Bow-street; he broke off, into lanes, and narrow passages; that I had not been accustomed to. He said he wanted to call upon a person of the name of Taylor to accompany him to Bow-street. I went on with him as far as a court at Charing-cross. He went up the court; I followed him. About the middle of the court he turned round, and gave me two violent blows on my head, and knocked me down. I called murder. There were a great many persons came round at the bottom of the court. I went down to the bottom of the court, and asked the bye standers, whether they knew of an officer. An officer was procured. I went with the officer to the door of the house that was open, at the top of the court; I saw the prisoner, a man, and a woman. The officer took him in custody; the officer said, I had charged him with a felony. The officer took him to Bow-street; I accompanied them. The prisoner was examined before Mr. Read.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner ever made any application to you for wages - A. Never for the balance. The 24th of February, was on Wednesday. On my coming to town for two or three days, I told him I should stop in town until Saturday. On account of the assizes being a busy time, I asked him whether he should want any money, between that and Saturday. He said no, he did not. I throwed down a pound note; I said you had better take that in case you should want any money, between that and Saturday. He said, no, he should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever, before you came to town, apply to you to purchase a piece of carpet - A.Never; nor did he ever ask me to take a piece of carpet out of the house, nor did he ever mention his intention of coming to London, or that he ever meaned to leave my service. I never was so much surprised as on receiving the letter from my wife; I read the letter three times over; I could not believe it. I had just given him a fresh job to do, which would occupy him till my return. I value that piece of carpet by the invoice, at sixteen pounds.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LYNE. I am a porter in the employ of Mr. Webb. On the 24th of February, I was porter to Mr. Webb, and on the 24th of February the prisoner desired me to take this carpet to his lodging. I took it out of the door, where the women work. He gave me no orders which door I was to take it out. I had no reason for taking it out that way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did your mistress send you to get that carpet back - A. Yes I could not get it, because it was taken up stairs, and Marr had secured it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you in the warehouse one day, when your master and Marr ever talking about this carpet - A. Yes. The prisoner said he could not give more than five shillings a yard for it.</p>

               <p>GEORGE CLARK. I am coachman to Mrs. Crosssley, 67, St. James's-street. I had been out with my carriage, on the 26th of February. Some days I go twice a day to Kensington.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember taking up any man, with a carpet - A. I do; the prisoner appears to be the man; he looks much elder than I thought he was. I cannot swear to the person. I drank with the man, he was in the tap-room, when I met with him. He said he wanted an hackney coach, and there was not one. I took him to Brompton; then my fellow servant called an hackney coach. At that time gentleman came up, and opened the carriage door; he said his property was there. The man said it was not his property. They both said it was their property. Mr. Webb pulled the carpet out, and desired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181304070079"></xptr>me to take care of it while he got a constable. The prisoner said it was his property, and then ran away.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Robert Lewis King, of Norfolk-street, Southwark Bridge-road. The prisoner is my son, but not my husband's son—my husband and I were tried for felony—it was for keeping goods sent to us to mangle—we were acquitted—we had the goods in the house, but we did not know who they belonged to—before we were acquitted the prisoner came for the key of the house, to take care of the things—when we were acquitted, we went back to the house, found it quite empty, and the key given up to the land-lord—we lost the whole of our household furniture—18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not replace them—I have seen the things produced—I am confident this gown and shawl are mine—the other things are my husband's, and were in the house when we were taken to prison.</p>

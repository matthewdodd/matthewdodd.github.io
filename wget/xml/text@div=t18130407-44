            . I am a constable belonging to the Thames police. I was stationed in the London Dock as constable. The prisoner was employed there by the contractor, Mr. Hobbs. He was a <rs id="t18130407-44-deflabel242" type="occupation">bricklayer's labourer</rs>

I suspected he had got something in his hat, by the motion of his hat. I asked him, what he had got in his hat. He said, nothing at all. I said, I shall not be satisfied until I search you. I took his hat off. These rivets were inside of his hat. I found nine new copper rivets. I asked him how he came by them. He told me he picked them out of some rubbish down by the steam engine, where he was at work. There was not the least appearance of rubbish or dirt sticking to them when I first took them from him. When I took him in custody he said he was very sorry he had done it; he wished he had let the rivets alone. They are the property of the London Dock Company. They were brought in for the repair of the steam engine; it was under repair.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I was employed at the London Docks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at work at the Engine-house at the London Docks - A. Yes, he was. On the 17th of February, I received eight dozen rivetts; they were cast in the London Dock by their own smith. I missed a dozen of them. I have seen the rivetts produced by the officer. I believe them to be a part of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was ten days at work there as a bricklayer's labourer. I picked up these things. I did not know what use they were. I put them in my hat, and as I was going towards the gate, this man said, what have you got in your hat. I said, nothing. He took my hat off, and found these things. I picked them up out of the rubbish.</p>

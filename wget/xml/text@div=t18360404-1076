                  </hi>. I am a constable, and live in Greville-street, Somers<lb></lb>town. On the 10th of March, I was in Kentish-town, near the Castle—I saw the prisoners at the bottom of the town, in the King's-road, in company together—Hoskins then left North, and went into Mr. Davis's a cheese<lb></lb>monger's shop—North came towards me by the Castle—Hoskins then came out of Davis's shop with some cheese in his hand—he came to the corner, and whistled—I went to Mr. Davis's shop, and got a shilling there, which I now produce—I told Coxall to follow me—we went down to the corner of the town, and saw the two prisoner standing together at the corner of some railing—Coxall took Hoskins, and I took North—I saw North's hand at his coat-pocket—I told him not to throw any thing away—I looked, and saw these three shillings down at his back—I did not see him drop them—they were just inside the wooden rails, and close against his feet—I took the prisoners to a public-house, but found nothing on them.</p>

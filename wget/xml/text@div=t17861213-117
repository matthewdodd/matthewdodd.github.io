I saw him at dinner time that day; he went out after dinner time; I cannot tell what time; nothing was found; only a knee-buckle and a knife, that I am certain were in my coat pocket, they were found in the landlady's room in a pair of breeches of the prisoner, which he left there the night before he went away.</p>
               <p>How do you know those breeches belonged to the prisoner? - I have seen him two or three days before he went away, and he owned them to be his. He absconded on the Tuesday night. I lost these things; they were found on the Tuesday night. Between eight and nine I met him in Holborn; he passed me; I thought it was the same, and I followed him back, and I saw it was him, and I collared him, and charged him with the robbery; he said, by heavens, I should not hold him; I told him, that hold him I should. When I charged him with the robbery, he said he heard I had lost some clothes: I said, how came you to hear that, when you have never been at the place since? I took him back to my lodgings again, and sent for this constable, and sent him to the round-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What time did you leave off work on the Tuesday night? - About eight.</p>
               <p>Was you from your lodging from the time you dined till you left off work? - As soon as I got my dinner, about half after one. I was not at home from that time. I came home at eight.</p>

               <p>Is this young woman here that you gave the breeches to, to mend? - No.</p>

               <p>I was in Garrick Street about 11.45 p.m. on. 17th September—I had a gold watch and chain—I did not notice any one till I got to the Garrick Club, when two men passed just in front of me, and two other men were behind me, and the left-hand man struck me under the chin, and with the other hand caught my watch and chain, and tried to knock my hat over my eyes with a little stick—I got hold of part of the chain and kept it in my hand, and caught hold of the stick and knocked him back—I cried "Police!" and the left-hand man ran across the road—I thought be had my watch and chain, and I ran after him and tried to knock him down, and the prisoner struck me behind and knocked me down—I fell against the lamp-post and broke my arm and split my knee—the prisoner was then taken in custody—I said to the constable in his presence, "That is the thief who knocked me down"—he replied "I tried to help you up"—the constable helped me up and no one else—it was found at the hospital that my arm was fractured at the shoulder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had only had a pint of beer and threepenuyworth of biscuits—I had been to the Swiss Hotel and nowhere else—the whole affair took no more than two minutes'—I did not say it was one of the number who stood there, but it was not either of the other two—I first of all said I had lost my watch—I was stripped at the station, and asked the policeman to look into my waistcoat pocket, and my watch was found there and I was surprised—I told the constable about the prisoner striking me with a stick, and I asked the prisoner if that was his stick and he said "No."</p>

On 17th September, about 12.30 a.m., I saw the prosecutor in Garrick Street lying on the ground—three persons stood four or five yards away, and he said "Some one there has robbed me"—I asked him if he could recognise either of the two men—he said "No," and he recognised the prisoner, who was standing against the shutters—the prisoner said he helped to pick him up—the prosecutor said "You did not help me to get up, I got up myself—I saw him get up—part of the watch chain was found in the prosecutor's hand and the watch was in his pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was standing there during this conversa<lb></lb>tion—the prosecutor had been drinking nothing was found upon the prisoner—the prosecutor first said he had lost his watch, and at the station it was found in his possession—he said nothing to me about a man striking him with a stick—I saw a small stick about 15 inches long in the prose<lb></lb>cutor's hand—he said at the police-station that he had hurt his arm, and that some one had pushed him down—he did not say he had let go of one man and followed another—he charged the prisoner with being concerned with three others not in custody for stealing part of the chain and assault<lb></lb>ing him.</p>

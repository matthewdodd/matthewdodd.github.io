             sworn.</p>
               <p>I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, I do not know when they were taken, it is about six weeks since I missed them; the prisoner was my <rs id="t17850629-13-deflabel67" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17850629-13-defend161 t17850629-13-deflabel67"></join>, she left me to go to lay in; she took lodgings for that purpose in York Buildings; she used to come and use me very ill, called me old rogue, scoundrel, and villain, because I would not take her in again I suppose. I had only bid her go about her business; I have lived in that house going on sixty years; I had a warrant for her to take her up, to make her give bail for her better behaviour for the future.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. I fancy I shall make an end of this business, by a word or two with this old gentleman; you thought it was a good thing to get her bailed , then you had her? - I had nothing but honour and honesty in me.</p>
               <p>That is certain, my old buck! - She had left my service about a year and a quarter.</p>
               <p>How many of your apprentices boarded and lodged with her by your desire? - There was one, and I gave a bond to his relation that he should be at liberty at five years .</p>
               <p>That is, in defiance of law, and in spite of the indentures, you gave them up in five years; did not this young man, your apprentice live with her? - He did live with her, he cohabited with her.</p>
               <p>Is not she a married woman? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>What do you believe? - He lay out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290023"></xptr> my house, and lay with her; no more of my apprentices went there; here is one that went backward and forward.</p>
               <p>So that a year and a half after you took her up for stealing these things; was you there when they were found? - The constable told me they were in a public room.</p>
               <p>- DUPREE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Thornes , I have been out of my time between three and four years; I saw the looking-glass, the pictures, and the china; I knew them to be Mr. Thorne's property, because the pictures had hung all my apprenticeship in my room.</p>
               <p>Do you know who took them away? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What sort of pictures were there ? - Old pictures.</p>
               <p>What might be the value of them for any other purpose but keeping out the wind? - I do not know; I had been at this woman's house to get the apprentice to work, he used to board and lodge there.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I have witnesses where I bought some of these things, an d he has had my sheets and blankets, and some of my blankets remained upon the apprentice's bed.</p>

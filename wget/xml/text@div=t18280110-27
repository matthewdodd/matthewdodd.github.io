I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

On Sunday, the 23d of December, I had four or five horses, in a meadow; there was a gray mare among them; they are put in the straw-yard at night, and the gate is locked; my son went to the straw-yard in the morning, and gave me information, before I was up - I did not go to the yard myself, but came directly to Smithfield, and from there to Cow-cross - I got no intelligence of it that day; it was nearly fourteen hands and a half high, and was cheap at 6l. - I left my address at several slaughter-houses, and on the Friday following, on my way to town, I fell in with a young man on the coach, who was going to town to look after a horse; we agreed to go together; we found a horse in Sharp's-alley, Cow-cross, which that young man claimed; the name of Staples was mentioned there, and from information, which I got, I directed Davis and Bradley to meet me at the King's Head public-house, at Smithfield - I went there that afternoon, and found Davis and Staples in conversation together, about a roan horse, claimed by the young man - Davis then said, I had lost a grey mare; the marks of it were described to Staples, and he said, "I had that mare on Monday morning, and I killed her at Shepherd's-bush, (where he lived), and sent her dead to Watt's in Sharp's-alley" - I did not go to Watts' myself; he said he bought her of William Godfrey; he did not mention Brier's name to me, but I went to Brier's, in Castle-street, Saffron-hill; in consequence of what one White said, some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100027"></xptr>legs of horses were pointed out to me - I selected two, which I was certain were two legs of my grey mare - Beldom, the farrier, who had shod them, also saw them. I have no doubt of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Staples said instantly, that he had had that mare; A. Yes - I should not have known it if he had not told me; he said he had it from Godfrey and sold it to Watts, who is a horse-slaughterer, or something.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many legs were there at this place? A. I suppose sixty in that beap; there might be a hundred or two in all, but most of them were cart horses; there were a great many grey legs - I only looked for the two fore-legs of mine, as there was no mark on the hind ones; the legs had no shoes on.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Describe the marks? A. One foot was over-shot at the joint; it was a very bad foot; both the fore-feet were fired, and they corresponded in colour.</p>

The prosecutor came to me in Smithfield, on the 24th of December; Bradley, another officer, was with me - I saw the prosecutor again in Smithfield, on the Friday, and saw Staples there, and after he had told me about another horse - I asked if he had ever bought another of Godfrey, whom he had mentioned; he said, Yes; it was a grey mare, a cripple, and that he had given 15s. for it; that he had brought it to Sharp's-alley, and sold it to Watts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did he not tell you every thing candidly and accurately, to lead to a discovery? A. He did.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Did he say any thing about expecting another horse? A. Yes; he said if I would go to Shepherd's-bush, he was sure the man could be taken into custody, as he had promised to bring him a blind horse there; and he would take him himself, if there was nobody else - I went to Staples' house, at Shepherd's-bush that evening(Friday the 28th); he said, "Oh! you are come - I expected some of you - I hope he may come to-morrow, according to his promise;" he said, if I slept at the White Horse public-house, he would detain him, if he came, and send for me - I asked if he had a book, in which he kept the name of the parties, as he had told me that he kept one; instead of producing the book; he gave me this bit of paper (reads), "I have received of Mr. Staples, the sum of 15s. Wm. Godfrey." I slept at the White Horse, and next morning, about eight o'clock, his little boy came running, and said Godfrey was there - I went immediately to Staples' stable, and found Godfrey there - I said, "Oh! this is the man;" "Yes," said Staples, "this is the man" - I said to Godfrey, "This is a bad job;" he said, "Yes, it is," and said he was very sorry for what had happened - I said, "You must go to town with me" - Staples went with us, as far as the White Horse - I took Godfrey to town by the coach, begging Staples to follow me, which he did; on my way to town, I asked Godfrey what he got for each of the horses - I did not threaten or promise him any thing; he instantly told me 15s. for each - I took him to the Compter, then to Guildhall, and from there to Bow-street - Staples attended at Guildhall, as a witness, voluntarily; he was there before me, and with us to Bow-street- I have since that been to Staples' premises - I found two horses in the first stable, and two or three men there- I found some carts which are used to carry dead horses to town.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any lamp near where you were robbed? - A. Yes, directly where I was robbed; the prisoner did not speak to me till she took hold of my arm; the money was in the same pocket-book with the notes.</p>
               <p>Q.How long might this be going on? - A. Not above a minute or two; when she was found again in Cheapside she was somewhat different in dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her face distinctly? - A. Yes; she was searched immediately, but no property found, none of it has been since found; when I challenged her with it, she said something, but I do not recollect what.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, knowing this to be a capital charge, that the prisoner is the woman? - A. I can do it with the greatest safety.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the change of her dress? - A. She had a large fur tippet round her neck when she was taken, I cannot say whether she had a cloak on or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a clerk out of place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live last? - A. With Messrs. Shirley and Boddy, distillers, in Warwick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been out of place? - A. Near six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been looking for a place lately? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you were paid your wages when you came away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. May I take the liberty of asking how much you received? - A. About ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Your loss, upon this occasion, is about seventeen pounds, seven shillings? - A. Yes; I believe it is more.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you not asked what your loss was, in order to obtain a search-warrant? - A. He did not grant a warrant, because it was out of the city that her apartments were.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, upon your oath, did you speak of more than one two pound note? - A. I do not exactly know what I said before my Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. I see the commitment is for one two pound note, and six one pound notes? - A. Those that I spoke of before my Lord-Mayor, were only those that I could swear to, by the endorsement upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know, that before the Lord-Mayor, you were sworn to tell the truth, and the whole truth; now, did you tell the whole truth? - A. I did not tell exactly, only what I could swear to.</p>

I then went to the watchman who stands at the end of Bread-street, and asked him if he had seen her; in consequence of what he said, I went down Cheapside, but could not see her; coming back again, I saw some women the corner of Milk-street, the first person I laid hold of was this Mrs. Appleby.</p>
               <p>Q.Who do you mean by Mrs. Appleby? - A.The prisoner at the bar.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. She was found in Cheapside, the place where the robbery was committed? - A. Yes.</p>

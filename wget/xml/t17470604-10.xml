               <p>Mr Cummins said to the same Purpose.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. Will you ask these two Witnesses any Questions.</p>

               <p>Court. But in answer to that, both Mr. Chambrie and Cummins say they saw you take it off from the Box. Besides, as a Proof of what they have said, if it had been upon the Ground it must have very dirty, but it was very clean.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner rested much upon his Character, and the great Services he had done to his King and Country; that he had been Abroad with the Duke, and had receiv'd a Wound, &amp;c.

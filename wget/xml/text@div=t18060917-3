               <p>Q. You have no doubt of her person. - A. None in the least, she asked me how I sold cabbages a dozen, I asked her one shilling and sixpence, she agreed for half a dozen for nine pence, she took half a dozen and tendered me this half crown, which I took from her; I gave her in change a good shilling and a sixpence, and three pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the half crown then for a good one. A. Yes, I did; about half an hour after I recollected the person I took the half crown of, as I had no other half crown in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it strike you at the time that you had some knowledge of her. - A. Yes, I then said to my man, do you think you should know her, as I thought myself I should know her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity on that day of seeing her again. - A. A little before seven on that morning she came to me again and asked me how I sold my onions, I asked her sixpence a bunch, she offered me another half crown, directly I perceived that was a very bad one, I pulled the other out of my pocket, I examined them together, and perceived they were nearly alike; I am sure it is the same woman, I looked at her very hard; says I, mistress, you bought some cabbages of me in the morning, which she denied; she hurried me for the change, said that I was mistaken for she was but just up and had come to market; I did not give her the change, she had the onions in her hand, I told her I would go and get her the change, intending to get a constable; I says to my man, take care of her till I come back; when I came back she was gone without her change; in about half an hour after I saw her again the other side of the market with Mrs. Oakes, cheapening a bunch of carrots, and she was offering a bad shilling; I asked her why she did not come for the change of her onions, then she answered me, give me the change, I took her in custody immediately, I was present when she was searched by the constable;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170005"></xptr>as we were going to Spitalfields watchhouse the constable perceived something in her hand, he was going to press it out of her hand, she said she would give it to me, which she did, it was a bad shilling; when she was searched there was one shilling and two sixpences found upon her, all good.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt at all whether that is the person who gave you the first half crown. - A. None in the least.</p>

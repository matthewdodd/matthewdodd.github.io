               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was Marshall to receive money in any form? A. He has received money for goods delivered, but that was contrary to my wish - Satchell was six or seven years with me, and bore a good character.</p>

            . I am clerk at this inn. On the 6th of April twenty-seven articles were brought to our place for Mr. Mount, of Foley-place - they came from Swallowfield, in Berkshire - the carriage would be 10s. when delivered - Marshall's duty was to enter them in the book when they went out - I have looked into the book at this date, and several other dates - they are not entered at all; here is an entry in the general ledger, "twelve boxes, Friday, April the 6th, Mr. Mount, K.A. (meaning King's Arms,)" and under it is this line, "To be left till called for, 2s." - I received that 2s. from Marshall.</p>

            . I am butler to Mr. Mount, of No. 3, Foley-place. On the 6th of April I received twenty-seven parcels from Swallowfield, by Satchell - there was another porter in the cart - I paid Satchell four half-crowns, I am certain - there were no other parcels at the King's Arms for which I called and paid - no other parcels came to our house that day - a ticket came with the goods; I put it into my book, and when Mr. Mount settled with me it was put into the fire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How are you sure that you paid four half-crowns? A. I remember having the money in my hand - I had sent to the public-house for change. I gave the prisoner 1s. besides, as he asked for some beer. I think I had seen him before, but could not swear it - he might be three quarters of an hour with me - I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Hearn. I went with Satchell to Foley-place; he delivered twenty-seven parcels. I did not see what money he received.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN JESSOPP. It was Satchell's duty to account to me for what money he received - he never accounted for this 10s.</p>
               <p>G. H. WORRALL. I apprehended Marshell. Mr. Hearn charged him with robbing him - he fell on his knees. As we went along he said Satchell and Oulds had brought him into this. I afterwards searched Satchell, and found a book and some blank tickets in it, with pen and ink to fill them up.</p>

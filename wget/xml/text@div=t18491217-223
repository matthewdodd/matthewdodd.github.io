                  </hi> am assistant to Messrs. Lewis and Allenby, silk-mercers, of Regent-street. On Saturday evening, 8th Dec, about half-past nine o'clock, I was in Hyde-park, returning home from Knightsbridge—I stopped at a public watering-place—the prisoner was there—he said, "It is a very fine night"—I said, "Yes," or nodded assent; nothing more—I left the place immediately and went straight in the direction of Stanhope-gate, which is my straight road home—I found the prisoner following me, and walked very fast, and turned a different way to what he was going, but still saw him following me—I then abruptly crossed the road in a dirty part, to get rid of him, but perceived him still near me—he made two or three remarks as to the closing of the park and the state of the weather—I did not answer him—I had intended crossing Hyde-park, but being dark I did not—I was inside the park, but kept along the light side where the lamps are—I found him still close to me pressing his remarks, I turned suddenly round—he then firmly laid hold of me in the most indecent manner, and said, "I can see you are a gentleman; you must give me some money; you must give me two sovereigns, or I will make a charge against you"—my flap was buttoned up—he said I must pawn my watch—being naturally timid, I became very much alarmed, and having heard of several persons being stopped, I ran across the road, the prisoner still retaining his hold—I then shouted out "Police!" and had hardly done so the third time before two policemen came, and I gave him in charge—I did not lay hold of him, except to keep him off—he could not have seen that I had a watch, unless it was when I was in the place.</p>

               <p>him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very near Apsley-house; within fifty yards of Hyde-park Corner—I was going up the drive by the side of Park-lane—the nearest way was straight across the Park—I had not gone to Knightsbridge for any express purpose that night—business calls me there three parts of my time—I bad gone out on my own business—I always take an hour's walk after the shop closes—I left home at nine—I had intended going down to Brompton, but not feeling very well, I turned to come across the Park, the nearest way home—I did not get three hundred yards from Hyde-park Corner—I walked perhaps 100 yards with the prisoner by my side—I had got 500 yards from the Achilles, more than quarter of a mile—I was much further from the Stanhope-gate—if I had gone far enough, I should have come to it, on the right hand side—I took the left of the watering-place to avoid going the sweep round Apsley-house and save the distance, and avoid going into the dark part—I changed my route when I saw the prisoner at my heels, crossed the road, and went to the left, but only the width of the road—I had intended going out at Stanhope-gate—it is the first gate you come to going up Park-lane from Piccadilly—I had got three or four hundred yards from the watering-place before I turned round—the prisoner retained his hold of my trowsers while I crossed the road—the watering-place is divided; it is for more than one person—I unbuttoned my coat there, I am positive of that—I was very much alarmed, as a young man living with us was knocked down the other night in the New-road, a more public place still—the police came not a quarter of a minute after I called out—they only occupied the time of going from one side of the road to the other.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, A</hi> 41). On Saturday night at eight o'clock I heard a cry of "Police!" and found the prosecutor and prisoner about two yards apart—he charged the prisoner with indecently assaulting him, by taking hold of his person, and with trying to extort money—the prisoner threatened to give him in charge for indecently assaulting him—I looked at them both, and having seen the prisoner in the Park for the last two months, took him—he said, "Do not come near me, I have got—all down me,"and put out his arm—I examined his coat at the station, and found nothing whatever upon it—I found a small packet of rouge in his pocket such as people rub their cheeks with, a duplicate, and fivepence.</p>

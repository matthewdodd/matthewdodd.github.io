                  </hi>. I am living at the Well Street Home—I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Sarah Anderson</hi>, a ship under English colours, which sailed from India in September or October, and arrived in England in December—the prisoner was also a seaman on board—on the morning of September 13th the ship was on the high seas, the prisoner and I had a quarrel a few minutes before 12 o'clock on the evening previous—we had a fight, and the prisoner gave in and went below—I remained on deck—I heard the prisoner say in the forecastle a short time afterwards "I will have the son of a bitch's life;" and afterwards that he would cut my guts out—I was standing against the hatch, preparing to go down into the forecastle—the prisoner rushed up with a sheath knife in one hand and a billet of wood in the other; he rushed at me and attempted to stab me, so (<hi rend="italic">with the knife over his head</hi>)—he made a cut down, which cut my monkey-jacket here (<hi rend="italic">near his throat</hi>)</p>

               <p>—I am left-handed—he ran back to the galley, and I called to the cook to come and lend me a hand—the prisoner said "Yes, Doctor, come out and see fair play while I cut the son of a bitch's b——y guts out"—they call the cook Doctor—the prisoner was running towards me at the time, with the knife still in his right hand, over his head, preparing to make another cut; but I seized him by the wrist with my left hand—he tore the knife from his right hand with his left, and drew it across the finger and thumb of the hand with which I was holding him—it went to my finger bone, but was not much on my thumb—he tried to draw the knife across my throat; but the ship gave a lurch, which brought it across my mouth, and cut my lip—it was not very deep, but it was painful—here is the mark now—I caught the knife with my teeth, and held it fast though he tried to get it away—he was swearing, and saying he would; have my life, all the time of the struggle—I shouted for help, and the mate came and took the knife—the prisoner muttered something, but I could not hear what—I was not laid up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is a sailor's knife—I wear mine tied to my belt—he wore his round his waist—there was not a great sea—he was not standing on a spar the first time he was on the deck—I did not run forward with two boys—one boy came after me; I only saw one—the prisoner may have spoken to me, as well as any other man, about bringing those boys forward—I did not then strike him on the head—I did strike him on the face when he called me names that I would allow no man to call me—the blow did not strike him down—he fell down after we had been ten minutes scuffling—I did not fall on top of him, the spar was between us when we fell—I did not then take hold of his finger or bite the point of it—I did not kick him with the heel of my boot; I could not kick between two feet of timber—I saw his mouth bleeding afterwards—he was feeling for his knife several times during the fight—I did not take my knife out—the prisoner is, I believe, three inches taller than me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. I</hi> parted them twice—the first time they were down by the spars, and they got up again, and went on struggling, and I parted them again—the prosecutor's cuts were not dressed—he tied them up himself.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187101090053"></xptr>
               <p>he was doing, sharpening the knife—he told me the prosecutor had offended him, and he was determined to have his guts open before the morning—I told him to be quiet—he told me not to interfere—I then called to the prosecutor, and told him to keep out of the way—the prisoner got half way on the forecastle ladder—he had a billet of wood and this knife in his hands—I went half way on the ladder, and looked up and saw him throw the piece of wood up on deck, and it struck one of the apprentices—I lost sight of the prisoner, and a few minutes afterwards I was called by the cook to assist—I went on deck, and the prosecutor and the mate had hold of the prisoner, who had the knife between his teeth—his mouth was bleed<lb></lb>ing, and his thumb was cut—I asked the prisoner to loose the knife—he said he would not, and the mate <hi rend="italic">drawed</hi> his arms down, and he let go of it—the steward called the captain—about ten minutes afterwards, when I was going to turn in, I saw the prisoner with a large table knife belonging to the steward; not this one; he was sharpening it—I asked him to put it down—he said he would not, but at last he turned into his bunk, but kept cursing and swearing all the time.</p>

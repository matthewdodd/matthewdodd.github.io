                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live at 2, Breams-buildings, Chancery-lane—on the morning of 23d December, about 1 o'clock, I was coming down Carey-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, and at the corner of Carey<lb></lb>street, I was accosted by two men and two women—the prisoners are two of the parties—they knocked me down immediately they accosted me—it was Day and the other man that struck me—I got partly up, and caught hold of Day, held him, and called out for the police, and in a very short time the policeman came and took him into custody—I was holding him at arms length, and he was striking at me all the time, and the female prisoner was kicking me, and trying to take whatever I had away from me—she kicked me several times while I was on my back—the other man and woman got away—I was quite sober.</p>

About 1 o'clock in the morning of 23d December, I was in Chancery-lane—I heard the cry of "Police!" in Carey-street, went up, and found the prosecutor struggling with Day; Light was trying to pull Day from him; at the same time she was kicking the prosecutor as he was in the act of getting up—I seized her, and the prosecutor gave them both into my custody—on the way to the station, and in the station, Day told me that he had gone away from the girl for a minute or two, and when he came back he found Mr. Myers with his arms round her neck, and that was the reason he struck him.</p>

            , At the last September session, upon your being brought to the bar, to plead to several indictments found against you for forgery, it was insisted upon by your counsel, that in point of law you ought not to have been put upon your trail at all, as you had confessed yourself to be an accomplice before the Justices of the Peace for the county of Middlesex, and had been by them admitted as an evidence for the Crown,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060004"></xptr> against your companions in guilt, Robert and 
               <persName id="t17751206-1-person58">
                  Daniel
                   Perreau

            . The ground of that claim was founded upon the supposed merit of the discovery you had made: that being admitted to give evidence as an accomplice, and having performed your engagement to the public, by being examined before the Grand Jury, and being ready to have given evidence upon the trial, if called upon, you was intitled to pardon; or not to have been prosecuted, that you might have time to apply elsewhere: that the constant practice in regard to accomplices becoming the King's evidence was, that they should not be prosecuted for the offence they had confessed, or such like offences: that a contrary conduct would be a breach of faith with you, and would discourage the future discovery of criminals, if after such disclosures they were nevertheless to undergo prosecutions for their offences. To this it was answered, that the discovery meant by law or practice to intitle an accomplice to favour, must be a full, ample, and true discovery; and that it would never discourage the making such discoveries if criminals offering themselves as witnesses, were made to understand, that to intitle themselves to mercy or favour, they are to make a full discovery of all the offences about which they were questioned, and of all their accomplices in guilt. And it was farther insisted, that you had not made a fair disclosure, at the time of your examination, of all you knew relative to the forgeries which had been committed and published, but that you stood charged by the Grand Jury with several other forgeries which you had denied the knowledge of Upon the debate of this matter before the Bench of Gaol Delivery, the Judges present, not all concurring in one opinion, and it being judged a point of great weight and importance, in the criminal law, fit to be fully considered and finally settled, how far, under what circumstances, and in what manner, an accomplice, received as a witness, ought to be intitled to favour and mercy; the father consideration of the matter was then deferred, in order that the opinion of all the Judges might be taken upon the point of law.</p>
               <p>Eleven of the Judges have accordingly met, the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas being absent through indisposition; and have maturely and deliberately considered of the matter, under all the circumstances; and it falls to my share to deliver, in your presence, to the public, the substance of their reasons upon the occasion, that the ground of their resolves may be rightly understood. All the Judges were of opinion, that in cases not within any statute, an accomplice, who fully and truly discloses the joint guilt of himself and of his companions, and truly answers all questions that are put to him, and is admitted by Justices of the Peace as a witness against his companions, and who, when called upon, does give evidence accordingly, and appears under all the circumstances of the case to have acted a fair and an ingenuous part, and to have made a full and true information, ought not to be prosecuted for his own guilt so disclosed by him, nor perhaps for any other offence of the same kind, which he may accidentally, and without any bad design, have omitted in his confession; but he cannot by law plead this in bar to any indictment against him, nor avail himself of it upon his trial; for it is merely an equitable claim to the mercy of the crown, from the Magistrates express or implied promise of an indemnity, upon certain conditions that have been performed: it can only come before the Court by way of application to put off the trial, in order to give the prisoner time to apply elsewhere. Nine of the eleven Judges were of opinion, that all the circumstances relative to a prisoner's claim of indemnity, in such a case, not only may, but ought to be laid before the Court, to enable them to exercise their discretion, whether, upon the grounds before them, the trial should be put off, and consequently have intimation given that the prisoner ought not be prosecuted; for the discretionary power exercised by the Justices of Peace in admitting accomplices to be witnesses, founded in practice only, cannot controul the authority of the Court of Gaol Delivery, and exempt at all events the accomplice from being prosecuted. Upon every motion made, upon collateral equitable grounds, the Court will see and examine into the whole truth, and consequently ought to be informed of all the circumstances affecting the case.</p>
               <p>The affidavit of the Justices therefore must in this case be necessarily taken into consideration, to see upon what ground they admitted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060005"></xptr> the prisoner as a witness. For if the Court looked no farther than the prisoner's own information, in the present case, they could not have learnt from thence that she had ever been considered as an accomplice at all; and as such had been admitted as a witness against the Perreaus in either of the prosecutions. Upon their affidavit it appears that the public faith was not engaged but conditionally, and that there was an express admonition given to the prisoner, not to conceal any part of the truth.</p>
               <p>The same nine Judges also were of opinion, that if the matter stood singly upon the two informations of the prisoner, compared with the indictments against her, that she ought to have been tried upon all or any of them; for from the prisoner's information, she is no accomplice; she has not confessed herself guilty of any offence at all. By their representation the share she has had in these transactions is perfectly innocent: but she exhibits a charge against Robert and

            , from a paper he produces; the other forcing her to do the fact of forgery, under the threat and fear of death. Her two informations are contradictory; and every indictment that is preferred against her proceeds upon a falsification of the account she has given; for she answers to the Justices interrogation, that she did not know of any other forgeries: so she does not confess, make any discovery, or become a witness concerning these offences; and if she has suppressed the truth, and not made a full and fair disclosure, she forfeits all equitable claim to favour and mercy. But if she has told the truth, and the whole truth, she cannot be convicted. On the other hand, taking the affidavit of the Justices, and all the case into consideration, if she is guilty of the charge contained in the indictments preferred by Sir

            , the Judges are of opinion, as her informations before the Justices have no relation to these charges, they can in no light be applied to mitigate her offences.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, whether the prisoner is guilty or not guilty is a fact still to be tried by a jury upon legal evidence only, without prejudice to the prisoner from any thing which has been insisted upon in point of law by her counsel to exempt her from any trial at all; for it would be hard indeed upon the subject, who has a right to advice and assistance of counsel in all matters and points of law that may arise upon his case, if the eventual decision of the Court against the points of law insisted upon in his behalf, should prejudice the subsequent trial of the facts, which is ultimately to be governed by the rule of evidence, and to be decided by the verdict of the Jury. I hope and trust, the facts will be tried without the least attention to, or even a remembrance of, any one matter or thing whatever, which has either made its appearance in print, or been the subject of common conversation. I shall only add, that an accomplice, who desires that his trial may be put off, that he may apply for mercy under all the most regular pretensions before laid down, confesses the guilt; but, under the circumstances of this case, if the prisoner confesses these indictments, she has no promise of mercy, and no claim to favour for the reasons aforesaid. The Judges therefore are of opinion that the trial ought to proceed; and I have authority to say, that the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas concurs in that opinion.</p>

             was a co-defendant in the present indictment with Mrs. Rudd, Mrs. Perreau could not be admitted to give evidence; that she could not be admitted a witness for or against either her husband or the co-defendant of her husband.</p>
               <p>Mr. COWPER (likewise of Counsel for the Prisoner) observed, the law requires that every witness in a cause shall be totally indifferent in the event of it. The counsel contended, that when a witness says he conceives he is interested in the matter, that the very imagination of the witness is as much an objection to the witness, as if he was really and truly concerned; because the law requires, that a witness shall have no bias upon his mind, but shall be totally indifferent and disinterested in the event of the prosecution. That the bias that may be upon the mind of a wife in favour of her husband, or a husband in favour of his wife, is undoubtedly the strongest that the law can take notice of. For Mrs. Perreau not to have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060007"></xptr> that bias, not to be warped by that bias, not to come with more anxious wishes than any witness ought to come into a court of justice, would in her be almost criminal. That whether her imagination, that the conviction of Mrs. Rudd would obtain her husband's pardon was well or ill founded, would not alter the case an iota. She has said it is her opinion that

            's pardon will also be the consequence of that conviction: that if Mrs. Perreau's testimony is to contribute to her conviction, it is, to be sure, through the same medium her husband's life is to be saved; and if that is not a clear, a decisive, and a positive interest, it is impossible to define what a positive interest is. If upon the trial, when it was an equal chance, whether he would or not be in the unfortunate predicament of being under sentence of death, Mrs. Perreau could not be admitted a witness for him: is he, when under sentence of death, to be redeemed from that unfortunate situation by her testimony? Does the influence cease, and does it become an objection to her credit only and not to her competency? In civil cases, if an objection is taken to a witness, who only imagines he has an interest, though he has none - If a master, for instance, in defending his servant, imagines, that in point of honour he ought to pay his costs, though there is no bond to indemnify him; but he says, I think, as a man of generosity, in point of honour, I ought not to let my servant suffer, how small is that bias? The idea of obligation upon the man's mind makes him act like a man of honour, and under that bias he would not tell an untruth; and yet so careful is the law, that a person shall not be a witness who is under any temptation whatsoever when called upon to give evidence. That such a witness has in many instances upon that ground been rejected.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cowper mentioned a case that happened the preceding day in the Court of King's Bench upon a patent: the patentee produced his journeyman, who stated to the Court, that he had entered into articles to work a number of years for the patentee, and receive a sum of money upon the patent: an objection was made to his evidence, a release of the articles was executed by the witness in Court, and it was then contended that the objection was removed. The question was then put to him, Sir, though you have discharged your master from all obligations he was under to you, don't you expect, when you go out of Court, to be restored to the situation you was in before? Why, replied he, I believe my master is an honest man; and I believe my master could not do the work without me, and therefore I am well convinced I shall be put in the situation from which I have released myself. My Lord Mansfield, upon the idea that the witnesses's imagination led him to suppose that he should certainly be restored to the situation he was in before, rejected his evidence; and very properly rejected the evidence, repeating what he had once before said in a solemn judgment from the bench, that it is not the office of courts of law to consider how far the minds of people may resist temptation, but to take care that they shall be exposed to none at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. LUCAS (of Counsel for the Crown) contended, that the observations that had been made by the counsel were proper as to the credit of the witness, but did not affect her competency. That if the doctrine was to be held in the latitude in which it was laid down by the gentlemen on the other side, it would be impossible ever to prosecute. When a man prosecutes for a felony or robbery, suppose he was to be asked, Sir, if the prisoner should be convicted, don't you expect the restitution of your goods? he would say he did; he is intitled to restitution: and yet that question was never asked in such a case. And in cases where the prosecutor is intitled to a reward, the reward is dependant upon conviction, and he is therefore interested in the conviction of the prisoner; and yet that objection was never taken. An accomplice is not sure of his pardon the moment he gives evidence in many cases; it is only from the favour of the Crown. Where a pardon is held forth by statute in case an accomplice convicts two persons, suppose he convicts but one, or suppose he convicts neither, he is not intitled to his pardon, unless he fulfills the conditions required of him by the act. It is only in the mercy and favour of the Crown. Mrs. Perreau has told the Court, that she hopes her husband's innocence may appear. She certainly wishes that he may obtain a pardon whether Mrs. Rudd is or is not convicted.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060008"></xptr>The COURT, in deciding upon the objection, observed - That the reason the witness assigned for hoping the prisoner's conviction, would be a means of obtaining her husband's pardon, appeared in substance to be an apprehension, that such facts might appear upon the evidence now, which might induce the Crown to extend mercy to her husband; and that her expressing such an apprehension did not prove her to be so interested in the conviction of the prisoner, as to make her incompetent as a witness: nor did it follow, in case the prisoner should be so unfortunate as to be convicted, that the pardon of

             would be the consequence of that conviction. The Court farther observed, that the bond which

             was convicted for uttering, knowing it to be forged, was not the same the prisoner was indicted upon. That the observation was well founded, that if

             was a co-defendant with the prisoner, Mrs. Perreau's evidence would be inadmissible. That this was not like the case of an accomplice, who comes to give evidence in hopes of being pardoned if he speaks the truth; for in what had fallen from the Court, in delivering the opinion of the judges upon that point, it was certain that wherever an accomplice discloses all he knows, whatever may be the consequences of that disclosure, he himself stands in a situation to be intitled to the expectation of mercy; but that it was very like the case put by Mr. Lucas, where a person who prosecutes a thief is intitled to the restitution of his goods. And in prosecutions where there are rewards, the reward can only be the effect of a conviction; in such a case as that, every man that comes as a witness, under the idea of having a reward, supposing the criminal should be convicted, may be said to be interested in point of property. But the case that had been put of criminals that are admitted witnesses under the statutes of king William and queen Ann, came clearly within the objection now made, because they are not intitled to their pardon, unless their evidence is a means of conviction; and therefore, where the legislature has held out that, as a reward, by way of inducement for criminals to come in and make a discovery, the legislature would have acted contrary to the rules and principles of law, if by the consequence of their evidence they were to be considered as interested in the determination. That to go a little farther back, and enter into the doctrine of approvers, they likewise came most clearly within that idea; for there the approver, if he did not convict, was not intitled to a pardon: therefore in this case, whatever Mrs. Perreau's hopes might be, yet as it is not an interest that is necessarily to follow upon the conviction of the prisoner, the Court were of opinion, that it was not an objection that would go to her competency, though it would certainly go very strongly to affect her credit; and of that the counsel for the prisoner would have the advantage, by the observations they had made in the hearing of the Jury.</p>

               <p>After you had a notion that there might be something wrong in this transaction, when did you see Mrs. Rudd? - At my house, about seven or eight o'clock that evening, Wednesday, the 8th of March.</p>
               <p>What room were you in? - The parlour.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass about these transactions, whether they were right or wrong?</p>

               <p>And they were engaged in a conversation touching Carmarthen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are a well-bred woman, and therefore, of course, you was attending to the conversation of your visitors, and you perfectly well remember their conversation: how came you, when you had not a thought that any thing was wrong in the transaction, to attend to the particular conversation that passed between your husband, Mr.

               <p>How long has she been gone? - She went there, I believe, last March: she was on board the ship when this affair broke out.</p>

             to whom it was made payable, and the sum; that when it was shewn you by the two justices, you was so sure of it that you set your name upon it, and took upon you to be positive it was the same? - Yes, as well as I can speak to a thing that has not been in my possession.</p>
               <p>How happened it, that at the distance of five months you should be able to be so very particular to the exact similitude of all the circumstances of the bond, never having seen any bond before in your life, and not being led by any suspicions to make any particular remarks upon it? - I have the happiness to have a good memory.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Wright and the other justice brought this bond to you, they also brought other papers? - They did.</p>

               <p>Did you read them? - I observed the difference of the dates and sums.</p>

               <p>As this man was your apothecary for seventeen years, and you and he were acquaintance, you best know his manner of dressing; therefore you suppose he might go to the masquerade in these cloaths? - I suppose as they were womens cloaths she wore them.</p>
               <p>Do you believe now that they are hers? -</p>

               <p>I wish to know whether under this bill of sale, to which the prisoner is no party, you don't claim these goods that are hers? - Upon my word I believe that affair must come into a court of law, and then it will be proper to decide that question.</p>
               <p>I have as great an affection for a court of law as you have; but as we are in a court of law at present, I would wish to have this question answered, whether these goods of hers that you claim, you claim under a bill of sale to which she is no party? - Whether they had a right to sell them I am not a judge, but that will be settled I suppose in a court of law.</p>
               <p>But I ask you now, whether you don't believe that these are her property? - Her husband has sent over a power of attorney from Ireland to claim them.</p>
               <p>Then you claim the interest in them, do you? - They are sold to me by a bill of sale; and I think that bill of sale is a good bill of sale.</p>

               <p>What had you been before? - I was never any thing but a livery-servant before.</p>

               <p>Pray, what other men servants were there belonging to the family when you came there? - First, there was a servant out of livery, acted as butler; he went away after I had been there three months, and I had the care of the cellar till the time I left their service.</p>
               <p>But what was you at the time you delivered these letters to

               <p>How soon after you had been in the family, was it that Mrs. Rudd made you the confident of this imposition upon Mr. Perreau your master? - I never made any observations of the time.</p>
               <p>I don't mean the day or week; but you know it is a remarkable transaction, and you have a remarkable good memory and attention, for you have sworn to a hand-writing only from two letters? - Not from two letters only.</p>

            , this conspiracy was concerted and carried on against Mr. Perreau between you and Mrs. Rudd? - About five or six months.</p>
               <p>Was it in October? - I cannot say the month.</p>
               <p>Will you positively swear it was in September, October, or November? - I will swear neither.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was in January or February? - Neither.</p>
               <p>Or in March, April, May, June, July, or August? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you tell me how often you have delivered these letters? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you tell me within three times? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How often upon your oath have you delivered them? - Five or six times; I believe it may be more.</p>
               <p>But you have no doubt abut five or six times? - None.</p>
               <p>What space of time might there be between the delivery of each letter; a month, a fortnight, or a day? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>When was the first time you ever saw Mrs. Rudd write? - I never made any observation.</p>
               <p>Was it within two months after you came there? - Not to write a feigned hand in less than six months.</p>
               <p>When did you see her write a real hand? - Perhaps in two days after I came into the family.</p>
               <p>What did she write? - I don't know: she wrote that publicly.</p>
               <p>Where? - In the dining-room.</p>
               <p>Did you lean over her shoulder? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you examine what she wrote? - No.</p>
               <p>I want to know then how you could distinguish the feigned hand from the real hand? - Not to read it while she was writing it.</p>
               <p>My question is, how you could distinguish that you did not examine, or read, from what you call a feigned hand? - When she has wrote papers containing directions for me to get in errands, that I might not forget, that was her common hand.</p>

She said, she had provided a counsellor and solicitor, and witnesses to back me, and my life was as precious to her as her own; and that my saying that, and that only, would save her life. She gave me the papers to shew my husband, and I was to bring them back to Newgate at four o'clock that afternoon.</p>
               <p>What was you to do with the papers in the mean time? - I was to consult my husband about the papers. I told her, my husband was an honest man. She said, if he would agree to it, and 200 l. would not do, it should be ten times more. After I had consulted my husband, I was to bring the papers back; but I never went back.</p>
               <p>Was any body present at this conversation? - Nobody but herself and me.</p>
               <p>If your husband had agreed to the papers, what were you to do with them? - Whether he agreed or not, I was to return them again at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>What use was you to make of these papers?</p>
               <p>What was you to have the 200 l. for? - I did not ask what for; I was to come back, and she was to direct me.</p>
               <p>You have mentioned something about a Jury that were to ask you questions; what was that about? - She said I was to go to her trial, and to take particular notice of Sir

               <p>Did you ever see Mrs. Perreau? - No, I never saw her.</p>
               <p>This paper your husband took from you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long after you received it did he have it? - The same day, and it was taken to the justice of peace.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination by Mr. Serjeant DAVY.</p>
               <p>When did you write your name to these papers? - That very day.</p>
               <p>When did you first mention this to your husband and consult him? - As I came down stairs, we went to a public house, my child dropp'd a guinea, my husband asked what that was, I told him it was a guinea my wicked mistress gave the child. My husband asked me for the papers; I said, my mistress wants to hang you and me and all the world; but I said she never shall be brought into trouble for me: my husband was in a great passion at the Horseshoe and Magpie; he struck me and abused me very much, and said he would go to Newgate and know what Mrs. Rudd meant; and he insisted upon having the papers.</p>
               <p>Did you give him the papers? - He insisted upon having the papers; and said, if Mrs. Rudd drew me in, he would appear against me, and hang us both; this frightened me a good deal, and I read the papers to him.</p>
               <p>How came you before the justice? - He took me there, and I made oath before the justice.</p>
               <p>You had been in Mrs. Rudd's service two months, and she had behaved so well to you, that you had a great liking to her? - I had.</p>
               <p>That led you to Newgate, and in Newgate passed the conversation you have given an account of between your mistress and you, in which your mistress said, she would give you 200 l. nay, ten times that sum, in order to swear to the particulars in those papers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was a great sum to offer for a witness, but that was because her life depended upon it: when you parted with your mistress, you had many objections; you was afraid of being found out; you asked what a bond was like: and then she explained to you what sort of man Sir

             was, that you might satisfy the jury: if; I understand you, your objections were for fear you might be found out in swearing all these lies; but you had no objection to swearing of lies? - I was afraid.</p>
               <p>At last you agreed to do all this; but you must consult your husband first? - I did not intend to go to her again; I intended to have wrote a polite letter, and sent the papers back.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060023"></xptr>But the reason why you did not leave them, was for fear she should keep you a prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then your resolution was not to say a word to your husband about it? - No.</p>
               <p>The moment you saw your husband he was angry with you for staying so long; and by and by the child dropt a guinea, and your husband asking what that was, you said it was a guinea your wicked mistress had given the child? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was because you knew his principles were exactly the same as your own? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your husband asked you what you had it for? - No; he asked me what I meant by that; I told him it was given me to hang him and myself and all the world. He wanted to know what I said that for.</p>
               <p>And, as you represent it, Mrs. Rudd said it was a true transaction, which she would have you fix to have happened in your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I observe a very remarkable expression you used,</p>
               <p>"I was afraid to meddle with such rich people?" - Yes.</p>
               <p>Because I observe that very expression is in the written paper: was this paper produced to you in the manner in which you have represented it; or was it an offer that you made to this Mrs. Rudd, and asked to have what you said you would swear taken down in writing? - It was ready wrote when I came into the room.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about this upon the Tuesday? - She only spoke on Tuesday about my going with some messages for her.</p>
               <p>Then you did not offer your service in the lying way? - No.</p>
               <p>There was nothing said from you about giving evidence, or telling any lies? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the first talk of your telling lies was after the paper was wrote? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before she began to read she told you she wanted you to tell a lie for her? - Yes; and she said what she had wrote was as true as God was in heaven.</p>
               <p>Nothing had been said to you about this upon the Tuesday? - No.</p>
               <p>Then upon the Wednesday, the paper being ready wrote, she wanted to ask a favour of you; and then she told you that what she had wrote was as true as God was in heaven, and wanted you to say it happened at your house? - Yes; and she explained the papers as she went on.</p>
               <p>And then she told you what answers to make when you was cross-questioned? - She did.</p>
               <p>And after you had been with your husband you read over these papers? - I did twenty times.</p>
               <p>It is necessary one should read a paper very often in order to be-able to swear to it? - I was to remember the last word always: I told her I never was but once at Hicks's-Hall.</p>
               <p>Then you was to read and con it over so often as to remember perfectly the last words that were said, and the counsel and solicitor were to be just by in order to help you to go on with the story? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Though you resolved from the moment you left Newgate never to do this wicked trick? - I did.</p>
               <p>Then why did you take the papers with you? - I was afraid to leave them behind.</p>
               <p>When did the justice take the papers from you? About four o'clock on the same day that I came from Newgate.</p>
               <p>When was the twenty times that you read these papers after you left Newgate? - While I was deliberating what to do with the papers for an hour, I read them over a great many times.</p>

            ? - I am.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Newgate with your wife; - I did not go with her; I went after her on the Tuesday. She told me her mistress had sent for her.</p>
               <p>Court. What she told you is not evidence: did you go to Newgate and find her? - I did: I sent up my name, and desired to speak to her: I went up; Mrs. Rudd and my wife were together: Mrs. Rudd asked me to sit down, which I did. Mrs. Rudd said, she desired I would not be angry with her for sending for my wife: she said she intended to send her children with her. I looked at my wife, and thought it very hard to be troubled with other people's children. Mrs. Rudd said, I need not think that her children-should be a burthen to me: that I might call next day, at nine o'clock, and her counsellor and solicitor would be there, and settle her children with me. She asked me what part of my house was to let: she said if the parlour was to let, that she would have the parlour for the children. My wife replied, the parlour and first floor were let to a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At No 1, in Coombes-court, Well-street, Oxford-road. I said the second floor was to let, and that was more airy for children. She desired me to get iron-rails for the windows, to prevent the childrens falling out, which I did intend to do. We came home, and the next morning my wife and I went, at nine o'clock, to Newgate, and sent up our names. She sent for my wife up, and desired me to wait in the tap-room. I waited there from nine o'clock, I think, till near twelve. About twelve I sent up the man to desire my wife to come down: she came down soon after, and I was in a very great passion. I asked her where the children were? She said there were no children. I asked her what was the reason? she gave me little or no answer; and I saw she was all in a tremble. I said again to her, where are the children? she prayed me, for God's sake, to hold my tongue: she said, if you don't hold your tongue we shall be both taken up; which put me in a great confusion. I saw some papers in her hand: we went to the Horseshoe and Magpie, and there I saw these papers.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination by Mr. DAVENPORT.</p>
               <p>How long had you been with Mrs. Rudd on the Tuesday? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>And she desired you to come with your wife next day? - She wrote down directions for my wife to go to several places for her.</p>
               <p>Your wife was not with you the first day? -</p>
               <p>Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>What directions were wrote down? - To go to some of the servants.</p>
               <p>Did not Mrs. Rudd desire you to come? -</p>
               <p>Yes, with her own mouth.</p>
               <p>And yet you was not called up? - No, nor allowed to go up.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body else go to or from Mrs. Rudd on Wednesday? - I cannot tell; I saw none that I know of but my wife.</p>

               <p>"and that made Mrs. Rudd smile. The answer she gave to the person who brought up the note was, that she knew no business she had with her, and that she did not desire such visitors: the person belonging to Newgate who brought up the note, I can't recollect now; who it was said the woman had been often there in order to be admitt ed.</p>

Mrs. Rudd told me that Mrs. Hart had been with her, and told her a very strange incredible story, and she repeated what the woman had told her. I said I could not think there was any probability in such a scheme, and advised her to pay no kind of attention to it. Mrs. Rudd coincided with my opinion; and she said

               <p>You was present when all this passed? - Yes, I certainly was; and upon a consultation that was had the next evening at Mr. Davenport's chambers I shewed that paper, and said I did not place any reliance upon it, only I thought it my duty as counsel to point out every thing.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect coming the morning after to Guildhall, and shewing it to me? - Perfectly well.</p>

               <p>I believe then we were in a course of consultation, as we frequently met at Mr. Davenport's chambers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you say you mentioned the circumstances at that time? - I did not read the paper in Mr. Davenport's chambers; but I mentioned my opinion of it then as a strange improbable romance, and the counsel were of the same opinion.</p>

               <p>Pray, do you recollect when it was that you first saw this woman? - The first time I ever saw Mrs. Hart was coming out of Mrs. Rudd's room.</p>
               <p>What time of day was that? - Between five and six in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Was any body with her? - Yes; a child in her arms, which I took for Mrs. Rudd's child; and not having seen her before, I took her to be Mrs. Rudd's servant.</p>
               <p>What time was you there on Wednesday? - At twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was twelve o'clock? - I think it was near that time. Mrs. Rudd always dined at two o'clock, and she did not dine till an hour after this conversation.</p>
               <p>Hart desired it might be put down in writing? - She did; and Mrs. Rudd wrote it from her dictation.</p>
               <p>Is the paper you have marked the original or the copy? - That is the original that has my name on it.</p>
               <p>How long did Mrs. Hart stay? - I imagine about an hour.</p>
               <p>When was she to return? - At five in the afternoon; and the reason why she appointed that time was because her husband would then have done work.</p>
               <p>Did she return at five o'clock? - No; she did not.</p>
               <p>Do you know where Mrs. Hart lives? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you ever at her house? - Yes, that evening.</p>
               <p>Did you see her? - No; I saw her husband at the street door smoaking his pipe; I asked him if he was master of the house? he said he was. I asked to see his wife? he said she was out. I asked why she did not come again to Mrs. Rudd? he swore violently that his wife should never go to Mrs. Rudd more.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - Near eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him for the paper? - No, never.</p>
               <p>How came you to be so anxious about a story which nobody gave credit to, and want her to go again to Newgate? - She might want something else to speak to her about.</p>
               <p>Is it a true copy? - Yes, every line; I saw it copied.</p>

            . Do you remember Mr. Bailey coming in the evening? - Yes, that very day we were at Newgate; he came in the evening between eight and nine o'clock. He asked me, if Mrs. Hart was within? I told him she was not. Said he, Do you know where she is? I said no. What do you want with her? I want her to go down to her mistress immediately? I said, she shall not go out of my door; I would sooner break both her legs. He asked me, what was the matter? I said, why her cursed mistress has given her papers to hang herself and all the world, and I was in a great passion; I told him the papers were taken care of. The sweat ran down Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060028"></xptr> Bailey's face very much. He asked me to go into the back-yard with him, which I did. He took me by a button of my waistcoat, and said, Pray, Mr. Hart, do not be in a passion; if you come to the bar, speak the truth, and nothing but the truth about these papers.</p>
               <p>Did any body apply to you for the papers? - Nobody applied to me for them. I told my wife, when I went from dinner to work, that if she was drawn into it, I would certainly swear against her. She said she was ready to do as I pleased.</p>
               <p>Were the papers given up at that time? - The papers were given up to the magistrate three hours before Mr. Bailey came.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about being given up to Mr. Bailey? - I told him I had taken care of them.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell him you had carried them to a justice? - No.</p>
               <p>He said to you, do not be in a passion; and desired you, when it came to the trial to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth; what did you understand him to mean? - I did not know what he meant by it; he took me by the button.</p>
               <p>Speak the truth; about what? - About the papers?</p>
               <p>When what came to the trial? - The papers came to the trial.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cowper. Which came first; did he desire you to speak the truth before or after you told him you had taken care of the papers? - After I had told him that, he said, when you come to the trial speak the truth, and nothing but the truth; and I told him I would.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you carried the papers at this time to the justice. - Yes; three hours before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lucas. When you said the cursed woman wanted to hang your wife and you, and all the world, did Mr. Bailey then tell you, that your wife had dictated the paper?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bailey. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cowper. Mr. Bailey, have you heard what that man says? - I have.</p>
               <p>Is there any truth in it? - He was very violent about his wife; I never asked him about the papers.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you at that time, that his wife had got a paper to hang him, and all the world, or to that effect? - He blustered a great deal about the papers; I cannot tell whether he did say these words or no.</p>
               <p>He was very indignant about the papers? - He was angry to the last degree.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him at that time of his wife having dictated the papers? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he, during the conversation, call it a cursed paper, or give it any epithet that imported he was very angry at her having such a paper? - No; he said he was angry at her going to Mrs. Rudd, and she should never go to her again.</p>
               <p>Did he say the papers were taken care of? - Yes;</p>
               <p>"I have taken care of the papers."</p>
               <p>When you desired Hart, if it should come to a trial, that he would speak the truth about these papers, what did you mean by saying that to him? - What I told your lordship before; I thought it a very extraordinary transaction; and then, when I found that there was no person coming at five o'clock to tell the truth of the matter, I had some suspicions that these were persons sent to Mrs. Rudd in in order to get out of her as much as they could to turn against herself.</p>
               <p>But Hart had not told you at that time that Mrs. Rudd had given any paper to his wife? - No: I then had suspicions and doubts.</p>
               <p>What doubt could you have about it, if you was present and heard the woman deliver all that story to Mrs. Rudd? - I doubted very much that she had so much friendship to Mrs. Rudd as she prosessed: I thought rather she was a person sent with an intent to hurt her.</p>
               <p>Court. If she was ever so wicked a woman, and told this story, it could not affect Mrs. Rudd, if it was in the manner you represent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cowper. Did you impart these doubts to the counsel at the consultation? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you understand by the answer that he gave you, that he had taken care of the paper? - I did not know what he meant.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. You say you did not ask him for any papers? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury to Hart. Did he ask you for any papers? - He only asked me what I had done with them.</p>
               <p>You mentioned the papers first? - I did.</p>

               <p>Did you carry up the note? - No, one Lee carried it up. I believe Mrs. Rudd refused seeing her, and said she would see her another time. Mrs. Hart thought Mrs. Rudd must have made a mistake or she would have seen her, for she said she was an old servant.</p>

            ? - Yes: I have known her both before and since her connection with Mr. Perreau; I knew her as Mr. Rudd's wife, and afterwards as Mr. Perreau's.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of her fortune at the time of her connection with Mr. Perreau? - When her husband Rudd left her she was very much distressed: a gentleman allowed her 5 or 600 l. a year; she lived in a genteel manner; he gave her 16,000 l. In October 1770, she received 4000 l. in my presence; in March 1771, she received 3000 l. and some hundreds; I cannot charge my memory exactly, I believe about 700 l.</p>
               <p>Was that before her connection with Mr. Perreau, or since? - Since her connection with Mr. Perreau.</p>
               <p>This was part of the 16,000 l.? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. Was it given her by will? - No: it was left in a trustee's hand; she received 7700 l. at twice.</p>
               <p>How do you know that these are parts of the 16,000 l.? - Because I was present when the money was paid; it was left in the hands of a very near relation of mine that was the trustee.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know that he was a trustee of 16,000 l.? - I have heard him say so; I know perfectly well the gentleman who left it her.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination by Mr. MURPHY.</p>
               <p>I must beg the favour of knowing who the person was? - I will not tell.</p>
               <p>Was the money left by will? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Was there any writing about it? - It was left in the hands of a trustee.</p>
               <p>Then you can tell us the trustee perhaps? - I don't chuse that.</p>
               <p>Then we are not to know the trustee, nor the donor, nor when it was paid: in whose presence was it paid? - In my presence.</p>
               <p>Where was it paid? - At Mr. Perreau's house in Pall-mall. In October 1770, she received 4000 l.</p>
               <p>Who paid the money? - The trustee.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - He paid her 4000 l. down.</p>
               <p>Was a receipt given? - Yes.</p>

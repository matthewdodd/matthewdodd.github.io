                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, at 59, Aldermanbury. On 16th Oct., 1850, the prisoner opened an account with me for lace goods—the arrangement between us was that it was to be balanced every week—that continued so till 25th Nov., about which time his wife made an application to me to make it a monthly account—I saw the prisoner afterwards, and the statement his wife had made was communicated to him—I told the wife that before opening the monthly account we should wish to know something of who the partners were, and the answer was that they were Joseph Frederick Wiffin, who lived at Brentwood, and William Wallace Whyte—the account was opened, and I believe the two first months were paid—about Feb. last about 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was due—I made several applications for payment, and several excuses were made, and appointments made to pay money—on one occasion the prisoner came and wished me to draw on him—I refused to do so, and the account went on for another month—I ultimately drew this bill on him for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and he wrote the acceptance, "J. F. Wiffin and Co.," on it—in my presence—frequently when I have pressed for money he has stated I had no occasion to be afraid; that Wiffin, his brother-in-law, was a highly respectable man in the country.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">left the case to the Jury upon these two questions; first, whether the prisoner when he accepted the bill had reasonable grounds for believing that he had any authority to do so; and, secondly, whether he assumed the name of "J.

It would not be enough that he assumed the name for purposes of fraud merely, but they must find that he contemplated the acceptance of bills; this among others. In his opinion there was no evidence upon which they could safely come to the conclusion that the original use of the name was with a view of doing the parti<lb></lb>cular act charged.</hi>

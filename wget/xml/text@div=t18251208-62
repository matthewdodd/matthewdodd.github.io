I went to his barn, about 7 o'clock on Friday morning, the 2d of December, and found the back door had been unbolted; I missed some barley which had been threshed, and laid in a heap, partly cleaned - I should think more than a bushel was gone - I had seen it all safe about half-past eight o'clock, the morning before. I acquainted Mr. Roake, the bailiff, and went back with him; we saw some foot-marks leading from it, and some barley near them. I afterwards saw the prisoner's shoes applied to these marks, but I was not near enough to see if they corresponded - the barley found, and the sample are here - but I have not compared them - I am not a judge. He lives about two hundred yards from the barn.</p>

            . I am bailiff to Mr. George Winch. I saw the barn all safe about the middle of the day before - there was a quantity of barley there, which had been thrown once. On Friday morning, between seven and eight o'clock, I was called, and found the barn broken open, and missed about a bushel of barley. I proceeded to the back door, and saw some foot-steps leading from the door towards a meadow, with a great deal of barley in the steps which had stuck to the shoes. I took the measure of the footsteps, and counted five nails in the heel of each shoe. I then returned, and informed my master - he suspected the prisoner, who worked in the adjoining grounds. I got a search-warrant, and went with the constable to the prisoner's house - he was not at home; we went up stairs, and found about a bushel of barley concealed in a little box, which was locked - the prisoner's wife refused to give us the key at first, but we got it and found the barley in it; it appeared to me to be barley once thrown. I had taken a sample of what we had in the barn, and compared it with that in the box - it corresponded exactly. I could swear to it - I have been in the farming business all my life, and it appeared to me exactly of the same quality - we then took the prisoner's shoes, and compared them with the foot-steps - they had five nails in the heel, which just corresponded with the marks.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had the barley been in a round heap? A. Yes; if a mouse had gone over it it would have been discovered.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with Roake - what he has said is correct. I took off the prisoner's shoes, and compared them with the marks in the ground - the number, size, and position of the nails exactly corresponded - they appeared nearly new, and both shoes had precisely the same number of nails - they fitted the foot-marks in length and breadth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked this barley off the green, where it grew in the summer.</p>

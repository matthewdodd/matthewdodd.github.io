               <p>Q. Was there any pork laying there? - A. Yes, three legs were laying in a dish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep your eye fixed on him? - A. Yes, I kept looking at him there was some more pork at the door, I called to a lady to look at that, and while I turned my back, he was gone away with the leg of pork.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the pork in the hands of any one? - No, I saw him put his hand on it at the stall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner when you turned round again? - A. No, I asked my master if he had brought the leg of pork in to be weighed; he said no; I run down the alley to see whether I could see him; not seeing of him, I came back, and went up a little higher; I then saw him come down a little alley, only two doors off, I said that is the man that took the leg of pork away to the maid, she was with me; he then run as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the leg of pork with him? - A. No; when he ran I halloed out Stop thief, as loud as I could, and the watchman came up, and laid hold of him and brought him back; I told the watchman which alley he came down; we went up the alley, and found the pork lying in a corner of that alley, the pork was taken up and brought back to the shop, I knew it was the same pork, there were three of them, they were salted.</p>

             sworn. I am a watchman; on the 21st of December, between nine and ten o'clock, I had been to buy some tobacco, I was going to do my duty, there was a cry of Stop thief; seeing the prisoner at the bar running, I stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else? - A. There was a young man before him, walking gently up Hand-alley, it is a very narrow alley, he could not pass the young man without shoving him down; when I had stopped the prisoner, the lad came up and said, that is the man, where is my master's pork; we found the pork in another alley, where there is no thoroughfare, up against the wall in a corner.</p>

             sworn. I know no farther than the leg of pork being mine, I saw nothing of the transaction. The prisoner at the bar told me it was distress that occasioned him doing this, saying he had three children; I went and found he had none.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He asked me when I was taken, whether it was distress that occasioned me to do it; I told him it was not, I told him I had a wife and three children, but I was not so much distressed as to take his leg of pork, I never saw the leg of pork till I was taken up the alley; I am certain the boy is mistaken in the person.</p>

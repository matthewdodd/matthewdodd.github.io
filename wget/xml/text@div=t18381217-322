About five o'clock on the 11th of Decem<lb></lb>ber, the prisoner came for a 1/4 lb. of cheese, which is two-pence half-penny—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him change—the moment he went out I saw the half-crown was bad—I saw it before, and he said it had been among tobacco in his pocket—I went after him—my place is about two hundred yards from Wade's—the prisoner was overtaken by me and Hawkins and Pye—there was another, man with him—this is the half-crown.</p>

               <p>they did not see me—I pursued them about three hundred yards—they then stooped down by the side of the road as if they did something—I did not mark the place where they did it—about fifty yards before I overtook the prisoner, a cart passed, and I got behind and overtook them—I said to the prisoner, "You have given this poor woman a bad half-a-crown"—he said, "Take this good one and give her"—I stopped him till Mr. Pye came up—he searched, and found the pasty and cheese on the other man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of William Abner Vaughan, a linen-draper, in Aldgate. On the 18th of February, about dusk, the prisoner came to the shop, and asked for some persian—she told me to cut her off one-eight of a yard, which I did—she then asked to see some prints, and told me to cut off a yard of one—while I was doing so, a shawl</p>

               <p>laid under the prints—she took it, and concealed it under her cloak—I saw her do it, and in about two minutes I took hold of the shawl—I called Mr. Vaughan forwards, and took the shawl from under her cloak—she had not paid for any thing—what she bought came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—she was searched, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was found on her.</p>

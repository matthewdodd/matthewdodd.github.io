                  </hi>. I am butler to Mr. Charles Newdegate Newdegate, of Harefield-place, near Uxbridge. On 28th July, 1854, I examined the cellar, and ascertained the quantity of wine in it—I then locked it up, and depo<lb></lb>sited the key with Mrs. Mountford—on 8th March I examined the cellar; the door had been forced open, but the lock was on the cross bars—the Marquis of Donegal's butler was with me—I missed eleven bottles of port, four of sherry, sixteen of Madeira, eleven of brandy, seven, of stout, and some sundries, seventy-five bottles in all.</p>

I am butler to the Marquis of Donegal, who took possession of Harefield-place on 14th Aug.—the wine cellar was then quite secure, neither I or any of the Marquis's servants had any access to it—about 1st March I went to a room adjoining the cellar; Charles Hall, who was second footman to the Marquis, had slept there for several weeks, but had left at that time—I saw that the cellar door looked very suspicious, and found that it was broken open—Biggs was under gardener—he slept there for a fortnight after Hall left, and slept there the next day—I took him to assist as an indoor servant, in the place of Charles Hall, until I could get another one—I saw Charles Hall afterwards at Hillingdon station—Biggs was not there—the inspector spoke to Hall, but I do not recollect what he said.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police inspector of Hillingdon. On 11th March I went to the house at Harefield, where Biggs was lodging, and inquired of the woman of the house whether he was there—she said, "No"—I after<lb></lb>wards returned to the house, and found him in bed, speaking to the woman who before had denied him—I said, "I shall apprehend you for being con<lb></lb>cerned with another in stealing a quantity of wine and brandy from the cellar of Mr. Newdegate, occupied by the Marquis of Donegal"—he said, "I know nothing about breaking into the cellar, neither did I steal the wine; I declare I did not go into the cellar"—I said, "Very well; I do not want you to implicate yourself at all, but there are circumstances come to my knowledge from Trumper, that I shall apprehend you for, he says he drank brandy with you."</p>

I said, "He is all right"—he then said, "I shall tell you the truth; I am not going to suffer for others"—I said, "I do not wish you to implicate yourself; I shall take no notice of what you tell me, but if you wish to make any state<lb></lb>ment to me when you come to the station house, I shall take it, and shall then be able to tell the Magistrate what you tell me"—he said, "Well, I shall tell the whole truth"—this was on the road to London—I did not say that if he knew the guilty parties he might tell me.</p>

I said, 'Yes,' and drank it—he afterwards gave me two or three bottles of other sorts; one was a bottle of champagne, which I drank at different times, and kept the bottle till it was finished"—I said, "This is your voluntary statement to me?" he said, "Yes, it is," and I took it down in writing—he said, "Hall told me afterwards that he got it from Mr. Newdegate's cellar, but I did not know it at that time, and when I went there to sleep, I found the door was broken open"—the two prisoners were taken together from the House of Detention—the case was remanded to the following Monday; Hall was then taken into custody, and they were fetched by me from the House of Detention both together—as soon as they came out of the House of Detention, the first time that they had seen one another, Hall said to Biggs, "Why, Thomas is coming down against us"—Biggs said, "He is not, to be sure"—Hall said, "Yes, and you know that he had three of the bottles of wine"—Biggs said, "Yes, he did"—that was a man who was suspected, but was not in custody—after I had taken the charge at the station, Hall said, "Now I shall tell the whole truth; Biggs came in to me one night and said, 'I say, <hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>, this is Mr. Newdegate's cellar, I helped to pack it with Mr. Newdegate's butler;' I did not know that it was Mr. Newdegate's cellar up to that time, and I prayed of him not to open it; he said, 'Me and George have tried to open it before;' he broke open the door, and brought out ten bottles of wine; one was drank that night in my room; three Biggs had; three I had; and three the under butler had; I have not been happy since it was done; I have been miserable about it, and that is the reason I asked Mr. Joannes to let me leave with<lb></lb>out stopping the month"—on the same day I apprehended the under butler, Thomas Playle, and took him to the station—Hall was there with Mr. Joannes, but I made no observation to him—I said to Playle, "Now you are charged with being with the others, and stealing wine"—he turned round and looked at Hall—Hall said, "You know you had three of the bottles, and took them away, and did not you drink part of the brandy on the night we took it out?" he said, "No, I did not"—Biggs was not there—Hall and Biggs were not together before they came out of the House of Detention—on the road down, I said to Biggs, in Hall's presence, "Hall says you broke open the door;" they both laughed and said, "Well, we did it together."</p>

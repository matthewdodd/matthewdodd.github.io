On the 2nd of April, the prisoner came to our shop about one o'clock in the day; one of them asked for some remnants of ribbon. I shewed them several drawers of remnants of ribbons, and then took several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200008"></xptr>remnants out of the drawers. Bower paid for them eight shillings and seven pence halfpenny. When she paid for them, she asked to see more. I shewed them another drawer, and out of that drawer Bower bought one more remnant. I then missed a piece out of the last drawer. I asked them for the ribbon which they had in their hands just now. They asked me what ribbon, and what colour. I told them I could not tell the colour, but it was the ribbon they had in their hands just then. Ruby then was going out of the door; I called out to her to have her stopped; a customer in the shop brought her in; she came in, and stood by one of the pillars. Bower made off in the confusion. Ruby was taken by force from the pillar, and taken into the accompting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When Ruby stood by the pillar had she any thing in her hand - A. I saw something, but I cannot tell what it was. I saw her put her hands down by the side of her when she was by the pillar. She was taken into the accompting-house, and a constable was sent for. The constable searched her; nothing was found on her. Bower was not apprehended until the following day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. You observed no umbrella upon either of them, did you - A. No, I did not.</p>

            . I live with Messrs. Flint and Ray.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect these women coming into the shop - A. I did not see Bower that day; she was gone when I came in. I saw Ruby take hold of the pillar after she was brought back. She was endeavouring to conceal something between her and the pillar. After she was moved by force from the pillar, the umbrella was discovered, containing the ribbons. I took the umbrella into the accompting-house. The umbrella was propped up between her and the pillar. I had not seen the umbrella before. I laid hold of the umbrella, and the weight of the ribbons opened the umbrella. I then discovered eleven rolls of ribbons. The prisoner was searched; nothing was found on her.</p>
               <p>ABIGAIL HALL. I was in the shop at the time the first witness charged the prisoners with having the ribbon. I saw Ruby walk out of the shop; I caught hold of her before the door closed. She endeavoured to get from me; with assistance I brought her back into the shop. At that time an umbrella came against my hand, and at the time that she was against the pillar I saw an umbrella in her hand. I saw her endeavouring to hide the umbrella; then I recollected her hurting my finger with t. I took the umbrella first from the pillar, and gave it to Miss Pittman. I saw it opened, and the ribbons in it.</p>
               <p>Ruby's Defence. On Saturday I came from my father and mother; I met a young woman I slightly knew; she asked me to take a walk with her to buy some ribbons. I went with her to Mr. Flint's shop. I was coming out of the shop; I was stopped by two gentlewomen; they took me into the accompting-house, and brought an umbrella into the accompting-house. The other prisoner I never saw with my eyes before.</p>
               <p>Bower's Defence. My little boy is blind. I went to Mr. Ware's, in Bridge-street. I never was out of my house all the day afterwards. On the next day I was taken in custody. I was at home all day on the Saturday with my baby.</p>

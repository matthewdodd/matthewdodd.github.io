I had the front room third floor - there is only a passage between us; I could hear voices in their room, but not to hear what passed distinctly.

I have no reason to believe that the prisoner and deceased did not live comfortably together - they always cooked their victuals in the room, and kept their coals in a cupboard in the corner of the room; there was some tinder in front of the fire-place; it might have been caused by something being thrown into the fire. I dare say there was a quarter of a pound of grease or gravy in the pan - it had not been overturned, but laid on the floor, a yard and a half from the fire.</p>

            . I am nurse at the hospital. Two females brought the deceased in, she was dreadfully burnt; I saw the prisoner on the following morning about eight o'clock; he came and said he wanted to see the case that was brought in burnt; he asked for Ann Silver, I shewed her to him; he brought nothing with him, nothing passed between them; he wanted to kiss her, but she smothered her head in the clothes, and said she did not want to see the wretch.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she died was she conscious of danger? A. She said four or five times she was well aware she should not recover, and used to ask me every morning what I thought of her wounds; she got more and more certain that she should die: she was strongly under that impression from the time she first came in; and while I was putting oil on her, she said she and her husband had quarrelled, that she was cooking some steaks, and had a lot of waste paper in a box, which she threw on the fire, and while she was doing that her husband struck her a blow; she turned round to strike him again and her petticoat caught fire, and she ran down stairs; that one of the lodgers went up to tell him she was burnt, and he said she might burn.</p>

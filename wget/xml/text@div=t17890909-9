               <p>Was it late? - It was near one in the morning; this man Mahony, and Dunnovan wanted, right or wrong, to fight with the people they were Englishmen by their discourse, he and one of his comrades wanted to fight with all four Englishmen, and I prevailed upon him, and the other, to let the people pass, and the people went off, and walked I believe the space of a quarter of a mile myself on before them, and they were coming after me, when Mahony came behind me, and took my fork off my shoulder, struck me with it, and knocked me down, and told me, as he had not satisfaction out of the men that passed by, that he would out of me then; he would have quarrelled with every body he met; then he quarrelled with me; I said nothing, only begged of him to spare my life; he knocked me down several times, and stabbed me in my arm, with my own fork, and took 6 s. 4 1/2 d. out of my right hand pocket, while I was on the fiat of my back; the prisoner Twohig struck me once with a stick; he did not knock me down, it was near one in the morning, it was light enough, that you could see sixty or eighty miles in the road; I lay there for dead, and I saw Mahony go back to the Hyde, with my fork in his hand; I lay there by the hedge, until the day broke upon me, in the morning.</p>
               <p>When did you get up? - Just as the day broke, and the morning sun; that was I believe about four o'clock; then I came towards London, to the lodging that I always resorted to; I went to see whether I could get any justice, or a constable to apprehend these people; I went to the justice, but no justice would hear me, it was Sunday; I did not go to any justice the next day, for I never expected to meet one of them afterwards till the Wednesday. I met Mahony just at the end of Oxford-road, I took him, and carried him to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090015"></xptr>justice; when I asked him to spare me my life, he desired me to lay alongside of my countrys an that hung in chains thereabouts; I lost all my money, I was perfectly sober indeed, they seemed to me to be sober, excepting Mahony, and he could not be drunk, from what was there, nor none of them; I say they were sober.</p>
               <p>Then Mahony was sober? - Yes, but he would wrangle with any body; I could hear that character of him afterwards.</p>

The prisoner came to oar shop on the 31st of March, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, and asked for some tea, sugar, butter, and cheese. I weighed them all up, and put them on the counter; she then asked for change for a 1 l. note, which she produced. I looked at it, took it to the candle, told her it was bad, and asked whom she had it of - she said she knew whom she had it of. I asked her again, and she said she did not know. I told her she knew it was bad as well I did, and she had tried to pass it on me - she said she did not know it. While this conversation was going on, a man came in, and asked for a small quantity of cheese, which I gave him - he then asked what was the matter, and I told him. He asked her if she knew whom she had it of - she said she did not. He asked her if she was married - she said she was. He said, perhaps she was a poor woman who had a large family, and did not know who she had taken it of, and I had better give her the note, and let her go about her business - I refused. He then left the shop, and went outside. I then heard some muttering outside, and told my husband I wished there was an officer near, for I would have her taken up; he said he would fetch one, at that moment the door opened, and two men came in, one asked for tobacco, the other pretended to be in liquor, fell against the shop door, pushed it wide open, caught her by her two shoulders, and ran out with her. She had left the note in my hands, I took it in the parlour and saw a name on it very much blotted, with the words - and Co. Limehouse, or Wapping, I put it under an image on the shelf, it remained there till the Tuesday following, when I gave it to Christian, went to the office with him, and found her in custody (looks at one) this is it, it is the number 129,76, and there is H.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am an unfortunate young woman. I met a gentleman in the City-road, who went home with me, he promised me a 1 l. note, and refused to give it me; I put my hand into his side-pocket, and took out a pocket book, which contained the notes. I was going that way, and called in at these shops.</p>

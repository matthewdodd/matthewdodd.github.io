               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>A. I am a plaisterer. I was with the other men in this building when the Jew came in with some pencils, and ask'd if we wanted to buy any, opening his handkerchief. There were four carpenters at work. Henry Hill bought a dozen pencils, and gave the Jew a shilling for them. After that the Jew miss'd three dozen, and made a sad racket about them. They advised him to go up stairs after Benjamin Hill. He went up, and then I saw Broad take some pencils from under the bench, and carry them into the next room on the same floor.</p>

               <p>A. To the best of my knowledge it was about three weeks ago. I never thought any more of it afterwards, till one day this week, as I was coming through Westminster, I met Benjamin Hill, who desired me to come to Hicks's-hall to find the bill, and said I was to speak what I knew in behalf of the Jew.</p>

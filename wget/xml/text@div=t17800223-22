               <p>I was employed to load the cart with some goods to be carried from Mr. Palmer's in St. Martin's-lane, to Bow-Church-yard. I assisted the prisoner and Pass. Myers sent me for some brown paper. I saw him make up the parcel, and lay it on the compter; that was the last I saw of it. I did not know but some of the other porters had put it in the cart. When I unloaded the cart, I did not observe whether or no it was in the cart: there were some circumstances that led me to suspect the prisoner. I went after him, and on the Friday evening following I sent for him to a publick-house, the corner of St. Martin's-court, and asked him about the parcel. He gave me some ill language. I got a constable and had him taken up. When we were together I said, it was very hard for me, for my master charged me thirteen pounds for that parcel. He said, Well then, I will tell you where the parcel is; I have got it, and if you will go with me you shall have it. The constable went with him and I followed him to his lodging. When we came to his lodging, I asked his wife for the parcel. She fell a crying, and said she had taken it to a house by the New-Church in the Strand; if you will go with me I will go and fetch it. The constable and one of the justice's runners went with her and returned in about an hour to the publick-house with the parcel.</p>
               <p>Did you look at the parcel when they brought it? - Yes; the garters were in a bag, some of them were turned out upon the table before the justice. I believe them to be the same garters, I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>What was said to induce him to confess? - Nothing; only I said it was very hard for me to pay thirteen pounds. His apartment was below stairs, under ground.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said he must make them good, and if I would deliver them up to him, he would be very friendly to me? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Who did he tell it to? - All three of us; we were in the box together. We had a strong suspicion that he had the parcel.</p>
               <p>What was said to him before he confessed this? - I asked him whether he knew any thing of the parcel or not, and then he said directly, the parcel I will fetch you in five minutes.</p>
               <p>There was nothing said to induce him to confess? - Nothing at all. His wife fell a crying, and said, she had taken the parcel out of the house, and would go and fetch it.</p>
               <p>How did you know she was his wife? - They lived together as man and wife. I went with her to one Mr. Sharpe's, a stationer, by the New Church in the Strand. I stopped on the outside. The man who has the things went in with her. In the morning I told him if he knew any thing of the parcel, and would tell us, I would be a friend to him; he said then that he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Did you repeat that when he confessed in the publick-house? - No; it was four or five hours after I said I would be a friend to him that he confessed.</p>

               <p>To Woolley. Was this parcel one of the last things to be put in the cart? - It was very near the last.</p>
               <p>Was it a covered cart, or an open cart? - An open cart, a common town cart.</p>
               <p>Was it pretty full? - About as high as the sides of the cart. There were some chests of drawers, and a bed on the copse of the cart.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether the parcel was put in the cart? - I never saw it taken off the compter to be put into the cart.</p>
               <p>You published a hand-bill? - Yes (producing it). I and Pass went to deliver them all round the trade. Myers got them printed; they were brought to our house to be distributed.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you read the bills before you distributed them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The bill says,</p>
               <p>"Lost or stolen out of a cart on Friday last, between St. Martin's-lane and Bow-Church-yard," &amp;c. Did you tell your master or Mr. Myers that the bill<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230040"></xptr>was wrong? - No. My master asked me if I followed the cart, I said yes. He said, was I sure it was in the cart; I said I did not see it in the cart at all.</p>
               <p>To Myers. Did you direct the printing of the hand-bill? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found the parcel in St. Martin's-lane. It was very wet. I carried it home and put it out of the paper into the bag. I did not know whose they were.</p>
               <p>To Woolley. Did you follow the cart immediately? - No; I overtook it just as it came to Chandos-street.</p>

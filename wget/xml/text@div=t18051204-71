Yes; I saw the ostler go to the stable; Ford waited at the top of the yard, being a moonlight night I thought they would know me; and when I came back Ford had got the hay on his back going across the field with it, I ran after him, and asked him where he had got that hay, he told me he bought it at the corn-chandler's; I told him he must come back with me, and shew me where he bought it; I brought the hay back; my father came and took Ford.</p>

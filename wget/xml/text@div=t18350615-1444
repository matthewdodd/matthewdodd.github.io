                  </hi>. I live at No. 22, Artillery-place, City-road. The house belongs to Mr. Hunter—I do not know his Christian name—the house is under repair—I am left in care of it—on Monday, the 1st of June, between eight and nine o'clock, the prisoner came to the door and knocked—it was getting towards dusk—it had gone eight o'clock, I think—my little boy opened the door—he went away that time, and came in again about five or ten minutes—my little boy opened the door then, and called me up—I went up, and asked the prisoner what he wanted—he said he was come for a brush and a trowel—he said they belonged to his brother, who was there at work as a plasterer, and his brother had promised to lend them to him—I told him I thought he would not find it, as it was getting quite dusk, and the tools were at the top of the house, and I would get a light—he said he could do without a light—I saw him distinctly—he went up stairs—I offered to go with him, but he said he should find it without a light—I waited on the stairs for him—he was a long while on the stairs—he came down again, and brought a saw, a brush, and trowel down—I called at the door, seeing a person go by, and asked him, to come to my assistance, for I thought it was not quite right; and the man went and called a policeman—directly the prisoner heard the man's voice, he dropped the saw, and went down the kitchen stairs—the policeman came in and took him, with the brush and trowel in his hand.</p>

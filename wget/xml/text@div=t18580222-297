                  </hi>. I am a tailor of No. 8, Holywell Lane. On 29th Jan., I went to bed about 12 o'clock at night, having fastened the doors and windows myself—I was alarmed next morning, at a little before 6 o'clock, and found the back parlour window open—I went down the court, and found some things of mine put on a costermonger's barrow—they had been safe the previous night—I missed thirty-eight pairs of trousers, four rolls of stuff to make into trousers, a roll of moleskin, two jackets, and five other pairs of trousers; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of them—I have found all except the five pairs of trousers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, of No. 5, Holywell Place, close against the prosecutor's back wall. On 28th Jan., in the morning, I was in bed, and heard some one jumping from the wall between my master's and the prosecutor's premises; a water closet parts them—I then heard a barrow come up the court, which I knew was wrong—I got up about five minutes before 6 o'clock, and when I got out I found the prisoner on the top of the wall—there was another man on the top of the water closet, and the barrow was close by—I asked the prisoner what business he had there—he jumped down, and I collared him—the other one ran away, I could not see his face—we went together about twenty yards, when he slipped from his coat, and ran away—I could go no further, for I had no shoes or stockings on, and I kicked my foot against a stone—I saw him again five minutes afterwards, and am sure he is the person.</p>

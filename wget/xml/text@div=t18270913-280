            . I am a constable. Pluck called me up and seemed much frightened - I went about three hundred yards and took the prisoner; he said he had only stood in his own defence, and he told the Magistrate that Pluck had shoved him in a ditch; he had nothing but this razor in a case - a pistol was found by somebody, in a ditch near the spot; the man who found it is not here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking pretty fresh; this man shoved me over into the hedge; I saw him running away - I ran after him, and said he ought to be shot.</p>

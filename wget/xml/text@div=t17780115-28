               <p>On the 30th of December I lost a silver watch; I went into the <placeName id="t17780115-28-crimeloc150">Butcher's-arms in Chick-lane</placeName>

I felt the prisoner pulling my watch out of my pocket; I got hold of her wrist; my watch was then quite clearly out of my pocket; I saw her hand it to a little boy who ran away with it, upon which I secured her.</p>
               <p>Was you perfectly sober? - Yes; I drank only a pint of ale; I had come from a benefit club, but I had drank nothing there to hurt me.</p>

               <p>I heard two constables had enquired after me, and that I could find them at Mr. Blackborough's office; I went there voluntarily; the men did not come then; I went there again the next morning, and then this man swore to me about the watch; I never saw him before; I live with Mrs. Smith, a quilter, in Shoe-lane; I am but 16 years old.</p>

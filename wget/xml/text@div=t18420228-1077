                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop at Forest-gate, West Ham. I took a board with some writing in pencil on it over to Mr. Lane, of Elm Cottage, Upton-place, on Wednesday morning, the 22nd of February—I saw Mr. Lane there, and made inquiry of him respecting it—it is a regular way, in the carpentering line, to send orders written on pieces of wood like this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the last witness's wife. On Tuesday, the 22nd of February, the prisoner came with a piece of board, which he pro<lb></lb>duced to me for a gallon of porter—I said I did not know the party—he said they were working at Elm-cottage, where the board was directed; that he was the foreman, and the gentleman who was going to occupy the house when finished, had given the foreman some money—I asked a per<lb></lb>son who was there at the time if he knew the persons at the building—he said yes, and he thought I should get the money—I let him have a gallon of beer upon what is written on this board—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Please, Mr. Dyer, let the bearer have one gallon of porter for Mr. Lane, at Elm-cottage"—he afterwards fetched two more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the plasterers employed in repairing Elm-cottage. The writing on this board is not mine—I never authorized the prisoner to go to get the beer, or knew of his going, further than that on Tuesday, the 22nd, there was some beer brought into the building—I was at work in the drawing-room, and he was at work for the men in front of the house—they gave him two days' work, as he had nowhere to go to—they brought some beer into the drawing-room, and I had some, but I did not know how it was obtained till next day, when Dyer came and inquired if I had sent this board—I said no, and what fools they must be to let the beer go—it is not an ordinary mode of sending an order for beer on a board in this way—I did not desire the prisoner to go and get some beer, nor express a wish that he should go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> On Tuesday, the 22nd of February, I was directed by my employer, Mr. Sims, of Mile End-road, to go to Elm-cottage, to finish the job he had commenced some time previous; Lane asked me if I had any objection to fetch a gallon of porter; I said none in the least, and asked him where from, being a perfect stranger to the man and the place; he sent his plasterer's boy for a pencil and a piece of board, and wrote that order in my presence; he gave it into my hands; I read it over, and asked if that was his name; he said yes, it was all right, and directed me to the house where the beer was to be fetched from. I went to the house, and saw Mrs. Dyer; I gave her the board, and after some conversation with a footman who was there, she gave me the beer, which I took back to the building, and Lane, and all the men, except one who was a tee-totaller, drank of it. When Dyer called next morning, Lane denied having written the board; at that time I was not at work at the building, but at my master's yard; in the evening be accused me of having done this act, and discharged me; next morning I went to Elm-cottage to inquire about it; Lane gave me a breakfast, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184202280184"></xptr>
               <p>said he had seen Mr. Dyer, and made it all right, that he had agreed to pay him back on Saturday or Monday; consequently I stopped at the building till two o'clock; on my road home I met Mrs. Dyer, who asscused me of this and asked if I had any objection to be given in charge; I said, "Not the slightest;" a policeman was sent for, and I was taken before a Magistrate—Dyer called at Elm-cottage, to ask Lane whether he did write this board or not, and to come to the Magistrate; he said he would not go without a policeman; Dyer obtained one, and on his return found the garden-gate locked, and Lane spoke from the inside; the consequence was they were obliged to come away without him; the Magistrate directed him to be fetched to Bow next morning, but on the policeman going, he found the gate locked, and Lane said he would not come forward without a written order; one was obtained, and he was taken to Ilford on Saturday, where he stated that he did not write the order.</p>

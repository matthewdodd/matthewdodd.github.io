            . The prisoner was also in his employ. On the 16th of this month, I was set to watch the prisoner; there are three shops in Mr. Jackson's house; the prisoner was at work in one of the shops; different work is carried on in different shops. I watched him through a hole in the wall, that I made for that purpose. I saw him take two pair of boot-legs, and secrete them under his trowsers. I informed Mr. Jackson's clerk of it; he went and told Mr. Jackson of it. The clerk went into the shop where the prisoner was. He let the prisoner go out into the street, and then called him back; told him Mr. Jackson wanted to speak to him; the prisoner went out in the street about two yards from the door; when he came into the shop he attempted to run up stairs. He told him to go into the accompting-house. The clerk ran after him, and laid hold of him, and said Byrne, you have got legs about you; he said, yes, I have, and begged for mercy. He was taken into a room adjoining. He then took out two pair of legs from his trowsers, where he had put them before. Mr. Broadhurst, the clerk, took possession of them. The legs would sell for half-a-guinea a pair; they were in a finished state, ready for sale.</p>

I desired the prisoner to go into the accompting-house; I thought he was following me. He ran up stairs; I ran up stairs, and collared him. I told him he had legs about him, and desired him to pull them out; the prisoner immediately begged for mercy. He pulled the legs out himself in the sale shop, from his trowsers.

                  </hi>. I am a builder. I had some building at Brook<lb></lb>cot-tage, St. John's-wood. On the 7th of Oct. I employed the prisoner, and on the Monday following I watched him—he came from the buildings to leave his work at a quarter-past five o'clock, and inquired of me about some nails—I answered him, and he was going on—I then said, "I think you have some of my lead on you"—he said, "Oh no, I have not," and hurried on—I ran after him and said, "This won't do, what have you got in your pocket?"—he took two pieces from his jacket-pocket, and one from his trowsers—I told him to take it back to where he got it—he went up to the first-floor, and gave it to a carpenter named Bryant—I took it to my premises and compared it—I have no doubt it is mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor, and live at the Sailors' Home, Wells Street—at 6 p.m. on Feb. 12th I was at Euston Square Station with some of my shipmates, and we went into a public-house and had a glass of beer—I saw Anderson there—she said, "Will you treat me?"—I demurred at first, and said that I did not know her, and she said. "You might as well treat me to a glass"—I did so, and took out half a-crown to pay for it—I had 12 sovereigns and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—it was wrapped up in my certificate of discharge in my breast pocket—I left the public-house alone, and on going down to the Sailors' Home I was attacked by three men—Moore is one of them—he knocked me down with his list, jumped on me, put his hand in my breast pocket, and ran away—I pursued him and caught him, and he knocked me down again by a blow in my face, which bled, and was marked afterwards—I was also kicked by one of the others while on the ground—I knew my money and certificate were gone before I ran after him Jones caught him—on the way to the station Anderson tried to rescue Moore by striking Jones in the face and kicking him, and another constable came to his assistance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Moore.</hi> I was not drunk—I was in the Sailors' Home at 2.30, and not in Drummond Street—I was with no one but my shipmates all day—I was not giving everyone drink, nor did I pay for it—I never toss, and do not know how to—I never spoke to you in my life—I can take care of my own money, and did not ask you to hold it—I never saw you till you attacked me.</p>

At about 6.45 p.m. on Feb. 12th I was on duty in Euston Road, and saw two men running—I followed and caught the first one (Moore)—he said, "Oh, policeman, let me go, I am only running away from that man who is knocking me about." McFadden then came up and gave him in custody—I took Moore to the station, and before we got 100 yards Anderson rushed out at me and caught hold of him, and tried to drag him away—I did not see where she came from—I told her to keep away, but she would not, and I pushed her away—Moore's hat fell off, and she tried to pick it up, but I kept her away, and she struck me two or three blows in the face—another constable came up and took her in custody—at the station, before Moore was charged, he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, which he took from his left side pocket—I searched him, and found 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold in his left side pocket—I did not find the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note or the discharge.</p>

He gave me some money, saying, 'Take care of this, if I have a fight with them two.' The two began fighting. One of the men began to hit me. I ran slowly away.

At the com<lb></lb>mencement of this month I was employed in the recruiting service, in London—it was my duty to billet certain recruits in the neighbourhood of Chelsea—Craig was assisting me—he is a private, in the 43rd—he can write pretty well—he signed the recruits' names on each of these billet forms (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these are got from the police station—there are no names on them when they are given at the police station—(<hi rend="italic">Form read:</hi> "To the landlord of——public house.

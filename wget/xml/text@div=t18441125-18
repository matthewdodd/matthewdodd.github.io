                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Green-arbour-square, Old Bailey. On Friday afternoon, the 25th of Oct., about a quarter past four o'clock, I was in Smithfield—I felt a pushing, turned round, and there was a gentleman behind, in the act of telling me that somebody had taken a handkerchief from my pocket, but before he had time to tell me, I saw the prisoner with my handkerchief in his jacket pocket—I immediately laid hold of him—he threw the handkerchief from his person, down at some horses' feet—I picked it up, and put it into my pocket—it was mine—I had a dress-coat on, and it had been in my inner pocket—I took hold of the prisoner, and was in the act of taking him to the station—this was nearly in the centre of the market—after I got him over two of the rails, a mob collected—some cried it was not him, that the boy that took it was gone away—he struggled—the mob formed round me, perhaps 150, and several of the mob jumped on to my wrist at differ<lb></lb>ent times—as they got him from one hand, I caught him with the other—he was got away from me four times—and after that, a parcel of the horse-dealers there untied several horses, and backed them among the crowd, and we were all obliged to look to ourselves for self-protection—the pri<lb></lb>soner was passed from one to the other of the mob, and I went after him all over the pens—I was covered with mud from top to bottom—I saw a</p>

                  </hi>. I know Mr. Dean's house, in Brunswick-square, St. Pan-eras; it is his dwelling-house. On Friday morning, the 30th of Oct. I was en-gaged with somebody in the house who was mending some pipes, and heard a female servant scream out—I ran, and met her coming from the area—she gave me information and I missed a watch, which I had seen safe ten minutes before, from the pantry, which is in front of the house, next the area—there are two doors before you come to it—I ran out immediately—the area gate was locked, but the area door was open—they must have got over the area gate or railing—I ran out—a gentleman directed me round into Bernard-street—I saw the prisoners running very fast abreast of each other, and followed them—Davis turned round and saw me, and then they ran faster—I overtook' them near the top of Wilmott-street—Davis said he had been pursuing Jones; I said they must both come back—I had seen them running abreast of each other for about 300 yards, for a minute and a half—Davis could have secured Jones at any time, if so inclined—I asked where the watch was—Davis said he had got it, it was all right—he said he had seen Jones get over the gate, and ran after him—I said then he must come back as a witness against Jones—he followed me back to the house, holding Jones by the collar—when they got back I asked where the watch was—Davis said, "Here it ii," and produced it from his pocket—I took them down below, and discovered that there were two spoons gone from a drawer—I asked Jones if he had anything else—he said he had not—then Davis searched him, put his hands all over his person, and said he had got nothing—Jones was afterwards searched at the station, and delivered up two spoons from his jacket pocket—I cannot say whether Davis put his hand into that pocket, but he squeezed it up, and said he had nothing—this watch and the spoons produced are my master's, and have his crest on them.</p>

About a quarter to nine o'clock I saw the prisoners talking together, and walking very gently towards Brunswick-square—I saw them pass me—I did not look after them—they turned round the corner from Great Coram-street—the beadle brought them to me about half-past nine, and I recognized them.</p>

On Tuesday the 23rd of May, the prisoner came to my shop to buy a neat's foot, I served her; she tendered me a shilling in payment, which my brother went and got changed, and the price of the neat's foot being five pence I gave the prisoner seven pence in change; just as the woman was going away,

I remember the prisoner at the bar, tendering a shilling to my sister, I went to the public house to get change of it; Mr. Johnson was there, both him and the landlady said the shilling was bad; he told me to mark it, which I did, and he marked it himself; he told the landlady to give me a shillings worth of halfpence, she did, and he gave her a good shilling.

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner on the 23rd of May, in Whitecross-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210025"></xptr>I watched her, she went into a butcher's shop and I heard her ask the price of some meat; she was about to buy it; she threw down a shilling, which was refused. She then went to Jacob's well. I continued my watch, and followed her to Miss Smail's; she stood talking, and bought a neat's foot, and gave a shilling in payment; I followed the boy, when he went to get change, and saw him go into the public house; both he and I marked the shilling; while we were there, I went to Miss Smail's, and took the prisoner into custody; I took her into a back room and searched her, and on her I found a piece of blue paper containing three shillings, each wrapt up separately in a piece of blue paper, so that they might not scratch. They have been in my possession ever since, and here they are.</p>
               <p>MR. POWELL. I am solicitor for the mint, I am in the habit of inspecting counterfeit money. These three shillings are counterfeits, and are of the same manufacture as the one proved to have been tendered. They are quite fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the effect of keeping them folded between the paper - A. It keeps them fresh for circulation.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Johnson never saw me in the butcher's shop. I found the three shillings wrapped up in a piece of paper.</p>

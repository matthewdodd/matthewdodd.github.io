                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 293). At about 11.30 p.m. on the 18th November I was on duty in plain clothes in the Commercial Road when I saw Chambers with another man, who is not apprehended, and a woman, standing round a sailor, who seemed to have been drinking—they were outside the St. George public-house—they all went in, and remained there half an hour, when Chambers and the missing man came out with the sailor, and they went into the Commercial Road—I followed them; they went into the Bedford Arms—I passed Chambers very closely as I crossed the street—he had his left hand in the left-hand trousers pocket of the sailor—they came into Bedford Street, and they met Smith, and they all three went into the Bedford Arms with the sailor, and remained till 12.30, when they came out together—I was concealed in a doorway on the opposite side of the street—I saw Cham<lb></lb>bers and Smith and the man not in custody bring the sailor along from the Bedford Arms towards the Commercial Road, when the sailor was</p>

               <p>knocked down by one of them; there was a constable in uniform close by—I went to him and picked up the sailor—the other constable took Smith into custody—Chambers and the other man not in custody ran away—I followed Chambers into the Commercial Road—I took him into custody and charged him with assaulting and attempting to rob the sailor—he said "It is not me," and on the way to the station he said "There were three of us in it; you ought to have Cooper as well."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Chambers.</hi> You were not 10 yards on the other side when I said "I want you for robbing this man"—I did not say to you at the station "Who was it who knocked that man down?"—you did not say "I believe the man fell down"—I did not say "Who was that standing outside the Bedford Arms?" and you did not say you did not know any of them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 317). I was on duty at the time in question, and saw the other constable—I waited until they came out of the Bedford Arms—there were the prisoners and another man and the sailor—I did not see anything which had happened before—after they came out they came upon the same side that I was standing, and when they got half way between the Bedford Arms public-house and the Commercial Road, in a dark corner, they all three kept very closely round the sailor, and all at once I heard the sailor fall—it could only be about twenty-five yards from where I was standing—I ran up, and when I got up I saw Chambers run across the road, and the missing man ran away then through Bedford Road—Smith had got hold of the sailor and the sailor of him, and he could not get away—I took Smith into custody, and asked what was the matter—the sailor said, "See what they have done after treating them all the evening; they have knocked me down and robbed me"—his left-hand trousers pocket was torn down half way across the front—I said to Smith I should take him into custody for assaulting and attempting to rob the sailor, and he said to the sailor, "So help me God! are you going to lock me up after being with you all the evening?"—the sailor did not say anything—in reply to the charge Smith said, "I did not have anything to do with robbing him, I was only helping him along.</p>

I saw the prosecutor inside, and had a drink with him and another man. We came outside and went into the Bed<lb></lb>ford Arms. We had two drinks, and I paid for one and the prosecutor paid for the other, all but a halfpenny, which he borrowed of this man. He then fell down a few yards off, and this man said, 'I will pick him up.' I said, 'Don't; you may get yourself into trouble.' I went over the other side and stood ten yards away, and saw a constable come up. I was going across the road to see what this man was to be locked up for, and the constable came across the road and said, 'I want you for robbing this man.' I said, 'You have made a mistake.' On going to the station he said, 'Who knocked that man down?' I said, 'I believe he fell down.' The prosecutor, when at the station, said he had lost 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. The next day he said he changed a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note at 11 o'clock, and lost the rest of that, and the Magistrate asked him whether me or this man robbed him, and he shook his head, and said, 'I don't know.'"</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe whether there was the track of more persons than one? - A. Yes; or else that one had had two or three journies; we traced the footsteps to a lane called Arrow-lane, and then when we got into the road, we could not trace it any further: on Saturday night, the 8th, between six and eight in the evening, two men brought the prisoner down to me; I charged the constable with him, and desired one of the men to go and fetch two planks that they had taken off his back; and he was committed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he express himself clearly, that he was going to sell them for three shillings? - A. Yes; and he said he had taken eight the night before; I asked him what he did with them; and he said he had sold them to a shop; I asked him what shop, and he said stick-a-me-knife first, with a thump upon his breast; Mr. Bough was present; I took him the same evening to Mr. Staples's office.</p>
               <p>Bough. I was present at the conversation with Brandy; he spoke very imperfect English, but he could answer any question in the negative or affirmative, as plain as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he speak such good English that you could be certain as to what he said? - A. No, I could not; when Brandy asked where he sold them, he said three shillings, and shop or ship, I could not tell which.</p>

I am not guilty; I bought them of an unknown person, who came to me and asked me three shillings for these two planks; I do not recollect the day, but it was about seven o'clock in the evening of the day that I was stopped; I had very lately come from a foreign country, and I do not know any body here.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Aust.) Was the direction in which he was going, towards the docks or from the docks? - A. From the docks.</p>
               <p>Bough. I counted them again on the Sunday, and found twelve more gone.</p>

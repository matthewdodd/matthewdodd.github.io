I live at 49, Gooch-street, Tottenham-court-road—on 20 November I went to bed at half-past 11—my premises were then quite safe—Mrs. Blake and her friend disturbed me about 1 o'clock, and I found my parlour window on the ground floor open—it opens into an area—the shutters were broken off, and lay in a chair—they were inside shutters, fastened with an iron bar—whoever got in got in by the window—neither the area nor the street door were open—nothing was taken away.</p>

I live at 82, Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square—on 20th November I went to Mr. Blake's, John-street, Gooch-street, to spend the evening—she lives opposite Mr. Pitman—I left at about a quarter to 1—I was stepping off the pavement to cross the road, and saw a man outside Mr. Pitman's window putting it down, and another man close by—the prisoners are the men—I went back to Mrs. Blake, who came out with me, and the prisoners were then scrambling over the railings into the road—I saw Brown come off of the window-cill—when I first saw him he was standing on a bar that goes from the iron railings to the house—they got over the railings, turned the corner, and I lost sight of them.</p>

               <p>and I found a groove in the paint corresponding with this notch in the crow-bar—there was only one mark on the window, but several on the shutters—this crow-bar exactly fitted them—the shutters had been broken off, but when I saw them they had been put up again—the notches in the crow-bar exactly corresponded with some notches in the paint—the window was outside the shutters, and had been, I imagine, forced up by the crow-bar—I found no marks inside the house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, E</hi> 15).

                  </hi>. I am a coal dealer, in partnership with Thomas Clark, at Fetter-lane. The prisoner was our carman—we dealt with Messrs. Neal and Co., of Upper Ground-street, Blackfriars—on 16th Jan. I directed the prisoner to go to Messrs. Neal, and get a ton of the beet coals—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he brought me back this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the same day—I sent him again for two tons, and gave him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he brought me back this, bill</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said that the coal merchants had no best coals, and he had brought seconds, and that was the price of them—they are charged 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the bill—on 17th Jan. I gave him an order to get one ton of coals, and gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he brought me seconds, and said that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was the price of them—on the same day I gave him an order to go and get two tons of the best coals at the same place—he brought me back seconds, and this receipt for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said that they had no other coals.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal merchant, of Upper Ground-street, Black-friars. On 17th Jan., the prisoner came to my wharf, with a van for some coals—my man had gone to dinner—I cannot Bay what coal he asked for—we have a list of prices of coals in the counting house; he usually selected the commonest coals—I wished him to have some vendor's tickets for his employer to fill up—the prisoner represented that his employer was badly paid, and that he wanted the coals for another party—he mentioned no names, and I did not know who he was <hi rend="italic">drawing</hi> the coals for, but he wanted 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. put on the bill to enable his master to get a profit—I charged him the price which was on our list; I cannot say what price that was, unless I had the books; this is copied from the counterpart, and I have a little cash book as well in which he enters it, and gives me a sample for what he receives of me—the cash book is not here, but this book contains the whole of it—I make an entry in the counterpart of the book from which this receipt is taken—the sum entered on the counterpart may not correspond with the sum entered upon the receipt—I pay over to Jordan the money I receive over the counter—I cannot recollect how much I paid over to him—I gave this receipt for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is in my writing—I had not received 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but less—I do not think that there is any case in which he has paid the money that he has had the bill made out for, but having once assigned the reason, it was allowed to go on, believing that it was his master's order—if he had asked to have 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. put in the bill for himself, I would not have done it—he took the two tons of coals; he bought them in Mr. Clark's name, who left us shortly afterwards in consequence of our selling bad coals—I handed over all the money to Jordan that I received from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You cannot say what money there was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; this is not a common practice of ours—I have known a case of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. being added to a bill before—you may call it a fraud—I have done so to the extent of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. perhaps in one ton in 5,000; I think I can swear to that—I remember two customers to whom I have given such receipts; I mean to the Carmen; they are master carmen—there are a great many men who keep a horse and van, who do not come down to the wharf but they cart coals for less than the coal merchants can, and they come down and say, "I have got to give this man credit, you put me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on;" but we never allow any servant to get 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a ton on coals, and we never put any amount on the bill but what they pay, but in this case I believed that it was his master's orders—it is not, besides that, my custom to give the Carmen a couple of shillings when they bring orders; we cannot afford to do it; nor 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., nor 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we only get 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—we have perhaps given a man a pint of beer, but not' for bringing an order—if the coals are getting small, we perhaps ask a man to take a sieve and assist, and give</p>

               <p>him a drop of beer—I mean to say I have never given Carmen money to induce them to bring orders for coals; I have to agents, who sell coal for us; we provide them with printed orders and envelopes, and allow them 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton for their trouble in writing to us; and if our carmen get an order, when they are shooting coals we give them 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but we never allow anything for bringing such an order as this—we do not get 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ton out of the transaction, or not more—our books will prove it—the more business we do, the cheaper we can do it—I never saw Clark—I supposed I was selling to some retailer, and that Clark was the Carman—Clark's customer was the person who was to be <hi rend="italic">done.</hi>

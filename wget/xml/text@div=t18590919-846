At 4 o'clock in the morning, on 11th September, I was on duty in High Holborn—I heard the spring of a rattle, and in consequence I went to the shop of Mr. White—I found Comber there—after some time the door was opened by one of the inmates of the house—I turned my light on and I and Comber went in—I saw the prisoner in a stooping position in the right hand corner of the shop—he was in the same clothes that he has on now, but he had no hat or boots on—I took him in custody and searched him—I found this silver watch in his waistcoat pocket, and this gold chain round his neck—I also found this Prayer-book in his coat pocket, these two knives in his trousers pocket, and this brooch was about a foot from where he was—I asked where his hat and boots were—he said they were at the top of the house—comber went up and found them—the house, 262, High Holborn, is in the parish of St. Giles, and the house we were in is in the same parish.</p>

                  </hi>. I am daughter of John Baldry, who keeps a public-house, 262, High Holborn—there are two houses between that and the house, where the prisoner was found—this chain, and watch, and Prayer-book, are all mine—these knives are not—on Saturday night, 10th September, I went to bed about 12 o'clock—before I went to bed I put my watch and chain, and brooch, and Prayer-book, on the dressing-table in my room on the second floor—I closed my bed-room door—I got up in the morning about half-past 7 o'clock—I missed all those articles, and my bed-room door was open—I had a case belonging to this Prayer-book; the Prayer-book was in the case the night before on my table—this case was found out-side the house—there is a tap-room in the house which has a window opening on the roof—about 10 minutes after I found these articles were gone I went up to look at that window; it was shut—I had seen it shut two or three days before—it was kept shut generally—it had no fastening to it—it could be opened by a person on the roof—I did not see this case of the Prayer-book found outside—my youngest brother found it and he called me up.</p>

On Wednesday, the 3rd of June, he had two calves and twelve geese; I secured the calves in the pen - they were all right at ten o'clock that night; the pen is at the end of the cowhouse - the geese were in a building which was formerly a stable; it is part of the premises - I saw them safe at eight o'clock, when I secured them there, as usual; I got up between five and six o'clock in the morning, and went to the pens immediately - the calves were gone, and the doors were open; I then went to the stable - that door was open, and only one goose left; I went and told master, then went to Dorward, the constable, who accompanied me to London that morning - we went to Leadenhall-market, and in consequence of information there, we went to Judson's, a butcher, in Whitechapel; I saw Adaman there, and in consequence of what passed I went to the house of the witness Banks, in Rosemary-lane - it was in the morning; I there saw the two calves dead, but their skins on - I knew them to be my master's, and the two I had lost; the skins are here (looking at them) - these are only the skins of the two bodies, the skins of the heads were so offensive we could not keep them - the heads were particularly spotted about the eyes, by which I knew them, and here are white marks down the back on these skins, by which I know them; the mark on the head was a particular one - I have not a doubt they were the heads of my master's calves - one was seven weeks old, and the other seven weeks and a few days; they corresponded in age, and one of the skins has a very particular mark - they were calved at our place. When I went to Banks' the prisoner was there, with the calves; I had known him before for seven or eight years, and have seen him passing the house three or four days running - Dorward took him into custody: something passed between me, Dorward, and Banks before that - after finding the calves Dorward went to look for the geese, and I saw eight of master's geese in a cart at Lambeth-street Office on the Friday: they are now at master's farm - I have no doubt of their being eight of what were stolen; one had been left behind, and when the eight came back they appeared to know each other; if you put geese to a strange one they will fight - they were not marked: I put them down in the farm-yard, they then came up to the back door where they were usually fed, and the one which had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080010"></xptr>been left behind came and joined them - they appeared to recognise each other; I believe they formed eight of the eleven which were stolen - the calves were not exactly in a killing condition; they were worth about 7l.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. What are you? A. A bailiff; there are two other persons employed at the farm - it is my duty to look after the calves.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever see a brown calf without a white stripe down the back? A. Yes; I never saw one like this before - there are certainly others with white backs, but not as this is; I do not mean to say there never was one like it before - there were also marks on the head of a particular sort: the head was spotted round the eye very particularly - it is common for calves to be spotted.</p>
               <p>Q. The other skin is white, what do you know that by? A. The skin is dried up now, and I cannot explain it so well; I know it by these marks - I never saw another marked like this one; it is a very particular mark - I have had some hundreds of calves under my care, and never saw one that would answer this; I never saw one marked like it; I should know it from five hundred - I never knew the prisoner employed to take calves or poultry to market; he kept a cart, and I know he carried wood- I do not undertake to swear to the geese, but have no doubt of them; my master has no other Christian name.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you speak to the prisoner at Banks'? A. Yes - I said to Dorward, "That is Kirby;" Banks lives in Rosemary-lane.</p>
               <p>DAVID DORWARD. I am constable of Chingford. On the morning of the 3rd of June I was spoken to, and went with Hawes to Leadenhall-market, after inquiring at different markets; I afterwards went to the house of Judson, in Whitechapel, and there saw Adaman - in consequence of what he told me I went to Banks', in Rosemary-lane, with Hawes and Adaman, and saw the two calves hanging up, with the skins partly off, as the butchers generally leave them when they are fresh killed; the prisoner and Banks were there - Hawes identified the calves, and recognised the prisoner; I said, "Halloo, countryman. who would have thought of seeing you here?" I live at Woodford, and had frequently seen him, but not for some time before this; he was very much agitated, and said, "I don't know you;" I knew that he did know me very well, and said, "You know me very well - you are my prisoner," and took him into custody; I found five of the geese next day at Leadenhall-market, in the possession of Howard, and two more were produced at Lambeth-street by Howard; I took the geese to Chingford, and put them down in the farm-yard - they appeared to recognise the one which was left, and that one seemed pleased and was cackling; they went under the gate together, into another yard, and then to the place where they are fed - I was present before the Magistrate when the prisoner was examined; I believe what he said was taken in writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Before you took him to the Magistrate, did he say any thing to you? A. He said he did not steal them - that he was engaged by two men to fetch them from Chingford; I asked who the men were - he said he did not know them at first; he afterwards said one was a bird-fancier - I have since ascertained who that is, and have been in pursuit of him, but cannot find him; he said that he went down with him, and another man, who he had very little knowledge of, was to meet him at Mr. Walton's; he said the bird-fancier had engaged him- that the bird-fancier and him met at the Two Brewers at Stratford; he went down to Walton's with the birdfancier, and met the other man, who had got the calves ready for them - that the bird-fancier and him carried them to the cart, which stood at a little distance from the house, in the lane; he said it was about two o'clock in the morning - he said that he engaged him to fetch them, and he did not steal them, for he was employed by them- he said he and the bird-fancier carried them from Mr. Walton's barn; I had not held out any threat or promise to him, but told him what he said to me would come against him as evidence - he lives at Hackney-wick, four or five miles from Chingford; I have seen him many times at Woodford, which is the adjoining parish to Chingford.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BANKS. I am a butcher, and live in Rosemary-lane. On Thursday morning, the 3rd of June, between seven and eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Lime-street, Leadenhall-market, where they unload the meat-carts for the market - he had a cart with two calves, also two small hampers and one long one at the side; he called to me, "Butcher, will you buy two calves?" I told him no - I went over, looked at them, and asked what he wanted - he said either eight guineas, or 8l., I do not know which; I said No - he said, "Do you know any body who will kill them for me?" I asked whose they were - he said they were his own; he asked if I knew who would kill them for him - I said I would if he would take them down to my house; he asked where I lived - I said, "No. 64, Rosemary-lane;" he took them there - I was to have 10s. for killing them, and taking them to market the following morning; that is about a fair price - I went home directly; he was coming to my house, and I met him - he had the calves and three hampers with him - I helped him to take the calves out, and put them in my shop, which is in front of the main street - I untied their legs, and said, "Let them lay and rest themselves;" he said, "Put them backward in the back place" - (they could be seen where I put them in the shop, which was open, and the door off;) he drove them backwards himself, and we went over to the Hampshire Hog public-house, and had a glass of gin each; he said I was to kill them and get them done by four o'clock, and he would come back again - I said that should be done; he said they were to go to Mr. Brown's, Whitechapel-market, the following morning; he wanted me to purchase them several times - I said what I bought I always bought at market; we parted about half-past eight o'clock- Adaman, who was in Mr. Judson's service, came to my shop between eleven and twelve that day; I told him what had passed between me and the prisoner, and showed him the calves - between three and four o'clock that day he came with Hawes and Dorward; Hawes recognized the calves. which hung in the middle of my shop - he said, "They are my vmaster's calves, I will swear to them;" the prisoner was present, and was taken into custody; I never saw him before that morning, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure about the conversation you first had with him? A. Yes, quite;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080011"></xptr>nobody else was with him - I am sure he did not say he was instructed to sell them, and get them killed; nobody came to inquire after the calves after he was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Is Salmon in your service? A. I employed him to kill them - my house is in Middlesex.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH SALMON. I occasionally kill beast for Banks. On Thursday morning, the 3rd of June, I killed these two calves - the prisoner came in while I was killing them; he said they were his own, and that they were to go to market - I was to do them in the best manner I could.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ADAMAN. On Thursday, the 3rd of June, I was gathering money for Mr. Judson, who is a carcasebutcher; I went that day to Banks', who made a communication to me about the prisoner, and showed me the calves - Dorward and the bailiff came to me that afternoon; I accompanied them to Banks', and saw the two calves, which were then killed - they were alive in the morning; they appeared the same calves.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose there was no particular mark by which you could recognize them? A.There was no private mark, but I knew them from the colour of the skin.</p>

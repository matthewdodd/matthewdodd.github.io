                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Ruddock, of 2, Royal-hill, Green<lb></lb>wich—I was there on July 22d, at half-past 6—while I was there two lads came in; One of them was the prisoner—they came for a fancy chair for their mother, they said—one took it, and the other looked at it—they got close to me; just before that I had my watch in my pocket—I then saw one of them run out, and heard my keys fall on the ground—I caught the other one by the coat, and said, "You rascal! you hare got my watch"—I caught him by the sleeve, and he slipped away—the watch was worth 3 guineas; I have never seen it since—I have the piece of ribbon that was attached to it; he caught that.</p>

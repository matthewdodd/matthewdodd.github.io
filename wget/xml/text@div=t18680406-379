I keep the Galloway Arms, Thames Street, Lime-house—on 30th March I fastened up my house before going to bed—I left a silver cup, a coffee-pot, a bottle of brandy on the sideboard, and an electro-plate cup with a stem to it—I also left about nine shillings' worth of copper in the till—I came down at half-past six the next morning, and missed the articles—the buck parlour window was open, and the shutters</p>

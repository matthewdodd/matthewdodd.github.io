                  </hi>. I live in the service of Mr. Joseph Fuller of Steward's-grove, Chelsea. On the 7th of February I placed a blue bag in the kitchen—it contained a jacket, a pair of boots, a shirt, and two collars—I tied the bag up—I left it with my fellow-servant, to give to the porter when he called—it was Mr. Joseph Fuller's property—it was for his son, who is about fifteen years old—he is an apprentice in town, and comes home on Saturday.</p>

I received a bag from the cook—I took it from her in the kitchen, and gave it to the carman—I saw it put into the cart—I went with the cart—I was in North-street, Chelsea, for about half-an-hour, and some one took the bundle while we were there—I did not miss it till we got to Brewer-street, about half-past seven o'clock—I had seen it safe about two hours before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a braid and fringe manufacturer, and live in Bunhill-row. The prisoner Kennedy was in my service as a braid Cleaner for a year and a half—he sometimes earned seven shillings a week, and sometimes eight shillings—the policeman brought some braid to me, which Was the first intimation I had of its being stolen—I immediately supposed it to be mine, and went up stairs for a corresponding article to prove it—I took some bobbins off the machine and compared them, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Friday, the 25th of August, I was going down Wentworth-street, Whitechapel, and saw the two prisoners coming up George-yard—I stood for a minute and saw them standing still, looking towards me—they began to walk back towards where they came from—I stopped the female and asked what she had in her arm—the other immediately walked away—I examined the bundle, and found the braid produced—I asked where she got it—she said from her employer in Old street-road—I asked who he was—she said "Mr. Phillips, a braid manufacturer"—I asked how long she had worked for him—she said she was a braid winder, and had worked for him about five months—I was dissatisfied with her statement, and took her to the watch-house—I made inquiry and found the owner of the property, but no such person as she described in Old-street-road—I inquired at different braid manufacturers—the prosecutor identified the property, and I apprehended the male prisoner on his premises.</p>

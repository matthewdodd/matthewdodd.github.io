I takes hold of her by the cloak directly and said, you have robbed me; and she stretched up her hand to the other woman and gave her something; there was some people in the street, and I called out to the people in the street, and she went along with me into Mr. Gerards, I searched her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking? - I had one glass of gin; that was all, the whole day long.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you stop to talk to this woman? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. She asked you to go with her? - She did; and then she got hold of e round the middle and took out the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come before you, or behind you, or how? - She came before me and quite lifted her feet from the ground; she got hold of me so fast I thought it was impossible almost she could get hold so fast only with one hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you come out of Mr. Gerards? - I was going to Mr. Gerard's for my uncle to come and have some supper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he came up to me there was no soul in the narrow passage? - There was a woman in a red cloak and a tall man, and they spoke together, but what I cannot say, and she said, in the mean time, when I took her into Mr. Gerard's, that she would let me have her cloak to get half a guinea upon at pawn; the prisoner asked me if I would search her? I said, no, I would send for an officer; she desired to be searched by the woman of the house and her mother.</p>

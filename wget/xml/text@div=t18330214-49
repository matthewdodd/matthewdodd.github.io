The prisoner lodged with me, and left with - out notice - she was indebted to me for board and lodging during the whole time she was there; she had told me she was a respectable married woman living on a maintenance allowed by her husband - I missed these articles; I heard she was walking in Regent-street - I went there, and gave her into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you known her before she came to lodge with you? A. No; I was not at all acquainted with her husband - I did not agree to board her when she came, but she met with an accident, and no one came to her; I cannot say that I never went out with her, but it was before I knew what she was - I was not in the habit of going to places of amusement with her; I was not there above three times with her - it was her wish that I should go with her; I paid for her; she has gone without me, and I have lent her money - one gentleman used to visit at my house; a gentleman of the name of Thorn once lodged at my house - I lent the prisoner a shawl once to wear when she was ill; it was returned, and put into my drawer; that and other things were taken away - we went to different theatres; I went to the prisoner's husband to say she had robbed me - he said he had been the things about her, and he wished her to send them home; she said she would rather he transported than send them back; I said unless she did, and made arrangements to pay the rent, I would have her taken.</p>

             (Police-constable C 112). I was in Oxford-street - the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge; I found nothing on her, she refused to say where she lived, but I found she lived in Henry-street - I found there this bed-gown and night-cap: she owned to having the shawl and silk handkerchief, which she put round her knee, and lost in the street.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She lent me the beads to go to Covent-garden in, and in three or four days afterwards I returned them to her - she would not have them, but put them round my neck again.</p>
               <p>MRS. WALEV. I am housekeeper in a gentleman's family; I have known the prisoner twelve months; she had a respectable character - she is separated from her husband; I called at the prosecutor's to see her about a week after she had left - the prosecutrix told me she had lent her a shawl to put round her knee, and she said, if she did not bring the things back and pay the rent, she would charge her with felony.</p>

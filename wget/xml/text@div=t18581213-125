                  </hi>. I am a baker of Bedford-place, Fulham-road. On the evening of 2d December my wife fetched me, and I saw Fitzgerald there—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change, and saw a half-crown in the till; that was the only one there—my wife gave him the coppers, 3 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had a loaf in his hand, the price of which was 2 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—next day about dusk he came again and purchased a half-quartern loaf; I was in the shop then—it came to 2 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half-crown; I gave him the change and he went away—I had nothing in the till but threepenny and fourpenny pieces and sixpences, till I put his half-crown in—Welch came in a few minutes afterwards and pur<lb></lb>chased a penny loaf and a halfpenny worth of treacle—he gave me a half crown—no other customer had passed a half-crown—I put it in the till and there were then two half-crowns there—Fitzgerald came again half-an-hour afterwards—he first came and asked for, I think, some cheese; he gave me a shilling—I put it in the till; there were no other shillings there—I gave him change and he left—in about a quarter of an hour Welch came in and asked for some more bread; he gave me a shilling—I put it in the till, gave him the change, he went away—Fitzgerald came again a little while afterwards and tendered me a shilling, which I put in the till—Welch then came again for a penny loaf, and brought another shilling—they each came three times that evening—about an hour after shutting up the shop that evening, I found that I had two bad half-crowns and four bad shillings in the till—I am quite positive that I had received no half crowns or shillings, except from the prisoners—I laid them on the shelf in the parlour till daylight next morning, then examined them again and found they were bad—I knew the prisoners; they lived one on each side of me, which probably caused me to pay less attention to the money—I gave them in custody—I examined a bag of silver which I had taken in my shop the day before, on 1st December, and found in it a bad half-crown and three bad shillings—Fitzgerald had been in the shop that night—I had cleared the till myself, and I put a half-crown, for which I had given change, into the bag—I marked all the bad money, and put a different mark on that found in the bag.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband keeps the Redan beer-shop, Fulham road. On 2d December, between 5 and 6 in the evening, the prisoners came there together—Fitzgerald called for a pint of beer and gave me a shilling—I tried it with my teeth, and said, "It is not good"—he said, "Give it to me back"—I threw it on the counter, and he said to Welch, "Have you got any halfpence?"—Welch pulled out some halfpence and paid me—they both drank of the beer, and both left the house together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living in Union-street, Stratford—about five minutes to 6, on the morning of 20th August, I went to work at Mr. Cook's stables at Stratford—the prisoner was there—I unlocked the stable and fed the horses—he came with me—I took off my jacket, and laid it on the corner, and went to clean one of the horses—I left the prisoner there, and afterwards went to put my jacket on and found the pocket-book gone—it contained a half-sovereign, half-a-crown, four shillings, and sixpence—I gave information to the police—the sergeant afterwards showed me my book—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

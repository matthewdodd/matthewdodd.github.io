            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the 2nd of November he employed me to look after his potatoes; they were harrowed up, and were to be picked up by the women the next morning - I saw the prisoner in the field; he came out about half-past ten o'clock; a person named Walden was with him - the prisoner had a bag on his shoulder; I took Walden at the time, but the prisoner got away - there appeared to be as much in the prisoner's bag as there was in Walden's, and that had a bushel of potatoes in it; the prisoner's bag seemed to have potatoes in it - he went off as soon as he saw me run.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I did not run. Witness. Yes, he did, directly he saw me.</p>

            , I was in the field to keep the birds off. I saw the prisoner and Walden; the prisoner picked up potatoes, put them into a bag, and put it on his shoulder - he jumped over the hedge when he saw me coming; I told Edwards - he went after him, and the prisoner ran away.</p>

               <p>MR. WALPOLE. We had harrowed the field up over night, and the potatoes were left to be cleared - there were above a ton to an acre left in the field.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EDWARDS. There were a great many potatoes left to be picked up the next morning.</p>

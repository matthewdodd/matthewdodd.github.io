On Sunday night, the 29th of April, a little before twelve o'clock, I and my family went to bed; I had been into the cellar about twenty minutes past eleven, and tapped a barrel of ale - the cellar flap was all fast then - it was fastened with a padlock, which was safe. I was alarmed by the watchman about twenty minutes after two o'clock; he knocked at the door, and said there were thieves in the house; I came down, and got a light from the watchman - we both went into the cellar, which is part of the dwelling-house; I found the prisoner concealed behind two hogsheads of ale; I asked how he came there - he made no reply; I brought him out, and gave him in charge; he was taken into custody. I had locked the cellar door before I went to bed; when that door is open there is a communication from the cellar to the rest of the house - the flap between the cellar and the street was locked outside with a padlock, which fastened the bar of the flap - I found it broken open, and the padlock thrown away; the small flap was open - he must have got in that way.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Must you get into your house to get at the cellar? A. Opening the flap would admit him without going through the house; the flap was broken open. I was the last person up, and took the key of the cellar-door with me.</p>

I was going my rounds about two o'clock on the morning in question - I observed nothing particular at the prosecutor's cellar then, but at half-past two, when I came round again, I missed the padlock off the flap; I called to Stewart, and desired him to remain at the flap while I went round the corner, and called the landlord; the flap was put to, but not the bar; I went with the landlord into the cellar, and found the prisoner concealed between two butts - I took him to the watch-house; he made no resistance. I found nothing on him but two small latch-keys. The padlock was broken off; another watchman afterwards found it. The flap was put to, and the bar was down, not on the hasp.</p>

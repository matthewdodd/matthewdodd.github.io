            . I was on duty, and seeing the people round the bottom of the court, I went and asked what was the matter - the prosecutor told me he had been robbed of his pocket-book and purse; I searched the prisoner, but found nothing on him - the prosecutor had the book then, and I saw it at the station-house.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

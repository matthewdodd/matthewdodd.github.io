                  </hi>. I keep the White Hart, Windmill Street, Tottenham Court Road—on 13th October I served the prisoner with a half-quartern of gin—he gave me a florin—I put it between my teeth, and found it was not good—I gave him a good shilling, and directly he left I followed him to Hinway Street—he went into the Blue Posts, and I spoke to Reilley, who was in plain clothes, and went into the centre bar, and told the people there to see what he gave—he changed 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of coppers, and came out; I followed him, with Reilley, to where he lived—Fisher then came up.</p>

On the afternoon of 13th October, Slingsbury told me something, and I went to 33, Dudley Street, to the top room back—there are thirteen rooms in the house—I tried the door, it was shut; we forced it open, and the prisoner was sitting on the ground, with his back against the door—I asked him where the florin was, which he attempted to pan about 2 o'clock—he made no answer—I asked him if he had any more about him—he said "No"—I removed his hand from a box, which I opened with a key of my own, and found fifty-five florins, 153 sixpences, and one shilling, all counterfeit—I found a bad shilling and sixpence on the floor, where he had been sitting—I took him to the station, and then returned, and found a galvanic battery, a crucible, a packet of Plaster of Paris, two bottles of acid, two files, three copper wires, which appeared to have been recently used, a ladle, with fused metal in it, and other things in this box—the prisoner had been drinking, but knew perfectly well what he was about—I tried the padlock with a key Reilly gave me, and it fitted.</p>

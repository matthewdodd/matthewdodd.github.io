                  <hi rend="largeCaps">ROBERT HAMMOND</hi>, I am a harness-maker, at Waltham-cross—I rent a field by the high-road to Cheshunt, about 200 yards from my house. In July I was about to make a division in that field; I drove some stakes in, and fastened some rope to them—about the middle of Oct. I went to that field, about nine o'clock at night, and saw the rope as I had put it, quite safe—I went the next morning, at six o'clock, and it was gone—it had been cat from each end—I found the ends of it round the two end-posts, and gave them to the policeman—this is the rope—I know it by the nails that I put in it, to nail it to each stake, which were seven or eight yards apart—I nailed it myself with sixpenny clasp-nails.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 136.) On the morning of 12th Dec., between twelve and one o'clock, I went with the prisoner and his horse and cart, to his yard—I took him on another charge—I then went with Bridge, and found this rope in a tub, just inside the stable; it corresponded with the rope that was lost—I took it to Mr. Hammond, and to the field, measured it with the posts, and with the nail-holes in the posts—I drew some of the nails out of the posts, and they corresponded with the nails in the rope.</p>

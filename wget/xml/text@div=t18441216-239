                  </hi>. I live in Lower Berners-street, Commercial-road. I was in Leadenhall-market last Saturday, and saw the prisoners before Mr. Howard's stall—I saw Smith take two turkeys off Mr. Howard's board, and lay them on a poultry-case in which some turkeys were—Ferrey then took the turkeys off the case, and laid them in a basket, which I had seen Ferrey have as he was coming through the market—he was in the act of taking it up, and going off with it—he had not got above two feet from the place—Smith was about two yards away from him—I stopped them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Smith.</hi> I never had them in my hand; I was right oppsite the shop, and you called out and I stopped; Ferrey basket, but what was in it I do not know. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I saw you distinctly take them from the board, and put them on a case which stood about three feet under the</p>

               <p>board, which put them out of the view of the man to whom they belonged—the man had just turned his back when the two prisoners went up to the stall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ferrey.</hi> Before you offered to say a word to me, you ran up to Smith, and said, "I want you," and then you turned back to me, and said, "There is another one;" and I said, "Are you making your remarks on me?" <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I said so after I stopped you—I had seen you put the two tur<lb></lb>keys into the basket, intending to take them away—I had seen the pri<lb></lb>soners before in the market.</p>

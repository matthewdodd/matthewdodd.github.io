               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. I know the prisoner; he was tried here for stealing a bag with a 5l. bank note, and a banker's check; it was at the September adjourned Session, held on the 8th of December; he was tried on the 13th; he was found guilty, and received sentence to be transported; he was afterwards pardoned, upon condition of serving his Majesty in the sea service.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you that pardon? - A. I have, (produces it, it is read.)</p>
               <p>Q. After that pardon came down, what became of the prisoner? - A. I went with him to the regulating captain, on board the Enterprize off the Tower.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he acquainted with the condition of that pardon? - A. I went with him, and told him and every man of the contents of the conditional pardon; he did not go down with the whole of the prisoners, for he was not well at the time, and therefore I told him particularly that he was pardoned, on condition of serving the King; I have my receipt for delivering him up.

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I was apprehended in December, 1794, and tried and convicted for seven years transportation; after being in prison about six or seven months, I received a pardon, to go to sea, as a sailor; upon what condition I was never told; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130108"></xptr>was put back because I was not sit to go; and they took the rest of the men away, and left me three weeks after the rest; I was put on board the tender, from thence on board a guard ship; when our ship went to sea, and in six weeks it was wrecked; we made for a harbour as quick as possible; when we came into harbour they drasted the best men on board another ship; when it came to my turn, I asked liberty to go on shore; my sister, at that time, I was informed, was in London, had got a sum of money in her hands; I knowing the ship could not be ready to sail for less than eight weeks, I took too much liberty in coming to London; but the conditions of my pardon I never was told; and, like many other-foolish men, I stopped longer than I should have done.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Lloyd.) Is what the prisoner has said, true? - A. It is; the ship lost her masts, but was not wrecked.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the usual time of leave of absence? - A. Twelve hours only.</p>

On the 12th of July I did not give him authority to take a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140131"></xptr>a pair of shoes, or to pawn them; these shoes are mine, they were kept in the shop where he worked; I had seen them the day before, and missed them when I came home, about six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe he had a shop of his own once? A. I believe he had; he was not in any kind of partnership with me; I never had any cards with his name on the back of them; he came with a condition that he should recommend his former customers, and I allowed him 15 percent.; I did so with all my shopmen - he was allowed to take shoes out and sell them to his own customers with my leave, or with the shopman's permission in my absence, and to book them afterwards - I should have no objection to take him again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was it you permitted him to do on speaking to you, or to any body in your shop? A. If any of his friends had a pair of shoes, I allowed him the profit of them, but I never allowed him to take any, except for sale.</p>
               <p>HANNAH ANDREWS. I was in the service of Mr. Bonham. On the 12th of July, I observed a pair of shoes in the prisoner's coat pocket, which hung in the cupboard - he took them out with him; I sent the apprentice to see where he went to - he gave me information, and I found them at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were in the shop when he went out? A. Yes; the cupboard was not locked - any one might have gone there - he put the coat on openly before me - he has borne a good character.</p>

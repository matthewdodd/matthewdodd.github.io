I am courier to a Russian general, who is now in Paris—I live at 31, Golden-square—on 30th May I called at No. 6, West-street, Golden-square—the prisoner's wife lives there—I knocked at the door—a little girl opened it; then the prisoner struck me with a knife—he tried to strike me in the breast, and I caught his hand and dashed it down, and he struck me on the forehead—he was inside, behind his daughter—I saw some<lb></lb>thing in his hand, shining like a looking-glass; it was a knife nearly a foot long with a white handle—he did not say anything to me before he struck me, nor I to him—I was sober—I had no time to make any inquiry of the little girl before he struck me—I ran into a little court after I was struck, and I received a blow on the head and I fell to the ground—the blow was from a man, I do not know who, or whether he was an acquaintance of the prisoner's—there were five or six of them kicking me—I had never seen the prisoner before in my life—I lost a great deal of blood—I went to a surgeon—when I took the plaster off next day the point of a knife came out, which I gave to Mr. Guy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and carry on my profession in Golden-square—the prosecutor called on me on 31st May—he was suffering from a wound in the cheek—I examined it—it went from the front part towards the interior; towards the back—I should describe it as an incised vertical wound, likely to have been caused by a knife—it was very deep but not very long—it could scarcely have been pro<lb></lb>duced by a fall on the kerb, because the part that was injured was in the gums, towards the molar teeth; if it had been a fall it must have struck directly on the part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it a sort of wound that could have been produced by a stone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did not appear to me that it was a bruise.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>C. Alexander. I had gotten Oarders to gang wi' my Colonel tull Bristo', Sir, and so, Sir, I tuck my Things, and went tull his House at Hammersmith; but his Moather was seek, and he wanno' gang then, and so I came back to Toon again, and was to find my sell a Loading, for I had discharged my aul Landlady. And so I mat the Preesoner in King-street, Wastminster, and she seeing me Stranger-like in Boots and Spurs, and a leetle in Leequor, she and me to make her drink. I taud her I danno' want Drink, but I wanted a Loadging. Well, Sir, quo' she, gin ye wull gang wi' me tull Mrs. Humphries in <placeName id="t17330628-7-crimeloc26">Bell-Alley</placeName>

So she tuck haud o' my Arm, and lad me awa' to Moather Humphries. We staid a Quarter of an Hoor below Stairs, and then I paid for the Leequor and my Loadging, and I and the Preesoner went up tull Beed, and Mrs. Humphries lighted us. I undrest me and got intull the Beed, but I tuck oot my Watch to see what a Cloak it was, and it was part II. Then I put it intull my Fobe and laid my Breeks under my Heed. But the Preesoner wonno' strip, but laid her sell doon by me wi' her Clothes on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Well, and what then?</p>
               <p>C.A. Why, Mrs. Buruess, because you beat me before the Justice, you thenk tull frighten me now, but it wonno' do, troath wull it not. - And so, my Lord, I desir'd Mrs. Humphries to caw me up by sax a Cloak in the Moarning; and than, being pretty weel in for't, I sell faist asleep. Accordingly next Moarning Mrs. Humphries came tull, my Beed-side and wak'd me. Loard, Sir, quo' she, I am afraid this Betch has roab'd ye, for she has brock open my Door and run awa'.</p>
               <p>Court. And had you lost any Thing?</p>
               <p>C. A. Troath had I, Sir. I laost my Siller Watch with 2 Seals, a Gowd Ring, and a Brace Mourning Ring, and a Guinea and a hauf. They were aw' tacket oot o' my Breeks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. And what of all that? What have you to say to me?</p>
               <p>- Humphries. I keep a House of Lodgers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Of Whores you mean. She keeps a Bawdy-House, my Lord, that's the Truth on't.</p>
               <p>Humph. You have reason to say so, indeed. This Man came in with the Prisoner. I lighted them up to Bed. I saw him pull out his Watch, and put it into his Fob again. Then he bid me call him up at 6 in the Morning, and so I left them together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Hark you, Landlady, don't you remember that you and your Husband were whipt for keeping a Bawdy-House?</p>
               <p>Humph. What's that to you? - Next Morning I found my Door broke open I ran up in a Fright, and waked the Prosecutor. He said he had lost his Watch and 2 Rings, and a Guinea and half. I told him she had a Loadging in the Neighbourhood, and I'd find her if possible, but when I went thither she was gone from thence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Hussy, you lie; you are a vile Toad, a vile old Baud; you lie, you lie, you lie.</p>
               <p>Humph. Then the Prosecutor took me up the same Morning ( it was Wednesday ) and the Prisoner was taken at Night. I bid her help the Man to his Watch again, but she said it was too far gone; but if I would say that I had never seen the Watch, we should both be discharged.</p>

            , Constable. The Prisoner was brought to the Watch House between 10 and 11 on Wednesday Night. I searched her, and found this Brass Mourning Ring clenched in her Hand. I have lately had her 4 or 5 times in my Custody for the like Facts.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Well, if you have, that's no reason I must be guilty of this too. So many against one is a little hard. It's well known I am no bold Woman. He pick'd me up, and said he would lye with me, if I could carry him to an honest House, and I went with him to Mother Humphries's, tho' much against my Will, but he would take no Denial. He gave her a Shilling for a Loadging. She sent for a Pint of Anniseed, and the reckoning came to a Crown, which be paid, and then we went up to Bed. He gave me 3s. 6d. but I insisted upon more, and then he put the Ring upon my Finger. As for the Watch, he gave it me to look upon, and I might forget to give it him again.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any Witnesses?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Witnesses? no. What's the matter I may not speak for myself. Here's a Parcel of Whores and Bands that will swear any thing against me.</p>
               <p>Court. If you have any thing to say in your Defence the Court will hear you, but you must not be suffer'd to give such abusive Language.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. But I won't stir till I have told the whole Story of these Bands.</p>
               <p>Court. Take her away.</p>
               <p>Execustioner. Do you hear, Child? Come along with me. You must beat your March. The Jury <rs id="t17330628-7-verdict27" type="verdictDescription">

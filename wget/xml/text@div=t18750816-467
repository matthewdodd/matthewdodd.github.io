I am the son of the last witness—about three or four months ago the prisoner came and complained of some one going to the yard to ask for the money before his mates—he said "I know I owe you the money, and if you summon me I can only pay you so much a week"—I saw him again about a fortnight afterwards, when he produced a receipt for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said that his wife and he had talked about it and they did not think they owed so much, and had looked over their receipts and found one for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that I did not know anything about it, and asked him to call again when my father was in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Owen, solicitor of 1, Castle Terrace, Richmond—I received instructions to recover 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is. from the prisoner—I sent him the usual official letter for payment, and I gave him notice on Monday last to produce it in Court—I afterwards saw him stand<lb></lb>ing outside the Talbot Yard—I said "What are you going to do about that account of Gaydon's?"—he said "I can't pay it now, my wages are only 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week"—he did not repudiate the debt in any way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner produced a written defence, stating that the prosecutor had brought the jewellery to him, laid it out on the kitchen table, and persuaded him to buy it; that he had paid 51. on account, and afterwards paid the balance as he believed, and thought no more about it till he was summonsed, when Mrs. Lonsdale seeing his wife in trouble, searched for the receipt and found it; that he had been constantly in Richmond meeting the prosecutor two or three times a week, who therefore knew perfectly well where to find him.</hi>

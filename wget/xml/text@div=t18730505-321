I carry on business with my father and brothers as diamond merchants and manufacturing jewellers, at 15 and 16, Brewer Street, Golden Square, under the style of Drayson &amp; Son—I have known Montague Goldsmith for some considerable time; prior to certain trans<lb></lb>actions with me I had known him as being in the employ of Mr. Harry Emanuel, and other large jewellers—I first became acquainted with Michael Goldsmith about two years ago—I know nothing of Lewis—I have seen Rebecca twice at 66, Conduit Street-Montague Goldsmith carried on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187305050004"></xptr>
               <p>business there, and Michael assisted him—the first transaction I had with Montague was about two and a half years ago, in October, 1870—down to April, 1872, the transactions between us had not been of a very extensive character—I let him have goods on approbation to show to customers—I would let him have sundry articles to show to customers, and if he sold one or more of them they were charged to him—sometimes they were sold to a specific customer, and sometimes merely on a statement that he wanted goods to show to a, customer—I fixed the price—they were all marked—when a sale was effected I was to be informed of it, and we invoiced it to him; if not sold it was returned—there was no limit within which goods given to him on approbation were to be returned—no limit was absolutely fixed—it was not to pass into his stock except in particular cases—he had no authority from me to sell at a lower price than that which I fixed—in April last year the transactions between us began to increase—up to that time he had paid me by bills and cash—in April, 1872, Montague Gold<lb></lb>smith gave me a reason for increasing the transactions between us—he told me that he was related to Sir Benjamin Phillips, who had promised to give him some introductions to rich people—I have my books here—during the year 1872 I continued letting him have goods on approbation—some portion of those goods were charged to him, as I have described, and other portions were left in his hands—about the 18th or 19th of December last year I received some communication from Messrs. Charman—in consequence of that information I instituted certain inquiries in reference to the property I had handed to Montague—at that time I had let him have articles of jewellery on approbation to the amount of 6, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those were goods that had been invoiced—he had also a number of goods, still in the appro<lb></lb>bation book, to the amount of about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the ledger (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there is an approbation book as well—when goods were first handed to him they were entered in the approbation book—the approbation book will show when the goods went out of our premises to him—if a sale was effected, and he informed me of it, it would go into the journal first, and then to the ledger—I have the journal here—Montague Goldsmith had already started in business when we first supplied him—the first transaction with him was on the 12th April, when he had eight scarf pins on approbation—I did not make the entry, my clerk did, my cousin, Alfred Drayson—I have no recollection of the transaction—the first transaction that I recollect was on 15th October, 1872; that was a butterfly brooch in brilliants, that he had for 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the entry is not my writing, my cousin made that, and nearly all the entries in this book; it was his duty to make entries both in the approbation book and the ledger, under my instructions—I find in the ledger that that butter<lb></lb>fly brooch is charged to Montague on 23rd of that month—at the time he got that he said that he hoped to sell it to Sir Walter Riddell—he made a statement to me, upon which I debited him with the amount—I have not been paid for it—the diamonds of which it was composed have been returned to me by Mr. Whitfield—the next item charged to him is a pearl necklace, worth 3, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 31st October—he said he thought it would suit a cus<lb></lb>tomer he had—he brought it back to me two or three times, and eventually he told me he had sold it to Alderman Truscott—he made a statement which induced me to debit him with it—at first it was brought back to me every evening—I said it was such a valuable article, and it was safer in our house, as we had persons always on the premises—before it was represented to me as being sold, he kept it for three or four days, telling me that he could</p>

Douglas Pakenham—bride, Mary Helen Scott—bridesmaids' lockets, Henrietta Fitzclarence, Julia Emma and Annie Fitzclarence, Louisa Scott, Elizabeth Scott, Jane Julia and Maria Scott"—that is the paper that relates to the lockets, this other paper he brought with him—I should say it was in the same writing—he said he thought what he had written on this paper was what would be given as presents to each bride—he asked me if I had such</p>

These things, to whoever they are entered, are all entered in the same way—the terms upon which they are entered are the same to everybody—they are all on the tame system—if Emanuel's, or any one of those gentlemen had 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of jewellery on approbation, and called and said, "Invoice that brooch to me," I should do it as a matter of course—the transactions were opened with Montague Goldsmith on the same system—he was shopman at Emanuel's—he began dealing with me about October, 1870—he was then living at 15, Colville Terrace, and getting a place ready for business in Conduit Street—I did one or two very trifling matters of business with him then—he came and had a few things to show:—if he sold them, well; if not, he returned them—I could not say how long that continued—I think it was in January, 1871, that he first had a place of business of his own—I have only known him in one place of business—no show was made in the window—there was a case in the shop containing jewellery, not in the window—there was simply a wire-blind to the window with his name on it, "Montague Goldsmith, jeweller and diamond merchant, "I think, but I am not quite sure—I knew that he had no stock of his own—he had no authority to sell below my price; if he put them above he would have the profit—when I have used the words price and value, I mean my price for the goods—I have received altogether from Montague about 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—besides that I have received bills accepted by himself, some of which have been met and some not—I have received back a pearl necklace from Mr. Hennell—I had received 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in part payment of that from Montague—the first entry of the butterfly brooch would be in the approba<lb></lb>tion book—the journal and ledger show the same thing entered in the same way—on one or two occasions he has had a thing in a great hurry, and a memorandum has simply been made upon a slate that we keep<lb></lb>perhaps he has taken it, and said "I will bring it back in an hour, if it is not sold"—with that exception, the others are all like the entries I am going to show you—the first is on 15th October, at page 283, in the approbation book, a butterfly brooch, that is entered in the journal on 23rd October, at page 391, and on the same day in the ledger, folio 499; you will only be able to find it by a number; it has the folio of the journal in red ink written across it, 391—it is not entered in the name of Goldsmith—the things struck out were returned—there are thirty-one articles—I can tell you by referring to the stock-book what they are—the aggregate value of the whole entry would be about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and of the articles returned about 1, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they are struck out when they are returned—we could not tell on what day they are returned—I don't know <hi rend="italic">over</hi> what period the returns of those articles extended, there is nothing by which I could tell you—he had them in his possession from 15th October until the 23rd—the two columns in the journal are in case of there being several articles in one invoice—they are in separate items in the first column, and in one item in the second column; wherever it consisted of one article it would be duplicated, and where it consisted of several articles it would be in one; the second column is the aggregate of the whole order—this is the ledger account—all the transactions were upon the same system, goods-supplied on approbation, returned, and struck out by the red mark—I will put pieces of paper in the different places where the supplies on approbation are marked.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>, I should not accept a sale from him below my own price—there is only one instance in which I made a slight reduction of price, and that was by special arrangement—if a gentleman of position like Mr. Emanuel sent to me to charge him with goods sent on approbation, I should do it at once, I should do it with anybody if I believed they had sold them, I should not charge them to a person like Goldsmith unless I believed he had actually sold them to a customer—the cash was not paid at the time of charging, it was always a quarterly account; there would be no bills or cash paid while the goods were on approbation only—the goods on approbation would not be included in the quarterly account—the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I received from Goldsmith includes all, from the commencement of my dealings with him from October, 1870—the greater part of that 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. consisted of bills which were met—the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. includes everything that was paid; it does not include the bills that were dishonoured—I received back the necklace from Mr. Hennell some time in January—during this inquiry we threatened him with an action to recover it, and he was also summoned as a witness to the Police Court—he then brought it to us, and gave it up, and said he would not have any more trouble about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cousin of the last witness, and assist him in carry<lb></lb>ing on the business in Brewer Street—I know Montague, Michael, and Re<lb></lb>becca Goldsmith—there were transactions between the firm in Conduit Street and our firm—sometimes Montague gave us orders and sometimes Michael; it was about equal—when I went to their place I more generally saw Michael—they used to enquire for some specific article on approbation—when I have gone to Conduit Street and seen Michael, I have had conversations with him about the things; I used to ask 'about different articles had from us on approbation, and if they were out at a customer's he would say so—I used to call there two or three times a week—Michael was more generally there—I have seen Rebecca there four or five times, perhaps six—when goods were obtained, I frequently took them myself from Brewer Street to Conduit Street, and delivered them either to Michael or Montague, whichever was at home—there was no clerk—in October, by the last witness's direction, I took the 3, 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. pearl necklace which has been spoken of and three lockets, value 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and some other articles to Conduit Street, and saw either Montague or Michael—I went for the pearl necklace again in the evening—sometimes he used to bring it, and sometimes I fetched it; it was taken back and brought again in the morning for about a week—I remember Montague coming and seeing my cousin, but I was not with him—I took it again one morning after that and saw Montague, I believe, but I do not remember sufficiently—the same arrangement was made that he was to return it in the evening, and I left it, as explained by my cousin—I do not think I saw it after that—it was first left on 22nd October, and finally left about October 28th or 29th—I had no conversation with Michael as to whether it was sold or not; it was all with Montague—on 4th November I took the 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods selected for the wedding to Conduit Street, and saw Rebecca and her sister; I said that I had brought her brother some things to show, she said that he was out—I said that I would wait, and I would enter them to save time—while I was opening the cases they looked at the different things and admired them; they said that it was a treat to see the ornaments, as their brother never allowed them to look at anything—the conversation was general—I do not know which said that, they both took part in it—the brothers both came in at that time, while I</p>

               <p>was entering the goods on a piece of paper which I had brought—they had not to sign that paper—nothing was said to Rebecca, or in her presence, as to what they were brought for—I believe they asked about the price of one of the articles, casually, in the course of conversation—I left the goods when Montague and Michael came in, and among them were the articles stolen—they were left on 4th November, and about two or three days afterwards I went there for two or three articles which I wanted, and I asked him to make a return of the things he had, the brilliant head ornament and the bracelet specifically—he said that they were out at a customer's—I frequently spoke to Michael about them—I enquired for them four or five times, and he always told me that they were out at a customer's—the last enquiry I made was within a day or two of the explosion of the affair, about the middle of December—I also enquired of Michael about other goods which had been left, and he used always to say if he could not give them to me that they were out at some customer's—on 14th November a diamond cross was charged, I believe it was on Michael's statement, but I cannot remember sufficiently; my cousin has that diamond cross in Court—it was sent on 22nd October, and charged on 14th November—either I or my cousin have seen all these other articles—on 7th November a bracelet, value 420<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was had on approbation, and it is charged on the 16th on Montague's statement—I have since seen it in the hands of Richardson, in pawn—I called many times to make enquiries about it, and generally saw Montague; I don't think I saw Michael about that—on 7th December, Montague came to Brewer Street about a diamond star and some earrings—I told him that they had been standing some time, and I desired to clear them—he said "Those two are sold"—I wrote a memorandum at that time in consequence of what he said, namely, that Michael knew to whom they were sold—I addressed the memorandum to the firm, it is, "Dear Sirs; Please give bearer the diamond earrings, "giving the numbers, "as we have a good chance. Alfred Drayson and Sons, "on the back of which Montague wrote, "Dear Mike: I think you will find the earrings are sold to Lady Truscott or somebody else, if so, please say. "That was sent by a messenger, and this answer was returned, which is I believe in Michael's writing, but they write so much alike I cannot say—it says, "Dear Sir: The earrings (giving the numbers) sold, yours truly, Montague Goldsmith"—Montague was not at my place when I went back—I frequently received letters from them both, which, whether they came from one or the other, were signed "Mon<lb></lb>tague Goldsmith"—In consequence of that statement, I charged those ear<lb></lb>rings—I have since seen them produced by a pawnbroker during this enquiry—on 7th November a pair of brilliant three-drop earrings were had on approbation—I don't remember taking them; I went to enquire after them, and I believe I saw Montague—after the goods had been sent for the wedding, Montague called in Brewer Street—I did not deliver them, I sent them by a porter to Conduit Street—I saw the black pearls when they were brought back again to have a head ornament made to match—Michael came down about them one morning about 9th December, and said that the customer was coming to his place to see them with the lady to whom they were to be given, and he wanted them to show them—I said "We cannot very well spare them, the case is going to be re-lined, "but I let him have them, and never saw them again; that was about a week before the catastrophe—I have since seen those black pearls in pawn—about 27th November, Michael came and I let him have about a dozen rings, which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187305050010"></xptr>
               <p>were all returned but one, which stood open on approbation till the affair exploded, and I hare since seen it in the hands of a pawnbroker—Montague also asked me for a collet necklace, value 680<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and told me he wanted it for a customer in the country—when I gave it to him, he said that that was about the thing, and it was sent in a parcel to Conduit Street—I have since seen it in the hands of the pawnbroker—that is not charged, it is still on approbation—when this affair became known I went and received about 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Worth of property from Conduit Street—I saw Michael, and said that we were going to take stock, and I should like him to clear up as near as he could all the goods he had had on approbation—I saw one book at that time, but did not see the inside of it to see whether it was a ledger—on 9th October, 1871, a ruby, emerald, and brilliant ring, No.155, was had on approbation; it has never been charged—I conversed with Michael about it about July, 1872, who told me it was with a customer in the City—I have since seen it in the pawnbroker's possession—I did not knew that any of these things were sent to the pawnbroker's, but afterwards I went to Liverpool, and saw Mr. Whitfield, who handed me two duplicates and some diamonds, some of which formed part of the butterfly brooch—he also gave me the centre stone of the diamond, ruby, and emerald ring, which has been spoken of—I can say that this stone formed part of that ring—I have seen the other two stones elsewhere—they constituted the ring—I took the tickets that were handed to me by Whitfield, and have been to the pawn<lb></lb>broker's and seen our goods—one ticket relates to a brilliant French brace<lb></lb>let, value 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was sent on approbation about May, 1872—a brilliant half-hoop ring, sent on approbation on 14th September, 1872, value 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is a mistake, it should be a ring of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is not the one re<lb></lb>turned by Whitfield—the ring pawned at Rowley's, in Ledbury Road, was a brilliant half-hoop ring, value 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was sent on April 20th, 1871, and was charged later on the same day, on the representation that it was sold.</p>

               <p>Street, with either Montague or Michael, I could not say which—I have seen Michael on the occasions when I went to Conduit Street more frequently than Montague—the bracelet which was altered was charged to Montague on or about the 13th—the head ornament, which had been sent with the bracelet, was charged to Montague on 27th July, one of the lot which had been sent on the 8th—that was worth 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 27th Montague required some drawings for earrings, and I had an interview with him at his own premises—I could not say for certain whether Michael was present—Montague said he wanted the drawing of the earrings to show a customer—some drawings were made—at that time he said he wanted a brilliant necklace to show a customer, and that necklace, worth 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was taken by me to Conduit Street—that necklace was afterwards charged to him on the 7th August—on the same day that it was charged he had some earrings, some brooches, and some bracelets—he said he wanted them to show a customer—all those articles were returned, except a bracelet, a pair of ear<lb></lb>rings, and a brooch—the earrings were charged to him on 15th August, at 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the bracelet on the 23rd, at 525<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and the brooch remained on approbation until the 13th November, when it was charged to him at 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 3rd August I delivered a large quantity of jewellery at Conduit Street, at the request of Montague; amongst those articles was a pair of earrings worth 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were charged to Montague on 5th October—on 14th October I delivered to him a necklace worth 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was charged to him on the 17th—I remember a transaction on the 21st October—I went to Conduit Street, and saw Montague—he mentioned certain things he wanted—they were articles of considerable value, and I told him they were rather more than I could let him have, he had better call and see Mr. Charman—he came round and saw Mr. Charman—he made a selection of a large quan<lb></lb>tity of valuable things, amongst them was a bracelet worth 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he was charged with that on 25th October—there was also a pair of earrings in the shape of bees, worth 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a bracelet worth 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they were also charged to him on the 25th October, and at that time he had some further articles, amongst them was a bracelet worth 525<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was charged with that on the 13th November—there was another bracelet worth 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a pair of earrings worth 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was also charged with those on 13th November—on 26th November he had a bracelet worth 510<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a head ornament worth 465<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was charged with the bracelet on 28th Novem<lb></lb>ber, and with the head ornament on 2nd December—on 30th November he had a necklace of the value of 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was charged to him three or four days afterwards—on 11th December he was charged with a bracelet worth 375<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he had on 23rd October; and on 16th December he was charged with a brooch worth 735<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., had on 21st October—on 5th December I went to Conduit Street—I saw both Montague and Michael there—Montague asked me in Michael's presence for some diamond orna<lb></lb>ments for a double wedding, some pearls, and some diamonds—I told him I could not let him have them, he must come round and see Mr. Charman—I said the amount was too large—he said he would come round, and he told me not to take notice to anyone else in the trade, lest they should find out his customer—later in the day he came round to Mr. Charman's—I was present at the interview which took place—he told Mr. Charman the same that he told me, that he wanted the goods for a double wedding—that is all I recollect—he was allowed to select certain goods, and he took away with him a pearl bracelet worth 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a diamond bracelet worth 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a</p>

Charman do a very large business with the chief west-end jewellers—it is all approbation business—I can't tell how much they have out at the present time, at times to a very large amount—when an article was kept Montague said, "Charge it, and send an invoice"—I never enquired who his customers were—it was not my business to do so—we received cash 1, 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one was on a bill for 460<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—for the balance, 6, 950<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., we only hold Montague Goldsmith's acceptances—on the occasion that I saw Michael, he said the goods were at a customer's, and he could not disturb them, he said his brother Montague was out—he has also told me that on other occasions, and it was in consequence of that that I called again and saw Montague, when he was at home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a diamond merchant and jeweller, of 4, Beak Street—I have known Montague Goldsmith for some time as assistant in various jewellers' shops at the West-end, Emanuel's, and one or two others; they were customers of mine, and I knew him in that way—about April, 1872, my son met Michael Goldsmith, and about that time we commenced business with them—the first transaction was through my son; it was a diamond bracelet, 460<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—an acceptance was given for that, which was paid—from that time until 17th December I continually sent them goods through the medium of Mr. Harris, and sometimes myself—I don't recollect the exact amount of goods sent on approbation, and afterwards charged for—it was quite 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and additional goods sent on approbation, making a total of 9, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—during that time I received cash to the amount of 1, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including the bill that was taken up—1,965<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, was the exact amount, or probably it may have been less 5 per cent—Mr. Harris, my assistant, supplied the goods—on 5th December Montague Gold<lb></lb>smith said that he wanted a diamond suite and a pearl suite, as there was a double wedding in a family that he was doing business with, and he wanted them to show—he selected the diamonds and pearls that Mr. Harris has mentioned and took them away, to the amount of 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—we afterwards got a portion back, the residue being 3, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 18th December I received a communication from Mr. Flower, the assistant to Messrs. Ortner &amp; Houle, jewellers, in St. James's Street—I think my jewellery is pretty well known in the trade, and it was in consequence of that that the communication was made to me—it was with respect to a pearl bracelet, which was one of the articles for the double wedding—in consequence of what Mr. Flower told me I went the following morning to Goldsmith's place, in Conduit Street, and there saw Montague, together with Michael—I said I wished to have some of the goods that he had or they bad on approbation—Montague said he was very sorry he could not let me have them, indeed, I think he commenced the conversation by saying he was sorry he could not let me have the goods that had been applied for, they were out on approbation with his lady customer</p>

               <p>—he said he had an appointment at 11.30 to sea the lady for her final decision—he said the appointment was in Portman Square; referring to the Directory, he said it was at 40, Portman Square, and the name was Lady Pakenham—he said she was the customer of whom he had spoken—I told him I should like to go with him to Lady Pakenham's to get the reply, and I did go—he did not seem to know anything about the place—the street was up, and he told the cabman to drive on the other side of the square to No.40—we drove all round the square; ultimately, on finding No.40, it was shut up, the steps were uncleaned, and the place looked entirely as if the family was out of town—he made inquiry for Lady Pakenham, for Colonel Pakenham, and Captain Pakenham, the secretary, and a great many more; but we could not find anybody—I then told him what I thought, that it was a gigantic swindle, and I pushed him into the cab—we went to my office and I sent for my solicitor, and subsequently we went to Conduit Street—I there saw Michael, and in his presence I desired to see the books, and they showed me these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); the smaller book is the ledger; it was not then in the state it is now—it called forth a remark from me that I did not think they had ever done a single shilling's worth of genuine business in their lives—and that was the then appearance of the books—this book has been un<lb></lb>doubtedly added to since—nothing has been scratched out or taken out that I can see, but it has been added to; something has been written in—at that time there was no appearance of business—I did not then remark any ledger account between me and them; I am not sure that I have seen one since, I think I have—there was an approbation book shown to me, a book with the items in it that were supposed to be with customers, and so on—I think this is it, I don't know—after the books were shown to me I said it was a very unsatisfactory matter as far as the books were concerned—he said he could give an explanation, but he failed to satisfy me, and I asked for security pending the explanation that was to be given—he said he had not anything except the bills he had received in payment for the goods he had sold—I desired to see them, and he then asked Michael to get them out of the safe, and he brought them out in an envelope, and gave me bills representing in amount 9, 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Michael gave them to Montague, and Montague gave them to me—they are the bills that have been pro<lb></lb>duced and pronounced to be forgeries; there was not a single genuine bill among them—there was a bill book, it is here—the bills were called out and checked by the bill book by Michael, here are the ticks; Montague then endorsed them and handed them to me—that was the last I saw of Montague; I have endeavoured to find him, and instructed the officers to do so; I took out a warrant against him directly I discovered that the bills were forgeries—that was on 19th December, I think, the day after I discovered the pearl bracelet—on the 23rd I saw Michael and his father, and Michael then handed me some duplicates and pawnbroker's contract notes affecting my jewellery; there were a good many, some applying to my goods, and some to Drayton's, and some to persons that I don't know—he said his sister had given them to him; he did not specify the sister; I gave the parcel to Drayson's, and they selected what they chose from it—the father said "If you will go to Colville Terrace and see my daughter, she is the only person who can give an explanation regarding this matter"—on the following morning I met the elder Goldsmith at the Great Western Terminus, and ultimately went to Colville Terrace—I there saw Rebecca—Michael was present, and her father and mother—the father introduced</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father—in April, 1872, I met Michael Goldsmith on the top of an omnibus—I had known him previously; I had been introduced to him by a mutual friend—I don't know what he was before that—at the time I did know him he was with his brother in Conduit Street—he opened the conversation concerning business; he asked me if I would let him show some diamond bracelets to a lady customer—I said I would—he said he wished to show them on the following day, and when I came to town on the following morning I sent our man with them—there were several—I was told when I returned to town, in the course of a fortnight, that he had kept one and paid for it—I remember the goods being sent on 5th December for the double wedding—about 17th December I went to get some of those goods back; it was the day before my father had a communication—I saw Michael—I asked him if he had done with that ornament, the aigrette, as we had a telegram from Manchester, and we wished to send it away—he said it was out at a customer's—I said it was very important that we should have it that evening to send away—he said his brother had been in the course of the day to see the customer, and he could not go again that evening, but he would on the following morning—I don't remember that he mentioned the place his brother had been to; he merely said "the customer, "to the best of my belief; my impression is that he did not name any place—when I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, of 189, Oxford Street—on 4th July last year I first became acquainted with Rebecca Goldsmith; she came in to my shop to sell a diamond bracelet—I questioned her as to who she was—she said she was a Miss Goldsmith—I asked her address—she said she was living at Ealing—I asked if she was connected with any of the Goldsmith family; she replied in the affirmative, but it was a poor branch of the family, or something tantamount to that, and her residence was at Highfield House, Ealing; she wished to sell the bracelet—I asked her the object of parting with it—she told me she was living with her mother, that they had some law expenses which were rather heavy—she left the bracelet, and I said I would see what offer I could make her—I then took the bracelet to a neighbouring jeweller's, Mr. Waylett, who was better versed in these things than myself, a better calculator, and he offered 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; it was then sealed up with his seal, that is an understanding in the trade, that if the seal is not broken the person who makes the offer will not revoke—I took the bracelet back sealed up, and I gave her a cheque for 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards delivered the parcel to Mr. Waylett, and he gave me a cheque for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have never seen the bracelet since—about the 9th or 10th she came again, and brought a pair of diamond earrings—I asked her the reason of parting with them—she said she was about to get married, and her mother wished to raise some money, or the earrings were to be parted with to purchase her trousseau—she mentioned the name of Lord something Osborne as the person to whom she was to be married—I asked her if it was one of the Leeds family, and she said "Yes"—knowing she was a Jewess, I said "But he is not of the same persuasion as you"—she said, as nearly as I can recollect, that her mother would waive that, as the opportunity was too good to be lost—I gave her a cheque for 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the earrings—when she brought them she asked 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—the market fluctuated a good deal in large stones at that time—and I took them to Messrs.

I have been in business 23 years—I am a judge of jewellery to a certain extent, but my business is not confined to jewellery alone, it is a portion of my business, but not heavy diamond goods; the centre-stones are the principal, and what the market price is at present you can hardly get at, for since the discovery of the Cape diamonds they fluctuate very much, particularly at that time; I was not able to give my own opinion, therefore I went to one of the largest houses in London, Messrs. Catchpool, Hill, and Williams, of Oxford Street-Mr. Hill valued the earrings at 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so perhaps you may place them down as worth 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if you had to replace them in the market—diamonds fluctuate some<lb></lb>times 10, 15, or 20 per cent.; about that—I cannot retain the value of the bracelet in my memory—Mr. Waylett, I think, gave a very fair price, and I got a very small profit, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with which I was satisfied; the earrings were decidedly not of the value of 575<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is undoubtedly an extravagant price—the value of these things depends a great deal on the fashion and the water; they fetch more in the height of the season than in the dull time of the year.</p>

The term "false pretences" was not a term of art; it was not like a charge of receiving stolen goods, the word "stealing" having a definite meaning attached to it.

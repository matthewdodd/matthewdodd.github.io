                  </hi>. I live at 20, Church-street, Old Kent-road, in the parish of St. Giles', Camber well—the prisoner was in my service for a little more than two weeks—I received her from her father and mother, but she had been in service before—we had a good character with her—on 27th Dec., about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was fetched by my daughter, Frances Sarah, from the parlour to the kitchen—it was scarcely light, but there were no candles lighted—when I got to the kitchen I went to the coal cellar, and found it in a blaze, the roof of the cellar is the floor of the pas<lb></lb>sage—coals and turf were kept there, and shavings, and wood in a box—the flames were proceeding from the box where the shavings and wood were; I got some water and extinguished it—I then returned to the parlour—my wife and daughter were in the parlour with me; and in about an hour after<lb></lb>wards, between five and six, a lady came to tea—we were sitting at tea, and I heard a noise like a candlestick fall—it seemed to be on the stairs, as if a person coming down-stairs had let something drop—my wife went up-stairs, and cried out that the top of the house was on fire—the lady who came to tea (who lived next door) went in for her brother—I went up-stairs and called for water—I cannot tell who brought it, I was in such confusion—when I got to the top floor I attempted to go in the front room, but I could not, the smoke was so dense—I went up twice—some dresses were hanging on a rail against the wall, and a curtain drawn before them—they were on fire, and that fire had communicated to the hand-rail, ballustrade, and landing—there are two rooms on the floor; one of them the prisoner occu<lb></lb>pied—some water was brought, and in about a quarter of an hour we extin<lb></lb>guished the fire—I had no idea that it had extended any further, but I went in the room and found the roof-curtain of a camp bed had been set on fire, and was burnt out—it was calico, and was burnt about four feet square—the foot curtain and the rail of the bed had been ignited—I examined the floor of the landing; it was burnt about a yard square, and some part of it was quite burnt through to the joists—we could not find the prisoner when we were extinguishing the fire—after we had extinguished it I went down in the kitchen and found her whining—I asked her how she could commit such a diabolical act—she said, "I did not do it; you did not see me do it"—I gave her in custody next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's daughter. On Thurs<lb></lb>day evening, 27th Dec., I was up-stain, about four o'clock—I smelt wood burning—in consequence of that I went down—there was no one in the kitchen—the back door was open—I opened the cellar door; I saw smoke, and went and told my father—my father and mother and myself were in the house, and the prisoner—about an hour afterwards I was at tea with my father and mother—I heard something like a candlestick fall on the stairs—my mother went up and gave an alarm—next day I found that nearly all my dresses had been burnt on the landing, and part of my sister's—I had had no quarrel with the prisoner nor had my sister—I went down to the kitchen after the fire was out, and saw the prisoner there—I do not know whether my father was in the kitchen then—the prisoner stood crying—I said, "Why did you set the house on fire?"—she said she did not do it; she had not been up-stairs—I went up with a pail of water—I had not been up before since three o'clock—my mother is not here—I do not think she had been up<lb></lb>stairs—she had had no light up-stairs—she seldom goes up—her room is on the first-floor—I know she had not been out of the parlour after five—she was sitting at tea.</p>

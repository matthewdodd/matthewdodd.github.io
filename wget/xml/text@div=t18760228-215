                  </hi>. I am a teacher of music, at 367, Cambridge Road—on the 17th February, about 6 p.m., I was in Old Ford Road—I had a watch attached to my button-hole, so that anyone could see it—I heard footsteps behind me, and turned round, but saw nothing of consequence, but I was suddenly pinioned behind—I turned round and saw the prisoner and another man on my right, and another on my left—one of them snatched my watch and chain, and the prisoner immediately dragged me down—as soon as I got up I cried out "Stop thief! I have lost my watch"—a detec tive followed the prisoner, and I never lost sight of him till he was captured in Sugarloaf Alley—I am positive he is the man—my watch and chain were worth five guineas.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was just about dusk—the prisoner was captured seven hundred or eight hundred yards from the spot; he had to turn two corners, and I lost sight of him while he was turning them, but when I turned I saw the detective with the prisoner in front of him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi>). On the 17th February I saw Thomp<lb></lb>son going along followed by two men, one of whom was the prisoner, who took hold of his arms, pinioned him, and knocked him down; they both ran away, and the prisoner ran towards me—I pursued him thirty or forty yards, and round the museum through Sugarloaf Court, where he was stopped at the end by a constable in uniform—I got up to him, took him in custody, and told him he would be charged with stealing a watch—he said "I haven't got the watch"—I searched him at the station, but only found this sack (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" about 6 p.m.—I ran into Sugarloaf Passage and met the prisoner running very fast, closely followed by Banks—I stopped him and told him that somebody wanted him—he said "Not me, I have not got the watch"—the prosecutor came up very much distressed and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper to Sir Charles Foster, of 38, Queen Ann's Gate, Westminster—on Sunday, July 16th, I went to bed at 11 o'clock, leaving the house securely fastened; the dining-room was the last place I looked at—I saw everything safe there, and the clock on the chimney-piece, the sugar-basin in the middle cover of the sideboard, the, liqueur stand was on the top of the sideboard—there was a barometer in the hall; some coats were hanging in the passage; the dining-room door was shut—before 3 a.m. we were awoke by a noise, which we thought was outside—shortly after I heard another noise, and immediately the front door bell rang—I looked through the window and spoke to a constable at the door—he said "Come down"—I went downstairs accompanied by others—I saw the front door window open—a police-sergeant and constable were with the prisoner Harvey standing at the front door—I saw the liqueur-stand by the front door, and also the clock, tied up in a green table cover; two pairs of boots were also in the hall and two coats, which had been removed from the passage—the other articles came from the dining—room—we went into the dining-room and found it all in confusion, the sideboard, cupboard, and drawers were broken open—the window had been opened, and the shutters forced open, and part of the bar forced off—the window looks into the garden—that window was closed before we went to bed, and the shutters barred—the white window blind had been cut'; the clock was tied up in a green table-cover, but the ornament on it had come off—it used to be kept on the chimney-piece—I identify this liqueur-stand and sugar basin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as the property of Sir Charles Foster.</p>

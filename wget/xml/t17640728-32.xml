            . My husband's name is Francis. I was out last Friday night; my daughter told me, she had lost a gown and coat; I went up stairs, and missed more things. I was told some of the lodgers had called up the prisoner: describing her, I went in search of her; and found her in Drury-lane, where she lodged: we charged her with taking the things; she went with us to the pawnbrokers; there we found one gown, I have it now on; at the next, we found a gown; she owned she pawned them there, and asked for them: then at another pawnbroker's we found my petticoat and daughter's stays. (Produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>A Pawnbroker. I took in the petticoat and stays of the prisoner at the bar, last Friday.</p>

            . Last Friday I saw the prisoner knocking at the prosecutor's chamber door; I asked her what she wanted; she said, a midwife; I said there was none lived there; if there was any in the house, it must be higher: she went up. but that woman was not a midwife: I did not see her go away: whether she took them before or after I saw her, I cannot tell.</p>

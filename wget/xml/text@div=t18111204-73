I sent the bricks to Drapers-place, Burton Crescent, they were for Mr. Hart, he was having some houses built there. On the 4th of May I sent ten thousand; I had five carts in my employ that day, which were to take a thousand in each cart in the morning, and the same quantity in the evening. The bricks were delivered to the carters. Hill, the man who was convicted in July sessions, was one of the five men.</p>

               <p>MR. RILEY. This is our carpet, and the same as fell from the prisoner's shoulder; I had shewn it at two o'clock, and only missed it at a quarter-past four, when I saw him go by the window; it was on the second shelf from the ground - it measures eighty-three yards and a half, and is worth 8l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing by the shop, and a respectable man asked me to carry the carpet to the bottom of Bond-street, and he would give me 1s. - I said I would; I got above two hundred yards, when Riley came and asked where I was going with it - I said I was going to carry it to the bottom of the street; I turned round to look for the person, and saw nobody but this young man, who came and took the carpet.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I wanted to convey a letter to Mr. Brathwaite, to return half a guinea that he sent me by my little girl, which, for particular reasons, I did not think proper to accept; I wrote it at a watchmaker's shop, in Holborn, one Mr. Pearce's.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this? - On Saturday, the 23d of May, between ten and eleven in the morning. I wrote the letter to Mr. Brathwaite; I said, 'Sir, ingratitude is not my characteristic, nor I hope never will be; it is impossible I can permit the inclosed to be received, it was given to my little girl.' I then inclosed the half guinea in a piece of paper, and then put the paper and half guinea into the letter, wafered it, and then sealed it carefully down with an instrument from the watchmaker's shop board.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you wafer that bit of paper that you put the half guinea in? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fix it under the seal? - No, I did not; but I put it in that situation which I conceived more secure; then I put it in the letter, and put a cover over that letter to prevent its being soiled.</p>
               <p>Q. But before you put this cover on this letter, did you put a wafer to this letter? - Yes, I secured the letter very proper as I thought.</p>
               <p>Q. The letter was secured by a wafer you say, did you put a cover over that? - I put a piece of paper over that to prevent its being foiled.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put the direction? - On the letter, and I put the blank cover on it, to prevent my hand from dirtying it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that blank cover sealed? - No, it was not. I made a reference to Mr. Pearce, he was at work in his shop, says I, do you think this is safe? I wrote the letter and put the half guinea in it in his shop; I then said, I wished that I had somebody that I could send this letter to the Post office by; Mr. Pearce made answer, if my <placeName id="t17950916-6-crimeloc28">porter</placeName>

I then went down to the porter's house and I saw the porter's wife, the prisoner's wife,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160022"></xptr>Rainsley, he is porter to the foreign office, I asked where her husband was? she said he was up at the office; I asked her if the would be so obliging as to let her daughter deliver that letter to her husband, to deliver it to Mr. Braithwaite.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver it to? - To the porter's daughter. She returned in the course of twelve or fifteen minutes; says she, I have delivered to him, and he will deliver it directly. I said, my dear, I am very much obliged to you, I have no money now, if I had I would give you something for your trouble. I returned again the same evening between eight and nine o'clock, and I see the prisoner standing at the door, I said to him, Rainsley, did you deliver that letter to Mr. Brathwaite? he said, no, he had not; I asked what was the reason? he answered, because he was out of town. I was satisfied with that answer, and conversed with him for some time after, it may be twelve or twenty minutes; I said, you will give me the letter I will not trouble you, I will take it to the house myself, and give it to his maid; I said, I am sorry you have neglected delivering it, I wish you had left it He said, no, sir, I will deliver it on Monday; I said, I will not trouble you as you have not delivered it, I am determined to take it myself. After some hesitation I was admitted into his room where he lives, and before I got in I heard a kind of whisper, a found like 'st 'st; when I got in, I said, Rainsley, give me the letter, if you please; he gave it me, and prior to the opening of that letter I said, Rainsley, Mrs. Rainsley, and young man, come here, and I opened the letter before them, and the half guinea was gone</p>
               <p>Q. Rainsley gave you the letter you said? - Yes, or his wife; I cannot tell which, out of a drawer in the house. I imagined the half guinea was gone, frora the outside, before I opened it, and when I opened the letter I read the contents to Rainsley, and I said to Rainsley, where is the contents, the half guinea? he said there was no half guinea; I said, there was an half guinea, and by God it must be returned; he said, it was a likely story that I should send Mr. Brathwaite half a guinea; I told him I should not condescend to explain to him the reason, but there was half a guinea sent to him in the letter. Then he abused me very much, he insulted me very much, and took a view of my dress, and the son also. I felt myself very much hurt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the paper in the letter? - The paper nor the half guinea was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it put in so loose that it might tumble out? - From the appearance of the letter the wafer was opened, but I do not present to swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the letter with the wafer wet or dry? - Dry.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearance of the letter or wafer, did you expect any thing had been done to it at the time? - No, I did not at the time. I then left the house and went on Monday morning to Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the wife say any thing at this time? - No, she returned abuse, and treated me with a vast deal of contempt, in consequence of my supposed authority. I went, on Monday, to Guildhall, and related to Mr. Alderman Coombs what I have related to your lordship and asked his advice, he answered that it was a very awkward piece of business, and he thought I had better drop it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know the fact one way or the other, whether Mr. Brathwaite was or was not in town? - I cannot ascertain that. I endeavoured to subpoena him to prove that, but he is gone out of town a very great distance.</p>
               <p>Q. You have not had your half guinea? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160023"></xptr>Mr. Fielding. Look at these gentleman. How long is it since you was dismissed from the Post office? - Four years last May.</p>
               <p>Q. You was before that time a clerk in the office? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has that man at the bar been at the office? - A long time.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you presented your memorial to the Post office for reinstatement, in consequence of which the secretary and Mr. Brathwaite sent you half a guinea a piece? - In the month of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Before I go any further be so good as to tell these gentlemen how you get your living now? - By honest labour. I am in the army way.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you send your memorial by? - By my little girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing given to your little girl? - No, it was money that I claimed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was no money given to your little girl? - Yes, this half guinea was given to my little girl, but I could not receive it, because I was defending myself against a report of Mr. Brathwaite's.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you took it into your head to return this half guinea? - I think I received it on Thursday, and I returned it on Saturday; I think it was the 23d of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you write this letter? - At the watch-maker's, in <placeName id="t17950916-6-crimeloc29">Holborn</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17950916-6-crimeloc29" type="placeName" value="Holborn"></interp>

               <p>Q. How came you to write the letter there? - Because I knew the person, and it was near where I did my business; I wrote it there because I shewed my friend my resentment, and I went there to ask him to let his porter take it to save the expence of a letter.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had written this letter, what was to prevent you from carrying it to Mr. Brathwaite yourself? - From point of delicacy, as I had been in the Post office I did not like to deliver it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take it to this man's house? - It was his duty to deliver it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is his house at the office? - No, but he was on duty, and it was his duty to receive all letters directed to his superiors. I supposed to find the porter at home.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found he was not at home, but his wife, why could not you have as well taken the letter yourself as send it by the child? - I have related the reason once, and I have no other reason whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. In the evening you had the curiosity to come back again to the house? - Yes, and I will tell you the reason of that curiosity. There was a very unpleasant circumstance had happened at the office, and I wished to know the nature of it; but I had not the most distant doubt of his sincerity at the time. In the course of the conversation I asked him if he had delivered the letter? he told me he had not, "the reason was because Mr. Brathwaite was gone out of town; I was satisfied with that.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not contented that he should keep the letter till Mr. Brathwaite came to town? - I did it from this principle, as I had no money to give him I would take it myself to Mr. Brathwaite's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You was angry at him for not having left the letter in the office? - I was rather displeased.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your letter was given you again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you told us that you called his wife and the son when you opened the letter, for what purpose was that? - That they might all see the half guinea was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. So when you said there had been a half guinea in this letter they were all angry? - No; they took a review of my dress and so on.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Brathwaite was the occasion of your being dismissed from the office? - I fancy so; after he superceded me he said, the office wanted weeding, and he offered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160024"></xptr>me an annuity of sixty pounds a year to resign, which I refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do any thing else after the alderman had dismissed this complaint? - He said I had better summons him, and I took the summons myself, and gave it to his wife; and she said, go along you fool to Bath; and flung the summons in my face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he attend the summons before the alderman? - He did; but there was no merit in that, for he must. The alderman said he could not grant a warrant, I had better go to the grand jury, and relate my story there, he could not grant a warrant. This was on the 23d of May.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you prefer your indictment? - As soon as the grand jury met.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had indicted him you took him up by a warrant? - Yes, a certificate was given me, and he was taken up and carried before Alderman Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you opopose his being bailed there? - Not in the first instance; in the second instance I did. He abused me very much, and the clerk said it was not bailable, and there I left it. There were two gentlemen there ready to have bailed him I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me when it was that you took it into your head to address a letter to my lord Chesterfield? - I took it into my head to write a great many.</p>
               <p>Q. You wrote to him the 2d of July, I believe? - (A letter shewn him) That is my letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the contents of the letter? - I dare say I do.</p>
               <p>The letter read.</p>
               <p>"My Lord, with the greatest respect and humility I beg leave to address your lordship, as his Majesty's post-master general, being a duty I owe myself in particular and the public in general, to acquiant your lordship of the following fact. In consequence of the last memorial I had of presenting to your lordship, I sent to the secretary for answer by my little girl; Mr. - knowing the child belonged to me, politely made her a present of half a guinea, Mr. Brathwaite also made her a present of half a guinea, which I could not permit to be received, and returned the half guinea in a letter by Mr. Rainsley, the porter in the foreign office; with the particulars of Rainsley's conduct; I shall not intrude upon your lordship's time, but only observe that I have related the whole of the transaction to the grand jury of the City of London, who have found a true bill against the said

               <p>I am a watch maker, in Holborn, about two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 23d of May, Mr. Rowning coming to your shop? - Perfectly well. He related that he had received a present from Mr. Brathwaite of half a guinea; and he observed, that he could no in conscience put it into his own pocket, because he had an affair at take with Mr. Brathwaite. He then wrapped it in a small piece of paper and enclosed it in a letter, and then sealed it with a wafer.</p>
               <p>Q. He first enclosed the half guinea in a small piece of paper; Did he put any wafer or seal to that? - I did not perceive that he did. He then put the piece of paper with the half guinea into half a street of paper and folded it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how it was solded? - I cannot describe that. He then sealed that letter with a wafer, and took an implement that we use and jagged the wafer to prevent its opening of itself; he then asked if my porter was in the way, that he might convey this letter for him to Mr. Brathwaite, at the Post office? I answered, he was not in the way, if he was he should take it down for him with pleasure, Mr. Rowning then put the letter into his pocket and went down, as I conceived, to the Post office.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that he enquired for the porter, will you take on yourself to say that the half guinea was in the letter? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mr. Rowning drew your attention to what he did? - He merely asked my advice whether I supposed it would fall cut</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he had the curiosity to ask you, as you had seen the half guinea put in, to have the goodness to accompany him, and to take care that it was delivered into the Post office? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not request you to attend him that there might be no mistake in the midway? - No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Q. How old are you? - Fourteen next November.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160026"></xptr>Q. Do you remember a letter being given to you by Rowning? - Yes; he came about ten or eleven o'clock, and said, Mrs. Rainsley, have you a little boy that will take this letter, and if you will lay out a penny or two-pence I will pay you when I have money, for I have not money now. My mother said she was very sorry he was so much like herself; he asked if none of the neighbours children would go? my mother said she did not like to trouble them; and then he asked if I would go? my mother said she did not know how to spare me, but as it was to oblige him I should go. I went up with the letter, and my father was gone up to Christ's Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this, Saturday? - I do not recollect the month or the day of the month. Mr. Rowning desired me to give it to no one but my father, for my father to deliver it to Mr. Brathwaite.</p>
               <p>Q. Not finding your father at the office what did you do with the letter? - I brought the letter back and laid it on the top of the drawers, the same as he delivered it into my hand. My father was gone to Christ's Hospital, as I understood, for one of the clerks of the Post office. Before I came back Mr. Rowning was gone, and that our lodger knows, she was securing the stairs the same time as he went out, before I came home with the letter. After this a gentleman came from Camberwell, his wife was very ill, and he came for me, and I went with him, and did not come home till Monday morning; I went about six o'clock on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at home when Mr. Rowning came in the evening? - I was not above a quarter of an hour going to the office and back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your brother there at the time that man came in? - Yes; he is out at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of the letter? - When I went out it was on the top of the drawers, as Mr. Rowning left it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prosecutor, Mr. Rowning, after this letter was delivered to you? - No, I could not, because I had not seen my father.</p>
               <p>Q. After Mr. Rowning had delivered you the letter, did you see Mr. Rowning any more on Saturday? - No, I did not; I never saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never told Mr. Bowning that you delivered it to your father? - No, he was gone before I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you never did? - Yes, I tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if Mr. Rowning has sworn that you told him so, he has sworn that that is false - I tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Rowning has sworn in plain terms that you told him that you had delivered that letter to your father? - I never see him till the Thursday after.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him on Thursday? - No, I never spoke to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have never spoke to him after he delivered the letter to you? - No, never at all.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Mr. Rowning coming to your house on Saturday about a letter? - Yes, I do. I reckon it to be about a quarter before nine.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were at home of your family at that time? - There were my mother, my father, and my sister, and myself, and our lodger. He came to know whether my father had delivered the letter to Mr. Brathwaite, and my father told him he had not, because as he was not in town he could not deliver it till Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Brathwaite out of town? - Yes, I know he was, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Rowning say on that? - He said, can I see that letter again?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160027"></xptr>my father says to me, Sam, go and fetch the letter that laid on the top of the drawers. I went and brought it, and gave it into his hands; he came in doors with the letter, and my mother was ironing, and our lodger was sitting in the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the letter before he came into the house? - Yes, I gave it him as he stood at the door. When he came in he broke open the letter and said, where is the half guinea that was in it? my father said, if there was a half guinea in the letter it is there now; he said, he would he upon his oath that he put half a guinea in the letter; my father told him that he knew nothing at all about it, and did not like such expressions in the neighbourhood, and he begged he would depart; and he brought a summons in about a week after from the alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the alderman? - Yes; but Mr Rowning pushed me out and said I had no business there</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You were at the door when Mr. Rowning came? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did your father come home that night? - About a quarter before two, to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the letter then? - No, he did not; he took it up in his hand and said it could not be delivered before Monday, for Mr. Brathwaite was out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. The letter lay then from the time that your sister brought it back till night, except when your father took hold of it. - Yes.</p>

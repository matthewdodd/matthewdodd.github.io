I am a son of Mrs. East—on Saturday evening, 7th January, I came down stairs after the prisoner had paid my mother his rent—she showed me a bad florin, and I fetched a constable, and then said to the prisoner that he had been having a game with us, in fact, giving us bad florins—he said that he had not done such a thing—I gave them to the inspector.</p>

On 7th January, East fetched me, and charged the prisoner—I took him to the station, and there received two bad florins from East—I afterwards went back to the prisoner's room, which was pointed out to me, where I found a metal box, which contained another bad florin.</p>

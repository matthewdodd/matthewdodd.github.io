Then I said, she might lie in a two pair of stairs room. She went to let the people where she lodg'd know, that they need not expect her at night. Soon after a person came and told me my servant was stop'd with a silver salt and a napkin. I took her in custody, and found the things where she had carried them.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar brought this silver salt and napkin to me last Thursday (producing them. )</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These are my property.</p>
               <p>Jervice. I stop'd them as suspecting them to be stolen; but after that she sent a woman, who made a faint pretence to them. So I delivered them; by this means it got to the prosecutor's knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Where did you meet with the things?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found them at a cook's shop, where the prisoner said she had left them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That cook-woman went to Mr. Jervice's house, and owned them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The cook woman said the prisoner sent her for them.</p>

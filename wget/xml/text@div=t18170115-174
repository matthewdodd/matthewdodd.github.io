             SIMPSON. I live in Fore-street, with Mr. Wilson, who is a broker. On the 3d of January, I was in <placeName id="t18170115-174-crimeloc954">High Holborn</placeName>

I did not see the prisoner near me. I knew the book to be mine. It was in the kennell at Southampton-buildings.</p>
               <p>THOMAS THOHPSON. I am a constable. On the 3d of January, I was in Holborn, just by Middle-row, I saw the prosecutor walking along, and the prisoner, with two others, behind him, the prisoner attempted his pocket twice, without success; he put his finger into his pocket; the two other men were close behind, apparently covering him from view. I saw the prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, and take something out - He put it under his great coat. I told the prosecutor, and took hold of the prisoner and another of the men; I was the pocket-book fall from the prisoner into the kennell. The other man made his escape, and left his hat in my hand. Mr. Simpson claimed the book; it contained two 1l. notes and some papers.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Q.by Prisoner. Did you not lay hold of another man before me - A. I took both together.</p>

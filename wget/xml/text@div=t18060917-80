On the 22nd of July, about two o'clock, the prisoner with another woman came into our shop, they enquired for some cambric muslin, which I shewed them, and none suited them, they then asked to see some prints for gowns, I shewed them all that was likely to suit them, they observed there was nothing that suited them, they would call in another day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay in your shop. - A. About a quarter of an hour; at the time they were going out of the shop, I suspected them, I let them go out of the shop, and then brought them back, I examined them, I found enclosed in M'Carthy's apron five shawls and a half, she threw them from her apron on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. What shawls were they. - A. Printed cambric shawls, I produce them.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these shawls before she took them. - A. I had shewn them to a customer a little while before, which was the occasion of their being on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to shew the cambric muslin did you turn your back to get it to shew them. - A. Yes, I was under the necessity of going to the window.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170061"></xptr>Q. Who was in the shop at the same time. - A. No person at the time, Mr. Poole came in the shop during the time they were there, he rather suspected them himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of them take the shawls. - A. No, I am confident I knew nothing was taken, I only suspected them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did M'Carty say any thing when the shawls dropped out of her apron. - A. Nothing at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. They are old fashioned goods, are they what would fell for two shillings. - A. Oh, yes, they are in wear, and have been in wear for years.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, called five witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

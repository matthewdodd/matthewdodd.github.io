                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old next month—I live with my father, at No. 3, Victoria-cottages, Hawley-road, Kentish-town. On the afternoon of the 1st of Oct. I went with M'Cane to Highgate wood, to get blackberries—in the field adjoining the wood we met four boys—the prisoners are two of them—they were together—Monk asked us if we would buy some blackberries of him—he had some in his cap—I said we had no money—we went on into the wood—the four boys came after us—. Monk asked us if we had got any money—I said no, we had not—he said, "What have you got in your pockets? let me look what you have got in your pockets?"—I had a stick in my hand—I offered it to him—he said that would not do—I had got a basket, and offered him that—he said that would not do—I had a top and string in my pocket, which I offered him—he said that would not do—I had a knife in my waistcoat pocket—he said, "What is that sticking out of your waistcoat pocket?"—I said, "A knife"—he said, "Let us look at it, or else I will hit you over the head with this stick"—he had a stick in his hand, which he held up—I took the knife out of my pocket, and gave it to him—he looked at it, and then passed it to one of the others—after they had all looked at it, Monk gave it to me again—Monk then said to Day, "You want a pair of boots, don't you?."—Day said, "Yes, and a jacket too"—Monk then went to M'Cane, and said, "We must have your boots, your fathers can buy more, but he has got no parents;"—I said, "I cannot let you have these, my father has something else to do with his money"—Monk then said to the others, "Suppose we have the knife, shall we?"—they said, "Yes"—Monk then said, "Come, give it out;" and I then gave it to him—he had the stick in his hand—he did not hold it over me then, or say anything about it—when I gave him the knife they went away—they did not take M'Cane's boots—they were all standing round me at the time—when they were gone we ran out of the wood—we then turned round, and saw they were running after us, about half-way up the field, or rather more—I saw a lady and gentleman, and told them what had happened—the boys on that ran into a field at the side of the wood, in a different direction—we went on to the Archway-road, and saw a policeman—I told him what had happened—he went with me—we saw the prisoners run past the Woodman—I pointed them out to the policeman—we followed them to Highgate and Hampstead—we</p>

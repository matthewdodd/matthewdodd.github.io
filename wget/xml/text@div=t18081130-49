               <p>Q. Do you know what parish that is in - A. That I cannot possibly say. St. Andrew's, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner; do you know him - A. No further than seeing him at Hatton garden on the Wednesday morning, when he had my property on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that man come to lodge at Mayo's house - A. Yes, as they informed me; on Friday evening the 18th when I came home from work I found a man in bed, in the room where I sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the evening was that - A. A little after eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to bed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out to your work the next morning - A. A little after six.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what things had you of your own in the room where you slept - A. I had a chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it locked - A. Yes, I had the key myself; it was locked when I got up and went out in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look in your box - A. No; I always try the lock to see whether it is locked when I go out in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last lock it - A. The day before in the morning, before I went out to work; I wanted something out.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all your things safe in it then - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell me what things particular you had in it - A. I had nine shirts, marked RH, and two neck handkerchiefs, marked RH, two pocket and two necks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing else - A. Yes, there were silk handkerchiefs, one marked with a figure of nine, one pocket handkerchief not marked, a two pound bank note, half a guinea, and some silver, and three broaches; I went out to my work in the morning, I returned between twelve and one in the day; I went up into my bed room, I looked at my chest, I found it broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the lock forced - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it open or shut - A. It was shut; I tried to unlock it with the key, I could not; I put my hand<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300043"></xptr>to the lid and lifted it up; then I missed the articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you missed all the things you have related - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out in the morning you left the stranger in bed, did not you - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the things again - A. It was on Saturday the 19th I missed them; I saw them again on the Wednesday following; I saw three handkerchiefs and one shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you saw - A. Yes. The prisoner at the bar had got the shirt on; when I came to the office it was taken off him, and then I could swear to it, it had got the name taken out; when he was first taken, when I first saw it, the name was taken out; I knew it by the mark in the bosom of the shirt, it was worked with a heart, I knew it by that, by the work of that heart; I believe to the best of my knowledge it was my shirt, I knew it by the frill, and every thing; I saw it was a new shirt; the person who made the shirt is in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with regard to the two handkerchiefs, can you speak to them - A. Yes, one is marked with my name; the pocket handkerchief and the other is marked with J. A. No. 9; it is a silk handkerchief; and a pocket handkerchief that is not marked; I know that, having had it for three years, for a particular reason; I know it as an old acquaintance.</p>

On Saturday the 19th I went down Saffron hill, I met the prisoner coming up Saffron hill, I asked him how he came to leave my house without paying the lodging; he said I made a mistake, that he was not the person; I told him I was certain that he was the person.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at these handkerchiefs and this shirt, and tell the gentlemen of the jury whether you are able to say they are your's - A. This shirt was marked R H on that side; I know it by the heart and the frill, it is my shirt.</p>
               <p>- . I made the shirt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make that heart - A. I did: I am sure it is my work, and this handkerchief is my work; it is Mr. Hawkins'.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my handkerchief; the silk handkerchief is mine; it is marked I A 9; the waistcoat is not mine.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the handkerchiefs and the shirts - A. The shirts cost me fifteen shillings a piece, the handkerchiefs about eight shillings the three.</p>
               <p>Q. You say altogether there were nine shirts missing and seven handkerchiefs - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the morning of the 19th of November I went to the west end of the town, I had a two pound note, and coming down Holborn hill there there was a Jew standing with a waistcoat on his arm; he asked me to buy them; I said I would give him seven shillings for them; he likewise pulled out a silk handkerchief and a cotton one; I gave him ten shillings for the waistcoat and two handkerchiefs. I went and paid for a pair of shoes and I had a one pound note left which the officers took from me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I lost a two pound note with these things.</p>

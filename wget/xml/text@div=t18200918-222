I asked her one day for a scarf of mine, which was washed at home. I had told her to put it under my bed to press - she said she put it under my bed - she seemed flurried, and I went to look and found a parcel containing five handkerchiefs, under her own bed. (the scarf was under mine) I had seen them in the shop the night before. I told her of it, and turned her away. She was apprehended two days after.</p>

            . On Friday, while the prisoner was in the house, my wife informed me of this. I told her to keep her till I was at leisure. I then told her that two bundles in the shop had been misplaced and rumpled in the night, and some cambric taken away. The handkerchiefs were mine. She said it was the first thing she ever took. I was called down to the shop. I said she must not go away without being searched. I saw her go out while I was busy. I sent for Levy on Saturday; as my father knew the girl to be a thief, and I missed other things. We found her at her sweetheart's apartments. She was searched and the coins found on her, which I swear to be mine. They were taken from my looking-glass drawer, they were marked in a particular manner by a stamp. It was done some years back. She was then taken into custody, but let go again, as her father said he knew where all the property was. She was apprehended again on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were the handkerchiefs missed before you turned her out of doors - A. She was not turned out exactly. My wife said she should not sleep in the house. I had missed nothing but the handkerchiefs when she left. They were worth 3 s. each. I missed no more that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, how soon after did you write to Mrs. Gasheer to make you amends for the false character she gave her - A. About three-quarters of an hour, and before I missed any thing else. I said 200 l. or 300 l. would not compensate for what I had lost. I demanded no money of Mrs. Gasheer.</p>
               <p>Q. When the coins were found on her, they were in your possession a day and a half afterwards - A. No. I kept them a few hours after, they were found on her on Sunday. I pointed the marks out when they were found, and gave them to the Magistrate on Monday, as the officer would not take them of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say your niece took them - A. She said so on Sunday.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. When you missed more property and told her of it, what did she say - A. She mentioned the person who was the instigator of it. Mrs. Gasheer is her aunt. The marks were on the coins before they were lost. Mr. Isaacs, the prisoner's attorney, attended before the Magistrate in my name without my authority.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At the time Mr. Isaacs attended, was not the prisoner examined as a witness - A. I charged her with the robbery. One Jacobs was charged as the receiver.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long before had you marked the money - A. Some years. They were all marked with the same punch. I cannot find the punch now. This is the letter I wrote to Gasheer - (looking at it.)</p>

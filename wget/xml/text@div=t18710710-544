                  </hi>. I am a doctor of laws, a barrister, and a member of the Inner Temple—I rent chambers of Mr. Wright, at 5, Fig Tree Court—the prisoner was my clerk—I went to Italy in December, 1870—I left a Christmas box for the prisoner and his brother, with their father, five shillings each—I sent word from time to time that I might return—I came back in May, suddenly—got to my chambers between 11 and 12 o'clock—I found the prisoner and his brother there—I said "Good morning"—I went into the large room—I observed there were not the same number of books that I had left—I went out of the room to go into the back-room, the door of which I found locked—I asked the prisoner's brother how it was the door was locked—he was in Mr. Wright's room, but near enough to hear me—I told his brother to fetch the key—I found they had both left the chambers—the prisoner's brother came back with the key—I was trying to open the door—I stooped down to put the key in—just when the door was unlocked, when I was still stooping, I received, on the side of my head, a heavy blow—I believed I received a very strong electric shock—I put my hands to feel where it came from, and was looking up, I received another blow from behind with the sharp end of a hammer, which rendered me insensible—while on the ground, the prisoner was standing on my left side, and he gave me another blow on my right ear, the pain of that blow restored me to consciousness—I then saw the prisoner standing over me with the hammer; I started up, went to the window and called for the police—I saw Mr. Bristowe standing at the hall-door, he said "My gracious, me, what is the matter?"—Dr. Brooks came in and attended to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The boy's conduct was always good—he was not in my service at this time, nor responsible for the custody of my property—I was not paying his wages—I generally paid in advance—two weeks were due when I returned, I think—when I was first knocked down, I was nearly insensible—I was not conscious of being struck—the second blow rendered me insensible, and the third restored me to consciousness—he might have struck me again if he had liked—I can't say he was excited this morning—I never ill-treated the boy in my life, or any other boy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 168, Fleet Street—on 25th May, I was called into the prosecutor's chambers, and found a wound over his right eye 21/4 in. long, through the integuments to the bone; another wound over the temple, which went simply through the integuments; and another bruise on the neck, below the right ear—the wound on the posterior portion of the temple bone was a large circumscribed swelling, about 2in. in circumference—there were three wounds on the head—the injury in the front of the head was dangerous—he has not recovered from the effects yet—the bone is still denuded—I question whether he will ever really recover from it—all the wounds would be occasioned by such an instrument as that produced—very considerable force would be required to make those blows.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> His health would not have had much to do with the dangerous nature of the wounds—the severe blow has torn the periosteum from the bone; that bone will naturally decay, and that is what is taking place now—I am afraid it will not recover again—I have not met cases where</p>

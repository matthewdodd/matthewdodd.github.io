             deposed as on the trial of Steward*. The substance of which was, that on the 31st of March 1757, Steward and the prisoner came together to him at the George, Leather-lane; and Steward agreed to give him 6 l. for his horse, and desired him to bring him to the Bell-Savage-Inn; then they took him to go to the Temple Exchange-Coffee House for his money; that Green went part of the way and disappeared. Steward took him from that Coffee-House to Symond's-Inn-Cellar, Chancery-lane, then to a place near Fetter-lane; still no money produced: they returned back to the Bell-Savage-Inn, were informed Green had took the horse away; that six days after, Green sent him word he should have his horse again, on giving him a note to indemnify him; that he ordered him to be brought to the Horse and Groom in Eagle-street, by Red-Lyon-Square, where he found him accordingly.</p>

I called out stop thief, and then they threw an old hat of one of them away; it was not mine; they ran down a place where there were some gardens and huts. I told some persons standing round what had happened, and gave them my address, and soon after they came to my father's house, and in consequence of something they told me, I went down to the watchhouse, and found the prisoner in custody there, and saw my hat.</p>

            . I am a weaver; I live in Loggerhead-late. On the 11th of last month, I was at my mother's, in Cooper's-gardens; and the prisoner came and knocked at my mother's door; it might be a hundred yards from the spot where the young man says he was robbed of his hat. The prisoner had an apron on then; he had one of his shoes in his hand, and asked if any shoe-maker lived there; we told him no, that we were weavers. With that he shut the door, and put his shoe down on the floor, and put it on,and went into the next room; then he looked there twice, and pulled the hat off his head, and swung it about twice. I asked him what business he had going into the next room, and he said, don't turn me out, I am only playing at hoop, and he said if I turned him out, they would catch him.</p>

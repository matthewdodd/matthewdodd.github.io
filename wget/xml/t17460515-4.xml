               <p>Morris. As near as I can guess, the 24th of January, a Quarter before Eight o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you alone?</p>
               <p>Morris. No, Sir; there were two with me, my Husband and another.</p>

               <p>Q. This Man (the Prisoner) laid hold of me, and said he would blow my Brains out, because I made a Noise, when my Husband throw'd me over the Bank to make my Escape; the Moon shone in the Prisoner's Face at the Time he robb'd us; he was in Soldier's Cloaths, and his Coat was turn'd the wrong Side outwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing of the other?</p>
               <p>Morris. My Lord, if I was to see them I can't say I know them, because they run swiftly before me.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to be so particular to know this Person more than the other two.</p>
               <p>Morris. The others run swiftly by us, this Man stopt us.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray had he a Wig on, or his own Hair?</p>
               <p>Morris. His own Hair, he had a Soldier's Coat turn'd blue.</p>

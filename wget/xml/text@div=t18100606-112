             was going to make her a present of them, one for her, and one for her sister. I sent for some patterns to Messrs. Roberts and Plowmen, and one of their men brought some patterns; she said, she could not judge of the patterns, she wished to see the pieces. The young man went and brought a number of pieces; she fixed on two remnants, and requested the young man to bring some plain sarcenet, and to leave the two pieces and she would fix on one of the two while he was gone. As soon as he was gone she said, Captain

             was waiting at a coffee-house near hand, begged of me to let my girl go with her to carry the pieces for his approbation; the little girl went with her. I never saw the prisoner again till the Sunday before Easter. The little girl returned without either of the pieces. I have been made to answer for the sarcenet.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her again, what passed - A. I was going through St. Paul's Church-yard with the little girl's father I saw her, and he took hold of her. I charged her with taking the two pieces of sarcenet from my girl; she made no answer whatever, and never spoke during the time of taking her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been charged to you for the sarcenet - A. Eight pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand that the captain was to pay for it - A. I understood that she was to pay for it, and that she had the money in her pocket; she said, he had given her eight pounds to pay for it.</p>

In June last I saw the prisoner at Dunquerque—I reported the matter, and extradition proceedings were taken, and a warrant was issued for his apprehension in France—I received him in my custody on 3rd August—I saw him in the prison, and in the presence of the French police I told him who I was, and said, "I understand that a warrant has been granted against you, and your ex<lb></lb>tradition has been granted by the Government. You will be charged with stealing and receiving 1160 yards of silk, the property of Mr. Spiers, of the Borough. I believe you are the person who was indicted with Allen and the two Harrises last year, and you absconded"—he said "Yes, I did abscond; the indictment was found against me, and I had the silk. I bought the silk from Allen. There was a man named Mordecai very much mixed up in the matter, and I think he ought to be arrested"—I said "I may tell you that Mordecai is arrested, and is now in custody at the Southwark Police-court"—he said he was very glad to hear that, and "I am very sorry now that I ran away; I suppose I must have been a fool"—he said Mordecai introduced Allen to him—on the vessel on the journey he said, "I wish to have a conversation with you about my case"—I said "Very well, as you please"—he said "I am not a German, as has been stated; I am a Dane; I used to keep a boarding-house in St. George's-in-the-East, and I bought that silk of a man. I think I paid him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard. I think Kimber has the receipt. I never knew that it had actually been stolen, but I knew that it was the property of Mr. Spiers. I stopped at the Old Bailey till the Thursday to take my trial with the others; I then got frightened; I thought I was going to get ten years, the same as"—some other person, I forget the name, but it was a man who was convicted at that Sessions—"and I thought I had better run away"—he also related how he got to Dunquerque.</p>

               <p>extradition treaty came into force—I have heard since I had him in custody that he was pressed by his creditors—Mordecai was discharged—the prisoner did not say he was so ignorant of the value of silk that he had to ask the value of it—I understood him to mean that he knew the silk was Mr. Spiers's property at the time the trial was about to take place.</p>

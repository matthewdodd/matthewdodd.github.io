                  </hi>. I live in Old-street. I had twenty feet of lead pipe fixed to my building—I saw it safe on Sunday night, the 14th of May, at eight o'clock—I know this brass tap—I am a farrier, and here is a hone-shoe nail which I put into it myself.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 170.) On Sunday evening, at a quarter past ten o'clock, I was by the Loggerhead public-house, Vir<lb></lb>ginia-row, Bethnal-green—the prisoner passed me at the corner—I saw this piece of lead in his apron—I followed him, and asked what he had got—he said, some piping—I asked where he brought it from—he said, from home, and that he was going to a girl he was acquainted with—I took him down the street, and in going along he said, "So help me God I found it is Cooper's-gardens, and I have got some more"—he then produced some more.</p>

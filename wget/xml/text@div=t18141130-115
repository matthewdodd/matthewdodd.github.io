Having missed two or three articles of mine, suspicion fell on the prisoner; on Thursday week last, having deposited six five shilling papers in a room, some pence and some half-pence, on the 2nd of November I missed two out of the six, and on searching for them I found them concealed under some wood that was bought to light the fire. I marked the paper of halfpence with my initials; the paper of penny pieces was only once tied round with string, I did not mark them. After I had marked them, I placed them as nearly as I found them covering them over with the fire wood; I desired my servant maid not to touch them until I got up the next morning; the next morning I examined the spot where I found these things they were gone. I then applied to Mr. Griffiths of Lambeth Street office, I let the prisoner go ont to breakfast as usual and when he got out of the house I called him back when he returned Griffiths the officer searched his person, and found the two papers in his pocket.</p>

            . On Friday morning I went to the house of the prosecutor; the prisoner was not gone to breakfast, I waited until such time he went; he went to breakfast; I was sitting in the parlour. I saw him go out into the street, I called him back into the shop; I searched him, and in his breeches pocket, I found a paper of halfpence in one pocket, and penny pieces in the other; these are the papers of copper. I asked him how he came to rob his master; he said it was the first time. I asked him the reason of his doing so; he said he wanted some money to make up to buy him a new coat: he begged of his master to forgive him. That is all that passed.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. to Prosecutor. When did you mark them - A. After I found them under the wood.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The money found on me was part of fifteen shillings paid me on Saturday night by my master. When Mr. Griffiths found the papers of money in my pocket, he asked me what made me take them; I said to buy me a new coat; I said it is my first offence, they ought to forgive me; they took me to Lambeth-street offence.</p>

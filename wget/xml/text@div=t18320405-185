               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I took the shop they said I could have the use of the counter, or pay for it if I thought proper, with a stove, which was there - I paid them 11s. 6d. rent and 2s. on account of the counter and stove - in about five weeks I could not keep up my payments, and they seized my goods; a squabble ensued, and we went to the office - the nephew was ordered out of the office for perjuring himself; I was discharged, and they have trumped up this story to prevent my proceeding against them for an illegal seizure; I sold the counter, because they should not seize that as well as the stove, which I had bought of them.</p>

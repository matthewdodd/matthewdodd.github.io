               <p>Q. Did she say that loud? - A. Yes; he then threw it down behind him; I then went round, and insisted upon having the duplicate and the one-pound note; I told him I supposed he had stolen the watch, as well as the handkerchief, and therefore I sent for an Officer; he attempted to run away, and did get out of the shop, but my young man and I pulled him back again; I delivered the handkerchief to the Officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this handkerchief was pinned? - A. Yes, I had pinned it myself, and saw it there just before he came into the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business as a stay-maker, at Deptford—I did so on 31 st May—the prisoner was in my service since 24th March—I paid him a salary on 24th March—he had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and his wages were 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day—I took the stay-making business of him—there was never any partnership between us at any time—on 31st May he was authorized to receive from Mrs. Evans 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Stanley—he only accounted to me for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., received from Mrs. Evans—he was afterwards to receive 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more from her—he did not account to me for that—I afterwards sent him to receive 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mrs. Stanley—he did not account to me for that—I purchased goods from Mrs. Stanley—these are the invoices of them—sometimes they would send them by the prisoner, as my servant.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Before you began stay-making, what were you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A miller—I never was partner with Mr. Frost—the prisoner had carried on the stay-business for some years—I gave him nothing for the business, but he was such a dissipated character, he said to me, "I have no means of carry-ing on business, without I get some one to take it; if you take my business, and allow me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, I will do the best I can for you"—I am carrying the business on now—perhaps I have been amongst the connexion of the prisoner since he has been in prison, telling them that he has robbed me—I have been amongst some of them, and told them he had been receiving money on my account, and absconded—the 24th of March was the time I took the business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this paper, dated 7th May, 1849; how came you to make out this invoice in Marks's name then? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said to me," This lady is a very particular lady; she won't buy stays of any one but me; it won't make any</p>

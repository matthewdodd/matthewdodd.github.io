                  </hi>. I am head barman to Mr. Rudkta, at the Groffins in the New Meat Market—I have been in his employment about three months—the Griffins stands at the corner of the market, facing Charter House Street, In what is called the "A" avenue—the entrances to the house are in the mar<lb></lb>ket—the entrance where the <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi> is delivered is through the market gatts—on 4th May, some gin was delivered from Messrs. Nichobon &amp; Co., at the Griffins—the gin drawn out from the cask which, stands in the van, into the gallon copper cans, which are very small at the neck—Fielding was the carman who came with the van—it was his duty to fill the cams, and he carried them from the cart as far as the door, and they were carried up stairs by another man, in the same employ—I had watch the delivery of the gin on the day in question—they commenced to take the him in about 3.15 on the afternoon of the 4th—I knew the prisoner by sight, as a beadle in the market—shortly before 4 o'clock he came to my master's place, and said How about the gates, young man may I close them?—I said "No, I think you had better leave them open till we get-the gin in which will not be long"—the gates are closed on that day at 4 o'clock, on other days they are closed at different times—he said "All right I" and went out—he came in agin shortly afterrwards and said "Young man, have you got a small bottle you can lend me?"—I said "No, we don't keep them in this house"—he said "Have you got a soda-water bottle you can land me?—I them lent him a lemonade bottle, with a flat bottom—I first gave it to him with<lb></lb>out a cork—he asked me to put a cork in, which I did—he put the bottle in his pocket, and went out—out—the bottle I lent him was like this one (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—I believe this was the one—the one I lent him had "Culver house" on it the same as this—I waited in the bar a moment or two, and saw the man go out with the empty cans they fetched the gin in—I jumped over the bar, and went up a few star is, and looked out of a window which com<lb></lb>manded a view of the cart—I saw the distiller's man fill a can and bring it in the market gates—I could not see any more from that window, so I went to another window and looked out—I saw the man again with the can—he placed it on the ground, and turned his back towards it, to look out of the</p>

               <p>market, at his cart—I then saw the prisoner coma tip the avenue, where he turned down in the first place—he stood behind the can, and looked round each way, put his hand in his pocket, and took out the bottle, took out the cork, and placed the bottle in the can—I got down from the window, think<lb></lb>ing I would go and catch him in the act, but I afterwards got up to the window again, and saw him putting his hand in his pocket; whether he had the bottle in it or not I can't say—I then went to the manager, and gave him information—I went out to see if I could find the beadle Roberts—I went up to the gates to see whether he had gone out of the market—I met him in the market as I was going back—I said "Mr. Jones wishes to see you"—Mr. Jones is the managing man—he said "Mr. Jones, what does he want me for?"—Mr. Jones then came up, and I heard him ask the prisoner for the bottle of gin he had in his possession—the prisoner said "What gin?"—Mr. Jones said "Come back with me," and he went back—I can't say that he was given in charge at that time—he was afterwards taken to the office of Mr. Stevens, the superintendent of the market, and searched, but no gin was found upon him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should say all this occupied about twenty minutes; from the time he came in and spoke about the gates to the time that he was searched—I am not in Mr. Rudkin's service now—I left last Wednes<lb></lb>day—I was only there three months—I never had any dispute with the prisoner—when the gin is in the copper vessels, and is taken into Mr. Rudkin's place, there is someone to mark them off with a chalk mark, and to see that they are full—if I saw that the cans were not full I should call attention to them—I did not see any of the cans not full on this day—I have not the slightest doubt that the bottle will go into the mouth of the can—the can is about 4 in. in diameter, and the bottle is about 2 in.—it will go in easily, I should imagine—I looked out of two windows—they both have ground glass; it is ornamental ground glass—you can see through very easily where there is a star—from the time I left the window till I met the prisoner in the market, and told him Mr. Jones wanted him, I should imagine was about five minutes—I only ran from the top of the house, and out to the market gates—I don't know whether Mr. Rudkin is here—on the occasion of the prisoner being searched no one gave him in charge—he did not ask to be given in charge—he said "Do you give me in charge for having the giu?"—that was when I stopped him—he was asked about the gin he had in his possession, and he said "What gin?" and I suppose some<lb></lb>thing more was said, and he said "Do you give me in charge?" like anyone saying it defiantly, daring him to do it—he was taken to Mr. Stephens' office—he insisted on being searched—I don't know whether there is anyone from Nicholson's here—I believe Fielding is here—I don't know that Field<lb></lb>ing took any part in the stealing; that is a thing I know nothing at all about—he was looking after his syphon, or anyone might have put a can under, and drawn off a pint of spirits in a moment—he never ought to have left the tap—he brought it from the cart, and another young man took it up stairs—I don't know a witness named Anglis at all, not by name—I was in Mr. Graves' service, in Church Street, Edgware Road, before I went to Mr. Rudkin's—I gave him notice the day before I left—he said he was going to make an alteration, and he has got a female now in my place.</p>

               <p>4th May, the prisoner was brought to my office, and charged with stealing gin—he was searched, but nothing was found on him—I gave instructions to a constable named Hart up to go and make inquiries of a labourer who lives in the neighbourhood of Newgate Street, about a third of a mile from Mr. Rudkin's—Hart up brought a bottle back with him with some gin in it—I gave that bottle to Mr. Rudkin on the following evening.</p>

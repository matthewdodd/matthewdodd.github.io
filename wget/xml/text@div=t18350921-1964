                  </hi>. I am a milkman, and live in Short's Gardens, King-street, Seven Dials. The prisoner lives next door to me—he is a butcher by trade, but he has driven a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> for eighteen or twenty months—In January last I went to Smithfield to sell a horse for my father, and met him there—I was the brown mare that he is charged with stealing—I saw a person describing himself as Jones of Stratford—It was on a Friday, the latter end of the month—I was present when the prisoner purchased the brown mare—I saw the money paid, and saw the man give a receipt for the money—I think it was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is the same receipt—I saw it on the table—from that time the prisoner has been constantly working about town with the mare in his cab—I have seen it at all hours, constantly at work, till he sold it to Mr. Higgs—I myself have driven it up Oxford-street, Regent's Park, Edgeware-road, and Piccadilly—he and his man have constantly been in the habit of driving it—he has one <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he drives by day, and his man by night—he goes out about half-past eight o'clock in the morning himself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you last see the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> he drove? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The day he was taken—It now stands in Green Dragon-yard, where it usually stands—he bought a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> of one Earl at first; that was a yellow one, with an old-fashioned body; but from about December, he has had a new-fashioned one—I saw the horse at Marlborough-street Office—It is the same horse as he drove in his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I had seen Jones before, and have seen him once since—I heard of him at Barnet fair—he stands about five feet six inches—h does not resemble the prisoner—he has rather a long face.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What makes you recollect the day of the purchase of the mare? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I sold a horse for my father—It was on a Friday in January—he had two horses before that; one black, and the other a brown mare—he kept them in Green Dragon-yard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a proprietor of hackney-coaches, and live in Euston-mews, Euston-square. In January last I saw the prisoner buy a mare in Smithfield—I cannot positively state the date—It was the last week of January, and either the last market-day, or the last but one in January—It was the mare in question—he bought if out of my hands—I had been bargaining with Jones for it, and he bought it over my head—I had bid 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and was very vexed at losing it—Jones asked 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, but the market was fast closing, and I thought he would he would take less—the prisoner came and asked the price of it—I said, "I am bargaining for it, and as a tradesman, I hope you will let me have the advantage of it"—he said, "Oh no," and he bid 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I had seen Jones with it, I should think two hours before—I never knew him before—I did not see the receipt given—I was not before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>for the prisoner, and I drove for him all throught January and February—on a Friday, at the latter end of January, I recollect his coming with this brown mare—It was driven about in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I drove it constantly myself—he drove it in the day-time and I at night—I remember on the 22nd of December; the prisoner had b been out himself that day with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he came home about seven o'clock in the evening with his own <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, which was a yellow one—on his coming home I changed the horse and took the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> our for the night—I do not exactly recollect the date, but that very night I was on the stand that it was lost from, and heard the loss mentioned.</p>

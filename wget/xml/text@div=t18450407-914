               <p>with Bradshaw and Lowe to a house in Pump-court, Perkins-rents, West<lb></lb>minster, about twelve o'clock in the day—I went up to the room on the second floor—I burst the door open, and turned my head to the left—I saw Vivian sitting with his face towards me, and Dunnett with his back towards me, and whether Davis was sitting or not I cannot swear, but no sooner had I entered the room than I saw Vivian with a lump of white stuff in his hand—I made towards him, and the instant he saw me he went on his knees, put his hands between his knees and crushed the substance in his hands—his hands immediately went into a tub of water that stood close to him—I considered what he had in his hand was plaster of Paris—I cannot exactly say that what I produce is the remnants of what be crushed—I got him off his knees and kicked the tub over—he said "Now, you b—s, you may do your best or do what you like"—I got the handcuffs on him after a violent struggle, and during the time we were struggling I saw Dunnett and Davis against the fire-place—both of them threw something into the fire-place which I considered to be coin—I heard it fall in, and I saw coin about the floor—they stood close together at the time—I picked up this coin—part was on the floor, and part I took off the fire—I took this spoon off the fire, and the metal that is in it was then melted—I produce six table spoons which I took off the table—they were lying close together—I found in the cupboard a jar of plaster of Paris, and some metal under the grate which I produce.</p>

Having satisfied him that I was not, he offered his assistance to instruct me, and, consenting to his scheme, I became his victim. He came to my place and made the mould, and assisted in making the coin; he left me, promising to return in two hours, but instead of his returning some officers in disguise burst open my door, and secured me. Dunnett had not been in the room more than ten minutes; I was about having my dinner and asked him to partake with me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Page, of Westmoreland-street, Mary-le-bonne, and take in mangling—on Wednesday, 13th August, I put two bundles near the window, containing 3 chemises, 1 shirt, 7 towels, 1 patch-work quilt, and other articles which I had mangled, and which were to go home—they were safe at half-past 12—the window was shut down, but there was no fastening to it—I went to bed—I awoke at half-past 6, and found the window open and the things taken away—I have never seen them since.</p>

I am the wife of James Foley, of Little Chesterfield-street, not many yards from Mrs. Page—on the morning that I heard of this in the evening, I saw the prisoner coming out of our yard with two bundles; a piece of a patch-work quilt was hanging out of one of them—he could not get from that yard to Mrs. Page's house, but my street door was open, and I suppose he went through—my husband asked him what brought him there—he said that he was going to the back entrance—my husband let him go away, and then followed him, and told him that he had stolen the things, but I told my husband to let him go, as I had seen him with things before, and he did so.</p>

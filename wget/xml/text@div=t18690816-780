I live at 15, Mulgrave Place—on Sunday night, 4th July, I met the prisoner in Artillery Place—he went home with me—about 6 in the morning, when I awoke, I saw him leaving the room with my chain in his hand; I called for assistance, but he vanished—I met him again on the 18th, the worse for drink—he said, "Are you coming home?"—I recog<lb></lb>nized him, and said "Yes"—he said, "Will you fetch some beer?"—I said "Yes," but instead of going for the beer I got a policeman and gave him in charge—the value of the things I lost is about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and there was 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—when the policeman charged him, he said "Oh!"—this chain and ring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine—I also lost my watch and a cross.</p>

About 11 o'clock on the night of the 18th, the prosecutrix spoke to me—I went with her to a house, and took the prisoner into custody—he was dressed in civilian's clothes, and was lying on the bed, very drunk—I asked if he knew anything of the charge—he said, "No"—he was very violent—I had to get assistance to get him to the station—I searched him there by main force, but only found things belong<lb></lb>ing to himself—I gave information at the barracks, and searched his quarters next morning, and, on the top shelf of a dresser, I found the chain and ring produced.</p>

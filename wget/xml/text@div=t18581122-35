                  </hi>. I formerly resided at 5, York-street, Westminster; I have since removed—I was living there with my wife at the time in question—we occupied the second floor front and back—there are four rooms on a floor, and I had a front and a back room—I knew the prisoner—he did not go by any other name than Isaac Harmond in the house, but out of doors I have heard him called by the name of "Bandy"—a woman lived with him as his wife—I always considered her as Mrs. Harmond—they occupied a back room on the same floor as I lived. On the 15th September, about 5 o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in my own room at my work as a tailor—I heard the prisoner come in—I did not see him, but I heard him come up-stairs—as soon as he came up-stairs, I beard him inquire of Mrs. Clark, who lived in the front room adjoining mine, where his wife was—she told him she was out and she would go and look for her—she went out, and returned shortly afterwards and said she could not find her—upon that, the prisoner made use of threatening language towards her—he said, that when she came home he would do for her, and that he would stick a knife in her—he then went out and returned in a few minutes and commenced breaking the crockery in the room, and he said if she had</p>

                  </hi>. In September last I lived at 5, York-street, on the first floor front—I was in bed on the night in question—a woman came to my door and knocked—I got up and went out on the stairs—I went into the room of the person who called me, which is a back room, and looked out of the window—and when I came out again on to the stairs, I saw the prisoner coming down the stairs—I asked him where he was going—he told me that his wife had jumped out of the window—I asked him where he was to allow her to do so—he made no answer, but was going down—we were both going down together—we both went to the coach-house gate, and the prisoner pulled the bell twice—I think he rang it—I had not got hold of him—he came down the stairs quite quiet with me—he never offered to go away or to use the least resistance—I said we would go together—that he should wait till I accompanied him—we did both go down together and go to this gate, and he rang the bell—somebody at last opened the gate—we both went in, and found the deceased lying inside—while we were there the policeman came—the prisoner did not seem to offer any assistance to lift up the woman—I did not see who it was lifted her up—some person went to do so, and a party standing by called the prisoner a scoundrel, and said, "Why don't you make any effort to assist the poor woman now?"—upon that, he went across with the intention of assisting her up, but she was then in the other party's arms—I cannot say that the prisoner was the worse for drink; he may have been drinking, but I should have taken him to be sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker—I did live at 5, York-street, Westminster, in the first floor front—I was not at all acquainted with the prisoner or the deceased—on the night this happened, a few minutes after 10, I was undressing, preparing to go to bed, and I heard the prisoner, as I supposed (I had never seen him), and the deceased come in at the lower part of the house—she spoke to Mrs. Seton and said, "We are all drunk to-night"—they passed up-stairs past my room to their own room—I heard their footsteps, but did not see them—after they were in their own room I heard a great scuffling—their room is not directly over my head, but from the adjoining room I could hear them stir the fire occasionally and hear their footsteps for some two or three minutes—I think he had heavy shoes on—after some few minutes, and when I was undressed and going into bed, the noise ceased, and Mrs. Ward, who lives in the adjoining room to me, came up-stairs and went into her room—she had no sooner got into her room than she rushed out again, and came to my door, but it was locked—she did not say anything—she then ran into Mr. Seton's room, and I heard her say, "That fellow has thrown the woman out of window"—I then unlocked my door and ran out, and at that time the prisoner was coming down stairs, and Mr. Seton had got hold of him—he had stopped him, and said "Where are you going?"—the prisoner had a candle in his right hand, and he was without coat, hat, or shoes—Mrs. Ward ran out into the street to give an alarm—I laid hold of him by the left arm, took the candlestick out of his hand, and said, "You villain, what do you mean by throwing the woman out of window?"—he said, "How could I throw her out of the window, when the bed comes across the window?"—I said, "Why did you not prevent her?"—he replied, "Oh, give her a <hi rend="italic">leg up</hi>"—he turned his head on one side and said that in a muttering way—I told Seton to take care of him while I went up-stairs to put on my trousers—the prisoner said, "Old fellow, you need not be afraid, I am not going to run away"—I went into the first floor back room, looked out of the window with the candle, and saw the woman lying in the coach-yard of Mr. Fowler; and I gave an alarm; I called "Murder" three times—the coachman's wife then looked out of window and asked what was the matter—after slipping on my trousers I went down again, they had then got the gate open, and I saw the deceased—I said to the prisoner "This woman has never thrown herself out of window, had she done so she must have gone forwards"—apparently to me she had dropped in a perpendicular position, and her eye had caught the ornament of the lamp which projects about two feet from the wall, and her heel had grazed the abutment wall—her eye was torn up—she lay rather as though she had dropped than if she had made a spring out—the prisoner made no reply to what I said—he asked the</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Westminster Hospital—I remember the deceased being brought there on the night of 15th Sep<lb></lb>tember, about 11 o'clock—at that time she was in a state of complete insensibility—she had one long wound on the right side of the head—the scalp was torn right down to the ear—she was at that time apparently suf<lb></lb>fering from concussion of the brain—the extremities were competely paralyzed—she was put to bed, and I made a minute examination of her; it was only an external examination at that time—after she had been about an hour in the hospital she vomited a quantity of beer—I cannot say at all what quantity, because it was vomited at intervals—I did not perceive any spirits among the matter, only the smell of beer—vomiting is very frequently a concomitant of concussion of the brain—she became partially conscious after she had been in the hospital about two hours, I believe—on the fol<lb></lb>lowing morning she gave the name of Farrell as her name—she had previously given the name of Norton; that was about two hours after she was brought in, but she was not completely conscious at that time—I was not present upon, the first occasion when Mr. Paynter attended to take her deposition—I had seen her shortly before Mr. Paynter saw her, and she was</p>

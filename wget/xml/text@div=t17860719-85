               <p>Court to Prisoners. You have, if you have any knowledge of this business, had an escape which may be fortunate or unfortunate according as you make use of it hereafter; by this verdict you are now in a state of perfect security as to this robbery, you never can be called in question for it again, whatever evidence may appear against you, and whatever you yourselves shall admit concerning it; therefore if there are any of you that are disposed to make an attonement to the laws of your country, you may make any confession with perfect safety, and it will be a proof to the Court and your Country, that you mean to quit that lawless course of life.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. We never saw the coachman in our lives; we never saw him till we saw him at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Court. Let the three prisoners be detained till the call over, and kept separate.</p>
               <p>Court to the two Maid Servants. Do either of you know any thing of the coachman's being out early on the Monday morning? - No, Sir, we do not, we were both up together in the morning at two o'clock.</p>

            . I first saw the coachman about six as near as I can recollect in the kitchen; I cannot say whether he came down stairs; he did not come from the stable.</p>
               <p>Was the other door of the house open that morning? - I cannot say that it was.</p>
               <p>When you came down do you know whether the house doors were fast? - We came past the house door and it was shut, but we did not look to see whether it was fast.</p>
               <p>Can it be opened from the outside? - Not that door that goes into the house; there is a hasp that it cannot be opened on the outside; we washed in the kitchen next to that where the door was.</p>

               <p>Did you observe whether the door from the kichen was fast when you came down? - It was fast, I cannot recollect when it was open.</p>
               <p>Court to Footman. When did you first see the coachman? - We slept in different beds in the same room.</p>
               <p>On the Monday morning or the Sunday night was you disturbed? - I never waked on Sunday night till seven the next morning, nor on Saturday night; I heard nothing each night; I very seldom wake of a night; the coachman was up before me; the things were always in the stables with him; yesterday morning I was coming from London to Tottenham, I called at Mr. Armstrong's, and met Mr. Siddons, says he, how do you do, young man? I am glad to see you here again; says he, I wish I had thought on this affair, for on Monday morning after the robbery was committed, I met

I know the person of the coachman Skinner very well; I have known him four years; I saw him on the 26th of June, I got up about three in the morning to go on my duty, and I met him at half past three, it was quite light; I was quite nigh to him, within three yards; I bid him a good morning, and he bid me the same.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt that he was the man? - No, Sir, I cannot say that I have; I had no suspicion of him; I am sure it was

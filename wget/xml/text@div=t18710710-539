                  </hi>. I am a checker on the Midland Railway, at the goods station at the Victoria Docks—on 20th June, about 3 o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, I was on Tower Hill—I saw the two prisoners with a drunken sailor—I saw Holmes put her hand in his pocket, and take out a canvas bag—they gave him a shove, and he walked on—they went in another direction</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 123). Catell came to me, on 20th June, a little after 3 o'clock in the afternoon—he took me to a public-house, where I saw the two prisoners—he said he would give them in charge for robbing a sailor—he said "I saw Holmes put her hand in his pocket, and take out a canvas bag"—he said that loud enough for them to hear—I took them in custody—they said they were innocent of it; they did not do it—nothing connected with the robbery was found upon them—they were with another female—she was taken to the station, and charged, but there was no evidence to show she was with them, and she was discharged by the Magistrate—I saw the sailor about a quarter of an hour after the robbery—he was brought to the public-house—he was drunk—he was charged with being incapable, and was kept at the station-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Holmes' Defence.</hi> It is a very curious thing, if he saw me put my hand in the man's pocket, that he did not come across the road, and acquaint the sailor of me robbing him, and not allow me to go away. I am a licensed hawker, and sell watches. I went over to the sailor, who was with three sailors, and a female. I showed him the watch; he asked me how much I wanted for it, and I said "9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,"—he said "I will give you three half-crowns," and I agreed to take it He said "I will get it from my ship-mates;" they refused to give it to him. I asked for the watch back, and he would not give it me, and we went to a public-house. I had a great deal of trouble to get it back. I had not been in the public-house four minutes when the policeman came, and took me.</p>

               <p>I am a boiler to the last witness; as I was coming to work on the 21st August, about seven. I saw the prisoner's wife at a chandler's shop, says she, this is the way my husband robs his master, I am going to sell the soap, I took the soap which is the same that was at my master's house; the prisoner was called in and owned it.</p>

               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen, my wife was out late at night, in the morning we had some words, she said she would go and do something or other that would hang me before night; about two hours after I went to my work, this soap was brought and one piece had his stamp, he said it was his property. The beginning of May I bought a quarter of an hundred for my own use, and the 3d of August I bought one hundred weight for a friend, half of it was stamped, and the other half not; a little piece I kept for my own use, this is the very piece, I said I knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Seagrave. What did his master accuse him of? - Of taking the soap.</p>
               <p>Court. But taking it in what way? - Of stealing it, I believe he confessed that he did steal it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say that he stole it? - He said that he took it.</p>
               <p>Court to Whitchurch, Did he buy soap of you? - Yes; my Lord, and it was a different kind of soap.</p>

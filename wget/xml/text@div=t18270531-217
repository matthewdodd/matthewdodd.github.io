About a quarter to twelve o'clock I told him and some others not to take any lead, as there was a good deal about; on coming down-stairs afterwards I saw the prisoner with something resting on his arm; I asked him what it was - he said a bit of lead which he was going to take to get a drop of beer - I cautioned him not to take it out of the gate, as he would be stopped; some time after I stood near the gate, watching the men out, and while I was looking after another man, who had something, I missed sight of the prisoner; I ran out, and called out, "John, come back;" he was about thirty yards from the gate; I said, "It is of no use - you cannot pass out with property;" he said, "I hope you won't take me for this bit of lead;" I said he could not pass; he said he had no more, but I found two other pieces in his pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310091"></xptr>given the men permission to take any of this lead away? - A. Never; they often asked me, but I never would. I put the lead which I took from him, into a closet in the lobby at Carlton House, and it was lost, but I found part of it afterwards, and it has my mark on it - it is the same. I found two pieces in a water-closet; I swear it is what I found on him - he had it in a blue handkerchief, which was lost with it - it is now in my handkerchief, which is blue also. I found nine pieces on him, but I have only found five.</p>

            . I am a stone-mason, employed at Carlton House. On the morning of the 5th of April, at six o'clock, I cautioned the workmen not to take lead - the prisoner was there; I said if they took any, and I countenanced it, I should very likely be displaced; I went before the Justice the same evening. This lead is similar to what was produced; I saw Allensby find it in a drain in the front area; he said he thought it the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said nothing about a mark? - A. Not in my hearing.</p>

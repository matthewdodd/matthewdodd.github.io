            </rs>. He was a second time indicted on the Coroner's Inquisition for Manslaughter. Major Nortliffe depos'd, that on the 6th of Dec. himself, Mr. Olivant, Mr. Lewis, and some other Gentlemen, dined at Mr. Lewis's Lodgings, at Charing-Cross. After Dinner they went to Young Man's Coffee house and from thence to the Mitre Tavern, to take a Parting Glass; for Mr. Olivant (who was an Officer in General Evans's Regiment of Dragoons) was to go the next day for Dorchester. They drank pretty briskly, and all appeared friendly and pleasant. About 11 o'Clock, part of the Company went away, and only Mr. Olivant, Mr. Lewis and himself, were left together. Soon after they were gone, Mr. Lewis desired Mr. Olivant to pay him 53 l. that he ow'd him. Mr. Olivant express'd a Surprize, that his intimate Friend should, without giving him any previous Notice, make such a Demand, at a time, when it could not be thought, that he should have such a Sum about him; and added, that as he was obliged to go out of Town the next day, he could not possibly have Time to provide the Money; but he would either remitt the Sum to him when he came to the Regiment, or give him a Note for Value upon a Relation, payable in London. Neither of these Proposals would satisfy the Deceased for he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172501150006"></xptr> still insisted upon present Payment. He, this Evidence, then told him, that he himself would discharge the Debt the very next day, if Mr. Olivant would give him a Note to pay the same Sum at six Months after Date. To this they both acquiesced and appeared to be good Friends again. And then he, this Evidence, fell asleep, but was suddenly awaked by a Quarrel betwixt the other two. He looked up, and saw that the Deceased had left his Place, and was gone round the Table to Mr. Olivant, at whom he that instant made a Pass with his drawn Sword, which the other put by with his Hand, and by that means received a Wound. He got up to part them; but before he could effect it, they closed, and fell down, Mr. Lewis under Mr. Olivant; and then he saw Mr. Olivant's drawn Sword upon the Ground, which he did not see before.

             the Drawer depos'd that when Mr. Olivant, Mr. Lewis, and the other Gentlemen came, they all appeared to be very good Friends, and be spoke a Supper. About 12 o'Clock, he heard a Disturbance, ran up, and found the Deceased and Mr. Olivant upon the Ground, the former being undermost. He and the Major's Servant, who followed him, help'd 'em up, and then he ran for a Surgeon. At his Return, he found them in another Room. The Deceased was lying upon a Bed, and Mr. Olivant said to him, Dear Lewis, I am afraid you are a dying Man; My Life is at Stake. I beg you to speak what you know. Was not your Sword drawn first? The Deceased answered, Ay, Ay, I forgive you freely, and then killed Mr. Olivant. This Evidence farther said, that the Room in which the Misfortune happened, was very small, and except the Deceased had risen from his Seat, and gone round the Table to Mr. Olivant, it was hardly possible for them to have fallen together in the Place and Manner that he found them in.

And the Deceased answered as often, I forgive you. Mr Olivant's Left Hand was bloody. The Sword of the Deceased was produced in Court, and appeared to be stained with Blood.

The Deceased died about 8 o'Clock in the Evening, and that Wound was the Cause of his Death. Before he died, he said to Mr. Olivant, I forgive you.

               <p>Mr. Olivant in his Defence made no material Variation from the Account that Major Nortliffe had already given, but added, that when the Major was asleep, the Deceased started up from his Seat, drew his Sword, came round the Table, and push'd at him two or three times; and the Room being very narrow, and the Door opening inwards, he could not retreat without manifest Danger of his Life, which put him under a Necessity of defending himself, the Consequence of which proved very unhappy; tho' at the same time he was ignorant when or how the Deceased received the Wound. Dr. Furlong deposed, that after the Deceased was wounded, Mr. Olivant laid his Hand upon his Shoulder, and said, Lewis, Lewis, Was not you the Aggressor ? And the Deceased answer'd, I forgive you; 'twas all fair. Mrs. Carter at the Mitre Tavern depos'd, that coming into the Room where the Deceased lay wounded, Mr. Olivant said to the Company, Take Notice of what he says; and then turning to the Deceased, he said, Did not you draw first?

             deposed, that having known Mr. Olivant three Years, he had constantly found him to be a Person of a happy, peaceable Disposition, and far from being quarrelsome. General Evans gave Mr. Olivant the Character of an open, peaceable, generous Gentleman, one that was not backward in paying his just Debts; and that on the contrary, the Deceased was very turbulent, and subject to quarrel in his Drink, for which Reason he had desired him to dispose of his Commission. Col. Lanoe, in the Behalf of Mr. Olivant, deposed, that he knew him to be a Man of a pleasant, even Temper, and that the Deceased more the opposite Character, he frequently being (especially when in Drink ) very troublesome in the Regiment. Many other Persons of Distinction were ready to appear in Favour of Mr. Olivant; but the Court thought it unnecessary. <rs id="t17250115-49-verdict256" type="verdictDescription">

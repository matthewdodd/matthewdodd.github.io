                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, and live in Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square. I know the prisoner by sight—on the 21st of January he came to my shop, between nine and ten o'clock, and offered three small pieces of gold for sale, two flat pieces and one round piece of plated wire—I asked him how he came by them—he said he found them, and that he lived in Tottenham-street—I was going out to make inquiries, and saw a policeman opposite—I beckoned him, and he took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a working jeweller. The prisoner had been my errand-boy for about six weeks—I did not miss any gold wire till the policeman came, on the 21st of January—I then found a piece of gold and a piece of wire had been cut from pieces on my work-board—the wire had been used to make the border of a brooch—I missed about three quarters of an inch, but I cannot be certain as to the quantity—I had seen it safe the day before—this is the piece of wire, and these are the two flat pieces of gold—they are worth about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

Q.</hi> Will not bits of gold like these get into the sweep? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It will—pieces as large as these do fall into the sweep, but this piece of wire must have been cut off—I had seen it safe the day before—here is the piece it was cut from.</p>

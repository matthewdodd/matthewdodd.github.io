It is fenced in on every side. I have a pond there, which is about twenty yards long and about ten yards wide, in which I keep gold fish; and there are some tench too. My pond has been robbed divers times from last July to October. I knew nothing of the prisoner till he applied to me to sign a paper to prosecute rogues and villains, who he said were not fit to live. He was to raise them up to me; I knew nothing of them. He asked me if I would prosecute them, and wanted it under my hand. I told him I did not understand what he meant, for he did not care to tell me the names of those rogues and villains. I know nothing about his taking my fish, only I heard him confess it when he was examined before Mr. Townsend, and he offered to make me any restitution.</p>
               <p>Were there any promises made at that time in order to induce his confession? - None at all. He said he had robbed me, he had been through my fish pond twice in one night between July and October.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderman TOWNSEND sworn.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tulk sent to me on the 14th of November, and desired to speak with me. I went to her house. She told me her fish-pond had been robbed, and that she had a clue to find out the people who had robbed her; that I believe was on the 13th or 14th; that there was one Mitchel, a farmer in the neighbourhood, who had been concerned in it. I sent for Mitchell whilst I staid with Mrs. Tulk. He came, and from him I took down in writing information sufficient for me to grant warrants to apprehend Etherington and Sorrell, and a search-warrant against the prisoner, who was taken up for receiving the fish, but it came out afterwards that he had been guilty of stealing them. The officers found the prisoner; Etherington and Sorrell were not found that day, but they were brought before me the next. There were about twenty or twenty-five gold and silver fish brought, which the officers said they took out of a kind of back in the prisoner's yard; they had particular marks upon them. He was then sent back again that night, which was I believe the 14th or 15th, and brought the next day for further examination. Mrs. Tulk said, These are my fish, but where is my Neptune? a particular fish she called by that name. The next day Sorrell and Etherington were taken, and they were all brought together before me. There then came one Wright as a voluntary witness; he had been concerned in the matter. He charged the prisoner, before me, with being himself in the pond. Etherington and Sorrell were servants to the prisoner. Wright said that himself, Etherington, and Hundsdon came together at the latter end of July into Mrs. Tulk's garden; that the net, in going through the pond, was hung, it being a staked pond, and Hunsdon said to his man Etherington, Will, Will, go into the pond and unbang the net; that Etherington said he would not go in; upon which Hundson himself went into the pond twice. Hunsdon said he was in the pond. A great deal of conversation passed; they were refreshing one another's memory with the facts. Wright charged the prisoner with having bad his own share of the fish, and the prisoner said, No, I had not, I only chose for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178102220074"></xptr> Etherington. Etherington said, Yes, but you had the fish. No, says Hunsdon, You had them, and carried them as a present to such a person, naming some person in the Sheriff's-office. Etherington replied, No, you had all of them, I had none, I carried them with your compliments to such a person. Towards the close of the examination Hunsdon walked about by the side-board, and said, To be sure it is a sad affair, and we have all been guilty.</p>
               <p>Was the time mentioned when this net was hung in the pond? - None of them could fix the exact day; it was understood to be towards the end of July.</p>
               <p>When was the indictment found? - In December session. Hunsdon then moved to another part of the room, and came near Mrs. Tulk, and said, If the lady will forgive me, I will give her all her fish again, and those I bought at Walthamslow; he said he had bought some at nine shillings a brace, and would make her any other satisfaction that she desired. I told him it was a felony, and could not be compounded. I made out the warrants of commitment for them all, and Hunsdon made his escape. The other two were tried and convicted in December session.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Tulk. There were some live gold fish produced before Mr. Townsend, were there any marks by which you thought them to be your's? - Yes, upon a great many. I had had these fish a great many years. I believe they were mine, I had all the reason in the world to believe so. I used when I walked in the garden to feed them once or twice a day.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the fish you called Neptune produced? - No, that fish never appeared.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Mr. Alderman Townsend. When you asked me if I was ever in the pond, did I not say I will reserve that for another occasion? - He said that after what I have mentioned, but what I have mentioned he did say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said I gave nine shillings a brace for the fish? - He said he bought some at Walthamstow; and to the best of my remembrance he said he gave nine shillings a brace for them, and would give them to Mrs. Tulk, as well as her own fish again.</p>

               <p>I live in Moorfields. I am a sheriff's officer. About the latter end of July last, I went with the prisoner into a garden at the back of Tottenham. There were Hunsdon, Etherington, and one James, a gardener; Sorrell was not there then. We had a casting net. The prisoner and we dragged the pond with it, and we took twenty-three or twenty four fish; there were some of them brown.</p>
               <p>At what time was you there? - About twelve or one o'clock; it was a lightish night. The fish were shared when we got to Hunsdon's house. The net was hung once or twice; Hunsdon undressed himself and went in and undid it.</p>
               <p>You are sure this was about the latter end of July last? - Yes, but I cannot recollect the day.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - Four or five years.</p>
               <p>Does not he buy fish? - He bought some one time.</p>
               <p>Does not he sell fish? - I cannot say that he does.</p>
               <p>Did he not buy some about this time? - He did somewhere about this time of a man at Walthamstow.</p>
               <p>I understand you were concerned with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon what terms are you admitted evidence? - I came and resigned myself voluntarily, and gave an information against him.</p>
               <p>I suppose it was upon a promise that you was not to be prosecuted? - No promise at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether Etherington did not tell you it was in a field that he was going to catch fish? - He did not say so before I went, or I should not have gone.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to you to be a garden? - It did when I got there.</p>

               <p>Did he own several facts from July till the beginning of October? - Yes; and told where he had made presents of some of them. I went and fetched six or seven from Mr. Cater's, in Ely-Place, and restored them to Mrs. Tulk.</p>

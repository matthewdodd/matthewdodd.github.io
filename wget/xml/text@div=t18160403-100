            . I keep a chandler's shop, in Clement's-lane. I remember the two prisoners coming into my shop on the 11th of March; they came for a two-penny loaf, with which I served them; they gave me a three-shilling token, which I put into the till, and gave them the change; there was only another three-shilling-token in the till at the time.</p>

               <p>ROBERT KING. I am a publican, and keep the White Swan in Drury-lane. I remember the two prisoners at the bar coming to my house at about seven o'clock in the evening of the 11th of March; they came for a pot of porter; I served them myself, and two officers, Mackay, and another came in, and gave me some information. Then I went to the prisoners for payment; they were both drinking together; Smith gave me a three-shilling piece; I shewed it to Mackay, and he desired me to mark it, and I did mark it. (Three-shilling token produced to witness.) That is the one.</p>

            . I watched the prisoners at the bar, in company with another man, from the Wheatsheaf, in Drury-lane, to Clement's-lane; they went into Moore's, and on coming out Smith said come along, it is all right; then they made the best of their way into Lincoln's-inn-fields, they ran across the fields, and when they got into Holborn, they walked quietly. I then followed them to the White Swan, and Johnson and I remained outside; then one came out, and Johnson followed him, and I went into the house; it was the third man that came out. I took the prisoner's into custody; I searched them, and on Smith I found a good one shilling and sixpenny piece; then I searched Hawkins, and found three tokens counterfeit, with paper between them. I asked Hawkins where he got them, and he said he took them in change.</p>

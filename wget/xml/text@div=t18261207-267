I was going up Ludgate-hill on the 8th of December, a little before ten o'clock; the prisoner overtook me, and when I had reached the corner of Creed-lane, some person walking before us dropped a pin-case - and then the prisoner (or some person very much like him) stooped and said he had found something, and he would have a bit of fun with the person who dropped it - he thought he was a tailor, and he would bother him a bit by taking the needles out and putting in a pin; I advised him to do nothing of the sort, but to return it to the person with the needles in it, but he persisted in putting his plan into execution; I did not see what he did with it, but he called to the person before, and asked if he had lost any thing; he said, Yes - he had lost a needle-case; he said, "What is there in it?" the man said, "There is a needle;" the prisoner said, "Are you sure there was a needle in it?" the man said, Yes; the prisoner said, "I will bet you three cups of coffee there is not;" he said he would bet him a 5l. note of it; the prisoner said, "No, I will not bet 5l., I will bet you three cups of coffee;" the other said, "No, I will not bet so small a sum as that - I will bet 5l.; and he said he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070098"></xptr>believed the prisoner had no money in his pocket to bet with; I advised the man not to bet his 5l. with the prisoner, as I thought the prisoner had changed it - the man got very violent, because I interfered - and said he believed I had no money in my pocket; I was a little off my guard, and was induced to bet the 5l. wager; we stopped at the end of <placeName id="t18261207-267-crimeloc1552">Creed-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You were pretty sure you should win? A. Yes - I did not intend to pocket his 5l.; I should not have kept it if I had won. I swear that - I am clerk to Mr. Downes - it was his note; I cannot swear the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you in the King's Bench or the Fleet? A. The Fleet - I have had no quarrel with the prisoner; I have had his sister in prison for robbing me - she was tried in this Court, I believe, two Sessions ago; she was a servant of mine - I have no wife - the prisoner did not sleep at my house while I was in confinement, nor for two or three months before; he had slept at my house, in the same room as I did - there was one bed in that room, but occasionally there was one made for him; his sister slept with me.</p>

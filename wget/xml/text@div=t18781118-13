I am employed at the Horseshoe Yard, Brook Street, and live at Clapham—I was at the Hare and Hounds public-house, and I saw the prisoner tender the second florin—he said that he had not sufficient to pay for the liquor, and a stableman by his side from Mr. Doller's opposite paid for it—it was three-halfpence—the coin was handed back to him and he put it in his pocket—I saw it tested and heard the barmaid tell him it was bad—in consequence of this I followed him and saw him pass across Bond Street, by Mr. Thomas the silversmith's—he joined two other men sitting on the railings, and I heard them talking together—they all went a short distance, when the third party remained on that side, and the prisoner and the other party passed along to Brook Street, and turned the corner—I saw a constable and spoke to him—I then saw the prisoner and the other man go into the White Lion—I went in afterwards and saw the prisoner in the parlour, and the other man standing in the front bar.</p>

On the night of 21ST October I saw the prisoner and two other men in Brook Street—they joined at the corner opposite South Moulton Street, very close to the White Lion, and went in the direction of Claridge's Hotel—the landlord of the White Lion came out and gave the prisoner in custody for uttering counterfeit coin—I took him into the house, searched him, and found this counterfeit florin on him, and the landlord gave me this broken one—I also found on him fourteenpenoe in coppers, a shilling in silver, and a pipe—he gave his address 9, Lee Street, Bed Lion Square—I went there the same evening and saw a Mrs. Clibbon, who pointed out the front parlour to me—I searched the place and found this florin under a shoemaker's workbox—I previously took the prisoner to the Hare and Hounds.</p>

I keep the Yorkshire Grey, Eagle Street, Holborn—the prisoner came there about nine weeks ago—my son who was serving at the bar handed me a bad florin in the prisoner's presence—I put it in the tester, found it was bad, I passed it back to the prisoner, and said, "This won't do for me"—he said, "I took it from my master; don't disfigure it, because I can get it changed by the <hi rend="italic">governor</hi>"—there was another <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi> in the bar, the prisoner's landlord I believe; he said, "I will pay for your drinks"—it was about four pennyworth—I told the prisoner I always destroyed such coins so that they should not be passed to any one else, and I did so and threw it on the counter—he did not deny having uttered it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger at No. 37, Cannon Street, City. On the night of 2nd July, about 10 o'clock, I was in Cannon Street—the female prisoner spoke to me; I tarried with her a little while, or rather she accompanied me towards Suffolk Lane—she then asked me some question, which I answered, and stood for a little while, and when I was moving off I found that my watch was gone; it had a ribbon and seal attached to it—I saw her darting down Suffolk Lane—I tried to follow her, and immediately found that there was a man trying to trip me up—I could not recognize the man; there were two, one was behind me and the other in front; the one who tried to trip me up first did not manage it; the second succeeded, and I fell—I did not observe the features of the men, but the male prisoner is, I think, about the stature of one of them—I got up again at once, and followed the woman.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 477). About half past 10 o'clock on 2nd July, I was on duty in Suffolk Lane, and saw the female prisoner in company with the prosecutor—I saw a man standing near them—I watched them—I saw the male prisoner come down Laurence Pountney Hill, turn to the right into Suffolk Lane, pass close by the prisoner and prosecutor, and place himself on the opposite side of the way, close by another man, who was waiting there previously; be stood there a few minutes; she coughed twice, and the man not in custody rushed over towards the prosecutor, and tried to trip him up; he did not succeed, and then the male prisoner went and tripped him up, and put him on the ground—I sang out to the prosecutor as the woman darted away and the other man turned round the corner to the right, "You follow those two, and I will follow the other one"—the male prisoner ran down Suffolk Lane, and I secured him at the bottom; I never lost sight of him—he asked what I wanted him for—I said, "For assaulting a gentleman at the top of the lane, and robbing him," I expected—he was rather violent, and I drew my truncheon, and said, "If you resist, I shall use my truncheon."</p>

I am an artificial flo<lb></lb>rist, and live at No. 2, Drury-lane—in the year 1840 I had 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the savings-bank—in July, that year, my wife was in a bad state of health, and in consequence of medical advice I found it necessary to separate from her, and went and took a situation as French teacher at Mr. Mummery's school at Homerton—in February, 1840, I sent a blank piece of paper with ray signature to it, for a person named Clavery, at Paris, to settle a business—I addressed it to my wife in Paris—that blank signa<lb></lb>ture had no reference to any monies I had in the savings-bank—I became acquainted with the prisoner in June, 1840, at my house—he was intro<lb></lb>duced to me by Madame Saving, an artificial flower maker, where my wife superintended the work, and where she was taken ill—the prisoner told me he was cashier at Savin's—I was in the habit of coming from Homer<lb></lb>ton to see my wife about once in every ten days—she was lodging at 29, Firth-street, Soho—the prisoner knew very well that I had 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one bank, and 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in another, and that it was for the purpose of paying different tradesmen, washerwomen, doctors and other things for my wife's use—he used to come and ask how my wife was going on—while I was at Homerton I had occasion to look for my savings-bank book and it was missing—at that time I had 24/. in the savings-bank—I inquired of my wife about it—I had no idea at that time that my 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was taken out of the bank—I had never given authority to my wife, or any one else to take the money out of the bank—I first ascertained that it was gone out of the bank in December, 1840—my wife said she had taken the money and dis<lb></lb>tributed it—I inquired of her what she had done with it—she cried and made no answer—after a long time she made a disclosure affecting here self and the prisoner—it was in July last—the prisoner was not then arrested for debt—I consulted an attorney, and afterwards took the advice of Coun<lb></lb>sel—I told Mr. Lewis, my solicitor, to take him into custody, but he arrested him on his own account—he was afterwards in Whitecross-street—I had no reason to believe, until July last, that the prisoner had misconducted him<lb></lb>self</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever propose going into partnership with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was he who said, "Let us go into partnership"—perhaps I might have said so, because the prisoner told me he was about marrying his landlord's sitter, who would bring him about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never said I could procure 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go into partnership with him—he came to me several times while I was at Homerton, and said he had job goods to buy, by which 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. profit could be made—I partly consented to advance the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did agree to advance it—I paid 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner gave me bills for it—I did not advance 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. first—I advanced 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. all in one sum—I bought the goods for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and sold them to the prisoner for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me bills of long dates in payment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received by the prisoner on your authority as part payment of that 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—I never told the prisoner that he had already had 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from my wife from the savings-bank, part of the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it lever made any part of the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swear that—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—this is my handwriting.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you prepared now to swear that you paid the whole 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one sum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I paid to Mr. Savin 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards, which makes 81<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mr. Savin will tell you so.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you refer to in that letter, the 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you had in the savings bank, and which was obtained by forging your name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was this 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I did not believe she was obliged to make a forgery to get it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing your wife had got the 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the Bank by any means short of forgery, did you then refer him to her to get the 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to make up the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—they made some story, and I answered them—I cannot recollect whether I got the bills for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the prisoner after I wrote this letter—when I wrote this letter I knew ay wife had got the money from the savings-bank, but I was not aware the had committed a forgery to get it, or that the prisoner had aided her in committing it—the bills for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are in the hands of Mr. Lewis, the soli<lb></lb>citor—I gave the prisoner 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides that referred to in the letter, as con<lb></lb>sideration for the bills for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot recollect when—it was after I wrote this letter—it was on the guarantee of a person named Rufel—I have had other transactions with the prisoner besides that of the 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have dealt together—the bills for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were renewed when they be<lb></lb>came due, and on their being renewed I delivered the old ones up to the prisoner—he never paid one farthing on the renewed bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you oppose the prisoner's discharge under the Insolvent act? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did what my solicitor advised me to do, and it was him did it—it was as the holder of the renewed bills for 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why was not Madame Bailey examined on that occasion on the same subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe she might have been examined—I do not know the laws of England, but it appeared that the Court declared itself incompetent—I preferred the bill before the Grand Jury the first Session after that—Mr. Lewis did all the proceedings—I did not stay till the last day of the Session before I took out a warrant—I do not know—I believe the prisoner was to have been arrested the very same day the warrant was issued.</p>

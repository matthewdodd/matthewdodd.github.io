On the 4th of August, a little before two o'clock, I put a sovereign into a box in the bar, and in the evening, at eight, I missed it. I sent for an officer, who came and found the sovereign on her.

            . I was sent for, about nine o'clock, to search the prisoner. She resisted violently, and I was forced to tie her hands. When I got her to the watch-house she contrived, with her left hand, to drop her pocket; I took it up, and asked her if it was her's; she said it was not; I opened it, and found a sovereign, a sixpence, and some copper in it. On the following morning, before the Magistrate, she acknowledged it was her pocket; she said the sixpence was his and the sovereign, but she knew nothing about the copper.</p>

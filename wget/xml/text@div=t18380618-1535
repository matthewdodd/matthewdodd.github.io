                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Little Corim-street Russell-square. On the 3rd of May I had finished a job in the country, and was returning to my lodging, with four sovereigns which I had re<lb></lb>ceived—the prisoners accosted me in Thorney-street, St. Giles, and Beaz<lb></lb>ley said they had a penny, and if they had another they could get a pint of beer, for they had had nothing since the morning—I had known them by sight before, but never spoke to them—I took them to a shop in Broad-street, St. Giles's, and changed a sovereign—I treated them to some gin and bitters, and then to some shell-fish—I spent 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was with them about three quarters of an hour—I took out my purse to pay and the landlord gave me half a sovereign and the silver, which they saw me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183806180093"></xptr>
               <p>put into a purse in my trowser's pocket—after treating them again I was going home towards my lodging, and coming up Thorney-street again, they swore I should not leave them unless I gave them some money—I then put the purse into my coat pocket and buttoned it up—Rowley seized me, threw the flap of my coat up, and Beazley opened it, put her hand in to the pocket, took it out, and they ran away—a man stopped me and asked if they had robbed me, and said, "It is no use, you will not catch them"—that detained me and they escaped—I gave information to the police, and next morning Rowley was taken up—she had held me while Beazley put her had into my pocket and took the money—Rowley was remanded for a fortnight, and Beazley was afterwards taken—I have not a doubt about their persons—I have seen them together frequently for years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Wednesday, the 30th of May, I saw the two prisoners in company with the prosecutor going into a public house in Broad-street—next morning the prosecutor told me what had occurred in George-street—I took Rowley into custody—she was remanded for a fortnight—I could not find Beazley, and at the end of the fortnight, Rowley was discharged, that I might find her companion, and in three days I took them both together.</p>

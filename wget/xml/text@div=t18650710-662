                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, at 2, High-street, Lower Homerton—about nine o'clock on Monday, 5th June, I was near the Marsh<lb></lb>gate, Lower Homerton, with my wife—I heard a child cry, looked round, and saw the prisoner pushing a child through a railing into some water—the child was very restive and prevented her—the railing was about four feet high, it was only one rail—the ditch was bounded by a rail—the witness Paul was watching her, and she rushed a few yards further and again made another attempt, but he knocked her down—I instantly rushed up, and took the</p>

               <p>child from her arms, and Paul took the child she was about to push into the water—I asked the prisoner the reason why she wished to do away with her children—she said that her husband was very unkind to her, spend<lb></lb>ing his money in drink, and frequently ill-using her—she said, "You have prevented me now, but there are more chances than one"—she said she intended to drown her children and then herself—she had a fearful black eye, and her nose was cut severely across—she asked me to accompany her home, and I went to her house in Pickle's-buildings, which is close by, within ten minutes' walk—the children were taken up with her—I went into her house, and she had a remarkably clean house—I went for a constable—it was about nine then.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Abbey-street, Bethnal-green-road—on the night of Whit-Monday, 5th June, about nine, I was near the Marsh-gate, and saw the prisoner with the child she has in her arms and another one which she was leading, and she made an attempt to shove it under the railings—I told her to go home and turned her away from there—she said she would do it, and she went about a dozen yards further and made another attempt—I then gave her a shove and she fell down, and the children were taken from her—some more people came up, and she was taken away—she said she meant to drown them and herself.</p>

On the night of Whit-Monday I met the witness Walker in the street, and went to the prisoner's house with him—I said to the prisoner, "You are charged with attempting to destroy your child, I shall apprehend you"—she said, "Make no mistake, if the young man had not prevented me, I meant to drown the child and myself too"—at the station-house she said, "I should think you are not such a fool as to take notice of me; although I said it, I did not mean to do it, I thought it would have some effect in frightening my old man, as he has been ill-using me."</p>

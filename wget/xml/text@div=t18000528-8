I was with Armstrong: I went up into the garret, and behind the door, upon the right-hand, was a turning lathe, to smoothe the edges, and a great deal of file-dust; upon the right of the lathe, in a corner, was this cutting engine, which was placed upon a sack, and a soldier's jacket, it had the appearance as though it had recently been at work; some of these bars of metal were laying down by the side of the engine; I saw Mr. Armstrong find a paper of blanks in the cupboard in the same room; over the door, I found two blanks of the size of a sixpence, they had not been coloured; and two more blanks of the size of shillings; and then I found a bottle with two of three drops of aqua-fortis in it; and behind a skirting-board I found three more blanks; I observed the prisoner's hands to be all over dirt, as if he had been at work; there were files, and scowering-paper, and all the things that have been produced.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner lodged in my house at the time he was apprehended, he had the two pair of stairs and garret; he said he was a brass-turner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever learn from him, or make any inquiry of him, in what particular branch of that business he was? - A. I asked him what branch of that trade he was in, and he told me in the lamp way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any work carried out from there? - A. No, I never saw any work go out or come in; the master used to come sometimes, and seemed angry because he was not at home to mind his business, that there was some piece of work in hand that was wanted.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Is not that engine used in the lamp way? - A. I believe not; I have been all over the factories at Birmingham, and they work with a stamp upon the stump of a tree, without a fly at all.</p>

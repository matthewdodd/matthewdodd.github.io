                  </hi>. I am a maltster and brewer of Stamford-bridge, Fulham. On 20th February, between eleven and twelve in the day, I came home and found the prisoner in my parlour—I begged him to go out over and over again—he said he would go when he liked—I walked out of the beer-shop, and put my hand on him to put him out gently—I used as little violence as I could—he</p>

               <p>stood at the gate outside, about four feet from the door, and said he would come in again, he would come in when he liked—I told him if he did I would certainly put him out again—as he went out at the gate, his left heel caught the gate-post and that threw him on his right side—he then pulled a knife out and scraped the dirt off his arm—he still kept saying he would come in—I stood at my door and said, "If you do, I shall put you out again—he then reversed the knife—I made a step over the cill of my door with one foot, and he struck me right down <hi rend="italic">athwart</hi> my nose with hit right hand—it was very much cut—I was taken to the hospital, and they thought I should bleed to death—I am still an out-patient.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner scraping his coat with the knife, and saw him walk into Mr. Hester's house after he told him he should not come in—he kept scraping his clothes with the knife—Mr. Hester went in, and as he came to the bar-door the prisoner walked towards the middle of the bar in the passage, and Mr. Hester went to order him out again, and he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his knife and struck him across the face—he bled very violently—I went and took the knife from the prisoner.</p>

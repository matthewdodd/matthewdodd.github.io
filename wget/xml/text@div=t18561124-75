                  </hi>. I live at No. 15, Paradise-row, Rotherhithe, and am a labourer employed in the Victualling Yard, Deptford; the prisoners are em<lb></lb>ployed there. On Tuesday, 28th Oct, I was employed in carrying some jars of chloride of zinc from the wharf to the surgery in the yard—the prisoners were employed in carrying bundles of different things from the wharf to the stores in a barrow—I saw Williams carrying a bale marked "silk hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs" in a barrow, about 10 o'clock in the morning—he went in under an archway, which was out of the way to the stores—he met King there—King took some silk handkerchiefs from the bale, and put them into his smock—Williams was holding the barrow at the time—I was about half-a-dozen yards from them—King went to the cooperage, and Williams went to the stores with the bale, and then returned to the wharf—in about a quarter of an hour Williams took a bale of stockings under the archway, and I saw him put his hand into the bale, and take out five stockings—King and Day met him there—Williams kept one pair, and Day and King tossed up to</p>

               <p>see which was to have the other pair and the odd one—King got the pair, and Day had the odd one—the bales had come from the <hi rend="italic">Lion</hi>, a vessel which was unloading—after she was unloaded, at about a quarter to 11 o'clock, I went to the cooperage, and saw the four prisoners there—we took down some casks from the wharf, and I could see the four go together under the old buildings—King gave Day two handkerchiefs, and he asked for the odd one—King then gave Keeble two more—I do not think they saw me—I came away, and met King as he came away and was coming up to the wharf, and asked him what he had done with the handkerchiefs—he said that he gave them all away but two, which he kept for himself—I told him that I must report him—he said that that would do me no good—I said that I did not care—I afterwards met Williams and King together, and told Williams the same—he told me that I was a d—rogue, and it was most time I should leave the gang, and go and work in the mustard mill—on the same morning, I asked Williams how many stockings he took—he said, "Only one"—I gave information to the foreman that might when I stopped work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the labourers in the victualling yard, Deptford. On 28th Oct., the prisoners were employed there, and after dinner I heard Ryan accusing Williams of something, but could not under<lb></lb>stand what he meant; and I afterwards asked him, but not in Williams's presence—Ryan gave me some information in the evening, and I went to Keehle's lodging, and told him I had been informed that he had taken some silk handkerchiefs from the bale that had been landed, he made no answer—I said, "It is no use your denying it, I have a witness to prove that you did take them"—he said, "I have one which I bought of King, and was to give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—he told me I could take it if I liked—I said, "You can bring it in the morning," and in the morning he brought it, and I told him to come with me to Mr. Bean, the foreman of the stores, and give it up to him—on the evening of the same day I asked King to go with me from Lord Kingston's house; having called him out, I said, "King, you have made a very bad job of this"—he asked me what I meant—I said, "By taking the handkerchiefs from the bale to-day"—he said that he did not know anything of it—I said, "It is no use your denying it, for I have a witness to prove that you did take them"—Keeble then said, "King, it is no use your denying, it, for you know you sold me the handkerchief for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—King said, "I sold it you, but there was no money received"—these stores came from the ship <hi rend="italic">Speagle</hi>, from Sheerness.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I live at No. 31, Searle's-terrace, Victoria-road, Deptford, I am foreman of the stores. On the morning of 20th Oct., I was raising a quantity of stores from a vessel, and the prisoners were employed in removing them—I received part of a bale containing black silk handker-chiefs—I did not see who brought it, but Williams acknowledged to me that he was the person that brought it to the stores—it was rather unsewn on one side, and I made a complaint as to it's state—on the following morning, Keeble brought me a black silk handkerchief, of the same description as we generally pack in the bales—he said that he had purchased</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185611240087"></xptr>
               <p>it of King, and was to pay him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I put a mark ou it—I have compared it with the contents of the bale, and it corresponds—the purser charges fifty-five handkerchiefs, the bale actually contained thirty-one, and this one would make thirty-two—in the course of the same day, a bale containing stockings was brought into store; there was a small hole in the wrapper of about four inches, large enough to get a hand in; it might be torn or worn out—I examined the bale, it contained 143 pairs, and one odd one; the purser charges 118—the handkerchiefs are packed in eight dozens, and four put into a bale—they were return stores—Williams said that he brought that package, but that there was another wrapper over it—that was within a few minutes after the package was delivered, when I made the complaint—I complained to stagg in Williams's presence, and he acknowledged that he brought the package into the store, but that it had a wrapper over it—I have seen the wrapper since, it was on the floor alongside the package.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many men were moving the packages? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ten or twelve—there was only one package of silk handkerchiefs—if I had found 118 pairs of stockings in this bale I should have thought it was all right—I found 143 pairs, and one odd one—you cannot depend upon the accuracy of the account given—fifty-five handkerchiefs are charged—I had that account in the same way—the bales are always covered with wrappers, the mark telling the contents is on the outside—I saw the principal part of the bales brought into the stores, but did not see the damaged one brought in—the man in charge did not allow Day to go away till he had shown it to me—he is not here—he is the man who received it from whoever carried, it there—I spoke about it immediately afterwards—I went with Day—Williams acknowledged that he had carried it, but that the wrapper was upon it—bales are sometimes damaged a good deal—I do not know whether this has been to the Crimea—there are very often sales of these things by auction—handkerchiefs had been sold a month or five weeks before, but I cannot say exactly—it sometimes happens that the bales are so damaged that the contents are found in the hold of the ship—it had been a very foggy day the first part of the morning, but it had cleared off partially between 10 and 11 o'clock—I know the arch; it is, perhaps, forty yards from the slide—if you are standing at the slide, you can see to the centre of the arch; you can see through it, but not through part of it if you are not in a right line with it—workmen pass and repass through it; it is large enough for carts and waggons to go through.</p>

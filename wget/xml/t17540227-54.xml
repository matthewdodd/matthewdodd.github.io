I saw him drink out of the tankard after all were gone. I was in the kitchen about my business when he went away; but I went into the tap-room in about a minute after he was gone, and then the tankard was missing. I had not been gone out of the taproom five minutes from him.</p>

            . I am a soldier, and was at the Prosecutor's house the night the tankard was lost. There was the Prisoner in a little box in the tap-room, and a silver tankard stood by him: he sent me out for a pound of beef-stakes, and gave me four pence to pay for them. I went out about ten minutes, and when I returned, he and the tankard were gone, and had not paid his reckoning. I ran out to see for him, but could not meet with him.</p>

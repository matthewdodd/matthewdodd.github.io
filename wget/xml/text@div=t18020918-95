               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had a misfortune, and was obliged to pawn my things; she asked me what I had done with my things; I said I had pawned them; she said I had better bring my duplicates there, and she would get them out for me; she gave me this money to fetch them out, and I was to work it out.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Fitzgerall). Is there any truth in that? - A. No; I was so poor myself, I was obliged to pawn some of my own things.</p>

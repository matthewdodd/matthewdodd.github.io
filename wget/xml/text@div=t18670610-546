                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman D</hi> 222). About one o'clock on Saturday morning, 24th May, I saw the two male prisoners in the Windsor Castle public-house before it was closed—they left and went down the Edgware Road, and turned to the right towards Maida Hill; knowing that was not their direct way home, I followed them—they stopped in front of Lyon Terrace, before the prosecutor's house—I passed them some short distance, looked back, and saw they were following me—I turned down Maida Hill West—I saw them come and look after me, they then turned back again and I lost sight of them—about a quarter to two I went down the Edg<lb></lb>ware Road, and saw all three of the prisoners in the Edgware Road, oppo<lb></lb>site the Metropolitan Music Hall—the female said to the others, "Now, are you coming, or I shall go without you?"—they all three joined together and went to Maida Hill again—I followed them—they stopped in front of Lyon Terrace, the prosecutor's house—I stopped also—I lost sight of the two men—they went into the garden in front of the house—I suppose the female stood outside on the pavement, watching—some person came by who I suppose disturbed them, and they left the house and came together on the pavement out of the garden; they then parted—the female went towards Kilburn and the two men towards Hyde Park—the female went up towards Maida Hill, then crossed over the road on to the same side that I was, and came past me, and as she caught sight of me she went "Hush! hush!"—James said, "What is the matter?"—they all three joined together, and James came back a short distance to see who I was (I was in plain clothes), and then all three joined together and went away—I did not suppose they had done what they had, and I could not see a uniform man at the time—I got the assistance of 63 D as soon as I could find him, and went to 11, Lyon Terrace—I saw this piece of moreen lying on the ledge outside—the window was shut down in its proper place—I then called up the inmates—there was a slight scratch on the window as if done by a finger-nail, or something of that kind—I afterwards went to Collins's lodgings—I told her I should take her into custody—she said, "What for?"—I said, "For</p>

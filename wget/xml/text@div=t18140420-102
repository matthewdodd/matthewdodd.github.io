            . I live in Virginia-row, Bethnal-green. On the 27th of February, I was going up Shoreditch, I met the prisoner and another girl; they asked me to go home with them. I went with them as far as the Angel; when we came there I had no money in my pocket; they could not agree with me. The other girl that was with the prisoner went with me to my lodging. I took one of them to my lodging; the other followed her; and when I went to get a pot of beer I was robbed of two pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no two pound ten shillings in the indictment - A. Here is the gown I found on her back; it is my wife's gown. I went to the prisoner's lodging on the 7th of March; I saw the gown laying on her bed; she took me out of doors. I staid on the stairs about an hour. I went into her room again; the gown was taken off the bed, and she swore to me that she had only a black gown. On the next Sunday night I found my wife's gown on the prisoner's back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the prisoner home with you - A. No, her partner. The prisoner could not take the gown; her partner took it. It is my wife's gown; she is alive.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop in Hoxton-square. The prisoner and three other persons came to my shop on the 26th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon—they called for a pot of sixpenny ale, and hesitated who should pay for it—one of them said, "Take hold and drink"—"No," says I, "I am not paid for it"—one of them then threw down a half-crown—I gave them two shillings, and put the half-crown behind the engine, in the bar—I then went into the parlour, and was there nearly a minute—I then heard a bit of a scuffle, and saw the prisoner on the counter, reaching after the half-crown—he got it, and got down, and ran off—I pursued him to the corner of Pitfield-street—he went into a cheese-monger's shop, and called for half a quartern of cheese, and tendered the half-crown—I went in, and said, "This is my half-crown," and I took it up—this is the half-crown—I noticed it because it was so smooth, and I was afraid it was a bad one.</p>

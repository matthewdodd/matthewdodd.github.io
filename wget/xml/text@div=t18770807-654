                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Matthews, labourer, of Plaistow Marsh—on 10th July, about 8 o'clock, I went with Mrs. Fisher to change a cheque, and put the change, sixteen sovereigns, in a new purse, which I placed in my bosom—we then went into the Walmer Castle public-house, where we met the prisoner, and, after some conversation, I invited him to drink with us—he saw the money when I took it out of my bosom, and another man opened the purse for me—the prisoner then followed us into Mrs. Fisher's house—he asked me to let him tell ray fortune at the Walmer Castle, but I said I should not wait there, and said if he liked to go in with us and have a glass of ale he could—after we went in to Mrs. Fisher's I consented to his telling my fortune, which he did—he asked for a pack of cards and Mrs. Fisher gave them him, and the other people went out of the room—he said "Have you any objection for them to go V and they went out—he said "Cut them cards in three," and he began to talk about Venus and a lot of rubbish, and he said "The motion of my hand deceives your eyes," and I don't recollect anything more—I felt quite silly then—it was not dark enough for a candle—he wished me many times to look through a glass—I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when be left the room, and he offered to tell it for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him a 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I had the odd money all right, but not the sixteen sovereigns in my house—the prisoner said to the others "You can come in, it is all over"—they made a remark how ill I looked—I was very sick and bad, and they sent for a Seidlitz power and were going to send for a drop of ale when I missed my money, purse and all, and the prisoner rushed into the back yard—I sent Mrs. Fisher's little girl for a constable—he didn't come very soon and I sent a second time—the prisoner made a push by me—I have since seen my purse—the constable came and took him into custody—I also gave Mrs. Fisher into custody—this is my purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when I next saw it there was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not toss the money about in the street when I got it—the only woman I was with was Mrs. Fisher—I met Mr. Stevens and paid in some money for him to the post-office—only the man I asked to open my purse did so—I went into the Walmer Castle alone with Mrs. Fisher—there were some others there that I knew, and I asked them to have a glass—they knew I was expecting a few pounds—I was not tossing it about—I did not sit on the prisoner's knee when he was telling me my fortune and I was ruling the planets—I had 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

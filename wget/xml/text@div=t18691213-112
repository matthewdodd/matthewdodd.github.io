               <p>import German and Belgian boards, manufactured from straw, which afterwards have paper put on them for the purpose of making boxes—some time in July the prisoner Clark with his wife came to my premises—I did not know him before—he wanted work—he said he knew how to line my boards, and could do it at a reasonable price—I sent him some afterwards—I supplied him with all the materials, and he did the labour—I supplied him with materials from time to time, he put them together and returned them to me, and I paid him the price agreed on, so much per ream—I have my book here—his wife seems to have been the manager in this business, and she came for the money, and signed "J. Clark" for him—a settlement was made on 1st October up to that date—boards were delivered out to him after that settlement, on 1st October, 27th October, and 3rd November—I sell the boards wholesale at 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a cwt—on 1st October a ton and a half were delivered out to him—this entry is in my writing—he did not return the whole of that manufactured, there was about 1 1/2 cwt. deficient—on 27th October the entry is my brother's, he is here, 148 bundles, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> 64 cwt, were delivered out, twenty bundles after<lb></lb>wards on 28th, and another twenty on 29th, altogether 74 cwt in 1/2 cwt. bundles—the whole of those were not returned to me manufactured—there was a deficiency of about 8 1/2 cwt.—on 3rd November here is an entry in my writing of 1 ton delivered out; of that 6 cwt. was returned, leaving a deficiency of 14 cwt.—the paper was sent in at various times between 1st October and 16th November—I have the entries here—here is one lot that I have a receipt for, sent on 16th November—that went from my office while the prisoners were there, for a special purpose, to line the 14 cwt. of boards that were to be returned to me on the Thurs<lb></lb>day morning—it was a small quantity of four reams and ninety-six sheets—altogether I find sixteen reams nineteen quires short—I can tell if necessary the way in which I arrive at that—I have gone carefully into it—on 16th November, I had an interview with both the prisoners at my warehouse—they came there and demanded money from me; an amount that I certainly did not owe them—I forget the amount just now; I think it was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told them in the first place I did not owe that amount, and in the second I would not pay the small amount I did owe until my goods were returned—Clark said (he and his wife were both there) that if I would send sufficient paper to cover the 14 cwt. of boards they would let me have them on the Thursday morning—that would be two days afterwards—I told them I wanted the boards very urgently for an order, and they promised to send them—that was the remainder of the ton sent on 3rd November—I sent the paper for those boards while they were at my office, four reams and ninety-six sheets to their residence, in 11, Paradise Street, Finsbury—this is the ticket, signed by Mary Bradshaw, for Clark—I saw nothing of them on the Wednesday, and on the Thursday I went to Clark's workshop, 6, Primrose Street, Bishopsgate, about 10.30 in the morning—I found no one there—it was locked up on the outside—I looked through the window, I could see every part of the building, and I found all my goods were gone—I had been there previously, on several occasions, and seen my goods there—I then went to Clark's residence, in Paradise Street—I got there about 11 or 11.30—I inquired for Clark—I saw the person living in the front room—Clark occupied the back room up stairs—I endeavoured to get access to that room, but it was locked—I could not see into that room—on the 19th I</p>

               <p>went to Mr. Toy's, 215, Queen Street, Bethnal Green—he keeps a grinder's shop, and sells leather, and all sorts of materials for shoe makers—I saw in his possession about 2 cwt. of boards, which I identified as my property from the size, the mark, and the quality—I have specimens of them here—they were not in the same state in which they left my premises, the bundles were altered, and the outside marks removed—there was a mark on the outer bundle of every hundredweight—they were all removed—that same evening I went with two officers to Mr. Hubbard's, of 14, Ashwell Road, and saw about 4 cwt. of boards there, which I identified as mine from their size, thickness, and quality—I also found this board marked "25 by 30, N. B." thrust into the centre of a bundle, it was originally an outer board, and the bundles were altered into 1/2 cwts.—that was the only marked board I found, all the other marks had been removed—on 20th November I went to a person named Balls, 148, Green Street, and there found about 7 cwt. of boards, which I identified as mine—they were part of a lot I had sent to the prisoners on 3rd November, and part of another lot—they are covered with paper—on the same day I went to a person named Cole, at 4, Royston Street, and there found about 1 1/2 cwt. belonging to me—I knew them from the marks, the size, thickness, and quality—the marks were not removed from those—the quantities I have mentioned are lying at the police-station—the police have portions of them here—the value of the boards, after the white paper was pasted on both sides, would be 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt.—that is my wholesale price—about 1 1/2 cwt. of the quantity I traced is lined on both sides—that was found at Balls'—I gave the prisoners in custody on the evening of 19th November—I had never seen Hopkins at work at Clark's workshop.</p>

J. Kammeran—they are the manufacturers—I dare say they make millions of these boards—I am not the only person who deals with them—I don't know how many do; quite a dozen, I should think, at any rate, or more—they would not all have the same mark—nearly every importer has his own mark—this particular lot I bought at the wharf—they were marked "N. B. 12"—the "N. B." merely designates the particular parcel, and "12" means the number of ounces to the sheet—other parcels might have the same mark—it is a private mark of the manufacturer, not mine—there was a lot there marked "N. B. 12," which I did not buy—Clark used to work for a Mr. Pound, a packing-case maker, but he left there some time ago—I called there on 19th November, and the principal clerk told me he had not been to work for ten days—the last lot of boards I sent to Clark was on 3rd November, and the last lot of paper on 16th November—he was not working for Pound then, he had left long before that—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ream—I can't say what I paid him in July, I have no entry of it—I have not entered all these amounts in the book, I did not think it necessary—the entry on 1st October, is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., signed "Settled" by Mrs. Clark—she did not say that any money was due to her then—that was a full settlement of the account to that date—I gave it her in cash—they did not offer me an account on 16th November, I swear that—I have received no account from</p>

               <p>them—I did not tear it up and say I would not pay anything until the goods they had were returned—I saw a copy of account attached to the summons on the 24th, when they sued me—they certainly did not tell me on 16th November that I owed them 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and that they gave me credit for my cheque for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leaving a balance due to them of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and if I did not pay it they would not return my goods, but would sue me in the Court—they never said anything of the sort—they did sue me four days after I gave them into custody, on the 24th, before Mr. Commissioner Kerr—he referred it to Mr. Buchanan—I don't know that Mr. Buchanan made an award—I did not take up the award—there was no award—I don't know that his decision was not in my favour; I swear that—I gave the prisoners into custody on the 19th—I did not receive the summons till midday on the 24th—it was dated the 18th—I gave them this cheque on 6th November—it was more than I owed them at the time—that cheque was not dis<lb></lb>honoured—the bankers did not pay it—they referred it to me, because it was not presented till long afterwards—I had plenty of money at the bank to pay it, and here is my pass-book, if you wish to look at it—Mrs. Clark has applied to me for money on a great many occasions, and I have fre<lb></lb>quently advanced her over and above what I owed her—she has not com<lb></lb>plained to me that I have not paid her in full, the facts are the other way—a man named Tilley worked for me—he has not complained that I did not pay him his account—he owes me an account now—he has kept back some of my boards—he does not work for me now.</p>

I live at 146, Green Street, Bethnal Green—Hopkins came to my place on a Saturday; I think it was 13th November—he brought some paper boards, covered with white paper—I bought about 1 1/2 cwt. of him—that was the first transaction I had with him—I think he asked 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave it to him—on the next Wednesday, November 17th, he came, about noon, with a sheet of yellow paper, such as this—he said that he had 6 cwt. of it, and asked me if I wanted to buy anything of the kind—I told him I thought I had quite sufficient to last me till after Christmas—he asked me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt.—I offered him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he took, and I bought the 6 cwt.; here is the receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were in the same state when Mr. Rowney saw them—I wrote the receipts because Hop<lb></lb>kins told me he could not write.</p>

I have been working for Mrs. Clark, lining straw boards with white paper, at 6, Primrose Street, Bishopsgate—I saw Hopkins there several times in October—he only came in occasionally—I did not know Clark in the business; I knew Mrs. Clark—Hopkins came for some boards, and took some unlined boards away with him—I knew he had pur<lb></lb>chased some boards of Mrs. Clark, who told me she had sold some at 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt.—Hopkins then took away three half-hundred boards, unlined, all at one time—I saw him take away boards once after that.</p>

I took Clark on 19th November, at his house, 11, Paradise Street, Shoreditch—I told him it was for destroying a great amount of boards belonging to Mr. Rowney, his employer—he said that be knew nothing about it—I saw Hopkins at the Black Horse, Kings-land Road, the same evening, and said I should take him in custody—I said, "Have you disposed of any paper or cardboard you have received from Mr. Clark?"—he said he had not—I said, "Be certain, for I know you have"—he afterwards said that he had sold 12 cwt., and afterwards he said that he had bought them and sold them—I went to 27, Ely Place, Kings-land Road—he has a small cottage there; two rooms, down stairs, and one up—it contained no trace of this business—I went to Primrose Street; hut the place was closed up, and the landlord had possession—I went into the premises the following day; but the boards were all gone.</p>

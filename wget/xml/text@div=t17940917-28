               <p>I saw the prisoner with two men, go into Mr. Dobion; they had been the space of about two minutes, and the prisoner came to the door, and put her hand up and unpinned something and I observed the waistcoat drop on the floor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179409170088"></xptr>inside of the door; she withdrew short into the shop out of my sight; she came out with the two men in about two minutes. I sent over a young man to enquire of Mr. Dobson if he had lost a waistcoat? he said, he had; and he sent a young man after them. I did not see the prisoner afterwards, till I see her before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>On the the first of August, about six in the evening, I pursued the prisoner at the bar on information that we had lost a waistcoat; I took her, it did not exceed three minutes nor so much; I found the waistcoat wrapped up in her apron; I have got it here.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Right honourable judge, and gentlemen of the jury, give me leave to address you in behalf of the situation I now labour under. I have a small family, and labour hard to support them, and always through life had an honest and upright character till this affair happened. I called this day at this shop for some property that I had in their hands; but he not having time to answer me, desired me to call a second time, which I did; coming out of there two men asked me to go with them to drink, I went with them, and was standing at the public house door when the prosecutor came in and searched the two men, but found nothing; he likewise searched me, and sees plainly I had nothing about me; there were many people in the house, and the man went away, and the waistcoat was found under the table; I can give no further or juster account. Honoured gentlemen, this is the truth, and I hope you will consider it as such, in pity to my helpless children.</p>

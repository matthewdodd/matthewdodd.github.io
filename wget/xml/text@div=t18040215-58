             sworn. - On the 25th of January, near seven o'clock in the evening, I heard the foot-step of a person on the stairs; I was in the office of Mr. Hilliard, in <placeName id="t18040215-58-crimeloc321">Clement's-inn</placeName>

               <p>Q. How long had you been in the chamber before he took the lamp? - A. About half an hour; I observed it was dark; I did not take the piece of the lamp up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the lamp being there, and was it alight? - A. Yes; I proceeded with him to the watch-house, and there he acknowledged the fact; he said he stole the lamp, and hoped I would excuse him, as he had never done such a thing before; he acknowledged the fact before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose property the lamps are? - A. I know that Lucas has received money from the Society; I have been present at the lamp contract.</p>

On Wednesday the 25th of January, I was going to my wife, who is a laundress, in Symond's-inn, Chancery-lane; I was rather in liquor; I told him I wanted my wife; he told me that was not the place; he would see where I went; he followed me, when I stumbled against something there; I was taken to the watch-house, where nothing was proved against me; I am entirely innocent; I was never charged with any thing dishonest; I have a wife and five children; I rest upon your Lordship's humanity.</p>

I had a side of bacon, which I hung at my door on the 21st of May; I went out, and while I was at the Fox publichouse, at Highgate, my wife came and said it was gone; I thought it was a joke, but when I came home I found it was gone - it was my own killing and cutting up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It has been killed a long time? A. About three weeks; I did not breed the pig - I know the cutting of this, it is different to any other.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. This bacon hung at our door at three o'clock - in ten minutes it was taken - I went and told my husband.</p>

               <p>GEORGE WADDINGTON. I am an officer. I met the two prisoners and a third person; Oakes was carrying this bacon on his head - Thomas was carrying a bat in his hand; I followed them down to Clerkenwell workhouse, to see if they spoke to one another, but they did not - they were close together sometimes; I then went up and asked Oakes who gave him the bacon - he said it was given him by a person near the prison to carry for him; I secured the third one, and took hold of Thomas; Oakes threw the bacon at me and ran off - he was brought back: he took up the hat, which laid at my feet, and said"Give us my hat."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where did you meet them? A. At the corner of Coppice-row, that is two miles from Camden-town; these two men might have met the other; Thomas threw down the bat when I took hold of him - it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; Thomas got away, and was taken the next day - the third person was discharged.</p>

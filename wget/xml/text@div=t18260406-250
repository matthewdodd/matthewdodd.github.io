               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. How many shops had you been to? A. Only one; there was a young man with me, who is gone to sea; the prisoner came down the next morning after the officer had been for him; my Captain was before the Magistrate; there was a man and a woman in the shop; a man gave my shipmate the jacket, and he was putting it up.</p>

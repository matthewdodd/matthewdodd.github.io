On the morning of the 17th of January I found a pair of half-fronts at the top of the cellar stairs, behind a candle-box, which was not a proper place for it- I lifted up the box, and found under it a pair of Wellington-fronts; this was about eight or nine o'clock in the morning - the prisoner was working about the shop at the time; I told my master, and then called the prisoner, who was then in the cellar - I told him to wait in the shop while I went up stairs; I returned in ten minutes, and when I came back the prisoner was gone in the cellar - I went to the candle-box, and the leather was gone, all but one half-front; I told master of that, them went into the cellar, and found the same pieces of leather which had been under the candle-box, under two papers - I watched the prisoner that day, on the Friday, and on the Saturday, at dinner time, I saw him come up from the cellar; I went into the cellar, and missed some of the leather which had been there on the Friday night - I told my master, then went after the prisoner, and brought him back with my master; the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, took out the four pairs of half-fronts, and said they were all he had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any mark on them? A. No, but they were at the stairs - I have known the prisoner for four years; I believe he is married, and has a family.</p>

            . I was informed by Brown of the discovery he had made in the cellar - I went into the sellar, and found this property concealed under the stairs; it was covered with paper - it was what I had seen under the candle-box, and there was one half-front left on the box; this is what was produced by the prisoner, and he said,"This is all I have" - here is a pair of Wellington-fronts, which one of a peculiar description of leather, which I believe, no person but myself cuts; they are a peculiar skin- the prisoner was the shumac man, a sort of porter to the men, he had nothing to do with this sort of leather, but with leather that was not manufactured; the hours of working were in summer from six till eight o'clock, and in winter, from eight till eight - I was in the warehouse on the Saturday, when the prisoner came from the cellar, and went out at the door; he was employed in the cellar in handling the leather through the liquor.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the cellar was the place where he was employed? A. Yes, and these the leather was found; there were other men employed in the cellar,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140039"></xptr>but not at that particular part - this is the pair I can particularly speak to; it is what we call a kip, not a calfskin - it is a Russian hide; no doubt there are many of them in London - I do not curry them myself, but there is something peculiar in my way of currying; we have a peculiar pattern of our own that we cut by.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. These pieces produced by the prisoner are the same as those you have? A. Yes, they are curried in the same manner, and cut in the same shape.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner; he took these pieces of leather out of his pocket, put them on the counter, and said that was all he had about him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him when he was first in the prosecutor's possession? A. Yes; he said he had lost property, and he suspected the prisoner had some about him - the prisoner took this out, and said, "This is all I have got;" he did not say it was Mr. Colling's - the leather was marked by me.</p>

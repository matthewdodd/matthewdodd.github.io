                  </hi>. I keep a tailor's shop in Holborn. On the 16th of July I missed a coat off a horse in the further part of my shop, five or six yards within the door—it was brought back by the pawnbroker, and I recognised it—here is my writing on the sleeve lining.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Rosier, a pawnbroker, in Clerkenwell. On the 16th of July, about half-past twelve o'clock, the prisoner came to pledge this coat—I asked who it belonged to—he said, "Mr. Daley, of Saffron-hill"—I said I thought it did not belong to him—he said it did, and he would go and fetch him—he went away, and left the coat in my possession.</p>

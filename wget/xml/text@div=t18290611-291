On Wednesday, the 20th of May, we lost some bacon from our shop - I had seen it about an hour before on the counter opposite the door, not within the reach of any one going by; I missed it about ten o'clock in the morning - I had not seen the prisoners that day; I had seen Bernadeer about before - I saw the bacon at Worship-street; I can swear it was my husband's, though it was dirtier than it had been.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH BARHAM. I keep a chandler's shop, about one hundred yards form Mr. Barber's, in Windsor-street. I know Bernadeer; he carries hearth-stones about for sale- I had seen him that morning in my shop, and bought some stones of him; there was a person shorter than him sitting at my door - I cannot say whether it was Cleasby.</p>

               <p>RHODA JOHNSON. I lodge at Mr. Barber's. I saw a person standing at the post of the door, about ten o'clock; I believe it was Bernadeer, but I cannot be certain - I saw no one near him.</p>

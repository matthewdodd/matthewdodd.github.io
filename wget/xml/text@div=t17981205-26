               <p>JOHN LUCAS sworn. - I am a pawnbroker,(produces a bolster, blanket, and a tea-kettle): they were pawned at different times; the bolster was pledged on the 15th of September, the blanket on the 1st of September, and the tea-kettle on the 12th; I have left my master two months.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Queen-square: I know nothing of it, further than apprehending the prisoners; I found nothing upon either of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley contended, that as to the woman prisoner, if she was the wife of the man, she being under coverture, of course must be acquitted; and that, if she was not the wife, she ought to have been indicted for a common law larceny, and not upon the statute upon which this indictment is framed, the contract for the lodging being made with him. The learned Counsel also contended, that there was no evidence to she what the property was taken with the privity or consent of the man prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. I am of opinion with you, that if the woman did this without the knowledge of the man, he ought to be acquitted; but, on the other hand, I think there is a case to go to the Jury, from the circumstances under which this property was pledged, upon the subject of privity, they both living together.</p>

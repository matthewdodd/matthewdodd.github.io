                  </hi>In January, 1839, the prisoner Antrobus employed me as a carpenter to fit up a coffee-shop—I was to have some money on account when I had done 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of work—my bill was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked Antrobus for money—he had promised me 15<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>, but I said I must have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he at last brought me a bill for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is accepted by the defendant Beagarie—I said to Antrobus, "You must let me know who and what Beagarie is before I can discount the bill"—he said, "I can refer you to Mr. Faulkner that he is a respectable man"—I said, "That won't do, I must know that he is responsible"—I went to Mr. Faulkner's office, and saw a person representing himself to be s clerk to Mr. Faulkner—I believe Beagarie to be the man—he said Mr. Faulkner was not within, but he could answer for him; he knew Mr. Faulkner knew Beagarie to be a respectable man—I said, "Is he a responsible man for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? "—he said, "I believe him to be so, " and said something about a suit in Chancery by which he was entitled to some money—I was not satisfied—Antrobus called on me again—I said I had been to Mr. Faulkner's office, but could not see him, and could not take what I heard from his clerk, I must have it from the principal, if not in words, I must have it in writing—Antrobus then left me, and brought me this letter—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I made a memorandum on the letter, and Antrobus signed it—this is it: "Witness to the above alteration. W. A."—I then advanced the money to Antrobus—when the bill became due it was dishonoured—I went to Mr. Faulkner's office, and made a communication to Mr. Faulkner—if the words "and responsible" had been left out of the letter I should not have advanced the money.</p>

                  </hi>I am a solicitor, and live in Staple's Inn, Holborn. On the 31st of January, between one and two o'clock, (I think, ) the two defendants came to me at Westminster, and both saw me together—Beagarie said a person living in Orange-street was going to lend him a sum of money, and they had requested a note from a respectable person to say that he was a respectable man himself, and pressed me to give him a note to that effect—I wrote the note, and, after reading it, he wished me to put in the word "responsible"—I objected to do so, and did not do it—this is the letter I wrote—the words "and responsible" have been added since—I did not write them—the rest is mine, except the me<lb></lb>morandum—I gave him the note, and they went away—the prosecutor and his solicitor afterwards called on me, and showed me the letter—Bea<lb></lb>garie had said the person proposed to lend him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said nothing about a bill of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I had no clerk at that time.</p>

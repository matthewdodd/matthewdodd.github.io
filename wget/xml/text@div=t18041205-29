             sworn. - I am ostler to Mr. Bestford; Mr. Stewart's horse stands at livery in my master's stables; I saw them both there, the saddle and the bridle, on the preceding night; nobody was in the stable after me that night, I locked the stable-door; I missed them the next morning; I went to the stable on the next morning about half past six o'clock, I put the key in the door as usual, and the key would not go round to unlock the door; with that, I tried the latch of the door, and found it was undone; I looked round to see if any thing was missing; I did not observe the saddle missing; soon after, the watchman came, and asked me if I had missed any thing out of the stable; I immediately looked up to where I had left the saddle and the bridle, and then I found they were not there.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure to his person? - A. I am positive of him, and as soon as he laid down the saddle, he stared me hard in the face; I passed by the person that was along with him, he was dressed like a groom; I slipped by the groom apparently, he strove to hide the bridle; I went about three yards, I turned round, and said, are you going to ride so soon as this in the morning; I had no suspicion of the robbery; they immediately jumped off from the kirb into the dirt, both of them; the other man that was with the prisoner seemed to have a number of keys with him, they jingled very much; I then ran after them, and cried, stop thief, and sprang the rattle at the bottom of Holles-street; at the last spring of the rattle I heard one

             sworn. - On Saturday, the 3d of November, about five o'clock in the morning, as I was coming into Cavendish-square to go to my daily labour, I heard the watchman's rattle, and stepping forward to assist the watchman, I met the prisoner at the bar running as hard as he could run; I caught hold of him by the collar, and I called out to the watchman, and told him I had got him, and when the watchman saw him, he said he was the man that had the saddle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going through Cavendish-square to Norfolk-street, to my work, and from thence he took me; the watchman coming down Oxford-road, held up the light, and said I was the man; he asked me where I had been; I was afraid it would come to my master's ears, and I told him I was going a fishing; there being but four masters in our trade, if a man has a bad character, they will not employ him; I am a saffron-caker; I was not willing it should be known in the trade; the last witness has sworn false, you may depend upon it. (The saddle produced and identified by the witness, Good.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am gardener to Mr. Charles William Tanner, of West Ham—on Friday, 16th August, we had a stack of oat straw in one of the fields—I was called up about twenty minutes past 4 on Saturday morning—I went to the stack and found it on fire—it was burnt down—the value of it was between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the fire had evidently commenced near the ground on the lee side.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 248). On the evening of 19th August, I was on duty at the police-station, at West Ham—the prisoner came up to me as I was standing outside the station door, and said, "I wish to give myself up"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "Well, I have done a thing last week which I ought not to have done"—I said, "What is that?—he said, "I set the straw stack, or a wheat stack, I could not tell which it was, on fire"—I told him that what he was saying I should give in evidence on his trial—he said, "I am laying nothing but what is right, and what is true"—I said, "Whereabouts was the stack situated that you set on fire?"—he pointed in the direction of Mr. Tanner's house where the stack had been on fire—that was about a mile off—I asked what he did it for—he said he did not</p>

               <p>know—I asked what he had done it with, and he said with a match—next morning, when I was taking him before the Magistrate, I asked him if he was sorry for what he had stated the night previous—he said he had stated nothing but the truth—I searched him and found three matches upon him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know him at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he stated that he one from Newfoundland—he said he had come over about two months previously to Liverpool, and had tramped all the way from Liverpool up, that he had been a week or a fortnight, and he was living upon what he would pick up in the streets, and he thought it would be better to do some<lb></lb>thing that would get him into prison than to be starving about the streets—he looked starving enough, and he begged me to give him something to sat, and I gave him a penny loaf and a bit of cheese—it bad been generally known about that this fire had taken place.</p>

He had an old one he wanted to be repaired, if I considered it to be worth the expence of repairing. I went to the Black Horse Yard, in Gray's Inn Lane, to view the old chaise. I told him the old chaise was not worth repairing; he said he would take the old one he had seen on trial; he thought it would be too heavy; if he found it so, he would have a new one built: in either case, I was to make an allowance for the old chaise. Six pounds he sent the same afternoon, and took the chaise away. In about a week or ten days afterwards, he called again to say the chaise did not suit him; he called at my shop and gave an order for a new one; I agreed to let him have the old chaise until the new one was made. On the 15th of September I received a note from him to hurry the completion of the chaise.</p>

               <p>"10, Symond's Inn, 1813.</p>
               <p>On Saturday I went into the country, and left the chaise unfinished. On Monday the 10th of September, 1813, he sent a person from the stable yard, as I understood, saying, he wished to have the chaise on the following morning. I had left no order to detain the chaise, consequently one of my men delivered it in my absence, that was the new chaise, the old one was to be returned, but was not. I made no enquiry; about three weeks or a month afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300057"></xptr>I met a person in Chancery-lane, I enquired Mr. Lloyd's character. I heard something which gave me suspicion; I went and found the chaise I lent him in Mr. Paste's yard; I seized the chaise and took it home. On the next day a man of the name of Flack and Mr. Paste the keeper of the yard came and said they had purchased the chaise of Mr. Lloyd.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the chaise - A I seized it as my property, it is in my possession now. Mr. Paste and Flack threatened to bring an action against me.</p>

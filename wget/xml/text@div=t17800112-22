               <p>I was sent for by Mrs. Whitman.</p>
               <p>You took the two prisoners up there? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you return to her after they were taken to the Bear? - I went back to tell her to come up; when I had got back she had found that one of the rings of the number that were taken off the gound was a brass one; and she desired they might be searched.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you that at her house? - Yes; the prisoners begged I might search them with decency; Mrs. Whitman said, Mr. Burton let me alone I will search them myself; she took the little one behind a screen in the parlour at the Bear to search her, she found nothing upon her; she was then turned into the room from behind the screen, and the other prisoner was taken behind the screen; at the time she was searching her there was something dropped from the little one; I looked about some time, at last I found this ring (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Are you sure that was dropped by the little one? - I am; there was no one near her.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Whitman was then behind the screen with the tall one? - Yes; this is the ring I found upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Whitman. I believe this to be my ring.</p>
               <p>What did she say? - When I found the ring, she said, that is worth nothing, it is only a brass ring; it is mine; I bought it to deceive my husband because I pawned my gold one.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutrix. Did you look at her hands when you searched her? - I believe she had none in her hands, but I cannot say.</p>

I said I don't know, but they are all dropped; it is best to search; they were searched for, she found the rings upon the floor. She took the bill and said there should be sixteen rings, here are but fourteen; where are the other two? They brought the candle round the compter, and said here are the other two, they found them; she pulled her black silk glove off; and it frequently did as she told me drop.</p>

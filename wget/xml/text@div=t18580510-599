I live in the same house as Gosling, and on that night I occupied a room on the same floor; I was not alone, it was a girl who was with me—towards morning I heard men's voices, and Callaghan came into my room—I said, "Who is there?" and looked up, and saw him with the door in his hand—he said, "It is Harry Waring"—I asked him what he wanted, and he went away—I had not known him before, except seeing him the afternoon before at a public house door near, but I knew Waring—I am quite sure Callaghan is the man I saw—I got out of bed directly, and before I had gone into the other room they were out at the window—any one can step out at the second floor window on to the wall, which is not very high, and there was a ladder leaning against it.</p>

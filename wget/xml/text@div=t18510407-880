                  </hi>. I am waiter at the American Stores, 56, Oxford-street; I succeeded the prisoner there as waiter to Mr. George Gurney, about eleven months ago. The coffee-room is on the ground-floor—the kitchen is on the first-floor back—there are leads opposite the kitchen window. On 3rd Dec, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I left four toddy-ladles, two punch-ladles, a pepper-castor, some mustard-spoons, a cream-ewer, and a piece of silver, in the coffee-room; and some money in the bar—the kitchen window was shut, but not fastened—I missed the goods about eight o'clock next morning—the kitchen window was open—a person could get from the kitchen <hi rend="italic">to the</hi> coffee-room by a machine for taking dinners down to the coffee-room, but unless well acquainted with it he would stand a chance of striking himself—it moves by a pulley, which no one could use unless he was well acquainted with it—from the coffee-room you can get to the bar, by unlocking the door—it had been unlocked—the key was inside—nobody could open it unless he got into the coffee-room</p>

               <p>first—the keys of the drawers where the silver was kept were in a small glass in the coffee-room, on the shelf—I found the drawers open, and the keys in them, and missed the plate; also 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, which was left in the bar—I saw footmarks on the rails outside the kitchen window, and on the beds—the rails would have to be got over to get to the window—a person could get to the leads from 72, Berners-street.</p>

I live with my mother, at 72, Berners-street; my <hi rend="italic">house</hi> adjoins Mr. Gurney's at the back—the leads <hi rend="italic">go</hi> from the first-floor to Mr. Gurney'8. On the first Saturday in Dec. the prisoner came to my house, and asked if I had a room to let—I showed him the first-floor back-room, which opens on to the leads—Miss Minifie was not at home, rod the prisoner left, and came again at four o'clock, and saw her—she took him up-stairs—he did not sleep there that night—he came on the Monday evening—I went into the room on the Tuesday morning—the window-sill had then been wiped, but was still very dirty—I found a brown-paper parcel there—I opened it, it contained hay—the prisoner was gone between four and five in the morning—I did not see him again all be was at Guildhall—I saw him in a cell with four or five others, and recognized him directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I occupy the first-floor at 72, Berners-street. On a Saturday, about the beginning or middle of Dec, I let my back-room to a person resembling the prisoner—it was the Saturday before the robbery—he came on the Monday, about ten o'clock in the evening—he brought a paper parcel—I showed him to his room, and gave him a candle—he said he was an engineer, belonging to a railroad, and should have to he up between four and five in the morning—I heard him leave in the morning, and shortly afterwards the <hi rend="italic">clock</hi> struck four—he never came back—I found a parcel in his room, containing hay—the washhand<lb></lb>bason had been used, and the water in it was as black as ink—there was no water in it the night before—I had not noticed that his face or bands were black.</p>

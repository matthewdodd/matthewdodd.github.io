I am high bailiff of the Lambeth County Court—I produce a certified entry of the proceedings in an action of Thomas Williams and Thomas William James against George Pearce, for the recovery and possession of two workshops and premises situate in Ebenezer Row—the Judge declined to make any order in the case—I administered the oath to the defendant in that case—it came on for hearing on 29th November, 1870—it was stated that the notice had been fixed to the door, and I had some doubt whether that was a sufficient notice, and I got down the "Law of Landlord and Tenant," and showed the Judge that that was not sufficient, unless it came to the knowledge of the defendant—he was asked whether it had come to his knowledge, or something to that effect, and he denied it.</p>

               <p>the 22nd January, I took by assignment, from Robert Swaine, the workshop and premises in Ebenezer Row; the defendant at that time was a tenant in possession—after that I received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., four weeks' rent, from Swaine, I received no rent after that; in consequence of that I gave instructions to Messrs.

Hill—I signed the notice before it was executed; it was about 26th September, that I signed it—I then left it in the hands of Messrs. Hill, and a man named William Pearce, in their employ, watched the premises—he had a duplicate notice, I believe—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a duplicate copy, and that is my signature—I was present at the County Court, at the action in which my partner and I were plaintiffs, and the defendant was the defendant then—he was examined as to the notice, and this duplicate was put in his hands; he was asked whether he had ever seen the duplicate of that notice, and he said "No;" he was then asked if he had ever had a notice, and he laid "No;" or whether he had read the notice, and he said "No"—he was also asked whether he ever saw the notice stuck on the doer, and he said no, but a policeman had told him there was such a notice.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Duke Street, Westminster Bridge Road, and am assistant to Messrs.

Hill, to serve on the defendant, on 26th September—I did not have an opportunity of serving in the course of that day; this is one of the notices I had—I posted the other one on the door of the workshop about 10.30 on the morning of the 26th—I remained in observation of the premises until the evening—in the evening, Thomas Nash joined me—soon after 6 o'clock—soon after 7 o'clock the defendant came to the premises; the notice was still on the door—I had fixed it on with liquid gum—the defendant went to the door of the workshop—he read the notice, as far as I could judge—there was a lamp about six feet from the door-way—after he had read the notice, he opened the door—two or three of his friends came, and after a short time, some water was fetched by a youth, and the notice was damped and taken off the door, by one of Mr. Pearce's friends—he gave it to Pearce—I don't think it had been torn at that time—the defendant and his friends went into the workshop, and closed the door—I then saw smoke issuing from the iron tube—they afterwards came out, and the defendant had a paper in his hand, similar to the notice—Nash was with me at that time, and during the time the notice was being taken down—we were both sober—I did not see the defendant again that evening—I saw him again on the 27th, about 7.30 in the evening, at the premises—he was there with his coat off, helping to load a van—I endea<lb></lb>voured to stop the goods from being removed—the defendant appealed to the parties present, and they tried to push the van on—he showed the notice, and said "Here is notice to leave, what am I to do; take the goods away or not?" and the parties there said "Go on, governor, we will give</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We went there about 7 o'clock, I expect—I saw the paper on the door—there was no trouble in pulling it down—it was torn in pieces—my father did not read it—Mr. William Pearce said it was to be torn down—he had not read it—he did not go up to it—he got there at the same time we did—I swear he did not go up to it—there was a lamp there—ray father read it when he was inside; not outside—he put the pieces together—nothing was said to the defendant, when he came, about the notice being pulled down, to my knowledge—I left the place with my father—I did not see a policeman speak to the defendant; nothing of the kind—the place was full of goods at that time—Nash was rolling about on the scaffold</p>

               <p>poles; I did not see the other man at all—the scaffold poles were outside the door—I believe they belonged to the defendant—I did not hear anything said to the defendant in the course of the evening about the notice being torn down—we were moving the goods about, and placing them in proper order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The workshop was divided into two portions, and the goods were at the farther end, and they had to be moved towards the door-way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at 1, Francis Street, Bermondsey—the prisoner is my brother—I went to this workshop on the evening of 26th September, by myself—I did not go inside—I waited there a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, talking to Nash—he was not sober—he was sitting on the scaffold poles—I had the key of the place—the two Sparrows and my son came down after—the notice was on the door at that time—I did not read it—I tried to but could not, because there was not sufficient light—I opened the door, and told Sparrow to pull the notice down, and destroy it—he did so—my brother was not there—there is no pretence for saying he tore it down—I am quite sure it was Mr. Sparrow who tore it down—I had previously given Nash 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a pint of beer—Pearce, the broker's assistant, was not there at that time, and Nash had gone away for some beer—after the paper was taken down we all went inside—Sparrow and his son lit a fire, and I believe they burnt the paper—I told him to destroy it—I don't know whether he did or net—I did not trouble myself—I don't know whether Sparrow read it—I did not—the defendant was not in the habit of using the workshop at that time—he was not busy, and what little work there was we were doing at Bermondsey—we are not in partnership—I was working in the same shop—the defendant came about two hours after I got to the workshop to rectify Corderoy's things; to remove them—we had been down on several occasions previous to the 26th—we went particularly on the 26th to rectify the goods—they were to be taken away the next day—I did not know there was any notice on the door till I went to the door—my brother never told me that he had been served with a notice to quit—I had not seen my brother during the day—we had made arrangements on the previous day to go down—Corderoy's shop was being fitted up at that time—I was not aware that any notice to quit had been served on my brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the paper on the door when I got down there—I tried to read it—I did not read it sufficiently to know what it was—I told Sparrow to tear it down, because I thought it was put on to annoy more than anything else—if they wanted to serve the notice on my brother he was there frequently for them to do so—the scaffold poles there belonged to my brother—my brother did come there that evening—it was quite two hours after I went there—when Sparrow tore the notice down I did not see the pieces put together—I did not see anyone read it—I did not trouble myself anything about it—I was there a quarter of an hour, talking to Nash—I saw the notice during that time—Sparrow and his son came after that—I</p>

               <p>left with my brother, the defendant, that evening—we all left together, five of us—I don't recollect speaking to a policeman, or a policeman speaking to him—I am quite sure he did not—I did not say anything to my brother about the notice—I believed it was a notice to quit—I knew that the rent was in arrcar, and that my brother had offered money for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. No attempt was made to remove the furniture—the men took all sorts of schemes to annoy us, and obtain an entrance to the place.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any reason for supposing the notice to quit was on the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was surprised—I did not read it—the lamp was about 12 ft. from the door—I supposed that it was a notice, and I ordered it to be taken down because I thought it was put up to annoy—going down that evening had nothing to do with the notice to quit—I did not think it was necessary to tell my brother that I had torn a paper down from bis premises—I did not tell him—if I told him anything it was that there was a paper on the door, not a notice—I might have told him there was a paper stuck on the door, and it was pulled down—I don't remember whether be made any answer to that—I pulled it down because it created a dis<lb></lb>turbance outside—it would not' have mattered if there had been no read<lb></lb>ing on it—when I went down to the workshop I did not know who was going—I did not go by appointment—we intended to go down—there was no specified time—they imagined I was going down because we had been down the previous evening, and we intended to put the things right—we all knew we were going down—there had been a sort of arrangement.</p>

The last witness is my father—I was at the workshop, and saw the notice torn down by Mr. Sparrow, my uncle—the defendant was not there at the time—I did not see what was done with the notice—no water was brought to the door—I went down with my father to help put the goods in order—I had been there on the previous evening with my father—we were doing a little work, and arranged the furniture, too.</p>

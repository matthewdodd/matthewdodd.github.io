             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a poor man in the workhouse; I was at work with the prisoner and Mr. May one day, and I saw him help Mr. May with his coat on, but I did not see him take any thing.</p>
               <p>May. I had 10 s. in my pocket when he helped me on with my coat; I felt his hand in my pocket; I had two half crowns, and 5 s. in my pocket; I had seen it about half an hour before that; about four o'clock in the afternoon my coat was on the ground on the common before he helped me on with it; I did not see any body on the common but me, and the prisoner, and this man; I was digging gravel; I had the silver in my coat-pocket; I had no suspicion of him before the Sunday morning; it was on Saturday night he took it; I did not take any notice of it at that time.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to say at first you did not know of his robbing you? - I did not know he had: I asked him on the Sunday morning, whether he had seen any money of mine? and he said no: I asked him again, and then he said he had got two half crowns and 4 s. of mine, and he brought it down to me; then I said I wanted a shilling, and he said he spent it; I threatened to send him to gaol, before he brought it down, if he did not give it to me; he then brought me down 9 s. and said he had spent 1 s. I got all but 1 s. back again.</p>
               <p>How came you to indict him capitally? Do you know that he is tried for his life? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you know that the charge you have made against this boy is a capital charge? - No, I do not think it is.</p>
               <p>Have you never been told that? - No, I never was.</p>

               <p>Did not the officer who

             the indictment tell you he had made a capital charge of it? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How many shillings did I give at one time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You have told the Judge, that to your knowledge they did not tell you it was a capital charge: Do you mean to swear that they did not tell you so? - No, Sir, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Will you swear positively they did not? - I have been lame these three years.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that nobody has told you, that if this boy was convicted he would lose his life? - Not to my knowledge; he has been in custody a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178904220084"></xptr>Do you mean to swear, that since Monday last nobody has told you, that if this boy was convicted he would be hanged? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not you know you would have a reward? - I know there is some reward.</p>
               <p>Have not you heard there is a reward of 40 l. - No, I heard it was some reward; I do not know who told me so; I have heard so from people.</p>
               <p>Who told you so? - I cannot tell now.</p>
               <p>Do not you know he was committed by the magistrate for a capital offence? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask the magistrate who was to pay your expences? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not the magistrate tell you that the Could would order you your expences, or that you would have a reward? - I am a poor man belonging to the workhouse; I work under the overseer, and I received this by my labour.</p>
               <p>Is your memory affected by your poverty? - No.</p>
               <p>Is your head affected? - It is a good deal.</p>
               <p>You'll be mistaken this time as to the reward.</p>

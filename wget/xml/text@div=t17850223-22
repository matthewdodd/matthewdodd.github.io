I applied to Justice Hyde, and some of the officers came with me, and went out upon the parapet through the window, and some of my things were dropped in the gutter; after that I went into the publick house, and got up upon the top of the houses, and at a house in Lisle-street, I found a trap door; these houses were searched, and nothing found. On Thursday, the 17th, I went to the house of Mr. Moffat, a salesman, in Leicester street, to buy a coat, and there I saw my own coat that had been stolen, I was sure it was my own coat, but the buttons of it had been taken off, and others put on, I told Moffat it was my coat, and he said he bought it: the next morning I got a search warrant, and then Mr. Moffat produced a pair of velvet breeches, which were mine, and which, he said, he bought at the same time with the coat; I said nothing to the people, only saying it was my coat.</p>

               <p>Then you did not ask any further questions? - No.</p>
               <p>What I mean is this, was there any unwillingness in Moffat, or the people in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230069"></xptr> house, to shew the things, or to give you information? - Not the least.</p>
               <p>Was the alteration in the buttons, better or worse buttons? - Worse.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of that? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>What sort of buttons had been on it before? - It was a gilt button, with a border to the edge of it.</p>
               <p>How do you know the coat to be yours? - At the sight of the coat, I knew it immediately for the colour, and examining the sleeve corresponded exactly with the directions I gave the taylor, being particular in having two buttons on the sleeve, to make it button close to the wrist, and the collar is what they term a stand up collar.</p>
               <p>Was it so by any particular directions? - It was the taylor's own doing, they are generally made so.</p>
               <p>Are they not frequently made with two buttons? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then there seems to me to be nothing by which you can identify this coat, except the circumstance of its fitting? - The part where the buttons had been sewed on the facing, had been unripped, and new sewed again.</p>
               <p>Court. The other side is not the same, is the taylor here who made the coat? - He is.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole you have no doubt but it is your coat? - I am confident of it.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor.

               <p>I am a taylor, I work for Mr. Taylor, in Duke-street, St. James's, I made this coat for Mr. Morgan, I cut it for him, I did not sew it, I know it to be the same for several reasons; I know it by having taken it in at the top of the sleeve, and the side, it was rather too big; it is visible to me, being my own work, it would not be visible to any body else.</p>
               <p>Can you judge as a workman, whether one side of it appears to be unripped? - Yes, it is plain, it is to put on these buttons.</p>
               <p>Is there any other mark, except the circumstance of this being unripped, that could enable you to judge, that the buttons on that coat had been changed, if you had never seen the coat before, could you have told that it had been unripped? - I cannot justly say that, I should have believed it to be so, but I would not wish to swear it.</p>
               <p>Take a penknife and unrip a part of the facing, on the side next the buttons? - The buttons were never put on by a tradesman.</p>
               <p>Could you as a workman have judged of it, if you had never seen the coat before? - Now I have unripped it, I see as a workman, that these buttons were never put on by a workman.</p>
               <p>What buttons were on the coat when it was made at first? - I cannot exactly remember, but it was a gilt button, with a small border, plain in the middle; I believe it was a double border, but I cannot be exact, but it was plain in the middle.</p>
               <p>Which of the buttons were best, these that are on now, or those that were on before? - Those that were on before were the best a great deal.</p>
               <p>Would it sell for more with these buttons, than it would before? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Does it appear to you, as a workman, that the coat would be made more marketable,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230070"></xptr> by changing the buttons? - They certainly were better before.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor lodged in my house; on Saturday the 5th of February, I was below in the parlour at work, about a quarter after eight in the evening, and I heard a window thrown up, I apprehended it to be at the top of the house; a young man who lodges in the second floor was in the house with me, and nobody else.</p>
               <p>Was he above stairs or below? - Above; I took the candle and run up stairs, and went into his room, and desired he would step up stairs with me into the garret, for I thought somebody was in the house; I went up with him, and the room door was locked, which was the prosecutor's; about half an hour before, I went up to see if the windows were all safe, and to turn down the beds; I am sure the windows were all shut then, and I had left the door open, not shut: finding the door locked, I was very much surprised, I ran down for assistance, the young man staid above at the door, I went up stairs, and by that time I got up stairs, the door was burst open; nobody was in the room, the window was wide open.</p>
               <p>Was the house door shut or open? - Shut.</p>
               <p>Was it upon the latch, so that any body could get in, without knocking? - No, it was locked.</p>
               <p>So that any person could not come in at the street door, and have got up to the room? - Impossible.</p>
               <p>(The Constable called again.)</p>
               <p>Court to Crosby. In what manner did Moffat behave? - He behaved exceedingly well, he rather thought it was hard to have his house searched being a man of great property.</p>
               <p>Did you or Morgan inform Moffat, that the coat that had been shewn to Morgan the night before, was a part of his property that was stolen? - Yes, and he said then he had a pair of breeches, that he bought of the same person.</p>
               <p>Did you inform him before you searched, that that coat was a part of the property that was stolen? - Yes, before we searched.</p>
               <p>You are sure he was told by one of you, before you searched at all? - I remember it, because I said, Sir, the man has been robbed of all his wearing apparel, and he is but a poor servant.</p>
               <p>Now after you had told him that the coat, that had been seen by Morgan, was a part of the things stolen, what did he say? - He produced the breeches, after I had been up stairs, and searched two or three rooms.</p>
               <p>After you had told him that that coat was a part of the things stolen? - Yes, he rather seemed to be a little rusty of the matter, and talked that he was a man of property, and should not be used in that manner, and he further told me he should take notice of it; I told him I must execute my office.</p>
               <p>When you went there, you told him what you came to search for? - Yes, and that it was for wearing apparel, that was stolen from a house in Princes-street, and the coat that Morgan had seen the night before, was a part of the property; I searched the sale-shop, and two of the wordrobes.</p>
               <p>Where were the breeches produced from? - One of Mr. Moffat's acquaintance came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230071"></xptr> up, and said here is a pair of breeches, which we bought with the coat, and I came down stairs and found the breeches on the compter, but where they were taken from I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who came up to tell the prosecutor? - A gentleman's servant.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Mr. Moffat produced the breeches, from some other black breeches, while we were above stairs.</p>
               <p>Court to Crosby. How long might it be before you were called down, and the breeches were produced? - I suppose it might be a quarter of an hour, or twenty minutes the outside.</p>
               <p>Did you ask Moffat at all, why he had not told you of the breeches, when he first came in? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he give any reasons why he had not? No, when he produced the breeches, I asked him upon his word, says I, Mr. Moffat have you any more property of the prosecutor's, I said I believe I can take your word, he said upon his honour he had not; we went to the parties where he had them, we never found any more property, we then went to the lad that he bought them of, that was

               <p>What did you sell them to Joseph for? - I sold them to Joseph with another coat, for two pounds four shillings.</p>

               <p>Are you sure yourself, independent of any information you received from Joseph, that the things you took back from him, were the same that you sold him? - I am quite sure they are the same clothes I sold to him.</p>
               <p>Were the same buttons on when you took them again? - He told me he took off the buttons, which was a very handsome button, and put them on a new coat, which he had made for himself.</p>
               <p>Who did you sell them to, after you had them from Joseph? - I sold them to Mr. Moffatt, on the Thursday.</p>

               <p>Court to Crosby. Which way did you go? - Up to the top of the houses, through the public house, there was a trap door to the publick house, the trap door was fastened, I could hardly get it open, I broke my stick in wrenching it open.</p>
               <p>What other trap door did you find that communicated with the leads? - I found none till I came to the second d oor, there I found a trap door that went into a small garret that was wide open, and that was the door of an empty house; I went down into the empty house, and searched every room and closet, but nobody was there, nor anything; when I came to the door of the empty house, it was a spring lock, with a large knob to open it, and a very easy lock, and would easily shut too after any body that went out.</p>

On Wednesday, the 24th of June, I left eight one-pound bank-notes in these breeches pocket. I went out to work about five o'clock in the morning. The prisoner had left the lodgings about eight days before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that they were safe in the small-clothes when you left the room in the morning - A. I am positive they were locked up in my chest. I had seen them safe in my small-clothes on the over night. On the Saturday following, I had occasion to took after my money, and seven of my notes were gone. I had kept my box locked all that time. I have never seen my notes again.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BENNY. I rent the house. Lochlane is my lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever lodge in your house - A. Yes, he did. He left the house on the 20th of June. He slept in the same room with Lochlane.</p>
               <p>Q. After he ceased to be a lodger of yours, do you know that he ever came to that room again - A. Yes, he did.</p>

            . Q. Do you recollect the prisoner leaving your lodging on the 20th of June - A. Yes, he came, on the 24th of June, to our house, between three and four o'clock. He asked me leave to go up stairs. He owed me five shillings. He told me, that his sister was coming, in order to pay me. He said, he had the bad headach, and wished to lie down on the same bed that he had lodged in before. I gave him leave. He remained in the room about three quarters of an hour, and, during that time, I heard him on the floor, moving about. I went up stairs, and lifted up the latch, softly. I perceived that he had Lochlane's trowsers in his hand. He was between the box and the bed. I asked him, why he did not lie on the bed, if he was bad, and tie a handkerchief on his head, and that I would make some tea for him. He dropped the trowsers, and laid on them. I did not suspect any thing in the least. He went away. I saw him, and asked him to have some tea: he went away without having tea.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it Lochlane missed any thing - A. On the Saturday, Lochlane called my husband up stairs; he said he had been robbed. My husband called me up stairs, I asked him, what he had been robbed of: he said, seven one-pound notes out of these trowsers; and then I recollected seeing Harrington have the trowsers on Saturday, in Whitecross-street. I had him brought to my house, and then he was taken in custody. After Harrington left the room there was nobody in the room but Harrington, until I went up to make the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other persons that had access to this room besides the prisoner - A. Yes, my husband slept in the room, and

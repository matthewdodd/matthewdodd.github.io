On Monday, the 11th of October, I went to work about eight o'clock—I hung my coat and waistcoat on a nail in the first-floor in the C warehouse—about half-past one, when I was delivering skins on the quay, I turned and saw a man with a broad back, and I thought he had my coat on—I went up to him, saw a mark on it, I knew it was my coat—I took him by the arm and said, "You have got my coat"—he said he had a wife and five children, and said, "For God's sake do have mercy on me"—this is my coat and waistcoat.</p>

I was at the warehouse between one and two o'clock, on the 11th of October—I was sent to the long-room—I was away about five minutes—I went to the first floor—on returning, I saw the prisoner there, who had no right to be there—I said, "Halloo! who Are you, what is your will?"—he seemed confused, and said nothing for the moment—he then walked past me very quickly, saying all was right—he walked with his face towards the wall, from me, avoiding my seeing his face—I said, "I don't think it is all right"—I followed him down stairs, till we came to the last division of the quay, when he turned himself, and said, "Halloo, <hi rend="italic">Bill!</hi>"—"Halloo! "says I—I took him by the collar, and said, "Is this you?" he said, "Yes"—by this time Avery came up and claimed the coat.</p>

On Saturday evening Avery met me outside the Dock, and gave me two fox-skins, and told me to dispose of them—on Monday I sold them, I gave him the money, he gave me part of it back—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Sam,</hi> I want some money"—I said, "I have got none"—he staid some time, and then said, "Go up stairs, take my coat and waistcoat and pawn it"—I said, "Your coat and waistcoat is locked up in Budd's cupboard"—he told me to go and get it.</p>

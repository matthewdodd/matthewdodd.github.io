Dalton said, she would have them; the other said, she would not; they disputed some time: then Dalton took them up, and said, I'll be d - 'd, if I have not them, and put them under her arm. I expected them to come in at the door, and pay me, but they went away with them: I called after them, but she carried them clean off. I went out, and to the corner of the Minories, I could not see them; I concluded my sausages were gone: coming back again, I met them, and said to Dalton, Good woman , pay me for the sausages: she opened her arms, and said, I have no sausages of yours. Said I, you took them away. She fell to beating me in the public street; Driver said, roll the old bitch in the dirt; there were people there that prevented them: then I got in my shop again, and thought farewell women, farewell sausages: they followed me into my shop, and beat me notoriously. I did not apprehend this to be robbery at first; but they would neither pay me for them, nor own they had them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Racquet-court, Fleet-street. The prisoner was in my occasional employ—on the 14th of March, I sent him to the post-office with a bag,) containing nineteen packages of newspapers—I followed him immediately he took them out, and at the post-office I ex<lb></lb>amined the bag—I missed three packages, containing forty-seven news<lb></lb>papers, worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—not more than eight minutes had elapsed from the time he left my house—he went very rapidly—I took him just as he was putting them in at the post-office—I said, "How is it the string is untied?"—He said it was just as I gave it him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I proposed to him to give me the direction, (and I would pay the postage,) to write into the country to know whether they had been received. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Yes, he did; and I have no doubt they were received; but they were forwarded afterwards, and perhaps the same night—it was half-past five o'clock when I took him, and they take them in at the post-office till half-past seven o'clock—I followed him immediately he left my house—he went very fast, but I kept sight of him till he got to Queen's-head-passage—I then missed him—I went on to the post-office and waited three minutes till he came—when I found the papers were gone, I went home and sent duplicates of them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K,</hi> 486). About a quarter past 3 o'clock on the morning of 31st January, I was on my way home, and saw the prisoner near the Albion public-house, Stratford-bridge-road, near the premises of Mr. Burford the dyer—a line of railway separated him from it—he was coming from Mr. Burford's—he turned back away from me as if avoiding me—upon that, I concealed myself in a place belonging to the Albion public-house—presently he came up, pretended to be very drunk—he rolled against a wall—I said, "Cook, what do you do out at this time in the morning?"—he said, "I have been having a drop of beer"—I said, "Have you got anything?"—he said, "What would I have?"—I put my hand on to the left side of his jacket, took out a piece of lead rolled tightly up—I asked him if he had any more, and at that time a second piece dropped—that was in a half circle, as if it had been round his body—I said, "You must consider yourself in custody on suspicion of stealing that"—I held him with one hand, and sprang my rattle with the other—he seized me by the neck with both his hands, and threw me to the ground—we struggled some time, and he escaped—on the morning of 24th April at half-past 8, I went with Toff a constable, to the East India-docks, and found the prisoner there outside—I told him to consider himself in custody as an escaped prisoner, on a charge of felony—he immediately threw me on the ground and pummelled my head on the pavement—it required six constables to hold him—I, with Mr. Burford, have compared the lead with the roof of Mr. Burford's dye-house—it matches in every particular—one piece of the lead which the prisoner dropped, looked as if it had been used for some years—another piece was quite bright at the edge, as if fresh cut.</p>

               <p>but there is a gate in a wooden fence that is always open—the railway fence should protect the prosecutor's place from the railway—that is a wall and a wooden fence—the wall it about six feet high, and the wooden fence is defended by sharp sails and spikes—I have seen it since—the wall is intended for a red wall; it is not white, and it is not red, but an ordinary wall; you may call it red—it was a dreadfully rough night, and I cannot describe the state of the prisoner's clothes at the time—it was very dark indeed—I will take my oath it was the prisoner—there was a gas-lamp on the path—I don't know that it was too dark to look at his dress; I was too much engaged to do so—I was never a carpenter, nor a plumber and glazier—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the lead—it had been nailed on the roof.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer and dyer, at Stratford—on February 1st, I examined the roof of my dye-house, having had my attention called to it, and found that some lead had been taken from the gutter eaves—lead like this was afterwards shown to me by the police—I have compared it with the roof, and it corresponds with the lead that is left—this lead is my property—it is a peculiar bending eave, and here are the peculiar marks where it came over the water-spout—I can tell from those circumstances that it is mine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there a wide ditch separating your grounds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from Mr. Kay's—it is ten or twelve feet wide, and there is water in it—the banks are grass and dirt—there has been a sewer made—the ground it soft as it generally is by the side of a ditch; a kind of oozy ground—between my property and the railway there it a fence of wood and wall, about six or seven feet in height—my land is all grass land—it is not grass directly under the eaves—there is a pathway along, and then you come to the railway, and then there is the high wall opposite—the path where the man was met by the policeman runs from Abbey-hills—the eaves of the dye-house are about six feet from the ground.</p>

I live at 1, Hook's-lane, Peckham, and am a laundress—the prisoner lives in the same house—Emily Ellen Pearce lived there with him as his wife, and the child Stephen Pearce is, I believe, their child—on 10th January, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I heard the child crying, and said to my daughter, "Have you seen Mrs. Harding go out?"—she said, "Yes, she has gone out"—it was crying as if its head was under the clothes—I heard the father cough, and when I knew he was there, I took no further notice—Emily Pearce was gone about half an hour, and when she came back she went into her room and brought the baby out to me, and said she thought it was in a fit—it was very black all round the nose, and the mouth and eyes were closed—it was not able to cry—the mother asked me to feel its head—I felt the back of it, and it was very soft, as if it had had a bad bruise or fall, and it seemed very wet with perspiration, as if it had been under the bed-clothes—I persuaded her to take it to the</p>

                  </hi>. I am now living with my mother—I am single—I have known the prisoner eighteen months—about four months ago, I had a child by him—we lived together at No. 1, Hook's-lane, Peckham—the child's name was James Stephen Pearee—he is in Court—on Wednesday, 10th January, about two in the afternoon, I went to my sister's to borrow some money, and left the baby in bed—when I came back, I found it making a funny noise in the bed—the prisoner was left in the room—the baby was sighing, as if he had been crying some time—I said to the prisoner, "What is the matter with baby? has it been crying?"—he said, "No, not long; he is hungry"—I took the baby off the bed, and he said, "Give the baby titty"—I did that, but he would not take the breast—he was quite black in the face, and could not hold himself up—I screamed out, "Baby is dead"—the prisoner said, "Hold your tongue, you silly; there is nothing the matter with it"—when I came back, I found the prisoner sitting by the fire-place—that is not far from the bed—I ran up stairs with the baby to Mrs. Gambler—she told me to take it to a doctor, as there was something the matter with its head—its head felt quite soft—I then went to Mr. Bloomfield—my mother complained to the police—when I re<lb></lb>turned from the doctor's, the prisoner was not there—that was about half-past 4, and he did not come home till 1 o'clock in the morning—he brought a young girl home with him named Nancy Tooke—when he came in he asked me if baby was dead—I said, "No, he is very near dead; what did you do to him?"—he said, "Nothing"—he then asked if I would say he was tipsy, and that baby fell off his lap—I said, "No, it is done now, and cannot be helped"—he sat down and cried—then Nancy Tooke asked me to say the same, to say that baby fell off his lap when he was left with it tipsy—he took a knife off the sideboard, and was about to leave the room, when Nancy Tooke threw him on the bed, and took the knife from him—the surgeon came directly afterwards—when I left the child with the prisoner it was perfectly well and healthy—on the Saturday previous I went out and left baby at home with the prisoner, and when I came back, its mouth was cut and bleeding, the top lip was cut inside—I asked him then what was the matter with it—he said he had let him fall—he was sober then, and he was also sober on the Wednesday—the prisoner always seemed very kind to the child until after Christmas, and then he seemed snappish and spiteful with him—he used to halloa at it, and try to beat it—he said he was too old and artful—I lived on very good terms with the prisoner—I was. short of money.</p>

               <p>he does not go to sleep there—he was not nursing the child when I went out, it was on the bed—when I came back it was not on the same side that I had left it, it was on the other side—it was half asleep when I went out—it frequently happens with children when they are left half asleep, that they wake up suddenly and make a noise, and they have then to be quieted—it would be nothing extraordinary for the prisoner if the child cried, to take it up and nurse it—he has frequently nursed it, and seemed very fond of it.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at 8, Peckham-rye, Peckham—on Wednesday, 10th January, Mrs. Pearce came to me with a child—I examined it, and found the head very much swollen, particularly on the right side—the child was very pallid, and greatly exhausted—I examined it more par<lb></lb>ticularly next day, and found a very bad fracture across the right side of the head, with the bone depressed in one part nearly an inch in diameter—the fracture was just above the right ear, extending backwards and upwards—both ears were bruised, and there was a bruise on the lower part of the back, to the right of the spine—it must have been a severe blow—the child is in great danger at the present time, and will be for some months hence—it has rallied a great deal, and improved very much—it is impossible to say to what extent it may suffer from that injury—my opinion is this fracture was caused by some violent blow—I am hardly in a position to say whether a fall off a chair would cause such an injury—I have an opinion that it would not—there were marks of violence on the left ear, and one on the right ear; the head was very much swollen and fractured, and one on the back.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would all those symptoms have been caused by a fall? A. No, I think not; there must have been something extra besides the fall to have caused the bruises—the serious part of the mischief might possibly have been caused by a fall, but I do not think it is likely.</p>

               <p>are not in a position to say that it was not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it likely that it was caused that way—it must have fallen some height to have pro<lb></lb>duced such an injury—the skull was not only fractured but there was a depression, and you could put your thumb in the hole—I should not like to say that a fall on the edge of a fender would not produce that, but the edge of a fender would have produced a long cut, this was oval—a fender must have a peculiar projection to have caused this depression—one with a ball projecting might have caused it—this child was four months old—the skull is entirely formed at that age—some children's heads are much earlier formed than others—I have not read "Holden's Manual of Human Osteology."</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Nicholas Winsland, a builder. On the morning of the 7th of July, between six and seven o'clock, I was on his premises in Duke-street, Bloomsbury—I saw the prisoner, accom<lb></lb>panied by a lad, come in there with a horse and cart—I looked at the cart, and saw a sack in it, with something in the bottom of it—that was the only thing I observed in the cart—I then went to the joiner's shop, and saw from the door the prisoner take the sack from the cart and pitch it on the pavement—he then got out of the cart, took the sack, and went into my master's cart-horse stable—I then went into a room, the window of which looked towards the dung-hole, and saw him bring three parcels of hay and put them into the cart, and the boy, who was in the cart, <hi rend="italic">covered the hay over</hi> with dung—the prisoner then brought a sack and put it into the cart, and that was covered with dung—the sack presented such an appearance as it would if corn had been in it—the hay and the sack were so covered</p>

               <p>that persons would see nothing but the dung—I then went into the counting house and stated what I had seen—the policeman was procoitd, and we waited till the cart went out of the yard—we then stopped it, and took the prisoner—the policeman asked what he had got—he said, "Nothing but dung"—I helped to unload the cart—I found the sack and the hay under it—I saw the sack opened, and it contained corn.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable E</hi> 51.) I was called in and stopped the cart at the gate—the prisoner was driving it—I asked him what he had got in the cart—he said, "Nothing but dung"—I asked him three times over, and the third time he admitted that he had got a little corn and hay—he said he had bought the corn of some woman, whose name he mentioned, at Turnham-green, and the hay he said he had taken out of the stable—he said it was sweepings—there was nothing in the appearance of the cart to induce any person to think that there was any thing but dung in it—I removed the dung, and then found a layer of hay, then dung, and then the body of the cart filled with hay, and under that the corn—there was some chaff on the top of the cart—here is five pecks and-a-half of the corn, and seventy pounds of hay—it if nothing like what may be called sweepings.</p>

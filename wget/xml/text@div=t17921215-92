               <p>I am a publican; I took the prisoner coming out of the hoard with it, he had it on his shoulder; I came up to him and asked him what he was going to do with that piece of timber; he said, he was going to carry it to his master; I told him he must carry it a door or two further; I made him bring it to our door; I had him taken into custody and had him taken to his master; the timber was taken into our house that night.</p>
               <p>Court to Winkworth. How came the timber at your house - It was brought by Wharton the constable and the prisoner while I was paying the men; I can particularly swear to this timber because I had a piece cut off for a small house I am building in Worship-street; this man was a servant of mine a <rs id="t17921215-92-deflabel520" type="occupation">labourber</rs>

               <p>Q. Were they on when the constable brought it to you? - I did not examine it then; I have tried it the next day with the other piece of timber, and I found it answer exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did it for real distress and want; I had not a farthing in the world nor could I get any relief from the parish where I belong to; I took a piece of wood whether it is the same or no I cannot tell.</p>

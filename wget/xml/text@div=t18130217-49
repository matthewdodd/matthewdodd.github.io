On the 9th of February, the prisoner came into the shop with another woman; she asked to look at some prints. I shewed them some. The woman that was with her bought three yards and a half of print, and paid for it. The woman stood by me, and the prisoner left her and went to the window, and put something under her left bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what she took - A. No, I did not. She took something, and run out of the shop with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow her - A. No. Two women outside of the door saw her take it as well as me. One of our young men came into the shop; he ran after her and brought her back. We sent for an officer; he searched her and found nothing. The shawl has never been found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look in the window and see what was gone - A. We did. We searched the window and we missed a shawl.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen that shawl - A. I had seen it about three days before.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many shawls in the window - A. Yes, perhaps twenty or thirty.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether she took any thing or not; you saw her put her hand in the window - A. Yes, and I afterwards saw her put her hand into her bosom; what she took I cannot say. This happened on the Tuesday to the best of my knowledge. I saw the shawl on the Saturday night before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. This young woman went to the window, put her hand forward; what she took you do not know. You cannot say that she had any thing in her hand - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in the shop when the prisoner come in - A. No, I was down stairs drinking tea. Some women came in and said they had seen a woman go out that had put a shawl under her cloak. I went after her to John-street; a person told me that was her. She crossed the road, stood at a gin shop, and turned round.</p>
               <p>Q. You overtook her in John-street, did you - A. Yes; that is about forty or fifty yards from the shop. I asked her if she was not the person that was in our shop. She said, yes. I asked her to come back with me. She did. She was quite alone. Jackson, the officer, came and searched her, and found nothing on her. She was taken to Marlborough-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see her have any shawl - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what shawls there were in the window - A. There were a great many shawls in the window, of different kinds.</p>
               <p>Q. You, perhaps, do not know that any was gone - A. I examined myself and found that one was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that one before - A. About a week before. I remember that particular one. We had two long shawls of the same description. The value of the shawl was twenty-four shillings.</p>

I went into the kitchen to take some bread up stairs for breakfast. The area gate is left open until a certain time in the day, in order to prevent dirt from coming in at the front door. It is a regular rule to lock it up at two o'clock in the day. The key is given to my master every night; he puts the key out in the morning; it is unlocked at eight o'clock, or near nine sometimes. I went up stairs to take some bread, I returned in five minutes, not more than six, to the outside; I found the door open, I missed the dish and cover, which I had left facing the pantry-door; I immediately went into the street, supposing somebody had been there, and saw the prisoner running with a parcel before him; the parcel was supported with his two hands before him; I pursued him, and overtook him in Norton-street; we saw about six hundred yards altogether, before I overtook him; when I got within twenty yards of him, I called stop thief; he then let the dish and cover fall, continuing to run as fast as he could; there were two men approaching at that time in Buckingham-street, they attempted to stop him, he crossed over; I laid hold of him, I collared him; he said, he hoped I would let him go at liberty as it was his first offence. I took him back to my master's house; another man carried the dish and cover, and tablecloth. They are here.</p>

            I was up stairs, about half past nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner go down the area, and come up again; my fellow servant came up the area steps. I asked him if he wanted that man that came up the area, I could not hear whether he made any answer or not. I said he was gone up Portland-place; he pursued him. When the prisoner came up the area, he had a parcel before him covered with a white cloth.</p>

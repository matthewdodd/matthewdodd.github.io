                  </hi>. I am the wife of Dennis Martin, a pork-butcher; he is in the employ of Thomas Field, my father, in Tottenham-court-road. On the 10th of June, about four o'clock, I was going into the parlour, I happened to turn my head, and saw a young man look very hard in—I saw the prisoner take the looking-glass from a chiffioniere in the shop—I went after him and caught him in the public-house with the glass—I caught him round the waist—he said, "What do you want?"—I said, "You va<lb></lb>gabond, you have stolen that glass"—he put it down, and struck me a tremendous blow in the face.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What attracted your attention to the glass? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was there to mind the shop—I was not minding the glass in particular—there was a person very much like you standing, watching—I saw his mouth go, but I did not hear what he said—I saw you take the glass—I am certain you are the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Duke-street, Bloomsbury. I was passing, and saw the prisoner come from the shop with the glass in his hand—he passed by me into the public-house—the witness came and seized him—he put it down, and struck her in the face—he ran across the road—I pursued—he was taken at the corner of Store-street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I passed near the shop about four o'clock, and was about to enter the public-house, when I was seized and pulled back by this young woman—I pushed her from me, fearing it might cause a quarrel—I then walked on, and was followed by some man, and I ran from him—the woman <hi rend="italic">trumped</hi> up this charge against me—I solemnly declare my innocence.</p>

            ? - I did, and no other. I sent over to the Navy office for a search, and on this being returned, I found it was more than ten pounds due; I then informed the prisoner that the will must stop to be proved in Doctors-commons.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it is the custom of the office not to pay any more money than ten pounds without the will is proved? - Yes; or letters of administration. I gave the will to one of the junior clerks, to enter in the proper book; he is not here. I then made the usual noration on it myself, which is inserted in the office for inspecting seamens wills, to which I signed my name. I then stamped it with the official seal on the office, and delivered it to the prisoner, in order to obtain a probate of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards that you saw the prisoner again? - On the morning of the 22d of the same month of July; I believe it was Tuesday. He claimed the certificate, the probate being in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. On receiving that certificate he becames entitled to the produce of the pay? - He does. I made out the usual certificate on parchment, and delivered it to him, giving him directions where to apply for the payment.</p>
               <p>Q. In the mean time you had received the probate? - The probate had been sent the night of the 21st, or the morning of the 22d.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was paid at all? - I cannot speak to that.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did you direct him to apply? - To Mr.

               <p>Q. Would he, representing himself as master of these boys, be entitled to their wages on producing these indentures? - I believe he would. It is a different department to ours. I had a perfect recollection of having seen him before; I recollected under what character, but not under what name; I asked him if I had not seen him before in that place, and if he had not claimed the wages due to a son. He said he had been there before. I asked him what his son's name was; he said

On the 10th of August I saw the prisoner in the hall of office, before his conversation took place with Mr. Cranston; I am not confident how long before. The prisoner presented me papers, which were marked C. B. indentures, the same as Mr. Cranston speaks of. I perceived they were indentures of apprentices, and I found considerable difficulty in comprehending what the prisoner had said; I therefore desired him to state his case in writing. I afterwards went down stairs to the office of Mr. Cranston, the last witness, and I observed to Mr. Cranston, that I found considerable difficulty in comprehending what the prisoner said or what he wanted, or words to that effect. Mr. Cranston, in answer said, that there was something extraordinary in the business, or words to that effect; for that it appeared that the prisoner at the bar had been sworn in by the name of

She said, sir, the man is run away, or words to that effect; on which, as the prisoner appeared to me, either through ignorance or design, to have been guilty of a great offence, I did not think it agreeable to my public duty to let him escape; I followed him, and he got up to the top of Somerset-stairs, nearly out of Somerset-house, but he stopped before I came up to him on my calling to him, and a messenger passing by at the same time, I desired him to take him into cus-</p>

            , who belongs to the workhouse of Spittall-fields, called on me, and my not being at home, he left word requesting that I would call on him; I went to him and found him ill; he told me that he had received intelligence that his son, in his Majesty's sea service, was killed by the enemy, and requested I would go and receive his son's wages for him, which I did undertake, and I was told at the office that as it exceeded ten pounds I must administer; I accordingly went and administered as they directed me, and received the money in Barker's name, having gone by his authority, and gave him the money. Some time after this, one Buckea, of Spittal-fields, hearing that I had got the money for Mr. Barker, came and requested of me to go to the navy office to enquire what wages was due to two sons of his apprentices. I went to the navy office, and the clerk recollecting that I had been there before, gave him some suspicion; sent for a constable, and brought me before a magistrate, and Barker was there, who said that I gave him the money that I received, and Buckea only sent me to know what he could do with his apprentices. That is my lamentable case, and I hope it will appear to your Lordship and Court, that I had no criminal intention in view. I went by Barker's direction, and gave him the money, as to Buckea, I made no claim of any, and did not think that the making such enquiry would be deemed criminal. I am now upwards of seventy years, and never brought before a court before, and humbly hope that your Lordship in the midst of justice will shew mercy to me. Mr. Barker desired me to do the business for him; my having a son dying at sea, I had a great deal of trouble to get his money; I was about three quarters of a year getting it, going backwards and forwards to the navy office, and there was a gentleman told me he could get it for me; accordingly I gave him a letter of attorney, and he got the money, and went off with it. Mr. Barker knowing this, said get this money if you-can for me, make use of my name. He says Esq. Hopkins will give me a character.</p>

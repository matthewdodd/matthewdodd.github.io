                  </hi>. I keep the Canning beer-shop, Plaistow-marshes. Last Saturday evening I went out, in five minutes I received a message, and came back and found there was a fight, one man was on the floor—the prisoners were there—Thomas had this chair in his hand (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), John a quart-pot—I said, "Oh! don't fight and knock my furniture to pieces; give me that chair, give me that pot"—Thomas struck me with the chair on the mouth and made it bleed, and gave me a blow on the arm—I cannot swear he did it on purpose—John rose the pot up and said he would strike me with it—I ran for the police—there was a terrible struggle in the house—I was afraid to go in the front way—I went in at the back, went into the bar, and found some of my customers were endeavouring to push out the prisoners who had insulted them—they got them out—I locked the door, and had scarcely done so when a large brick came right through the panel—I ran into the kitchen with my children, and saw no more, but heard bricks coming against the door—Thomas said, "Give me my clothes or I will pull the house down" (they had stripped in the parlour to fight).</p>

                  </hi> I am servant to Mrs. Way. After the prisoners were put out, a brick came through the door and struck me on the elbow, I fell insensible—I do not know who threw it, but the prisoners were outside at the time, and one of them put his head through the broken place and asked for his clothes—I went to get them, and the brick struck me.</p>

                  </hi> I was present and saw Thomas strike Mrs. Way with the chair—she had asked him for it, and he said, "Get out of the way or I will knock you down," and struck her with it—after they were turned out, a panel of the door was sent in by the prisoners—Thomas put his head in and said, "If you don't give me my clothes I will pull the b----y house down"—he turned away, and John threw a brick in, which sent the girl flying, and it hit me on the breast and sent me about three yards and a half—he said, "It would be a mercy to kill the fellow"—I found the girl had fainted away, and ran to the door and said, "For God's sake take the men in custody, they have killed the girl," and Thomas hit me between the eyes so that the blood flowed.</p>

I went to the Canning and found the door-panel right out—I found the girl fainting and the landlady bleeding from the mouth—she showed me her arm, it was black and blue all the way up—I received information and found the prisoners had secured themselves in a house in Plaistow-marsh, about a quarter of a mile off—several <hi rend="italic">gents</hi> had followed them—they forced open the door—I went in, and found John with a poker in one hand and a pair of tongs in the other—he was going to strike me, but saw me drawing my cutlass and he said he would go quietly.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon. I examined Mrs. Way and found a wound on her lip produced by her tooth, from a blow; her arm and shoulder were bruised—the girl was fainting, her elbow was very seriously injured—there is no probability of her moving her arm for some time—it is not fractured, but inflammation is going on, it is getting worse rather than better.</p>

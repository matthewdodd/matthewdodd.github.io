                  </hi>. I keep the White Hart public-house, in Hooper-square, Lambeth-street, Whitechapel. On Saturday night, the 12th of March, I received some information from Jones, in consequence of which I went into my yard, where I had a pump, at the back of my house, attached to the water-closet—I missed the body of the pump—I went with Jones after the prisoner, and found him in Lambeth-street, in custody of a man who had hold of him—I said, "What have you got there?"—he made no answer—I said, "You have got my property there"—he had got the body of the pump—I said, "You must bring it back"—he said be would not—I then told him he must take it back, it was my property, and was stolen from my yard—he said he would not—I said I should give him in charge—a policeman came up, and I gave him in charge—I had seen the pump safe about an hour before—it was fixed in a wooden case—this now produced is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother, in Lambeth-street, Whitechapel. On Saturday night, the 12th of March, I was at the door of the White Hart public-house, in Hooper-square—I saw the prisoner come out of the passage with this pipe under his arm—when he got to the step of the door I spoke to the prosecutor—the prisoner went away with it—I saw him again, in about a minute, near the prosecutor's house—he was in the act of going on with it again—he had been resting—a man named Thompson then came up, and took him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. The prisoner was given into my custody by the prosecutor, charged with stealing the lead—I said, "What are you going to do with this?"—he said, "It is no business of yours."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been in the prosecutor's house ever since twelve o'clock that day, drinking and playing at cards. I had occasion to go into the yard. I saw a man, apparently a carpenter, with a candle in his land. I said, "You have got a late job there." He said, "Yes, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184204040098"></xptr>
               <p>have." After several observations, he asked if I had any objection to earn 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I said no. He said, "I want you to carry something to my cart in Lambeth-street. I went into the tap-room, and borrowed a piece of string. The man said, "Carry the pump to my cart, and I will pay you for your trouble." I took the pump, and, when I got outside Thompson took me by the collar. The boy said, "You have got Mr Donsonan's pump there." I said, "I know I have;" he said, "I shall go and tell him." I waited till he came back. Mr. Donsonan came and collared me, and asked what I did with it; I said, if he would let me go back to the house, I would explain; the carpenter made off as soon as I was taken.</p>

            , that lives in your house - A. There is she, is a single woman, she was in the house on the 13th of September, about six in the evening. At the time we have just mentioned, I was sitting in a room having my tea, the door and the whole front of that room is glass, I saw the door that goes into Freeman's-court,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190042"></xptr>open; I have a front door that opens into Cheapside, and another door that goes into Freeman's-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say, with certainty, that that door was closed - A. I am not clear that it was not closed, I am not certain, no one made their appearance; I have not the smallest doubt that the door was closed.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any body come in - A. No one: I went forward into the shop expecting some one coming in; I went on the threshold of the door, looked up the court, to the right and to the left, and saw nobody that was likely to be coming in, I then shut too the door and returned into the room again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you closed the door again - A. That I am sure of, and then I returned to the room where I had been drinking my tea, and just as I sat down, I saw a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you at all tell whether he came in at the front door, or the side door - A. I am certain that he came in at the side door, in Freeman's-court.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that side door locked - A. No. The counter is exceeding long, from the position I saw him in, I am quite certain that he must have come in at the side door, between the time of my going into the room and drinking a cup of tea. When I saw him, he was in the act of taking something off my board, where I have a number of watches laying on the spot towards which part I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive that your side door was open from the manner in which he stood - A. I have no doubt it was; I called my servant down stairs and advanced to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were advancing what became of the man in your shop - A. He turned out of the shop and shut the door after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the door close - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you opportunity enough to observe him to know whether either of the men at the bar was the man that was in your shop - A. I have no doubt but

             was the man. I immediately went into the street, I looked into the court and saw the man just turn the corner of the court into Cheapside, the door is close to Cheapside, and Cheapside was very thin of people, there were no more than three people near; I immediately ran up to him, caught hold of his left arm, told him he must go back with me immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you had left your shop could you perceive whether any of your watches or watch cases had been taken - A. No, I had not time, I did not know whether I had lost any thing or not. He turned round with me to go back, according to my desire; I thought I discovered a wish for him to get his right hand round to his pocket; I was very watchful of that and kept him forward with my right hand, I had hold of his left hand, I thought he wanted to get rid of something; at that instant, another man joined him, which is

            , and Day handed to him a watch, and something in paper, which I conceived to be in paper; I did not see where North came from; I saw Day hand something to him, thought it was a watch at the time, or a paper with case in it. It passed quickly on to the other, but it appeared to me to be a watch; I then laid hold of the old man, and kept hold of both, I seized him by the collar, I had hold of the other by the arm. They struggled violently, I was afraid that I might loose one or both. I called out stop thief, some people closed in against me in the front, I then dragged them into the first door that was open, Messrs. Townshend and Simpson's shop, two doors from my own, and through a small passage, I took them into the warehouse, there they were secured. They dropped the watch and a pair of cases in the passage; I saw some, thing in the set of falling while they were in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them say any thing at the time they were secured - A. No; I told the persons round me under what charge, and for what reason, I had taking them, they neither of them said any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. After the watch and cases were picked up, did you know them to be yours - A. I knew them to be mine in the place where they were dropped, I had no doubt of it, both the watch and the cases.</p>
               <p>Q. After they were secured, on going back to your shop, did you perceive there was a watch and a pair of cases missing, which you had when you were at tea - A.Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. What watch was it - A. A metal watch; one left with me for a glass to be put in, it belonged to a customer.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the worth of that - A. Twenty shillings. The watch cases, they were also a customer's, they had been gilded, and had not been taken out of the paper; the cases were worth ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were either of these prisoners known to you before - A. No, I never saw them, to my knowledge, before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say it was between five and six o'clock when this robbery was committed upon you, perhaps you observed them through the mirror - A. I have no mirror in my shop; I saw the person in my shop, and when, I went into the street, from the figure of the man, and the colour of his coat, altogether, I knew him to be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you hang the watches up that do not belong to yourself - A. They were laying on the counter the cases were wrapped up in paper, the watch was laying without glass.</p>
               <p>Q. If the cases were wrapped up in paper, I want to know how you could see the cases - A. It is tishy paper, I could see the yellow cases through the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took hold of Day the other prisoner was not present - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the people came about, it excited their curiosity - A. No; I had only hold of his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the old gentleman at your shop - A. I did not. After I took hold of Day, I thought there seemed to be a wish to get at his pocket, I kept him forward; the old man presented himself all in a moment.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoners were taken into your neighbour's shop, there was nothing found upon them - A. The property was dropped in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that you put too the door - A. I am quite sure; I supposed the wind might open it the first time, seeing nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. If you supposed the wind opened it one time, the wind might open it another time - A. I am quite sure the door was shut the second time, because I shut it close too the second time, and tried it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at tea, you are not sure that you saw either of the prisoners there - A. I am sure I saw a man, I am perfectly sure that the mans features that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190043"></xptr>I saw in the shop, was the man in the street.</p>

As soon as I went into the house I saw the two prisoners, I knew them before; I said, I know these men before; the gentleman said, they have been into my shop and robbed me of my watch and cases; they had opened his door and took them out. I took them down to the counter; Mr. Anness gave me the watch and cases, I have kept there ever since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Secretary of the Friend-in-Need Sick Fund Society—I have our enrolled rules here—the prisoner was engaged by the Society to get persons to become members, and to receive their sub<lb></lb>scriptions—the prisoner's appointment is in writing; this is it—(<hi rend="italic">This appointed George Clark as</hi> "agent," <hi rend="italic">he agreeing to remit all moneys once a week to the office, and send in a detailed balance-sheet once a month</hi>)—he was our agent, with an interval, up to 10th January—his agency altogether ceased at one time, but he was re-appointed in the same way—I have not that appointment here—an explosion of gas blew out the office windows, and a great number of papers were blown away, burnt, or lost—I have searched the office for the second appointment, but cannot find it, and believe it was destroyed at the fire—it was precisely the same as the first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there not a duplicate filed under the Friendly Societies Act? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but the prisoner would have a copy—the second appoint<lb></lb>ment was placed away with a number of others in the room immediately over the office—I believe the date of it was January, 1861—I have not seen it since it was originally signed by my brother, who was then Secretary, in my presence—I read it, and saw it placed away in a pigeon-hole in the office, kept on purpose for these articles—I recollect it because Mr. Clark came to be appointed again after his return from the Crimea—the fire was in April, 1861; it was an explosion of gas in the second floor, but it blew out the whole of the front windows of the house, and a great quantity of papers were blown about the streets, and not recovered—I have since searched for this document in the pigeon-holes, and every other likely place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know that it was the same? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are all on printed forms—this was near the top of the pigeon-hole, and therefore would be more likely to be disturbed—papers in that very pigeon-hole were disturbed—instructions on a portion of the same sheet are given to agents at the time they are appointed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WEIGHTMAN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know what the instructions were in the second document? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first is a little longer, but the wording of the second is precisely the same—the prisoner ceased to be the Society's agent in January, 1863—he sent in his accounts prior to closing his agency—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the books issued by the Society to its members—we have entries in our books of the name of William Makepeace—the majority of entries are in Clark's writing, and some in his wife's—I have seen him write—the last entry by Makepeace to Clark is January 19th, 1863—it is the agents duty to make a return of his cash weekly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any return made by the prisoner of payment in December? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A number of returns—the last is August 18th, 1862—it is the agent's duty to make a return of all members' last payment, and the reason of their ceasing to pay—this is in the prisoner's wife's writing, and it states that the last payment by William Makepeace was on September 9th, 1861, and that the policy had lapsed—lapsed policies are retained our books thirteen weeks, and I have called the prisoner's attention to the fact of their remaining longer—I found thirty-six week deducted, and he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186304060007"></xptr>
               <p>no right to charge more than thirteen; he replied that they were respectable people, and there was a chance of getting a good bit of the money in, therefore he did not make the return earlier.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEWIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I see this appointment is dated 22d February, 1854, how long did he continue to act under it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Till some time in 1856—I will not be positive as to the date—he then ceased to be an agent, but was re-appointed in 1860—I will swear that a second appoint<lb></lb>ment was signed; that was in the spring of 1860—I am certain under the first appointment the prisoner had 10 percent commission, and half a crown a week; he also had the half a crown a week after the second appoint<lb></lb>ment—I swear that, and these books prove it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I see here, "In order further to stimulate the agent, &amp;c., a small weekly allowance will be made of half a crown, bat in no case will such allowance be made until a profitable and prosperous agency is established;" in those the instructions you give to your agents? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, we call it a salary—the returns were generally made by the prisoner's wife, who did all the writing for him—in some instances one or two entries were in the prisoner's writing, but, as a rule, they were his wife's, by his knowledge and sanction—the money was not always sent to our office by the wife in letters; some<lb></lb>times he brought it himself—we have about 500 agents distributed over the country—they send us in a balance-sheet at the end of the month—it some<lb></lb>times happens that a balance-sheet is down to the end of the month, and the balance remains unpaid—we sometimes do not receive sums which have been paid by our agents during the week—we frequently received the money from the prisoner long after the payment of it, and after the balance-sheet was made up; that was the reason we discharged him, because we could not make him more punctual as to the payment of the money—I called his attention to some names in the return, and he looked at it—the last payment is December 9th, 1861; I showed it to the prisoner in August, 1862—he is still a member of the Society, but he has ceased to be agent—his wife did not make returns after August—we have sent accounts to him in August, October, November, December, and January, and had no return for either of them—when an agent makes a return it is gummed in facing his account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WEIGHTMAN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you frequently called the prisoner's attention to the returns in his wife's writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he acknowledged them as being under his authority; he always submitted them as his—I am sure I called his attention to the name of Makepeace and several others; he said that they were decent, respectable people; he did not think it would be allowed to lapse—if Mr. Makepeace had died, and owed more than thirteen weeks, we should have considered that he had no claim on the Society.</p>

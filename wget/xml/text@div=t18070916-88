             was a lodger of ours. On the 25th of August suspecting that she was a robbing of us; we watched her; when she was gone out my wife and me entered the room, and in the drawers we found these things specified in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the prisoner. - A. A bead maker by trade. When she came home she went up stairs, and went out with a bundle; I followed her as far as Hatton Wall; she saw me and shunned me. I immediately came back and asked my wife to go up stairs to see if she had taken the things away; my wife did, and she said she had taken them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you stop her with the things. - A. I was not positive; I did not like to stop her In the course of half an hour she returned back again; we immediately went up stairs and charged her with these things; she acknowledged they were our property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a beer shop keeper, of the Prince of Wales, Beech street, Barbican. On Tuesday night, 21st Feb., I had about seventy-one or seventy-three sovereigns, I am not quite certain which, in a cash box upstairs in my bed-room, on the second floor, which is the floor above the club-room—between 12 and 1 o'clock on the next day, I heard a female voice screaming; it was my wife—I ran up stairs—a man rushed by me on the stairs, saying he was going for a policeman—when I got a little further up, I saw my wife struggling with the prisoner Williams on the landing, outside the club-room door—I laid hold of Williams—my wife called to me to hold him tight, for he had got all the money—at that moment Johnson came from the parlour, as I was struggling with Williams on the stairs below—Johnson said, "Hold him tight," but at the same time striking and kicking me on the arm, as I was standing on the stairs below him holding Williams—he then rushed by me into the street, and I saw no more of him—Williams took a sovereign out of his mouth, and said, "This is all I have taken"—I had seen them both before at my house; Johnson I had seen several times; and on this morning they came together, and called for a pint of ale, which they drank together in front of the bar; and then Johnson asked me if I had got a room in which they could sit down—I said there was a room up stairs, but there was no fire—they went up stairs together, and were served with a pint of ale up stairs—I went into the club-room, and served them myself—they were drinking together when I took them up a second pot of ale—Williams wanted me to let him go very badly—he was given in charge, and a policeman brought Johnson back—I examined the bedroom door—the lock had not been touched, but a drawer in the bedroom was wrenched open, and the lock was lying inside, wrenched right off—I had locked it myself, a few minutes before, and taken out all the sovereigns but one, which was then missing from the cash-box, which was left—it had not been locked—I found it open, and the papers strewed about the room—if parties were in the club-room, they would, without difficulty, get to the bedroom, up the staircase—I have not lost any money.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time did they come into your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a quarter to 12 o'clock; I believe I stated all this to the Magistrate—the club-room is the common public room, where all persons go who want to sit down—it is the only room I have for persons to sit in—it is quite a common thing for persons who have ale to want to sit down—there are bagatelle skittles on the table, and the prisoners began playing when I took up the ale—there was no one else in the room till the third party joined them—my wife serves occasionally—I swear that the prisoners came in together—I cannot say which came in first—no one was present when I served them with the ale—Johnson asked for it, and paid for it—I first saw Johnson eight or ten yards up the stairs; that was about five stairs down from the landing of the club-room—I had hold of Williams at that time—my wife had then left hold of Williams, and was running up stairs to see what money had been taken—Johnson was not on the same steps as me; he was a few steps higher up—they are very narrow stairs—he said, "Hold him tight, I will run for the police," and struck and kicked me on the shoulder, chest, and arm; he kept on striking and kicking me—it did not last more than three minutes—I mean to say Johnson was three minutes on the stairs—I saw my wife struggling with Williams; she had just let go of him when I first saw her—she was about one stair down from the club-room door—Williams had got away from her when I caught him—I did not see Johnson come out of the club-room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. On 21st Feb., Johnson came down stairs to the bar from the parlour and asked for a screw of tobacco—a few minutes afterwards I was going up to my bedroom, and after I had passed the parlour I heard some one walking in the bedroom—I ran up, the door was open, and the prisoner Williams was standing just inside the room by the door—I took hold of him directly by the neck, and called for my husband—I could see into the room, and saw the chest of drawers open, and the contents thrown about the room—I held Williams till I got to the parlour door—he was trying to get down stairs—I hung on him, and he dragged me down—he threw me down once, and I threw him down—I held him till my husband came—Johnson rushed out of the parlour, and threw me on my back on the stain going up from the parlour to the bedroom—he then went down stairs, and met my husband—I saw my husband seize Williams—I then went up to the bedroom, and looked at the cashbox; it had had 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 74<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it the night before—there was nothing in it when I went in—I saw Johnson brought back in custody—I am quite sure the prisoners are the men—I had not seen them in the morning, as I was in my bedroom when they came in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You did not lose all the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, because my husband had taken it out—I did not see my husband till Johnson had thrown me back on the stairs—I did not see him coming up stairs before I lost hold of Williams—I saw him when we were all in a scramble together, when Johnson threw me back on the stairs—I had lost my hold of Williams when my husband came up—my husband came to the top stair, where there was some struggling—I lost hold of Williams and my husband caught him at the same time—it was almost at the same time that my husband was on the landing that Johnson rushed from the parlour—it was not in passing me that Johnson pushed me down—it is a very small landing—after I was thrown he went down stairs—I went back to the bedroom, and did not see him pass my husband—my husband was on the landing with me when Johnson ran down—I did not see him struggling with my husband at all—I remained up stairs a minute or two, and then came down, and saw my husband holding Williams in the bar—there was nobody else in the bar—I heard the neighbours crying, "Stop thief!"—I serve a good deal in the shop, but had never seen the prisoners before to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 116). On 22nd Feb., some time after 12 o'clock, I was in Whitecross-street—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw Johnson running from Beech-lane towards Fore-street in the direction from Mr. Skelton's house—I am sure he is the man—when I got within a yard of him he held up his finger, and said, "I want you"—I laid hold of him, and said, "You must come back along with me"—I took him back to Mr. Skelton's, and found him holding Williams—I called another</p>

I saw my mare last on Friday, the 27th of October, about eight o'clock at night, and missed her next morning. She was turned into a field - she was sound and well, and worth 10 l. - I found her at Ford's, she was then cut and mangled under the fore leg, with a knife, or something - it must have been done wilfully - she could not move, and was not able to go home for a fortnight. The field gate was asped and chained, but not locked - she is recovered.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Ford, a horse-slaughterer, who lives in Sharp's-alley, Cow-cross. On the 28th of October, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought a black mare, and asked me to buy it. I said I could not, till my master was up. He asked me to let him leave it in the yard, while he went to St. James's, to see after his team. He did so, and came at eight o'clock and said he brought it from Squire Gray's, Wimbley-park. It was wounded, and must have been done with something blunt. I asked how it got wounded? He said they had been harrowing the field, that it took fright and ran over the hedge, my master paid him 30 s. for it - he was a long time before he would take it, and begged me to give him a note to satisfy his master what he got for it, and wanted 1 s. for himself, which my master gave him. He was taken five or six days after. I am sure he is the man.</p>

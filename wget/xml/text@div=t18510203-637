The prisoner has had the management of my land at Merton, fifteen years—he had no authority to sell anything without speaking to me—I had some potatoes in a garden there—the prisoner told me, both before and after Christmas, that there were six tons of Regents and tree tons of Shaw's—they were in five covered pits, which he had no authority to uncover—that was the quan<lb></lb>tity, in my judgment also—I ordered the prisoner to deliver a bushel of Regent's and a bushel of Shaw's to Mr. Baker; and a week after, two tons more—the following day I had twenty-eight sacks myself; I authorized him to deliver no others after I had the twenty-eight sacks—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185102030146"></xptr>
               <p>I have seen them since, and do not suppose there is one ton—I miss between two and three tons—at that time the retail price in the market was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a bushel—the sample produced by Mittell corresponds with mine—I never authorized the prisoner to sell any potatoes to Wheeler, and he had not paid me for any sold to him—the prisoner has about eighteen rods of garden—about Sept. or Oct. I went there once or twice, and saw his potatoes—he told me he had not a very good crop, and I saw some on the table, of a different description to mine—he had about ten rods planted with potatoes—after he had been examined before the Magistrate, he called on me, and told me this was the first offence, and he hoped I would forgive him, he hoped I should have mercy on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, at Merton. I have known the prisoner eleven years—I never heard anything against his character—he sold me a bushel of potatoes—I cannot say whether it was on 14th Jan.—I cannot swear to these, but those which Mittell took away were what I bought of the prisoner—I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bushel; that was rather a low price, but there were a great many small ones among them—a few days after I had another bushel—I saw him come with them down the lane which leads to Mr. Bridge's garden, and also to his own house—the first were in a barrow, and the others in a sack.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, at Mitcham. About Christmas I became a tenant of Mr. Bridge's, and his potato-pits were in my garden—I have seen the prisoner at the pits several times—I was to have two sample-bushels of potatoes, and went with my boy to the pit—the prisoner was there, and told me he had another party to serve over the way before me—I helped him fill two bushel-baskets, and he took them away, towards the Nelson public-house, near which Wheeler lives, leaving me to pick up another bushel into my own basket, which I bad done by the time he came back—I afterwards, on 16th Jan. I had a ton, but no more—the market retail price of such us I had would be 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bushel—I bad seen the prisoner take some out on the 12th.</p>

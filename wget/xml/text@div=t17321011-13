And so I parted with the Cloth-man, and taking my Wallet of Stockings with me, I went in. They pretended to be over-joy'd to see me, and Abigal bid her Sister Betty go for a full Pot of Beer; may, says I, if you send for one Pot, I will send for another, and so we had 2 Pots. It was then between 10 and 11 at Night, and being so late I drank once, and but once, and would go to London; so I went down Stairs, and out of Doors, and the 2 Women follow'd. When I was got about 10 Yards from the House, they laid hold of me, and said, that I should go no farther, for fear I should be robb'd, or come to some Mischief. I told them I would go, and they said again, that I should not, and so they took away my Wallet, and carry'd it in a Doors; I follow'd them, they bolted the Door as soon as I came in, and then they went up Stairs with my Goods, and I after them.</p>

               <p>Harris. Yes; but they were soon thrown out of the Window; and I never set Eyes on any of them afterwards, except these a Pair and an odd one, which were pick'd up near the House by the Watchman, and this Fellow to the odd One, which Sneeshy had sold. I call'd to the Woman below, and said, I was robb'd, and wanted some Body to fetch a Constable; but she could not go out, because her Husband was sick a-Bed, and had no Body but her to look after him; so I went down my self, and before I got out, I heard 2 Men jump out of the Window. The Woman open'd the Street Door, and I went out and stood there with my Knife in my Hand, and swore I would stick the next Man that came out of the Door or the Window; and there I staid till the Watch came up, which was at 2 in the Morning.</p>

            , Beadle. The Watchman call'd me at 11, but he not having a proper Officer, I refused to obey; and about 2 he came again with the Constable, and then I got up. We took the 2 Women, and 2 of the Men, the Hemp-dresser and the Baker; but Sneeshy and the Prisoner Richardson had got off; however we took Richardson in less than 2 Hours afterwards. For he coming again to the House, to enquire what was become of his Companions, a Woman told us of it, and we went and took him. He swore, damn him, he would not go to Jail, for he never was in a Jail in his life; and indeed he had like to have been too hard for us, but my Dog kept him under. Mr. Sorrow, the Constable, would have been here, but poor Man, he's gone aside, he's under a Colour, and can't appear.</p>

            . I was going home to my Lodging, and hearing a Disturbance, I went in with the Constable and Watch to see what was the Matter, and as soon as I was got up, the Prosecutor charged me.</p>

I was a Servant to a Distiler, and got my living honestly.</p>

               <p>Richardson. Did you see us?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No; but I left you both above, and you got out while I went down Stairs, I watch'd at the Door till I came up again with the Constable, and then you were both gone; as for being drunk, I had drank but one Pot of Beer, and part of a Quartern of Gin before I came there.</p>

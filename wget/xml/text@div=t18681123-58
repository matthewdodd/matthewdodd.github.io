                  </hi>. For some six or seven years I have been going by the name of Russell—I was engaged to be married to a Mr. Russell, and took his name after his death—on Sunday, 20th September last, I was living at 64, Tavistock Terrace, Westbourne Park—my servant, Mary Seiler, had been out that night, and had returned—we were the only persons living in the house—about 10.30 we were in the sitting-room together—I heard a noise down stairs, and asked her if she had left open the outer door—she hesitated, and then she said, "Yes, to let the dog out"—I then went down stairs and found that the door was unfastened, but I don't know whether it was opened—I went down first, and Mary followed me, carrying the tea-tray down—I then went and looked about the kitchen and the breakfast-room, but did not see anyone in either of the rooms—Mary looked into the two cupboards, one under the stairs, and another one a little further on—she said there was no one there—I did not look myself—I went with Mary and looked in the scullery, and also a closet in the scullery—there was no one-there—that was the whole search I made—everything then appeared to be</p>

               <p>quiet, and we went up stairs again—I asked Mary to fasten the back door, and I believe it was fastened—the area door was fastened at the beginning of the evening, and I did not look again—before going to bed the gas was turned off at the meter—I went to my bed-room, and Mary went to hers—my room is on the same floor as the sitting-room, only two steps lower—the window looks into the back garden—Mary's room is at the top of the house, also at the back—at that time the gas was turned off at the meter, and there were no lights at all—between 1 and 2 o'clock I was disturbed by the dog growling—he was lying on the foot of my bed—I saw a light shining through my door, which is half glass—I called out, "Mary, is that you?"—I received no answer, but the light was put out immediately—my door was a little open—I hesitated what I should do, and whilst doing that I heard a rustling noise, apparently on the stairs, going from the dining-room to the kitchen, outside my door—I was afraid to go to the door, in case someone might hurt me—the key of the door was outside—I jumped out of bed, and said, "Jip, there are thieves in the house; at them!"—I went to the window, and pulled up the Venetian blind—I opened the window, and was in the act of getting out, screaming "Murder,!" and "Police!" when someone pulled me back into the room—I can't say whether it was a man or a woman—I had a struggle—I don't remember the first blow, which must have been the one on my forehead—in the struggle I took hold of the person's hand several times and prevented many blows—I took away a knife from the person's hand—at the time I took the knife away, the person had ray wrist, and was in the act of cutting my throat—I received all the wounds on that occasion in that struggle—I don't know whether there was one or more in the house—my notion was that there were more, from the noise that was made—directly I took the knife away, they tried to make their escape—I got out of the window then—I don't know how I did get out—I recollect being found at the bottom of the garden, and Mr. Smith, a neighbour, and a policeman coming to me—when I took the knife away from the person I got out of the window with it, and kept it in my hand till I got to the bottom of the garden, and then I placed it on the wall—I told Mr. Smith where he would find it—I had left two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes in a desk in the dining-room—the desk was locked—two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes were missed from my desk afterwards, and the desk was broken open—there was a purse also in the sideboard drawer, which was safe the night before—it contained six or seven shillings—that was missing, and also an opera-glass—I thought there might be more than one person, from the noise that was made to get away.</p>

I am now living at 18, Heathfield Street, Notting Hill, with my mother—on Sunday, the 20th September, I was living with Mrs. Russell, and on that evening I went out at 6.50, and came back about 9.3—Mrs. Russell let me in—there was a lady and gentleman there, who had come after the apartments, and they were afterwards let out—while we were at supper I heard a kind of creaking noise down stairs—I had opened the back door after I came in, as I did every night, to let the dog out, and I had not fastened it up again—we went down stairs and looked into all the cupboards—we never looked up stairs at all—I did not see anyone down stairs—I fastened all the doors before we went to bed—I turned out the gas at the meter—the windows were all fastened—Mrs. Russell then went to bed, and I went as well—about 1.30 I heard my mistress calling for help—I heard the dog growl, and then there was a kind of scuffle in the bed-room—I went down two or three steps, and then heard the door bang—I can't say whether</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Tavistock Road, Westbourne Park, and am a surgeon—on the morning of 21st September, about 2 o'clock, I was sent for to see Mrs. Russell—she was then in the garden—she was assisted to my house, and I have attended her ever since—there was a compound comminated fracture of the skull—in my judgment that was inflicted by this hatchet that was shown me—there was about two inches of the skull crushed, sliced off—I have the fragments here—there was a wound seven inches long, extending from the back of the head through the ear on to the cheek—there was another perpendicular wound on the cheek, several cuts on the hands and wrists, and on the shoulders one or two—there was also a deep punctured wound on the upper part of the right leg, about an inch and a half long, probably done from a stab—the calf of the same leg was very extensively bruised, as if violently grasped—I saw the knife, it had blood upon it—a knife like that would inflict some of the wounds which I have described—there was also blood on the hatchet—Mrs. Russell is still in considerable danger from the loss of skull—there was no wound on the throat—I have described all the wounds.</p>

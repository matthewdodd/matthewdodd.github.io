                  </hi>. I am a manure dealer, living at Camilla Road, Ber-mondsey, and the prisoner was in my employ as horse keeper—on the 13th of this month, I had a horse in my stable at 12 o'clock—it was not there at 6 o'clock; I gave information to the police, and afterwards saw the carcass of the horse at a slaughter house, in the Blackfriars Road—I never gave the prisoner any authority to sell my horse.</p>

There was nothing the matter with his foot except that he kicked and hurt his foot and was under the doctor's care, and he ordered me to put the bran poultices on it—the other horse died of influenza; it is a gathering in the throat—three died; I am a carman and dealer in manure—I sell manure to the farmers in the country; I had eight horses—I lost two and bought two more—I never authorised the prisoner to sell this horse; it was not suitable for working the day I saw it in the stable—it was then worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I gave 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it about six weeks before—I saw its carcass at the slaughter-house; not skinned.</p>

               <p>He did it so openly, it was impossible to escape detection? - He could not escape; I had two other officers along with me; I seized hold of him, and took the spoons out of his hands, and took him into the shop to Mr. Edwards: I had him in custody on suspicion of house-breaking; he was cleared of that.</p>

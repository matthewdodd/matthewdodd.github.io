On the 24th of January the prisoner came to my shop, a little before seven o'clock, and purchased two herrings, for which she gave me one shilling; she had been at the shop about five weeks before, and purchased one in the same way for 1 1/2d. - she did not pay at the time, but called afterwards and paid for it with a bad half-crown, which I had marked, and put by to give her; I mentioned it to her on this occasion, but before I mentioned it she had given me a good half-crown in exchange for the shilling which I had objected to, and when I mentioned about the other half-crown, she said if she had given me a bad one it was unknown to her, and she was willing to exchange it; I saw a purse in her hand, with six or seven good half-crowns in it - she afterwards produced 2 1/2d. or 3d., which she laid on the counter; the patrol was passing, and I gave her in charge - she said if I would let her go she would give me 5s.; I marked the shilling and half-crown, and gave them to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you give her into custody before you got the good half-crown for the bad one? A. No - she gave me the good half-crown for the shilling that I said was bad; I did not see her searched; I afterwards saw the money that was in the purse - I think there were seven good half-crowns; she had a basket, and told where she bought the articles that were in it - I went with the officer, I think, to four places; I found a bad shilling at Brown's, in Cheapside - on going from the watch-house to the Compter she threw away a paper, which I picked up.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What was that? A. A small bottle of some sort of scent, and from that I went to Mr. Brown's.</p>

            . I am a constable, of London-wall. I apprehended the prisoner, and found in her basket a pig's head, a paper of ribbon, and 1 lb. of butter; I asked where she got the pig's head - she said in Honey-lane-market, but could not say where; I went to Mr. Smith, and got this shilling.</p>

            . This half-crown is counterfeit, and these two shillings - they are all of the same metal; the two shillings appear to be from the same impression, and from the same plaster of Paris mould - they are certainly not from a die, for here are the marks of the air-bubbles, which prove they are not from a die.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure that it is not from a die? A. Yes - they are made of what is generally called Queen's metal.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How long have you been in your capacity? A. Almost all my life - it is necessary to state, that the impression on the moulds, from which these are made, is from a good shilling.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. So far, the mould would furnish a better impression than a die? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. JACKSON. Q. Had the prisoner enough to pay for the herring without exchanging the shilling? A. Yes; she laid the first bad half-crown down to me, and I slipped it along - my wife gave her 2s. 4 1/2d; I had marked the half-crown, and kept it for her.</p>

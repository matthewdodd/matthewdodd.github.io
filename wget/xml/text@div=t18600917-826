                  </hi>. I am the wife of Stephen Simmonds—I keep a shop in Weston-street, Bermondsey—on 1st September the prisoner came to my shop and asked for a pennyworth of bread—I served him; he gave me a shilling—I looked at it—my husband stood by—I did not like the look of it, and I said to my husband, "Is this a good shilling?"—he said, "I think so"—I gave the prisoner change, and he left the shop—I bit the shilling, and previous to putting it in the till I found it was bad—I told my hus<lb></lb>band, and he went aud brought the prisoner back—I said, "This is a bad shilling"—he said, "Is it?"—I said, "You are the man who changed a bad shilling here a short time ago"—he denied being in the shop, and said I was mistaken—I said, "You <hi rend="italic">was</hi>, and had a quarter of a pound of bacon, and I will show you the piece I cut off, and I gave you change for a shilling"—I am certain he is the man—there was no other shilling in the till besides those two, and they were both bad—when I received the shilling for the bacon there was no other shilling in the till—about ten minutes after the prisoner had left a boy came in for a pennyworth of cheese, and gave me a bad shilling—these were the only shillings that were in the shop—no one was in the shop all the afternoon—I sent for a constable, and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

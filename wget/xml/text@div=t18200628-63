            . On Monday, the 22d of May, my servant informed me the cattle were stolen. They were unfit for market, they wanted about six weeks in the early part of the season - when they come from grass there is a difference in the flesh easily ascertained. I went to Newgate-market on Wednesday, and saw two aitch-bones of beef at Mr. Lee's - they looked as I expected mine would. I immediately went to the prisoner's house in Church-street, Bethnal-green, and asked him where he got the heifers, the bodies of which were at Mr. Lee's? he said from Epping, from the same person he had others from before. He afterwards said the man's name was Crawley. I said I knew several persons at Epping, but none of that name, and begged him to say what size he was; he said he was about my size, and lived on Thorney Common, below Epping, and was a farmer. I expressed surprise that he should send them to him instead of the wholesale market. He said he became acquainted with Crawley when he attended Epping market, and he thought he could do better for him than a stranger. I said he could have no difficulty in finding him - he hesitated, and said he did not know, and that Crawley was going into Kent - that he gave him 12 l. on account, and was to settle the rest afterwards. He said the person who drove them brought a note from Crawley, and he gave him 12 l. instead of Crawley. He was asked for the note, and he went out saying he would fetch it - he returned, saying he could not find it, and he supposed the children had destroyed it. I gave him in charge. I afterwards went to Salloway's, a tanner, at Bermondsey, and saw two hides, which I am certain are the hides of my two heifers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found the prisoner at home - A. Yes; he mentioned no name but Crawley. He did not describe the man who drove them. Another man, named Lye, was brought before the Magistrate, he was discharged on promising to appear next day, but did not appear - he was apprehended on the information of the prisoner's wife - it was not through the prisoner's instrumentality that we found the hides.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and in the employ of Mr. Crow; his slaughter-house is in Webb-square, Shoreditch. On Monday, the 22d of May, somebody brought two heifers to be slaughtered. I saw them about three o'clock; the prisoner was there with them all the while I killed them, and he had the key, and took them away himself next morning. The hair was cut off the tails of them when I killed them, which denoted that they came from Smithfield-market, and the prisoner said he brought them from Smithfield.</p>

             re-examined. The hides are the hides of my cattle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About four years ago I lived in Wilson-street, Finsbury-square, and was burnt out, I lost every thing but some meat, which I took to Romford market, and from there to Epping; I there became acquainted with Crawley, we did a great deal of business together - he agreed to send me his cattle to sell in London. One Lee, a drover, who had heard this conversation, brought three cows to me, and said he came from Crawley - I gave him 12 l. on account - he brought them between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and I asked Crow to slaughter them for me. Next morning I sold the bodies of beef to Mr. Lee. I put him in possession of all the information, and offered to do all in my power to bring the guilty person to justice, and told him where the fat and tripe were taken to. I sent to my wife to get Lee apprehended, which was done with difficulty - he was then liberated to appear next day, but never did. I have a witness to prove that I was at home all Sunday night.</p>

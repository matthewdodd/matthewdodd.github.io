On the 24th of December, he went out with me, with a carriage which I let out, and as it was too late for him to go home, he slept with me that night; we got up together next morning; he went away about eight o'clock, and about eight o'clock on the morning of the 26th, I missed this property out of my chest. He had come into my room with a light about four o'clock that morning, and got into bed with me - my landlady called me at eight o'clock, and said that a pair of my boots, had been found in the garden - the prisoner jumped out of bed, and stood kneeling on the chest which had contained my clothes; he appeared much frightened - I asked him to look into my chest, which he did, and said there was nothing there, but no doubt I should have my clothes again - he said,"Never mind, they are all right" - he then left me, and went to drive a chaise for Mr. Norman; I went to him at Norman's in about an hour, and begged of him to give me my clothes - he said he did not know much about them, but no doubt I should have them again - he went to London with the chaise about twelve o'clock, and while he was gone, I received information: when he returned, I and another man went to the chaise which he had driven; he was then cleaning the harness - I saw a pair of breeches and two pairs of trousers under the seat of the chaise. I fetched an officer, who took him - he had got my shirt on his back: 2l. 11s. was found on him - he said that was what he had sold my clothes for - I found the braces and the waste pieces of some shirts which were taken from my chest, on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. From where were they stolen? A. It is a separate building from the public-house - I live there constantly; the door is not kept open in the day-time; the chest was not locked - I saw nobody but him enter the room. I had been making myself comfortable on Christmas-day - I cannot say whether he drank with me; I was with four or five people, whom he brought there - he did not put me to bed. I have got back three pairs of boots and a box from the landlady - I am sure it was my shirt he had on; but when he came to the office a second time, he had got another on.</p>

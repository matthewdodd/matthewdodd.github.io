                  </hi> I am a costermonger, and live at 4, Wild Passage, Drury Lane—Mary Sheen is my wife—the other prisoners are my father-in-law and mother-in-law—they live at the bottom of Drury Lane, near Which Street—on 8th May, about half-past four in the morning, I went to their place—they live on the ground floor—I tapped at the window—Regan opened the door immediately—he was not dressed—I went in—there was no light—I told him to light a candle—he did so—the two women were in bed—there were three boys or two boys and a woman in a bed at the foot of the other—I put my hand on that bed—my wife was not there; she was inside her mother in the bed—I laid hold of her by the wrist and tried to pull her out—Regan laid hold of me and began to scuffle with me—I said I wanted my wife—he said, "You won't get her"—I then Said, "I want my money"—he said, "You won't get one or the other"—I was then turned out by Regan and another man—he used bad language to me not fit to express—Edmund Sheen was there, and my wife sent him for a policeman—Regan laid hold of me by the collar and shoved me out—my hand got jammed in the door—I came in again—they tried to shove me out again, Regan used foul language to me, and knocked me down on the bed, and his wife came with a kettle and hit me—I tried to save my head by defending myself with my arm, and my elbow was all black—in the struggle I hit them somehow in the head—it was Regan and his wife that did everything to me—it was he that gave me all the blows, <hi rend="italic">barring</hi> the first one that I got from his wife—I can't tell what it was he struck</p>

About half-past five in the morning of 8 th May I was called to 2, Denham Yard, Dory Lane, by a lad named Edmund Sheen—I saw the three prisoners standing in the passage, the male prisoner first; the prosecutor was lying on the ground weltering in blood from wounds he had received—Mrs. Sheen had a flat iron in her hand lifted over her head in an attitude—she was about a quarter of a yard, from the prosecutor—I rushed in and pushed her on one bide and took the flat iron from her, and have it here—I also produce an iron pot, broken; the fracture was quite new—Mrs. Regan had it in her hand, I took it from her—the male prisoner had nothing in his hand—I lifted the prosecutor up, took him outside, sent for assistance, and he was taken to the hospital in a cab—I took the prisoner to the station with assistance—I did not notice any cuts on the prisoners' heads—I saw blood flowing, it was from no wound that I saw; both the Regains had blood on their faces.</p>

                  </hi> I was house surgeon at King's College Hospital when the prosecutor was brought there, between five and six on the morn<lb></lb>ing of 8th May; he was in a state of great exhaustion from loss of blood—I examined his head, there were five wounds on it, two on the right side over the temple, one at the back, one on the left side, and one on the left temple; they went to the bone, but there was no injury to the bone—they must have been inflicted with considerable violence, four of the wounds were sharp wounds, and might have been caused by either a sharp or blunt instrument, but there was one wound which was evidently done by some very blunt object; the others would be done probably by something of the sort of this pot before it was broken—I saw the flat iron, it bears the external appearance of blood—a poker or anything of that kind would inflict some of the wounds—he had a small cut on the chin and bruises on his arm—I did not dress the prisoner's wounds—he was in a very dangerous state, principally from loss of blood—he subsequently had an attack of erysipelas which nearly cost him his life, I hope he has quite recovered now—he has had his head shaved since he left the hospital.</p>

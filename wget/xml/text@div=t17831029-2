            . Was you at Mrs. Sammy's? - Yes, I found this parcel there which has not been opened yet, it was put in a great pan and an apron was put over it.</p>
               <p>(The things in the bundle in the blue apron deposed to by Mrs. Straffon.)</p>

               <p>PRISONER WALLIS'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming up Mutton-hill, and I went to the Duke's Head for a quartern of gin about seven o'clock in the morning, and I happened to meet Martin and he knew me and said, Wallis, how are you, says I, I do not know you, he mentioned his name, and asked me to drink; we went in and had two or three pints of beer, in the mean time there came in a man that I have known ever since I used the house, he asked me if I had any work, I told him no, he asked if I would earn a couple of shillings, and I said I would, I rather scrupled going as I had a very bad ancle then and have now, he said he would have a coach for me, and I went to the King's Arms at Hounsditch, and I was to stay till he came there, I went in, and I came to the door to see whether the man was coming, and these men came and stopped me and said the constable was coming, then I went in again and they said we might both go out, and we went as fast as we could; I have only my wife to speak for me, I was in bed with her at half after seven o'clock, my friends are a long way off, my master that I lived with is dead, he lived in St. John-street, a cornchandler.</p>
               <p>PRISONER MARTIN'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I lodged at the Duke's Head in Mutton-hill; the corner of Great Saffron-hill, this man came in for a quartern of gin, I spoke<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290012"></xptr> to him and asked him how he did, he said he did not know me, we sat and drank between two and three pints of beer, and a man came in and spoke to him and asked him to do him a favour to carry a bundle to such and such a place, but I do not rightly know what the name of the place was, he agreed to go, and asked me the favour if so be I would be so good to go along with him to the place, I went with him, and the man said to him if you are lame I will have a coach for you; I got out of the coach in Duke's-place to enquire for the King's-arms, and I came to him and told him, and we both went into the King's-arms together and I called for a pint of beer, and a man came to me and said you must stop, I asked for what, he said a constable was sent for, I stopped there for about three minutes, in coming out again he said you may go about your business, and come for your property by and by, accordingly I went about my business, I said, I have no property, and in coming by the Royal Exchange there were three or four men took me into custody, I have no one to my character.</p>
               <p>PRISONER WARREN'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On the Monday night I was at Greenwich and we staid till it was quite late and came home in a coach together, I went to bed and I never was up till about half after nine o'clock in the morning, then my landlady called upon me to go with her to Hicks's-hall after a woman that had robbed her lodgings, I never saw the things nor the place, my witnesses were all in the Baildock when I came into Court but it rained.</p>
               <p>Warren to Pitt. Whether he was not very much in liquor and he differed in his stories diverse times, and he did not swear to me till now? - No, my Lord, I did not, I gave a proper account, for she was the woman I swore positively to before the Justice, I have no doubt of her, I have known her for years.</p>

               <p>Court. Have you any body here to prove that he differed in his account? - Yes, these people that were here to witness for me could prove it.</p>

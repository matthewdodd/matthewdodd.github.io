                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased, James Wallis, before he died—he was quite insensible when I saw him—he was brought into my surgery—I could not discern any external mark, except a little blackness under the ear, and scratches on his cheek—he died on the 7th of February—I examined his body after death—it was not dissected at all—I could not decidedly ascertain the cause of death, but I believe it was caused by the rupture of a large vessel about the neck—it was most likely the carotid artery, but it was one of the large vessels—I observed traces of black under the left ear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you examined him after death, had you heard the circumstances? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard he had been knocked down—he was about nineteen or twenty years old, I should think—there was nothing about the appearance of the body at that time to lead me to suppose the vessel was ruptured, but afterwards there was—on the day following his death there was a great deal of extravasated blood about the upper part of the body, and decomposition had commenced—a very heavy blow under the ear might have caused it—I saw him within two minutes of the blow being given, and there was not time for much appearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> May a person have a tendency to the rupture of a vessel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There may be, but generally there are previous appearances of such a disease having existed—a blow of the kind given might at any time have such an effect, but a blow will not on all occasions produce death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you any reason to attribute his death to any thing but the blow under the ear? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None—I did not bleed him—he was too far gone—he only breathed twice after coming into my surgery.</p>

                  </hi>. I knew the deceased—I was present at the time he had a fight with the prisoner—it was on "Wednesday, the 7th of Febru<lb></lb>ary—I saw him come up to the prisoner, and the prisoner went up to him. and struck him three or four times—he had given him no provoca<lb></lb>tion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260075"></xptr>
               <p>—it was in the street, at the top of Britannia-row—I saw where he struck him—it was under the left ear—he struck him three or four times—they were hard blows—the deceased said, "Come into the fields, and I will fight"—that was all he said—he fell down, and I and another boy picked him up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the deceased strike the prisoner at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I and another picked him up, and put him on Mr. Holt's, the baker's, step—Mrs. Holt brought out some water and sprinkled his face, but it did not revive him—Hawes and Charles Payne took him over to Mr. Martin's—I afterwards saw him brought out of the surgery, and he appeared to be dead then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he strike him more than once under the left ear? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, three or four hard blows—it was after the first blow that he said, "Come into the fields and I will fight you"—he said nothing after he had received all the blows, but fell.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. The deceased was at my house in the afternoon—a few weeks before this happened there had been a quarrel, and he went to take the prisoner's brother's part—he was sober when he left my company on the evening in question—I saw the prisoner strike the deceased two or three hard blows about the neck—ha fell back into the road—I instantly went up and assisted in taking off the deceased's handkerchief, and then took him to the doctor's—he never spoke after that—I thought he was stooping down to pick up his hat when he fell.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

                  </hi>. I live in George's-place, Stepney. On the 24th of April I had been at the Prince of Wales at night, to get a pint of beer, and saw the prisoner standing against the door there with another man—I mistook them for somebody I knew, and asked them to come in and have a pint of beer—I was in liquor—we all went in together—I called for a pint of beer—I had two half-crowns, some silver and copper—I pulled it all out of my waistcoat pocket, paid for the beer with the halfpence, and put my money back in my left hand waistcoat pocket again, and we all three went out toge<lb></lb>ther—one had hold of my arm, and the other leaning on my shoulder, on the other side of me—we went on to Stepney-fair-place, towards the Green Dragon—it is a narrow lane, with gardens on each side, and there the prisoner knocked me down, and held me while the other robbed me—I am sure it was the prisoner knocked me down—I called out "Police"—7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were taken from me, two half—crowns, some other silver and copper—my pocket and all were taken—I fastened on the prisoner—the other man went away—I held the prisoner a minute or two, and just before the policeman came be forced himself away from me, and walked away towards Heath—street the policeman walked after him and took him—he did not run away.</p>

I was at the Prince of Wales on this night—I went in a little after twelve o'clock, and sat right opposite the bar—the prosecutor, prisoner, and another man all came in together—they had a pint of beer, which Hales paid for—I saw him take out a handful of copper, and two half—crowns among it—he put his money back into his left—hand waistcoat pocket—they all went out—I followed in about two minutes, and saw them in the narrow lane—there are gardens on one side, and houses and gardens on the other—I there saw the prisoner knock Hales down—he knelt on his chest, and held him down—the other man was kneeling down and picking his pocket—I was not above six yards from them—it was not so dark as that I could not see them—it was moonlight—it was done momentarily—the man who picked his pocket ran away—Hales called "Police," and held the prisoner some time—then the prisoner walked away—he never ran—the policeman came up to Hales, then overtook the prisoner in Heath—street—I followed and saw him—I had seen the prisoner and the other man whispering in the public-house after the pro<lb></lb>secutor had pulled out his money—I knew Hales before by sight, but not the others.</p>

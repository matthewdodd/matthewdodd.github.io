                  </hi>. I live in Boston-place, Dorset-square, St. Maryle-bone, with John Penny, my father—it is his dwelling-house—the prisoner lodged there—on the 29th of March I was disturbed between one and two o'clock in the morning—I went down to open the door to the prisoner, who had another man with him—he said he was his brother, and he asked me if I would allow him to sleep with him—I let them in and saw them up to their room—at half-past six o'clock my father called me—I found the prisoner gone, the drawers open and the gown and other articles stated, gone.—one shirt, which the prisoner had on when he was taken, was mine—the other things were my father's—this is my shirt that the prisoner had on.</p>

                  </hi>. I went into the prisoner's bed-room on the morning of the 29th of March, and found that he and the other man had not been in bed, but there was the print of two persons who had sat one on each side of the bed—a writing-desk had been turned the reverse way from what I had put it the night before—I tried the drawers and they were open—the gown and other articles stated were gone—they were my property—I have not seen any of them since—they were worth upwards of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

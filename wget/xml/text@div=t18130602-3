On the 13th of March, between the hours of eleven and twelve, I left my own house accompanied with two of my workmen, to carry some goods home. I had not to go with it; a messenger came to me, desiring me to return home. I returned home, and found a large assembly around my door. I entered the house. I was there met by a person of the name of Wilmot. He produced two pieces of wet printed cotton, and he wished me to say whether it was my property or not. I answered, I would inform him when I looked at the remainder of my stock. I looked at the remainder of my stock, and found the two pieces missing. I examined the wet cotton, and found it to be the same pattern and quality that I had lost. I then proceeded further through my house in the passage. I found the prisoner under charge of Mr. Wing. The prisoner, upon finding I was master of the property, begged for mercy. I then took him to Marlborough-street office, where he was committed. This is the property that was found upon the prisoner. I have no doubt it is my property. I had two such pieces at eleven o'clock in the day, when I left my house, and when I returned I had not these two pieces. I value them at about five pounds twelve shillings.</p>

            . I live at 26, Weymouth-street, very near Mr. Bowen. On Saturday, the 13th of March, I heard a cry of stop thief. I went out of doors, and the prisoner passed me. A witness of the name of Wing caught hold of him, and asked him what he had done with the furniture that he had stolen out of Mr. Bowen's shop. He begged not to be exposed, but to be taken into a private house, and he would pay for what he had done. I then went in search of the furniture; I found it at No. 6, Great Chesterfield-street, in the area, in a water-butt. I was directed there by several persons who saw him throw it away. It was all wet. He had thrown it over the rails. It had fallen into a water-butt. I then took the prisoner to Mr. Bowen's shop. He offered a silver watch for the injury the cotton had received, and not to be prosecuted. We took him to Marlborough-street; there he was committed.</p>
               <p>MR. WING. On the 13th of March, I was coming past Mr. Bowen's shop, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner come out of the shop. He appeared to be very much confused. He had a basket, and two pieces of print. I looked in the shop, and saw no person in it; that gave me more suspicion. The prisoner seeing me look at him. He set off running with the property. I gave the alarm in the street. A great many people followed him. He threw over the area rails the basket, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020004"></xptr>the two pieces of print. I then got hold of him, and took him back to Mr. Bowen's shop; he begged we would not take him into a public-house, but to take him into a private-house. I took him back to Mr. Bowen's shop; he there begged to be let go, not to be prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Q.to prosecutor. Is that your property - A. I have no doubt it is my property; they were in my shop for several days before.</p>

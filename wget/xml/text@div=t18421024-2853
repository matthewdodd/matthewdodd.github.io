                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live in Sydney-street, Commer<lb></lb>cial-road. About two o'clock in the morning of the 10th of October, I was at the corner of Lime-street—the prisoner accosted me, and got into con<lb></lb>versation—I walked to Billiter-street—I had four sovereigns and some silver in my pocket—she stole three sovereigns and some silver—I heard a noise in her mouth, and found I was being robbed—I forced her mouth open, and took a sovereign out—I put my hand into my pocket, and missed half of my silver—I took one half-crown and one shilling from her hand—she was taken to the station, but no more money was found on her—I went back and examined the spot—it was dark—she had an opportunity to throw it away—I was sober.</p>

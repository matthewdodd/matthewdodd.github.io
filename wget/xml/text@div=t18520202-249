                  </hi>. I am an artificial flower maker, in Berwick-street, Sobo. The prisoner was in my employ eight or ten months—his business was to carry the goods into the City—I had regular houses, and by chance other customers—when the prisoner sold goods, it was his duty to bring the money home—he was in the habit of doing so, and giving an account of what he had sold—he was in my employ on 16th and 17th Jan.—on Friday, 16th, he said he had sold the goods he had taken out to a Manchester man—I asked what he had sold them for, and where the check was—he said he had not given him a check, but he bad entered them in his book, and on Saturday morning he was to take more goods—I complained of the price he had sold them at, but I said as the goods were sold I must make the best I could—he had sold four dozen at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I reckoned, when the discount was taken off, they would amount to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he took two dozen more on Saturday morning at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—he did not return on the Saturday—I found him with the policeman about 5 or 6 o'clock that Saturday evening.</p>

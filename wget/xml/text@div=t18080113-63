               <p>PETER KAY. I am a shoemaker, I live opposite of Mr. Turner's. On the 21st of December, between three and four in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner and a man come up to Mr. Turner's door, and the man that was with him lifted up the latch and looked in, he lifted up the latch again, and went in; the prisoner staid at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the other man came out. - A. Between ten minutes and a quarter of an hour; he handed these two trays to the prisoner at the door; I went out and asked the prisoner what he was going to do with these two trays, he made me no answer, but put the two trays just at the entrance of New-court in Church-street; I took them up and put them in a neighbour's house and followed the prisoner. In about two minutes I came up to him. I am perfectly sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. What become of the other man. - A. I do not know, he went the other way; I and a neighbour secured the prisoner and took him to the office. I delivered the trays up at the office.</p>

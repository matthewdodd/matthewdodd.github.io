I am cook in the family of Charles Chapman Barber, of No. 11, Westborne Villas, Paddington—on the 7th of May I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner at our kitchen door—he said, "Is there any orders for the butcher?"—I said, "Where from?" he said, "From the butcher"—I then asked him inw the kitchen, and to sit down while I went up stairs—I remained up stein about twenty minutes—I went nearly to the top of Che house, leaving nobody but him in the kitchen—he was dressed in dark clothes, and had an apron—I believe a butcher's apron—when I came down he was gone and the door open—I went to the plate-closet and nearly all the* plate was gone, which 1 had seen safe two minutes before he came, when I put the tea-spoons in the basket—I missed the articles stated—I am sure the prisoner is the person—I saw him at the station-house next morning.</p>

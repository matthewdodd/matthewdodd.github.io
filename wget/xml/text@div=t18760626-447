                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of 2, Sherborne Lane—I was engaged by the trustees of W. D. Saul to watch their interests—I produce a deed of partnership between Sarah Saul, Charles Godfrey, William Brown and William Salisbury Speiter—I am the attesting witness to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> William Devonshire Saul was the brother of Mrs. Saul's husband, he died I think in 1855, and shortly afterwards Thomas Saul, Mrs. Saul's husband died—I knew Mrs. Saul many years before that, and knew that she was carrying on the business under the will of her husband—her <hi rend="italic">son</hi>, William Devonshire Saul, junior, managed it for her—he is about twenty or twenty—one—Mrs. Saul resided on the premises—it was a good business when her husband died—it was worn out and spoilt in 1858—' I do not like to say that it was bankrupt, but it was as near bankrupt as it could be without being bankrupt—the defendaut became traveller to Mrs. Saul in 1857, and during 1857 she informed me that during the time he was traveller he had lent the business 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I know nothing about his lending her 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on an I O U—the partnership deed is dated 10th September, 1858—I know Mrs. Saul's writing, the signature to this I O U is hers. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>"I O U Mr. Godfrey 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., November 21, 1857., Sarah Saul") Under the partnership deed Mr. William Saul, of Northampton, was appointed inspector—I don't know whether Brown was a clerk, but he was brought into the partnership, and I know that he was a partner—before tie partnership deed was signed, Mrs. Saul told me that unless, they had some capital to go on with the business must, cease to be carried on—at that tune 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced by the trustees of William Devonshire Saul; those were the trustees of her husband's brother—the goodwill of the business was valued at 6,236<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and of that sum there was liabilities. due from the concern to Mrs. Saul's husband's estate 4,860<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. leaving 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as surplus—the deed shows 2,15.0<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which Godfrey lent' Mrs. Saul has not been paid—Godfrey's share is 1,050<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Brown brought in 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which is recited in the deed—Wood &amp; Travers were the solicitors where the deed was drawn up; they are both dead—six other deeds were also executed; but they were not all deeds of indemnity—there is a convenant in the mortgage deed by the members of the firm to hold the trustees of the estate harmless—here is the deed con<lb></lb>taining that covenant—Mr. William Saul, a wine merchant, of Northampton, was appointed inspector under the deed, he was Thomas Saul's executor—he is a middle-aged man—a bill was filed against the trustees of the estate of William Devonshire Saul, on 15th May, 1862, by Mr. Webb, who married Mr. Saul's daughter. (<hi rend="italic">Redding the prayer of the Bill</hi>). Miller &amp; Miller were the solicitors to Mr. Saul, and to the bill—the result of that bill was that an order was obtained from the Court of Chancery directing the trus<lb></lb>tees to release all parties from their covenants, and bills were given by the firm to the children of Mrs. Saul as they came of age, in lieu of money—In the next suit of Saul <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Saul, filled on 18th August, 1864, I think I acted for William Saul—I think there was another bill filled in 1868 against Godfrey by one of the Sauls, but I was not concerned in it, and I hare not got it—I remember the taxing the costs in two of the Chancery suits, and I remember an order of court to pay Miller &amp; Miller 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I discussed the articles of partnership carefully with Mrs. Saul, and explained them to her, and she said that if she could get out of the business when re-con<lb></lb>structed with 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for herself and her children to live on she should be grateful as long as she lived—she did not say that she regretted that</p>

               <p>she was compelled to go into partnership—there was a meeting at Guild. hall Coffee House in 1868, Mrs. Saul was not present, but her son was; it was a formal meeting for putting an end to the litigation, and Mr. Miller put an end to it by serving an injunction on Mr. Saul, of Northampton, he was the executor of Thomas Saul—an injunction, was also served on the executor of William Devonshire Saul, as inspector under the deed of part<lb></lb>nership—that put an end to the friendly arrangement which ought to have taken place at the meeting—I heard of a bill being filed by Godfrey against Sarah Saul, on 22nd December, 1871, praying for a dissolution of the part<lb></lb>nership, but I know nothing about it—I had ceased to have anything to do with it then—I continued to act during the litigation for the trustees of the estate of William Devonshire Saul—the trustees insisted on the order being discharged for the purpose of getting out their 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the order of 2nd August was to release the parties from their covenant—I know that those bills were duly delivered to Mrs. Saul's children, as they were entitled to them—I think the amount of those three bills was 2,803<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know nothing about it, except hearing it talked about—I know nothing about the way the business was managed or mismanaged after it came into the receiver's hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not draw the partnership deed of 1858—when it was necessary to put fresh capital into the business, the children's trustees lent 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and as that was a breach of trust they were anxious to relieve themselves from any responsibility—a bill was filed by Mr. Webb, for the purpose of fixing the trustees, but the Court decreed it to be a proper dis<lb></lb>position of the money and said that the trustees should be allowed to lend the money and take acceptances—that did not affect Godfrey or Brown in any way—the result was that the 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was lent by Mrs. Saul's children through the trustees, and acceptances taken for the amount—I had nothing to do with the proceedings till the meeting at the London Coffee House-Brown's 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was credited to him in the books as his share; he gave personal security for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general merchant of Walbrook, and am Mrs. Saul's son-in-law—on 28th August, 1872, I was appointed receiver to the estate of Saul, Godfrey &amp; Brown, by order of the Court of Chancery, under which I took possession of all the books, and of the assets of the firm—Mr. Godfrey was there when I took possession, but I had no particular conversation with him then—I had known the premises for many years and had been in the habit of going in and out—there was hardly any stock there—there was half a pipe of Tarragona, a Spanish port, a. cheap wine, and a little brandy and whisky—there were eight or nine clerks and servants there up to the last time I was in the place, but when I went into possession there was only one clerk, and an old cellar man—I had an inventory taken, about a week afterwards by Hudson Brothers, the wine and spirit brokers of Moorgate Street—this is the bonded stock book, and I believe all the books of the firm are here—I am well acquainted with them—the amount of bonded stock when I went in was 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I examined the books a day or two afterwards, to find out the amount of sales during previous years, and found that the sales in 1869 were 27,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in 1870, 29,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in 1871, 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the sales in January, 1872, were 2,615<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in February, 1,642<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in March, 1,284<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in April, 2,828<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in May, up to the 18th, 1,788<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from May 18th to the end of the month, 804<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in June, 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in July, 786<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in August up to the time of my appointment,</p>

               <p>have had 1,131<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to their credit over and above their payments, without the necessity of selling anything—from 1st July to 29th August the day that I went into possession, the total receipts of the firm amounted to 7,545<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which 1,204<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is made up of monies purporting to be paid by Balchin, Yerworth, Keating &amp; Son, Pattern &amp; Mitchell, and deduct<lb></lb>ing that 1,204<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that leaves 6,344<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. net receipts, irrespective of sales to nominees—I have here the monthly balances from my appointment taking out the amounts of sales to nominees, and taking into account all the payments made by them on the acceptances to the Saul family, and I say that they had ample funds to meet all liabilities, including the amounts to the Saul family, without selling any wines at all, and I am prepared to show that, month by month—I can-not trace a angle entry in previous years to show that they ever made any forced sales—after I was appointed receiver I had to meet liabilities incurred after January 1st, 1872, for goods purchased, the amount of which in round numbers was 1,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I can point out cases where wine so purchased on credit, and which I had to pay for afterwards, was sold to Keating &amp; Son, and Balchin—this list (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the payments to the Saul family, and to William Saul, of Northampton, I made out from the cash-book—those are payments made subsequent to January, 1872; only one or two were made before that—the total is 3,509<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I still say that they always had sufficient cash in hand without forced sales, and without borrowing money—the amount of purchases from 1st January, 1872, to my appointment was about 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but in June the purchases only amounted to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—from the end of June to my appointment only one bottle of champagne was purchased—I have also extracted this list of the customers of the firm standing on the books on 31st December, 1871, who had dealings with the firm in 1871—here are 670 active customers; they are mostly inn and hotel keepers in the country—I have ascertained from the books that on 25th June bills were dis<lb></lb>counted by Godfrey to the amount of 846<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they were the acceptances of different customers of the firm, and they were paid to the bankers and turned into money—on June 3rd bills were discounted to the amount of 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cheque-book of the firm of Saul, Godfrey, &amp; Brown—this counterfoil of 5th June, "Sundries, 680<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., change," is in God<lb></lb>frey's writing—this cheque for 680<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the signature, are in Godfrey's writing, and this, "W. J. Brown," is in Brown's writing—that appears in the pass-book, and the cheque is cancelled as cashed—I understand that 680<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was drawn out to pay someone; it was turned into cash, but being called "change," other cheques may have been paid in of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from some other source—cash was paid into the bank on 5th June amounting, to 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when cash is paid into the bank I can generally find from whom it has been received—this is the paying-in book, and I find here "5th June, paid in 1,110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I find that on on 25th June they discounted bills with the bank to the amount of 846<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that Godfrey drew out 310<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 1st July and 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 8th—I find that on 18th July they discounted bills to the amount of 574<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that on the same day Godfrey drew out 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I produce the cheques for those amounts, signed by Godfrey, and passed through the bankers—when I was appointed I found about 3,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of acceptances of the firm under discount," and two-thirds of that amount, about 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., were dishonoured, but they were ultimately met, except to the extent of 970<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is not unusual that customers may not be ready with the money, but yet they may be good</p>

               <p>bills in the long run—the retained bills came back through the bankers, and I had to refund them the money; the estate at one time owed me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I had had to refund—when I took possession, about 261<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was handed to me, including money in the bank, and there was about 530<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock—in consequence of those bills being returned I had not the money to resuscitate the business, and I realised the stock at a profit of about 20 per cent., the usual amount—I find in the cash-book three entries with T. E. against them—that means "Trade expenses of Saul, Godfrey, &amp; Brown;" on is on 13th July, 1872, for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to-George Books, Esq., and on the same day, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Brawn, the other defendant, and on August 6, 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable to Messrs.

Godfrey's, writing, it has written underneath "To my solicitor, for my protection"—on the counter<lb></lb>foil of the next cheque, dated July 18, is "To Mr. Crook, for the protection of W. J. Brown," and on August 6, three days before my appointment here, is written on a cheque "To my solicitor, for my protection, 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—those are all countersigned by William Saul, of Northampton, the inspector—at folio 187 of the private ledger, the three amounts I hare mentioned, one is headed "Trade expenses," those amounts are not debited in the books or in the ledger to the private account either of Godfrey or of Brown—those are monies drawn out of the assets of Saul Godfrey, &amp; Brown, and debited to trade expenses, and not entered to the debit of any particular partner—here are twenty or thirty copies of letters in the copy book, applying for money, to the customers of the old firm written while he was there—here is one of June 28, 1872, written by Smethurst, on behalf of the firm—he was partly clerk and partly collector—there are other letters here stating that the business is wound-up, and that it is necessary to call in the accounts—the letters do not solicit a transfer of the custom—I had an empty cask returned to me with this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on it—I found this circular at 15, Aldersgate Street—it is a blank form. (<hi rend="italic">Thisstated:</hi> "Our partnership having expired by the fluxion of time, we beg to enclose a statement of accounts). I found a number of those—I also found this circular.

Godfrey—I knew of the suit filed by Godfrey on 22nd December, 1871—Godfrey did not press Mrs. Saul to have the business put up for sale under the 23rd clause of the deed, but he offered 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the business and she refused it—I do not know that he after that asked her over and over again to have the matter carried out by private contract, nor do I know that he did not—Mrs. Saul was not examined at the police-court—she may be in this neighbourhood, I have not seen her for some time—I am receiver in two suits—I know of a suit filed against Godfrey on 8th June, 1872, in which Elizabeth Saul and Thomas Charles Saul, the children of Mrs. Saul, are the plaintiffs—Thomas was not then a minor—Godfrey petitioned for an order of Court to wind up—it appears by the partnership deed that 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced by the trustees of William Devonshire Saul—I have been over the books carefully and find that during the fourteen years of the partner<lb></lb>ship, Mrs. Saul drew out of the concern 11,508<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is an average of 842<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each year—she had put in 2,150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was the difference between the assets and liabilities of her husband's estate—the value of the business as a going concern is the difference between the assets and liabi<lb></lb>lities, but not the goodwill—the share belonging to Mrs. Saul when the part<lb></lb>nership expired was 4,068<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—what I am telling you now is from the boob and not from what I have heard—I cannot find it from the books here, bat in the old books—I can refer to the books and point out to the Jury where the recital in the partnership deed is false—I believe that the capital she introduced was the difference between assets and liabilities, I do not mean valuing the thing as a going concern; no goodwill—the value of the house was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the liquidation account is at Aldersgate Street, I left all the old books there—I do not know that the property in the concern which was valued to Mrs. Saul as 2,150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only realised 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but there is something about it in the liquidation account—when the partnership expired the capital in the concern belonging to Godfrey was 3,852<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Miller &amp; Miller acted in the six Chancery suits—it was under two cross actions that I was appointed as receiver—the accounts ordered by the Court to be taken have not been taken, it was found useless, I believe—I have never been in the wine business—I went into the concern on 29th or 30th August, 1872, and Godfrey went out, but he came once or twice afterwards to inspect the book—I sent out these circulars in the name of Saul, Godfrey &amp; Brown because I carried on the business in the name I found it in—the bill prayed that those three should not carry on the firm, but this was the remainder that was left of Saul, Godfrey &amp; Brown—it was not a year, but only a month before that that the Master of the Rolls decreed that the business was at an end—I know nothing about five writs being served on the members of the firm on 8th January, the day the bill of Saul <hi rend="italic">v</hi>.

I can identify l,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. sold at less than cost price, upon which there was a log of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think there was any gain on the other 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sold the stock at 20 per cent, gross profit—I have made a statement of the net profits during the fourteen years of partnership: from 1858 it was less than 10 percent., then 7 per cent., then 5 per cent., and then 3 1/2 percent, but 3 per cent.

I am now a wine merchant, carrying on business with Mr. Chitty, in Tower Street—I was, up to the early part of 1872, for some years in the employment of Saul, Godfrey &amp; Brown—up to the end of 1871 the business was lucrative—it continued so for a month or two after 31st December, 1871—I first found out that goods were being entered in my name in May; the month I went to Worship Street and engaged myself to Mr. Brown as clerk—I left the old firm—I took the managershi—I found by the books that the business of a wine merchant was being carried on in the names of ten or twelve customers of the old firm—this book is from the country ledger of the Eldersgate Street business—Mr. Brown was at Wor<lb></lb>ship Street daily, but he was out a good deal—I had no conversation with him at Aldergate Street about the Worship Street premises—we had some<lb></lb>times two travellers and some times three—Mr. Chitty and Mr. Lazarus were two, and there were two clerks besides myself, and one cellannan—that was not the whole of the staff—these that I have named subsequently went to Worship Street—I don't recollect that Mr. Brown spoke to me about having goods 'invoiced in my name—it came to my knowledge by receiving invoices from Saul, Godfrey &amp; Brown—they were put upon the business file—I paid monies on account of wine to Saul, Godfrey &amp; Brown; under 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should say—I took the money from Mr. Brown's cash-box—I went into Mr. Brown's service on 1st June—there were orders then on the books—this book commences the business—the. first date is May 27, '1872—I don't recollect that Mr. Godfrey came tc those premises in June—when he came he came entirely—when with Mr. Brown I superintended the for<lb></lb>warding of circulars to the customers of the old firm—before I left the old firm I superintended the circulars calling in all the accounts of the old finn—these circulars (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are what were sent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Brown supervised the books at Aldersgate Street—Godfrey superintended the despatch of goods—I did not known Mr. Brown before he yas a partner—the goods sent to Worship Street were' invoiced at market prices—everything went on right until about the end of 1871 with the Aldersgate Street firm—early in 1872 I saw Mr. Miller, a solicitor there—about that time I knew the firm were being pressed for a large sum of money to pay certain judgments—I knew there were several Chancery suits pending, in one of which I made an affidavit—and had the pleasure of being examined and cross-exaroiued for two or three days—I do not recollect in which suit that was—the' business began to decline in 1872—I believe I left on the last day of May—it is customary in this business for travellers to bring their own customers, to a very great extent a traveller leaving his old firm would carry the customers to another firm—some of the travellers that left the firm of Saul, Godfrey &amp; Brown weut to the Worship Street business—they would therefore carry their</p>

               <p>business with them—I have been in business for myself one year—some of the customers of the old firm have come to me and Mr. Chitty's entire con<lb></lb>nection—he is my partner—Mr. Godfrey has never made any complaints to me, and if he did I might tell him he could complain as much as he liked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not get these customers until shortly after Godfrey's bankruptcy—I continued at Worship Street until shortly before it—Mr. Chitty had a connection before he went to Saul, Godfrey &amp; Browne.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. E. H. Keiling &amp; Sons, wine brokers, Tower Street—I was in their employ in the early part of 1872—at that time I knew Mr. Godfrey and Mr. Brown—I saw Mr. Brown at our office, but I could not say which month—I don't recollect receiving any communication previously—the conversation, to the best of my recollection, was. that he wished the goods that had been invoiced to Worship Street sold through Keiling's—this invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was received by our firm—I do not know the handwriting at the bottom.</p>
               <p>F. W. <hi rend="smallCaps">SOHRIEBER</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). This invoice is Mr. Godfrey's writing at the bottom, and this receipt also.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). The goods were sold on account of Saul, Godfrey and Brown; I had some slight doubt about it—we charged a com<lb></lb>mission—we sold those goods to Brown, of Aldersgate Street, and delivered to him the invoice of W. J. Brown &amp; Co., Worship Street—we sold some goods on August 1st for Saul, Godfrey &amp; Brown to W. J. Brown, of Wor<lb></lb>ship Street—this is the invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—we also sold goods for them to Mr. Brown, Worship Street, for 233<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we received these receipts from the firm in Worship Street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never saw Mr. Godfrey in any of these transactions—the prices at which the goods were bought and sold were the then fair market rates—before being examined at the police-court I had the pleasure of being twice examined at the Court of Chancery; it was about twelve months ago—I do not remember which suit it was—all these transactions were ordinary business transactions, there was no peeuliarity in them, they are such as would occur every day.</p>

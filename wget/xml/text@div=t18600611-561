                  </hi>. I am unmarried, and live with my mother at 12, West-street, Golden-square; that is next door to the house in which the prisoner and her husband have been living—he carried on the business of a tailor and trimming maker—on Sunday evening, 22d April, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I was standing at my door; as near as I can remember it was about a quarter to 9 o'clock—while there I perceived a smell of fire—in consequence of that I went inside the passage of my own house—I found that it did not proceed from any part of my house, and I then went out to the street-door again—I still smelt the fire—while I was standing at my door the second time, I saw the prisoner come out at her private door—there is a shop-door and a private door to their house—smoke next attracted my attention; it came from the private door as it was shut—as the woman was coming out I saw smoke—I did not see the smoke before the door was completely closed by her; I saw her close the door and go out—the door was just closed and Mr. Bennett had passed when I saw the smoke—she had only just passed me, and I looked up and saw the smoke coming up from the private door—as the door closed to the smoke went from it and went up to the top of the house—I went and looked down the area of their house and observed flames—I could see the kitchen window from the area—there were blinds in it; they were down—I do not know how far the prisoner could have got from the house when I saw the flames in the kitchen—she could not have got very far—there was not a minute between my seeing the smoke and looking down the area and seeing the flames—I looked at once, and then I looked round to see if she was gone, and I could see nothing of her—the blinds of</p>

               <p>feet further, that would make it five feet—the counter nearest the fireplace was on fire; it was well burnt through, but the body of it would be two feet further from the fireplace—the body of the fire extended perhaps about a foot and a half to the right—that would not quite take the middle of the counter in—there would be only heat at this end, but it was burnt more towards the other end—in my judgment the fire originated near the bottom, and not at either end, it was under the counter—the materials that I found under the counter were partly consumed; they were the remains of cloth and cuttings and woollen stuff—there were shelves behind the counter round the shop, and stock upon them—the fire went round the shop—there was a basket under the counter which contained some part of his stock, but I did not examine it closely enough to know—one side of it was burnt, and part of each side was consumed down to the bottom—the contents of it were partially burnt, and likewise the ends—it was more long than round, it looked like a small hamper—I should say that the fire in the shop had been in existence the longest—I should say the fire in the kitchen com<lb></lb>menced after the shop had been burning some time—one was confined and the other was not—the fire under the counter was confined, and would take a long time to burn the boarding two-thirds through, to what the one in the kitchen would, that was exposed openly in the room—from the kitchen there are steps leading up stairs—I examined the state of those steps outside; they were not at all affected by the fire—I found no person in the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Tell me the reason why you say that one was longer than the other? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because the front of the counter and the underneath part was burnt so much through the wood-work, which being confined, must take a long time—the fire in the kitchen had not burnt out, our men had put it out, it would have put itself out—the counter was burnt underneath and in front—I do not know whether it is made of mahogany or deal—I should think it may be about three quarters of an inch thick in front, and the counter itself about an inch, but I did not examine it minutely—it was a common shop counter—I did not measure it—I only stepped the size of the place—I think the shop is twelve feet by nine, and I should suppose the counter might be eight or nine feet—one end of it goes in a direction across the room and very nearly to the window, but there is a show board in the window—I did not observe some greasy measuring tapes about—the half-burnt curtains are there now; they are not here that I am aware of—there is all the stock in the shop as it was found—there are some woollen or cloth cuttings—I visited the premises about half-past 10 last night, but I did not go into the shop—I did not notice a clothes line in the kitchen—it might be hanging from the window for what I know—I observed that there had been a subsidence in the house, and there was a crevice between the top of the basement of the window and the flooring of the shop—there was just an opening in the kitchen between the front of the window-frame and the ceiling—it is at the front part of the side, and goes to the top—I do not suppose that if one of these greasy measuring tapes had been hanging down, it would have conducted the fire up, because there was plaster; though there was an opening a little to the right—I must see where the flame travels—the crevice may be about six feet from where the basket was; not the basket in the kitchen—I have not measured—I did not see any scraps of paper about the floor, I saw a trace of tinder—unless I know how a room is before a fire, I cannot tell what hag brought it from one end of the room to the other, but the papers were not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186006110080"></xptr>
               <p>so littered about as that; and it depends altogether upon whether the tapes are lying or hanging—if they are hanging they would be destroyed, but there must be a strong heat at the top of them—when you have the tapes hanging in this position they would burn well—if they were lying on the floor I should expect to find some remains, but it would depend upon how it dropped down—I think the crevice was very likely to be about three quarters of an inch wide—it goes all along the window from the side of the window-frame, and is open here and there—(<hi rend="italic">Explaining it to the Court by pointing to one of the windows</hi>).</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could a piece of measuring tape have been dropped from the shop into the kitchen through that crevice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I did not see any signs of it at all—the crevice was under the show board—I do not think if any person had tried to do it from the shop, it wonld have passed; it comes to the window frame—if I were to take a flexible thing like this pen and push it up, it would most likely come out in the flooring overhead, but a piece of tape could not be dropped through—I did not see any opening above, but a pen pushed up would make its appearance above if the flooring was away overhead—the flooring was not away overhead; there was a crevice underneath which was not open to the room above—it was not open—there was the floor above, but it must get through the joiste to get there—the crevice at the ceiling was open to the flooring of the shop, but there was no opening in the flooring—a piece of tape could not be dropped through, it could be put up if there was a hole, but I have not seen any hole—there was no trace of fire at the window end of the shop excepting in the heat above, which was caused by the other fire—the shop floor was scorched, but not the under side—the part furthest from the win<lb></lb>dow was charred; it was nofc charred at the window—I have not looked minutely to see whether there is a hole in the flooring.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, and have carried on business in Adam-street for the last twenty-two or twenty-three years—I examined the house where the prisoner lived, where toe fire took place—there is a most easy and immediate means of communication for a flame between the two rooms—under the lining of the head of the kitchen window is a large fissure or crack, occasioned by the vibration of the house towards the street, which is very uncommon in houses; that fissure extends very nearly the entire length of the window—I saw that there had been a fire there; the communica<lb></lb>tion had evidently gone that way, its passage was marked—the upper portion of the frame was charred, immediately up to this crack—cobwebs, some of which remain on the opposite corner, are entirely removed from this por<lb></lb>tion of the frame, cleaned away—I then probed the crack to see where it led to, and found it led immediately to the under side of the floor board of the shop; I then went to the shop floor and there discovered a clear and large opening to the extent of many inches in length, and three-eighths of in inch in width—from different parts of the ceiling, but especially immediately over this opening, were hanging various articles partly consumed, those immediately over the opening were a bundle of one or two dozen tailor's measuring tapes, the under part of them was more or less burnt away, and had evidently come in contact with fire, in the situation in which they still remain—I think the burning of the cotton blind would be most likely to produce the result I saw, because the door would immediately create a draught to the fireplace, and it would naturally find that opening and ascend by it—the shop door communicating with the passage there would be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186006110087"></xptr>
               <p>a large chamber of air—the fire being created under the floor, and this being a communication existing, the natural tendency of flame would be to find its way through the opening to the shop—I do not care about exhausting the air or even diminishing it if there is a passage of'air; the fire being under<lb></lb>neath and an opening above, it would naturally find its way—if you hold a candle to a hole leading from a lower room to an upper one, the flame will find its way through the hole, which would at once do the office of a little chimney.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it you made the examination of these premises? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think on Monday or Tuesday last—I first became acquainted with the fact that a fire had occurred at that place about five minutes before—I never saw the prisoner's husband till this moment—I have rather directed my attention to the prevention of fires in buildings—I have never made investigations in cases of fire supposed to be wilful—this is my first essay in that branch of my profession—it was not by the prisoner's husband that I was taken to see the premises—I walked—there was a solicitor who I happened to know, and who I met five minutes before—I was not informed that an inquest had been held till that moment, it might have been mentioned on the way to the place—I heard that an enquiry had been made, I did not know whether at the police-court or where—I went for the purpose of making an examination, and being possibly examined myself afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you think as a scientific gentleman, possibly to become a scientific witness hereafter, that it would be proper to solicit the fire brigade people to be present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought nothing about it—I did not solicit the presence of any third or independent party, not with the knowledge that the man was a fireman—a man was there, but I did not know he was a fireman till after I left the house—I have not seen that person here to-day—having made these investigations I arrived at the conclusion that I have stated here to-day—I did not then suggest that it would be a fair and proper thing thai those who had investigated the matter should be called to look at this great big fissure, to see whether it was in the same condition as when they saw it after the fire—I saw that it was an old fissure, one of some years' existence, that was perfectly clear—that is the fissure that runs along by the window curtain—at the time I saw the fissure, I saw the part of the counter where the fire had been raging in the shop—I did not see that the fire was confined for the most part to the centre of the counter, and underneath it—I saw it in no particular part—the shop generally was more or less charred with fire in every portion—the under portion of the fissure may have been three fourths of an inch wide—the large portion, immediately over which these articles were hanging partially consumed, was in front of what we should call the story post—the front window is here (<hi rend="italic">pointing to the plan</hi>)—it is very near the door—it is on the entrance side of the counter—it is a perfectly parellel opening, supposing this to be the story post, it had moved away three-eighths of an inch in the width of the story post.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you say that it was on the public side of the counter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and close up to the face of the shop—it was a place that anybody coming into the shop might have stepped over—it ought to have been seen by the witnesses who have been examined to-day—it was just by the side of the door, anybody might see it, or thrust a stick down; it is on your left as you enter, one or two feet from you—I have been in Court to-day, and heard the fireman describe that the bulk and body of the fire was raging under the counter, and so to speak, on the proprietor's side of it, and other</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186006110088"></xptr>
               <p>places also, but I have heard do one deny that it was all over the shop, although it raged there principally—as an architect and surveyor I should have more prudence than to enlarge the opening—I did not take away, or cause to be taken away, any of the ceiling in order to examine the entire portion of the boards themselves—the upper portion being consumed, as you have heard, I considered it unnecessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment would it have been proper to widen the hole? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; nor did I trace what the operation of the fire would be—I saw the certain means of introduction from one room to the other, and my mission was ended—that was a hole which had doubtless existed for years—it had been the work of time since the house was built, or at any rate since it was floored—it is a common occurrence from the vibration—if the ceiling had been plastered in the last eight or ten years, probably it would have been filled up—a fireman was there, he assisted me in making these discoveries, but I did not know he was a fireman; he might have heard my observations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you believe the fire in the shop originated from the fire below? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My object was to see the possibility of the means of communi<lb></lb>cation, but with regard to the transit of the fire, I am not able to guess—I immediately arrived at the conclusion that the fire in the shop above originated in the room below, and that opinion is not now altered—I swear that in my judgment the fire in the shop above originated in the kitchen below, but if it was put to me that the tapes were not hanging there at the time, it would create a doubt; but presuming the things to exist then as they were left by the fire, that is my opinion—I express my opinion chiefly as to the mode of transit of the fire—I do not know what was behind the counter, or suspended over the ceiling, and I do not know the variety of draughts in the shop; these are matters upon which one has no doubt whatever, and it is my opinion that the fire in the shop originated in the kitchen below, but I do not say that it is founded upon any absolute or certain judgment—the hole above is opposite to the other; you might go at this hour and push up a small walking-stick—they are not exactly opposite, but a surveyor's rod or rule would pass from one to the other, or a small walking-stick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the fire originated in the shop below, the flame must have come through one fissure in the ceiling and then through the other fissure and burnt something in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not say, because the fissure might be filled with paper or combustible matter, which would be a vehicle of the flame, and which would no longer exist; but without that I consider that through those twelve inches which I suppose the flame would have to travel it could have travelled without any aid from combustible matter—I do not know whether the edges of the fissure in the shop were charred; the floor was so dark and covered with remains I did not examine them to see whether they were charred from fire, or from the embers about—I did not take the trouble to look whether the edges were charred, and I do not know whether in the present position that would be discoverable—it is possible that the flame would have gone through the fissure without considerably charring the edges, and so as to set fire to the tapes over it—I cannot tell how long the tapes were; they must have burned half their length—my theory is that the flame might have got through the crack, set fire to the tapes, and gone out without much charring the edges—on the lower edges the fire was clearly traceable, quite up to the fissure, and it was perfectly clean there and not like the floor.</p>

I laid hold of the other and sent for a constable; then I saw the handkerchief on the floor, I did not see it drop, it could not have dropped before I laid hold of her, because I had seen that part of the floor immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150016"></xptr>before.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I went into the shop to buy a silk handkerchief; he shewed me several, I did not like them; I pointed to the window to one pattern; he took it down, he asked seven shillings for it; I told him I had no more than three shillings; he cut the handkerchief off and immediately jumped from the counter and seized this woman; I never saw her before; he said good woman, I have nothing against you.</p>
               <p>Sullivan's Defence. When he cut off the handkerchief for this woman he jumped over the counter and seized me; he did not give me time to look at a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called each one witness, who gave them a good character.</p>

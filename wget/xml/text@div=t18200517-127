            . I am a turner, and live in New Montague-street. On Monday evening, the 10th of May, I was passing through Burr-street, and met the prisoner, with another person, not in custody; I watched them a few minutes, saw the prisoner go up to the truck, and draw it away from the cellar - he passed by me, and drew it down Burr-street to Nighingale-lane. I followed, and had him in sight until a cart prevented me, then the other had got it. I turned up Well-street, the prisoner was walking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170063"></xptr>behind the truck; when he got to the Theatre he saw me, and said.</p>
               <p>"To the right." The other person went to the left. The prisoner stopped at a public-house to drink, I watched him out, the other man turned the corner, and I heard the truck drop; a boy said, the man who drew the truck has ran away. I immediately collared the prisoner. Alder claimed the truck.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a man, named Smedley, about eleven o'clock, he said he knew a man who had some old iron to sell, and as we went by Burr-street he said,</p>
               <p>"I have seen this truck several times in the street, and I mean to take it to the Greenyard." I said I would have nothing to do with it. I met him again about four o'clock, he said he would take it to the Greenyard. I said,</p>
               <p>"You may do as you like, I will have nothing to do with it." He said give me a spell - I laid hold of it, and dragged it to Nightingale-lane, he then walked away with it. I went into a public-house with a man whom I knew, came out again, and was taken.</p>

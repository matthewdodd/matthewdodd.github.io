                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an Interpreter</hi>). I am a sailor—on the night of 16th November, I met the prisoner in St. George's Street, I gave her something to drink and went home with her—I gave her is. in the house, I undressed, and put my. clothes on the chair—she told me to wait and I gave her a shilling for the <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> of the house to send for some beer—we drank together, and she told me to go to bed, I did so; she undressed herself but never came to bed—she came close to me and kissed me twice—the lamp was turned off, and she took my clothes and went out; I got up, but it was dark and I could not see anything—I was quite un<lb></lb>dressed, only a flannel on when the <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> came with a light—my clothes were all round the room, and my purse underneath the table with 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—there had been 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—the <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> called the police and I gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

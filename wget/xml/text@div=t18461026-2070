                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and live at Hoxton. On the 27th of Oct. I met the prisoner about two o'clock in the morning, in King-street, Smithfield—I had been drinking gin—I was knocked down with a violent blow on my eye, and robbed of my pocket-handkerchief—this is my handkerchief—I had about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money.</p>

I took the prisoner—I found this handkerchief in his trowsers' pocket—he was standing close to the prosecutor—the prisoner appeared to be drunk, but when he got to the station he was not—Mr. Withers and the other man both stated that they saw him knock the prosecutor down and rob him of his handkerchief, but the other mm is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 26, Union-row, New Kent-road—on Saturday night, 29th August, about a quarter to 12 o'clock, I was in Newington-causeway—some lads called to me from behind; I turned round, and the prisoner came up and said some few words to me, and then hit me in the face—there are plenty of lamps there, and I saw him distinctly—I struck him in return, and we had-a little fighting—three others assisted him, and I was thrown down—I was afterwards thrown a second time—the prisoner was on me and kicked me, and when I got up I missed my watch, which, I believe, my father paid thirty guineas for—it was found two or three yards off—I did not see it in the prisoner's hand.</p>

I am a picture-frame maker, of Baalzephon-street, Bermondsey—I was in Newington-causeway on this Saturday night, and saw the prosecutor and the prisoner fall, as I approached—a man kept calling out, "Hit the cowardly b—"and he picked the prisoner up when he fell—the prisoner then rushed at the prosecutor again, and threw him violently on the back of his head, and then the other man kicked him violently—he seemed to be acquainted with the prisoner—the prosecutor walked from the pavement, just off the kerb, with his hand to his head, the other man then said, "Hit the cowardly b—; he kicked you "—the prisoner then rushed at Mr. Poole and he fell, and when he got up his watch was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to a pawnbroker in Free-school-street, Horsley-down, which is four or five miles from Deptford, between Deptford and London. A man brought this watch to our house about nine o'clock in the morning, on the 16th of June—I firmly believe the prisoner to be the man—I lent him 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—he gave the name of John Brown, Minories—I have not a doubt of him.</p>

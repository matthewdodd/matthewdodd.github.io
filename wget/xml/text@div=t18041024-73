He was asked what he was; he said he was a lighterman, and was present, on the 3d of March last, at a bargain with Inman and Gudgeon, and that Inman engaged to give Gudgeon 4 l. per week for himself and man; he was then asked by Mr. Plomer who that man was, and he said, I am that man. Did you work in the craft? I did, was his answer. To whom did the craft belong? I do not know. Do you know Messrs. Holmes and Bough? I do not know them. Who employed you?

             employed me, he was my master, and paid me my wages. Whose name was on the craft? His answer was, Holmes and Bough. Are you interested in the trial? He answered, I am not. Who were the principals in the bargain - upon your oath, do not you know that Holmes and Bough were the principals, and not Inman? I do not know, Gudgeon was my master, and paid me my wages. What is Inman? I do not know what he is by business. Whose money paid you, and the workman their wages? I do not know, Gudgeon paid me my wages. How long did you work at 4 l. per week?

             the 17th: then Inman said the wages must be lowered to 3 l. 10 s. per week, and Gudgeon continued to work for that sum two weeks; then Inman said he should stop one guinea for a pair of oars missing, and six shillings for not putting the craft on the side of the shore; Gudgeon refused to have his money stopped. Inman offered: him 7 l 14 s. and told him, if he wanted more, he would give him a note to Messrs. Holmes and Bough. Did he give him a sealed note to Mr. Bough? Yes, and he went with him to Holmes and Bough, and Mr. Bough flew in a passion, and said he would have him to the Police-office, and make an example of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I take it for granted, from your notes, you were the attorney in the action? - A. I was solicitor in that cruse.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been paid your costs, I suppose? - A. I have received my money from Messrs. Holmes and Bough.</p>
               <p>Q. At your desire the money was stopped in the hands of the Sheriff, the nine pounds? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. It went before the Grand Jury while it was in the Sheriff's hands? - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. The Jury thought fit to give a verdict against your client? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take those notes in short-hand? - A. No, they were abbreviated.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did not you abbreviate the sentence you have been speaking of - it was not that: I do not know Holmes and Bough at all - But I do not know Holmes and Bough in this business? - A. No such words; the question was asked, do you know Holmes and Bough? he swore he did not, without any comment at all. and that led to the question. Whose name was on the craft? he admitted that the names of Holmes and Bough were on the craft.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no short-hand writer to take this trial down? - A. No, I took it down myself.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no other evidence in the cause but James? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Inman called a great many, and they were not able to overcome the evidence of James? - A. They were not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Had you at that time discovered the defendant's affidavit? - A. No, I had not, that would have put an end to it.</p>

               <p>Q. On whose part did you pay him? - A. For Messrs. Holmes and Bough; he was employed among Messrs. Holmes and Bough's men, and he was paid in the same manner as Holmes and Bough's other men were paid; sometimes I paid the money myself, and sometimes I sent it by other persons; the money came from them; he was discharged in January.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he at that time make any pretence of Inman being their employer, and not Holmes and Bough? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Gudgeon and James being in their employ? - A I do; I hired them myself in the last year; I was the first man that was foreman that was down there; I hired them to serve Holmes and Bough; they continued in the service till they were discharged by the last witness.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time did you hire them in? - A. At the latter end of the last year.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember how many months they were employed altogether? - A. I really cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. What wages were they hired for? - A. First of all, at 30 s per week, per man, and I paid them the money separate; and then I rose it to 40 s. and then I reduced it to 35 s per week; I never paid them their wages both together at one time in my life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you ever pay them one farthing in the month of March last? - A. I cannot say I have.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you employed in paying the servants of the London Docks? - A. I payed them at Greenwich; I paid James and Gudgeon both separate money, and they gave me separate receipts; they positively knew they were in the employ of Holmes and Bough; the payment of James and Gudgeon was transferred from Warden to me by Mr. Hollis.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on the 3d of March last, make a bargain with them, intending to give Gudgeon 4 l. per week for himself and his man James? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom did the craft belong to in which they worked? - A. To Messrs. Holmes and Bough; they positively knew it; I have paid James separate and Gudgeon separate.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not pay Gudgeon for both, as James being his servant? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. On what account were they both discharged? - A. For damaging the craft; laying it in an improper place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did James or Gudgeon make any application to you about the money being stopped about any oars? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you took receipts from the prisoner and from Gudgeon, when you paid them; shew me one of them? - A. Mr. Coombes has got them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did they know what you were? - A. Certainly, they knew I was agent or superintendant over the work for Messrs Holmes and Bough; I was paid 30 s. a week for my labour.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did you ever pay them any money after the 3d of March to the 31st of March? - A. I paid them money in the month of March; I will not answer to a day or an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You paid them separately, and they gave separate receipts? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not pay any money that you did not take receipts for? - A. I took no receipts besides them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever after the third of March pay one farthing to the prisoner or to Gudgeon? - A. I will not answer the question so close as that; I paid money after the third of March, but I will not swear to the day.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. This is a most extraordinary thing to charge the defendant with perjury, because if perjury is imputed to any one, it ought to be imputed to a man against whom a verdict is recovered. If there were any interest on the part of the defendant it would be some thing; but there is not one single particle of interest in the defendant, nor even in Gudgeon; that I will shew you. An action was brought against the last witness, by a man of the name of Gudgeon; it was tried at Guildhall, in the month of June. and a verdict was recovered for work and labour performed by Gudgeon for the last witness. Inman.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. I am master of a vessel belonging to Mr. Wiggan, Blackwall.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Inman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Inman ever employ you to do any work? - A. Yes, on the 3d of March last, in putting craft ashore on the beds where the people leave the rubbish, at Greenwich; leastways where they put them on shore.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that, did you employ the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did; he continued to work with me for a month, from the 3d to the 31st of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Inman said who was to pay you? - A. Inman told me he was to employ me, and was to pay me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did you or did you not look to him for the payment of the money? - A. Exactly so; the prisoner James was present when the agreement was made; I called him for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the principal of the action when the action was tried in the Court of Exchequer? - A. Yes, I was present at the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. When James swore that you were employed by Inman, did he swear false or true? - A. He swore not false, he swore true.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. James was your servant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time what wages was Inman to give you? - A. Four pounds a week.</p>
               <p>Q. From the 3d of March to the 31st, Inman agreed to give you 4 l. a week; you considered Inman as your master? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. The 3d of March last was the first of this kind of work you did? - A. No, I had worked before, I cannot tell how long; I might have worked for them from February.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you work for them in October, November, and December, in the craft? - A. No, I was at sea at the time, as my attorney knows; I am certain it was not before January; I rather think in February.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the first person that employed you? - A.

               <p>Q. Take care Mr. Gudgeon, for half a dozen people will prove the contrary than you mean to swear, and have it taken down in writing, that you did not know, when Warden employed you; you did not know that it was Holmes and Bough that employed you? - A. No, I thought it was his money.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought it was his money; and that is as true as all the rest you have sworn? - A. Yes; Mr. Inman decoyed me away from Warden.</p>
               <p>Q. When Warden employed you, was James your servant then? - A. Yes, one week.</p>
               <p>Q. Then James received his wages from you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, when Inman paid you, you received 4 l. for yourself and man? - A. I received 4 l. the first week I worked for Inman; he said, Gudgeon, it will do as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180410240050"></xptr>well to give you a stamp and 
               <persName id="t18041024-73-person656">James</persName>

               <p>Q. So for want of a fourpenny stamp he gave you two two-penny stamps? Who was his master? - A. He never told me who was his master, there are so many in the company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the names of Messrs. Holmes and Bough on the craft, or on the oars? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you never knew the names before? Now you say you saw the names? - A. Yes; on some of them, I cannot tell how many.</p>
               <p>Q. Half-a-dozen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not forty? - A. Very possibly there might.</p>
               <p>Q. And you never conceived Inman or Warden were servants of Messrs. Holmes and Bough? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were employed, together, about a couple of months? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What were you discharged for at last? - A. There was no turn off at all, I gave them a fortnight's warning; I went about my business because I could not get my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Inman telling you there must be a guinea stopped for a pair of oars, and six shillings for something else? - A. Yes; we put them on shore, and they said, they were not put on shore to their minds.</p>
               <p>Q. Who stopped the guinea? - A. Mr. Inman; I asked Mr. Inman for a tick, and he sent me to Mr. Bough; he gave me a note, he said it was a tick for my money; I went to Mr. Bough, and he said he would have me the next day to the Police-office, and there he would make an example of me; I did not tell Mr. Bough I came for the money.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whose oars were these that were lost? - A. It is uncertain, because there are many oars in the craft; I never saw the oars with my eyes at any time, I have seen as many other people's oars, with other people's names on them, in his craft.</p>
               <p>Q. They are not the oars belonging to Inman? - A. No; Mr. Inman told me he would stop the money for the oars; I told him it was very hard that he should stop the money, but if it was legal I would pay it; they stopped the money because I would leave them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find out who these oars belonged to? - A. It is impossible, there is such a quantity of oars; these people told me they were to employ me, and pay me my wages;

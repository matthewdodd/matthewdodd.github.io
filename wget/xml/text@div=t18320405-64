               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure that the man you saw running you found sitting on the dung? A. Yes - I saw the violin in his hand before I heard the cry.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I was going to Islmgton; I saw a man run from Perceval-street, and turn up Seward-street, with a violln under his arm - nobody was in pursuit; I heard a cry of Stop thief! and followed him; a little girl at the bottom of the court said he was gone into a yard - I could not find him; I met the Policeman alone; we had been in the court several minutes when the prosecutor came up.</p>

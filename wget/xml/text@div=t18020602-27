Yes, there was an alarm given, that the window was broke, and some lace stolen; I immediately ran into the street, and saw Mr. Wells come in with a quantity of lace in his hand, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180206020012"></xptr>pointed out the prisoner as the boy who had done it; the prisoner was at that time in custody; I delivered the lace to the constable.</p>

             sworn. - I was passing the end of Chancery-lane, about five minutes after eight in the evening, and saw a lad, as I conceived, mending Mr. Thomas's window, I thought it was a glazier's servant; I passed him, and then it occurred to me that it was an extraordinary thing that he should be mending a window at that time of night; I turned my head again, and observed the prisoner at the bar drawing something throught a hole in the window, which turned out to be lace; he drew it through the window with both hands pretty rapid; I said, you young scoundrel, what are you doing? upon which he ran away; I ran after him, and a few yards beyond the end of Chancery-lane, he was taken by a person who is not here; I came back, took the lace up, and delivered it to the constable, the window that was broke was eight or ten yards up Chancery-lane; there was only a part of the lace out at the window, the card still remained in the window.</p>

            (To Weatherhead.) How far was this lace from the window? - A. A yard or more; the square of glass had been broke before, but had been made perfectly secure with putty; the glass was not broke, but the cracked part was shoved in a little way, so that they could get hold of the end of the lace.(

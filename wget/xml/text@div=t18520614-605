                  </hi>. I am shopwoman to Mr. Shreeve, a hosier and glover, at Charing-cross. On 3rd June, the prisoner came, and asked for a boy's collar—she chose one, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she paid me with a sovereign—it was good—I gave her in change a half sovereign, eight shillings, and two sixpences—I am quite sure the half sovereign I gave her was a good one—she rung it on the counter, and said, "I hope this is a good one; my mistress is very particular, and if it is not good, I shall have to come back; I once took her one that was cracked, and then I had to bring it back"—I said, "You will not have to do that; I am quite sure this is a good one," and in order to satisfy her more I tried it in the detector, and it was a good one—it did not bend at all—I gave it her—she took that and the rest of the change, and went to the door—she returned, and said, "I must trouble you to change this, I don't think it is good"—I said I was quite sure it was, for all we had in the till was good—she produced a half sovereign—I do not at all think it was the same that I gave her—Mr. Shreeve, my master, was there—I gave it him to try it in the detector—it turned out to be bad; it bent—I do not think it was the half sovereign I gave her—I had tried that, and it did not bend—it was not out of my sight from the time Mr. Shreeve took it.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner in my shop on 3rd June—I received a half sovereign from Miss Park—I gave it to my wife—I got it back from her—it had been out of my sight in the meanwhile—I saw a man come into the shop—I believe he asked for some collars—the prisoner was requested to stay in the shop, and she staid after the man came in, two or three minutes—I did not see her go out—she walked out—I followed her—she had been requested to stop till a policeman came—a policeman was mentioned before she went out—the man was not in the shop at the time we spoke about the policeman—when the prisoner went out I followed her—the man attempted to prevent me by placing his back against the door—I got out, and saw the prisoner run along the street into the Ship Tavern—I followed her, and she was there with several other persons, who were following her, I believe—I saw a child, I do not know who had it—I gave the prisoner into custody—I got a half sovereign from my wife—I gave it to the policeman—I do not know that I should know it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not the prisoner indignant at the charge, and did she not tell you that she would go and find a policeman herself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect that—I will not swear that she did not—she said that the half sovereign was the one that had been given her by my shopwoman, and she waited two or three minutes after I talked about getting a policeman—a man came in to buy something—I do not know what became of him—I did not hear him speak to the prisoner, or the prisoner to him—he was not present when the charge was made against the prisoner for passing this bad money—the charge had been made before—I did not suppose at that time that he had anything to do with the woman—I judged so by his conduct at the door, and he said to my wife, "Let her alone"—possibly before he said that, the prisoner had reiterated in his presence that the half sovereign had been given her by my shopwoman—I did not ask the man to stop or to give me his address—when I went after the prisoner I left the man in the shop—I never saw him afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. I was in the shop, and saw him with a half sovereign—he looked at it, and tried it—it bent—the prisoner was standing by the counter—I said, "I fear you are not doing right; this is not the first or second case that has occurred; we must for your own justification have you searched"—she was not searched in my presence—a man came in, and asked for collars—I said we had no collars that I thought would suit him—he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out some silver, and I observed he was hurried, and very much agitated—the prisoner got up, and went to the door—I tried to prevent her going out—the man said, "Let her alone," and he put me away from the door—the prisoner made her escape, and I followed her from the private door—I afterwards gave the half sovereign to my husband—I am quite sure it was the same I had received from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

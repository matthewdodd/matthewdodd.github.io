            . I heard an alarm in Corporation-row, and saw somebody running, who, immediately on seeing us, went across the field; I followed and took him; it was the prisoner; he went behind a new house - he was brought to me. I took him to the prosecutor, who said he could swear to him. There was nothing found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there sufficient light to swear to a man - Q. I think not.</p>

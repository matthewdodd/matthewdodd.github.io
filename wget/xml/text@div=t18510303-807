                  </hi>. I keep a beer-shop in Waterloo-road, Lambeth. I lost some lead from the kitchen of my house—the policeman called on me with this lead on 15th Feb., I then examined and missed it—it is a portion of the old lead that I had down in my kitchen—about forty feel</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 175.) I saw the prisoner on Friday evening, 14th Feb., about half-past seven o'clock—there was another per<lb></lb>son with him, who I believe was Goodwin—I stopped the prisoner, and asked what he had about him—I thought his pockets appeared bulky, and I had seen him loitering about a marine-store shop—he said, "Only a bit of lead-pipe that I picked up round the corner"—I put my hand into his pocket, and found a portion of this lead-pipe—my brother-officer took a portion of it from his other pocket—he had it doubled up, so that it laid close in his jacket-pockets—he said he found it standing against a wall round the corner—I said it was a very unsatisfactory account, and I took him to the station—he had turned a corner, but I had seen him, and if he had picked the lead up I should think I must have seen him.</p>

I was with Revell, and helped to search the prisoner—I took the rest of this lead-pipe—I took it to the prosecutor's the next day—I examined the kitchen, and found lead which corresponded with this—it was of the same size as this, and was similar pipe—it was in a length—I could not find that the ends of this pipe would fit the ends of that in the kitchen.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he employed by you to receive money for you. - A. Yes, during the time he lived with me; all those who chose to pay ready money, he had power to receive money from them upon bread being delivered.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a customer of the name of Edward Bramwell. - A. Yes, he lived in Oxford street; the prisoner had a book to set down the bread he delivered, and the money he received; in that book he states 11th of February one half quartern loaf, and on the 12th a half quartern loaf, that is elevenpence halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Whether in the hurry of business he may not have made a mistake of not marking it paid. - A. I do not think it is likely.</p>
               <p>MR. BRAMWELL. Q. Do you purchase bread of Mr. Harris. - A. Yes. On the 12th of February, I paid the prisoner elevenpence halfpenny for a half quarter loaf I had that day, and one I had on the preceding day.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did the prisoner ever pay you the elevenpence halfpenny for these two half quartern loaves delivered on the 11th and 12th. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Did he always account with you. - A. He always accounted to me or my sister.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether he accounted to her for them. - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not take the money with any felonious intent; my master did not pay me my wages every week, I kept that money till he paid me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Cuthbert—we live in Turville-street, Bethnal-green. On Monday, the 10th of November, I sent my little girl to the baker's shop at the corner of the street, for a four pound loaf—I gave her half-a-crown, which was wrapped in sugar paper—her name is the same as mine—a boy knocked at my door, and said that a boy had taken it out of her hand—I ran down the court, but</p>

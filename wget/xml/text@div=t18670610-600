                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Wolmershausen, a tailor, of 47 and 48, Halfmoon Street—the prisoner was in his employment—shortly after the strike, I saw him in Halfmoon Street with others, some of whom had also been in my master's employment and some had not—he was following the men, one of our men especially, who was willing to work, and did work in spite of all—I saw him doing so once, and I followed, to see what he was going to do.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alexander Verbaum, who has been nearly five years in Mr. Wolmershausen's employ—he was foreman, but afterwards he did work, not in my place, but in another place—on 2nd May I was at 7, Sherwood Street, Golden Lane—I heard the bell ring and locked my room-door—I went outside and found some men on the staircase, the prisoner is one of them—he said that my husband was no man, and they would strike against him when the strike was over—they said, "We strike against him"—after that they asked me to open the door and I did, and he wanted to know whether my husband was in or not—they saw that he was not there; they looked into the cupboard, and I said, "You can look under the bed, too; my husband is not in"—my friend opened the cup<lb></lb>board door—they went down stairs and made a very noise—the prisoner said twice that he would knock my husband down, on which I held up my finger and said that there was a lady up stairs—they then made a noise on</p>

               <p>the stairs and went away—I have not fetched work home, because my husband has had no work in the place for a year and a half—we left the house on the Monday or Tuesday after that, and went to live at 15, Stanley Place, Pimlico—we had not been going to move before these people came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did Geary say about knocking your husband down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said it twice on the staircase, "I knock your husband down"—my friend, Mrs. Lamb, was then up stairs—I do not know Francis Carr; I never heard the name—this was on 2nd May, about five in the afternoon—Mr. Carr is my landlord—I did not see him there or anybody else—the staircase goes up higher than where I was standing—any person on the staircase could hear what I said, and what was said to me—when they first spoke to me I did not laugh—I let Mr. Geary in, and said, "You may go and look under the bed"—when he came out he said, "I will knock your husband down"—I do not know who else was near enough to hear that—Mary Brand was there—I do not know whether she was near enough to hear that, or to hear what I said—Geary said that the society would strike against my husband, not strike him off their books—I did not hear him say, "Strike against him"—I know the name of William Juman, but I saw him not—when Geary said, "I will knock your husband down," I said, "I have a lady up stairs, take notice what you say"—Mrs. Lamb heard that.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the same house as Mrs. Vicerlon lived in on 2nd May—I was in the room when Geary and others came—I heard a noise on the stairs, and heard her say, "If you won't be so noisy I will open the door for you"—she opened it, and the prisoner and another man came into the room—Geary said, "Open the door," and I opened the cupboard door—he said, "Mr. Fritz is no man"—I went, by Mrs. Fritz's directions, to Mr. Verbaum and said something to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What frightened you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That the men would knock me down; a man told my wife that he would do so—when you get a couple of dozen men against you must be frightened—they did not molest me, because I took too much notice of it—this was 2nd May, the strike had been in existence then, I think, a week—I am not quite sure.</p>

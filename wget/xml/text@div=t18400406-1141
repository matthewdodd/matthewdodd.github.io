                  </hi>. I am a cow-keeper, and live in New Inn-yard, Shoreditch. The prisoner came to my yard, on the 5th of March, and said he knew of a pig to be sold very cheap, if I would go and look at it—I knew him by sight, but had never entrusted him to do any thing for me—I hesitated some time, and at last I went to look at the pig—the person who had it asked 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I offered 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and left—at seven o'clock in the evening the prisoner and the owner of the pig came, the owner said I should have the pig for three sovereigns, and I paid him—the prisoner then said, "I have got nothing to do, I will bring the pig in the morning, let he have 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. now," which I did—he never brought it—I afterwards saw him at the station-house—he said, "Don't book the charge, I have sent for the money, you will have it di<lb></lb>rectly"—I said I wanted the pig, not the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father at Bethnal-green. On the 6th of March, the prisoner came and said he had come for the sow for Mr. Halfhead—I delivered it to him—my father had been paid for it the night before—he asked me to help him drive the sow a little way, and before I could get round, he was out of sight with it.</p>

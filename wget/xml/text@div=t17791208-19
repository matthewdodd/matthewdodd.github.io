I lost a gold ring last Sunday night, a little after eleven o'clock, as I was going home; the prisoner followed me; he touched the lace of my cloak, and asked me, did I want a coach? I held out my hand and said no; he catched hold of my hand and held it fast till he got my ring off my finger; I had no glove on either hand; I had hold of him, and called the watch, before the ring was quite off; it was off when the watchman came up. The watchman took him to the watch-house, and delivered him to the constable.</p>
               <p>Was the ring ever found? - No, he said he was waterman to the horses.</p>

               <p>This was after eleven at night? - Yes; I kept hold of him till the watchman came up.</p>
               <p>Did he ask you for any thing else? - Nothing but if I wanted a coach, I said no.</p>
               <p>Might not the ring drop off as he squeezed your hand? - No, he catched at the finger with the ring and pulled off the ring.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether she can swear I am the identical person that did it.</p>
               <p>Garrett. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether she can swear there was any body near me for me to deliver the ring to?</p>
               <p>Garrett. I cannot say; there was a man behind him, who ran away as soon as the ring was off.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I am a Calvinist in my principles, and desire I may be sworn according to the present from of the church of Scot-land, with an uplifted hand, and not to kiss the book. (His request being granted, he was sworn.) I am a coachman. On Sunday evening, about a quarter before twelve o'clock the prosecutrix passed me as I was feeding my horses, by Sweet-Apple-court; the prisoner spoke to her in a low voice; I could not hear what he said; they walked together twenty-nine paces by my measurement, and conversed a few minutes; I thought they were going about some other business; when they were at the corner of Dunning's-alley, she called watch; I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080027"></xptr>up to her; she had hold of the prisoner, and said he had taken her ring; I did not see any other person with the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 18th of November, about half-past twelve o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoners, on different sides of the way, in the Strand, each carrying a basket, which seemed heavy. I secured Curtis with his basket full of lead, and asked how he came by it - he said he had collected it about the country. Wotten took Curtis, and on the way to the office he denied all knowledge of Blackman; but at the office they gave their addresses both at one place, at Hammersmith. The lead weighed 105 lbs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Were they together when Curtis denied knowing the other - A. Yes. They got into conversation at the office.</p>

            . I was with Davis, and took Blackman, with a basket full of lead, about half a hundred weight; he said he picked it up in the road, and had had it some time, and Curtis knew nothing about it - that he lived in Bond-street, Chiswick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell him you was an officer - A. Certainly; both gave their addresses, but I did not hear what the other said.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Mr. Frere's house, with one sheet of the lead, but could not match it. I drew the nails, and brought away what remained, and it corresponded with what I found on the prisoners; the edges appear fresh cut.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not mixed that you brought from the house with the rest - A. They have been together, but I know the difference between them - what I found on the prisoners is marked.</p>

               <p>On the 29th of January, I saw the prisoners cut or break the glass of Mr. Ward's window, with some instrument or other; I went into the shop to see what they were doing, and I saw the glass that was broke, and some halfpence and farthings lying under it; they had not got the piece out then.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house was it that this glass was so broke? - A. The shop is in the front of the street; after I had been in and seen what they were doing, I came out, and passed them; I walked up the street about twenty yards; I crossed the street, and came down the other side; just as I got against them, I saw them take the piece of glass out; and one put his hand into the hole; but I could not see which; I saw his fingers in; but I did not see him take any thing out; I saw it afterwards; and put my hand into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing within reach of the persons, if they tried? - A. There was about five or six shillings-worth of halfpence lay just under the hole, that any body might reach it with their hand.</p>
               <p>Q.How came they to leave off the attempt? - A. I believe I took them before they had the opportunity; they began to cut the place larger; I thought myself not capable of taking them, and I went to Mr.Hill's, the next door but one, to get a man to assist me; he stood about ten yards from me, while I took them both by the collar, and then he came and laid hold of one them; one of their hands was part of the way in at the window, at the time I laid hold of them; but they stood so close together, I could not tell which of them it was; the other witness can tell; we took them to the watch-house that night, and the next morning they were taken before the Magistrate in Lambeth-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe, when you were at the Justices, the two men were offered to go as soldiers? - A. I believe there was something mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. The Justices thought they were proper objects to serve his Majesty? - A. I did not hear the Magistrates offer it; I believe it was one of the clerks.</p>
               <p>Q. This was between nine and ten at night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from this house? - A. I live next door to it.</p>
               <p>Q. There were some halfpence near? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So near that they might have laid hold of those halfpence, if they had thought fit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That they did not do? - A. I cannot say whether they did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when they were searched? - A. Yes; five pennyworth of halfpence were found upon one, and a knife; and, I think, to the best of my recollection, 3s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no implements of house-breaking found upon them? - A. No; only a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. But no crow, or any thing of that sort? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a knife yourself; I dare say every body has? - A. Yes; I have one now.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How was it broke? - A. It was broke, by some instrument drove in between the putty and the glass.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. There was no diamond found upon them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know that there is a reward in this case? - A. I don't do such things for reward.</p>
               <p>Q.You have heard of such a thing as a reward for each of them? - A. I have; but I did not do it for that.</p>

               <p>When I came out of my master's house, I saw one of them with his hand in the hole of the window; the last witness got hold of one, and I got hold of the other; and we took them to the watch-house; Molloy offered to pay for the window, if we would not keep him in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the hole of the glass, where it was broke? - A. About half of the glass was broke.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it big enough for a man's hand to go in? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You don't know, whether the pane broke was large enough to admit a man's hand? - A. No.</p>
               <p>- AINSLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 29th of January, I was in the watch-house; I am the keeper of the watch-house; the two prisoners were brought to me, and given charge of; I asked what the charge was; they told me, they had been cutting windows at Mr. Ward's.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you that? - A. Taylor and Harrop; with that, I searched the prisoners immediately, and found five pennyworth of halfpence upon one and a knife; and I searched the other, Molloy, and found 3s. 6d. in his pocket, and a knife; so that there were two knives between the two; Molloy said immediately, I will pay for the window, if you won't detain me.</p>
               <p>Q.This was about nine o'clock? - A. It was a little before ten when they were brought to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any curiosity to go and see the win<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170030"></xptr>dow? - A. Not directly; I went that way home, and saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it broke? - A. There was a piece out big enough to put one's hand in.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was the putty removed from the window? - A. Yes; and there was the mark of it on the knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You saw the window afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear as if it had been broke before and mended with putty, or was it a whole pane? - A. No; it had been broke before, and puttied across, but it was cut nearer the frame.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an intention to discharge them? - A. No; I said, it could not be.</p>
               <p>Q. This window had been broke and puttied? - A. It had been broke across, but the piece did not appear to have been out, but the putty was put to keep it whole.</p>
               <p>Barnett's defence. I was going along, and a man bid another man lay hold of me, and said he would bring another; he says he took the money out of both of our pockets; it was all taken out of mine; the prosecutor said, before the Justice, that the window was broke before.</p>
               <p>Molloy's defence. I was coming by the place, a man laid hold of me, and took me into the shop, and asked if the man had lost any thing; he said no; but the window was broke.(The prisoner, Molloy, called four witnesses, who gave him a good character).(The prisoner, Barnett, called three witnesses, who gave him a good character).</p>

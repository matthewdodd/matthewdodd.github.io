I knocked at Mr. Norris's door, and the prisoner came and snatched them out of my hand; it was last week, I don't recollect the day of the month, it was about seven at night; it was light then, it was moon-light; I had a good opportunity of seeing the man; I am sure the prisoner is the man; he said he would have the bundle, and he snatched it out of my hand; there were two blankets and a pocket handkerchief outside. When he snatched it out of my hand, I cried out; the man turned round the corner, and a gentleman stopped him; he was not long out of my sight before he was stopped; I saw him again in about two minutes; I was then sure that he was the same man. The gentleman had picked the bundle up. I never said some other man had done it; the prisoner was quite a stranger to me.</p>

            . I am a messenger to Messrs. Kaye and Freshfield. On Friday, the 9th of February, I was on my way from London-wall along Winchester-street, and on hearing a cry of stop thief, I observed the prisoner running along on the other side of the way with a bundle under his arm; when he came to the corner, he threw something from him; but I did not look to that so much, as my eye was on him; he did not get above four or five yards further before he made a short stop; I challanged him with being the thief, and he said, he was not. There was not a person within thirty yards of us at that time. I told him he had thrown the parcel away, and I told the people to look after the parcel, while I had him in custody; the parcel was picked up. The little girl when she saw the prisoner, could identify him in the most clear manner, and declared that the prisoner was the man; she never appeared to have any doubt.</p>

            . I am clerk to King and Company, merchants. I was proceeding homeward, and I reached as far as Winchester-street; I heard some child crying, and my curiosity, or rather my attention was attracted, and I heard a cry of stop thief. I joined in the pursuit, and they said that the man had been stealing a bundle. A gentleman came up with the bundle under his arm, and the child said that is the bundle, but by no means intimated that that gentleman was the person who stole it. I was going along and I picked up a bundle. This same gentleman went with me part of the way. It was as I proceeded homeward. The bundle the gentleman had was his own, and the child mistook. The bundle I picked up, I delivered to the last witness, and he gave it to the child.</p>

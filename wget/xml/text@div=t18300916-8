the night before.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty about half-past one o'clock at night on the 14th of August, and saw the prisoner and another man coming down Duck-lane, in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster - (I know the prosecutor's house is in that parish); I was going up, and the 
instant they saw me the prisoner dropped these boots, and both ran away - the boots were wrapped in two handkerchiefs; the prisoner had both bundles when I saw them - they made off to the top of the lane, then went different ways; I followed the prisoner - Sarnbell saw me following him; he ran up, and caught him in his arms - I left him in his custody, returned to the spot, and picked up the boots; we took him to the watch-house - my brother officer found a knife on the prisoner; I went next morning with the inspector and superintendent to the prosecutor's, and matched the knife to the shutter - the pannel appeared to have been cut with a knife, it was cut down so level, and then forced out with a chisel; there must have been some instrument like a knife used.</p>

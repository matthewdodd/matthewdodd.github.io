Landseer, and I published the engraving in 1866—I bought the copyright of Mr. Flatow—I never purchased the picture—Mr. Flatow bought it of Sir E.

GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you spoke of having sold the first picture that was mentioned to Mr. Gambart; what do you mean, exactly? do you mean, you agreed to sell it to him, and it was not entirely carried out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not, it was a peculiar case; it was in this way: Mr. Gambart came to me, and I understood he was to have the picture; and a short time after that Mr. Agnew came to my studio, and saw the picture, and told me he had bought it of Mr. Gambart, and at that time he understood that the copyright was mine, a fact which he must have dis<lb></lb>covered from Mr. Agnew—he wished to have the copyright as well as the picture, and there and then he gave me a cheque for the copyright—that was on 27th January, 1863, and the next day Mr. Gambart paid me for the picture; so I was paid by Mr. Agnew for the copyright before I was paid for the picture—Mr. Gambart has not complained.</p>

                  </hi>, R. A. I am the painter of the picture called "The Railway Station"—it was begun in 1860 and finished in 1862—the picture from which the engraving was taken was finished in December, 1862, and the whole transaction was completed in 1863—it was painted on commission for Mr. Flatow—he had two pictures of the same subject.</p>

I painted the picture "Ordered on Foreign Ser<lb></lb>vice"—I commenced it in 1861, and completed it in 1862—I sent it to the British Institution, in Pall Mall, and subsequently sold it te Mr. Graves—I made certain reservations as to the copyright when I transferred it to Mr. Graves—I reserved to myself the right of disposing of all studies and sketches of the said picture in my possession—this is a memorandum I made: "I afterwards, before the said payment was made, transferred to him the copyright, and gave him a slip to that effect."</p>

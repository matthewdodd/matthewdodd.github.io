                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I lived with that man twelve years, and out of that I have had ten years of misery, knocking me about, even in my confine<lb></lb>ments. I had to be taken to the hospital. I had my ribs broken, and he threatened to put me into a boiling copper. He would not support me, and has left me with a pennyworth of milk for me and my child. I had to go to the workhouse, and he had to pay for my maintenance for a fortnight. He then begged me to come back again. I was in the family way, and he turned me out; I had to go about carrying a dead child in me, while he was living with another woman. I came home after two months with brain fever. He was then cohabiting with another woman, underneath. He struck me on the head, and I was taken to the Marylebone Infirmary, and was out of my mind for three weeks through his ill-usage. When I came back there was not a stick in the place; he had taken both my children away, and left only a bag of shavings. I then collected another home, and he came home on 12th January. On 28th March he commenced breaking up my things again, and ill-used me, and struck me in the breast with the leg of the table. I left him for some weeks, and then came back. I was then in the family way again, towards the latter end of the year; my breast was very bad, and after a three weeks' confinement I had to go to the Middlesex Hospital, and remained there four months, and during that time he never came near me to give me even an ounce of tea. The last fortnight he deserted my children, and did not give them a loaf of bread. I had to leave the hospital before my time to see my children. On 5th September, last year, I was taken ill in the street, and taken to the union, and was laid up for a month, and when I came home I found my home gone, and these two living together as man and wife. This time I would not have gone near him, but I wished to see my children. I asked him to leave me the eldest, as she did not belong to him. He said he would do as he liked with her, and I should not have anything to do with her. I went to see her on the Saturday night, and found that my husband had been to the Magistrate making a statement that I only wanted to get her away from her situation in order to pawn her clothes, which was quite wrong; the girl wanted to leave. When I found that I was refused admission to the girl I went and bought this, but not for him; I did not intend to find him at home, as he is generally at the public-house at that time of night. My sister answered me through the door, and defied me to come in; she said she was inside and she would take care to keep me out. I sat on the stairs for a quarter of an hour, and when he came up stairs she called out "Look out, Amos; there is somebody on the stairs;" he said "Is there?" I said "Yes, there is," and I threw the cup in the darkness. I could not see where I threw it. I then waited till the policeman came. That is all I have to say.</p>

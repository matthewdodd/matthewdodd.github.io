I am a baker, of 131, New Church-street, Bermondsey—about eighteen months ago, the prisoner was recommended to me as a painter, and I employed him to paint a barrow for me—he has been in my shop four or five times since then, as a customer—on 18th June, I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) by post; this is the envelope in which it was enclosed, and which also enclosed this other envelope; this is what I sent—I received it by post—in consequence of receiving that letter I com<lb></lb>municated with the police directly—I caused this IOU for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be drawn up, and authorized the police-officer to put my signature—he wrote the whole of it, my name included, by my authority, and posted it—I have had opportunities of seeing the prisoner write—I have only seen him write once—I have not received any letters from him—I have a bill for work done by him for me—I discharged that bill, and he received the money—he receipted the bill in my presence—I believe this letter to be in the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>): "17th June.

The only remedy left open to you is this, that you sell full weight in future, and enclose in this directed envelope, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

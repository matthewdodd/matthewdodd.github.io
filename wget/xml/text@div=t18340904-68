               <p>Prisoner. I was stooping down to pick it up as it was on the ground - a gentleman said he saw me stooping to pick it up. Witness. I saw it in his hand - nobody said they had seen him pick it up - he was close to my elbow - I felt it going out of my pocket, turned round, and collared him momentarily - he was quite upright with this handkerchief in his hand.</p>

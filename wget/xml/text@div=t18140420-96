            . On the Sunday night after Christmas-day, me and the prisoner Freeman went to Mr. Smith's livery-stables; about twelve o'clock, as near as I can guess, we came to his gates; I opened it with a latch-key, and then Freeman and me went into Mr. Smith's livery-stable yard; we got two coach-glasses and a box coat out of one of the coach-houses; we took them away from that place. I went and concealed them at my mother's house that night, and the same night I and Freeman slept together at Butcher's house. On the next day I got the glasses away from my mother's; we were going to sell them at some acquaintance of Freeman's in Golden-lane, and then when we were going up Chick-lane two officers detected us, and took us in custody with them. We had three examinations.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the glasses in their custody - A. Freeman had the glasses under his arm at the time we were taken. We had three examinations; nobody came forward to own the glasses. We were discharged, and the officers had the glasses.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is Franklin - A. The last witness; he answered to the name of Bennet. I saw Freeman with two coach-glasses under his left arm. I had seen him before along with thieves; I suspected he had stolen them. I stopped, and asked him what he had got there; he said, they were coach-glasses, they were his own, he had found them the night before in Covent Garden market. I told him he must give me a better account than that, or else I should take him before the magistrate. I then took him to a public-house, and searched them. I found nothing upon Freeman; on

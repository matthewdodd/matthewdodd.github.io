I live in Sackville Place, Lambeth—I work at tobacconist's, and have known Fowler, a cabman, since 1860—I know the prisoner by seeing him at Fowler's house—I remember the accident at New Cross—I went with Fowler to the prisoner's house in a cab, about three months ago—he was lying on a bed, with his trowsers on, and he had a handkerchief round his head—he said, "Good morning, sir"—Fowler had told me that he had met with an accident, and I said it was a bad job for him—he asked me if I would do him a favour, and I inquired what it was—he replied, "Oh, merely to say that you saw me when the accident occurred"—I said, "Yes, if it will do you a favour"—he said, "It is merely on account of the lawyers having got the money in hand; and, if you say that, I shall get it all the sooner out of their hands," or something to that effect, "or else they will eat it half up"—I said I would say so, and then I and Fowler left, and we went to his house—I saw the prisoner again in about three weeks—I think it was after I had received a note from Mr. Scott, his solicitor—the note is destroyed, I think, as I cannot find it—I think it was burnt—the prisoner told me I was to say that I had been with him to the Crystal Palace, and was in the train when the accident occurred—he told me what to say, and I told Mr. Scott, and something else about the time the train started, which was 11 o'clock, I believe—I have forgotten what else he said—I did not sign the statement which I made to Mr. Scott—I went back to Mr. Scott, at prisoner's request—I told him that I rode with the prisoner in the train, the time, and such like, but I forget what else, as it is so long ago—I was to say that I saw Dickeson at London Bridge, and that he came out in a cab; that I put him into a cab, and sent him home—I heard nothing said about brandy—it was not true that I was at the London Bridge Terminus—I did not give evidence at the writ of inquiry—I was tipsy at the time—I did not know there was any action being tried, or anything of the kind—I thought it was merely to enable him to get the money out of the lawyer's hands, and I did not know that the Crystal Palace Company had anything to do with the case—Mr. and Mrs. Fowler went with me to Scott's, and stayed outside—I gave my name and address to the prisoner when I first saw him, and I believe that he took it down on a bit of paper, an envelope, or something of the kind.</p>

I am one of the surgeons of the University College Hospital—I remember seeing the prisoner on the 27th June, the Sunday after the accident, at the request of Dr. Maclure, the surgeon of the college—he told me that he was ruptured, and he was wearing a truss—it was a remarkably strong truss, and it caused a good deal of pressure on the groin—it caused irritation, and would have been injurious in a recent rupture—there was swelling, which might have been caused by the truss—I found it was all gone in three days afterwards—he said that Dr. Simpson had ordered him to wear the truss—he called my attention to his knee, but I saw no bruises—I reported my impression of the matter to the Company—I did not believe his statement that he had been recently injured—I thought not, and I reported so.</p>

               <p>as to a compromise—I did not suggest to the Company any sum in liquidation of damages—I sent my report in to Dr. Maclure—I do not think that persons who have been seriously ruptured would be able to walk a considerable distance immediately afterwards—a great deal, as I have said, would depend on the circumstances of the case—muscular and physical exertion could not be taken immediately after a rupture has been caused, without great pain and suffering—there would be signs of inability to walk, and so on—if a man was bandaged up, and kept quiet for a fort<lb></lb>night, he might be able to get about with a truss—the prisoner's truss was not altered according to my suggestion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and Licentiate of the College of Physicians—I reside at 169, City Road, and have another establishment in Compton Street, Clerkenwell—I see about 200 patients every day—I remember seeing the prisoner on 24th June last, at my surgery—he was led in by a man named Hatswell—he stooped forward, complained of great pain, and said he had injured his ankle—I found it swollen, and slightly discoloured in two places on the right side—he also complained of pain in his knee; but there was no swell<lb></lb>ing there—he complained also of pain in the right groin, and I found the part swollen, and excessively tender—Mr. was a fluctuating tumour—I saw him again on the day following—there was nothing on the knee, and he only complained of pain there—I imagined, on the first occasion, that it was hernia; but the swelling in the groin masked it, to some extent, when I examined him on the first occasion—I told him to go home and remain quiet—I prescribed a lotion for him, and gave him a mixture, and saw him again the next day, Friday, the 25th—the swelling had then a little subsided; the fluctuation was distinct, but not the hernia—he was ruptured—I told him to get a truss, and directed him to go to Mr. Johnson, in the City Road, and I advised him to wear it as soon as the pain had sub<lb></lb>sided—I heard Mr. Heath say that the truss was too strong, and, by his advice, I told the patient to discontinue it—Mr. Heath told the prisoner that he ought to be perfectly still, and I advised him to keep his bed for eight or nine weeks—I saw him almost daily, and in bed—if hernia is caused by violence there would be considerable pain and some slight effusion; when hernia arises from constitutional causes there is hardly any pain at all, but some amount of inconvenience—this was a direct hernia, and I believed, from what he told me. that it was a recent one—on the first examination he told me that he had been shaken in a railway accident on the London and Brighton line, and was suffering considerable pain—he was in a very nervous state at the time—hernia that has broken through by force, requiring very considerable attention, in case it should come down and become strangulated—the life of the patient is in great danger then—it would be carelessness on the part of a surgeon if he allowed such a thing to take place—I attended the prisoner for eight weeks at his house, and saw</p>

               <p>him nearly every day afterwards At my surgery, making the period of my attendance upwards of four months—I attended his wife in her confinement—they were in poor circumstances at the time, owing, as he said, to his being deprived of his living—I believed all along that he was suffering from the results of the railway accident, and, as acts of charity, I advanced him email sums of money from time to time—this is the first case that I have attended in connection with a railway accident—I have attended oases of accident in which large firms were concerned, and I sent them my bill—Dr. Maclure, I believe, examined the prisoner on 3rd May last, and he told me to strengthen him as much as I possibly could, and to keep him quiet until the pain subsided.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know this man before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never saw him, to my knowledge—I have attended to Miss Nunn, who suffered in this accident—she lived about half a mile from my house—I had every reason to believe what the prisoner told me, that he had not been ruptured before, but not that he was by that means about to make a false claim against the Company—I believed what he told me to be true—I think that Dr. Maclure formed his own opinion from what the patient told him—I had no idea of what passed before the accident—there is of course, a posibillity of medical men being deceived by what a patient tells them—there were cir<lb></lb>cumstances connected with the case that made me think it was a recent hernia, and now I have no reason to think otherwise—I still believe it was a recent rupture—I knew the man Hatswell, who brought the prisoner to my surgery—he is the son of a publican, living in St. John's Street, Clerken<lb></lb>well—he led Dickeson in on the evening of the 24th—he had his arm under Dickeson, and the man was stooping forward—I did not see him on the day before the accident—my bill of attendance amounted to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—that was for my four months' attendance; but it did not include money I had lent him—I think I was paid a guinea for a subpœnaed, on the court of inquiry, at the London Terminus Hotel—I lent him, altogether, about 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as I found that he was in distressed circumstances at the time—he asked me to take a guinea for my kindness in lending him the money, and I accepted it; but it was not for interest—that was in addition to the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not keep books—I dispense medicine myself—I made about fifty visits, altogether, for the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I saw him very nearly every day—I sometimes charge very low for my visit, and often give medicine away for nothing—I sometimes charge as was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each visit, and that is the lowest—in this instance I made charges, because I knew that the Railway Company would have to pay them—I only know Hatswell professionally—I attended him seven years ago—I know Mr. Scott, an attorney; he is my solicitor—I sent the prisoner to him, when he asked me if I could tell him the name of any solicitor who would conduct his case—I have recommended a great many customers to Mr. Scott, and amongst them Miss Nunn—the prisoner had a severe sprain; but I did not think much of that at the time—the sprain to the ankle was very slight—I should not have attended the prisoner if he had had personally to pay—I attended him, and lent him money, because he had received, according to his own account, an accident in a railway train—I expected to get paid out of the money he would get from the Company—my charge was about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—he did not wear the truss for any length of time after Mr. Heath had requested him not to do so—I sent him to get the truss, on my credit, at a surgical instrument maker's—Mr. Scott paid me the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as well as the money I had lent to the</p>

I am a Member of the Council, and have an appointment in connection with the public hospitals—I examined the defend<lb></lb>ant at his own house the day before the inquiry at the London Bridge Terminus Hotel—no one else was present—I had had a note from Mr. Simpson, requesting me to see the patient, without any statement beyond that it was a case of hernia—I did not know that it was from a railway accident—I found him on his bed—he was weak—he is a feeble man—he mentioned the accident in the railway train, by which he had received a rupture in the left groin—I found there was a rupture, but all the symptoms appeared to have passed away, except the mere descent of the bowel—he said that he had had considerable pain at the time—I have heard the evidence of Dr. Simpson, and agree with him in the main—I think it was a very consistent statement, that he had received an injury, and that the rupture resulted from it—if the hernia falls out, the person is liable to strangulation—he had no truss on when I examined him—I think he bad a bandage—I thought he was ruptured for life, and would require a truss for support—a man who is ruptured would be able to walk a considerable distance, and to do muscular exercise—he could go out hunting and shoot<lb></lb>ing with a rupture well supported, and he might do twelve miles a day, but I should not recommend.</p>

               <p>of the first medical attendant, and of the patient—I had not the slightest reason to doubt the one or the other—Mr. Simpson said that it was hernia, and sent me a note—I think that a man who received a blow on the groin from a collision on a railway, so as to cause a rupture, on 23rd June, would be able to walk about with perfect freedom on the 24th—I think it quite possible that he could have walked the next day—I have seen cases where, in extreme strangulation, a person has walked to the hospital, and died in a few hours—he would exhibit symptoms of pain to a person conversing with him, but he would be able to walk—a person who had received an injury on 23rd June, could not walk with the same freedom as he did on the 22nd—whether he would be able to walk in a fortnight, would depend upon the injury received—I gave my testimony to the write of inquiry—I was called.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What would be the effect of wearing too strong a truss on a rupture? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would irritate the skin—if a truss was worn while the hernia was down it would cause effusion, and would produce a painful state of the skin—a medical man, in such a case, forms his opinion jointly from the inspection he makes, from the length of time since the injury, and by the statement made by the patient—the patient's statement is the main element in forming an opinion.</p>

I am in the service of the Fore Street Warehouses Com<lb></lb>pany, 104, Fore Street—they sell general drapery goods—I have been there about eighteen months—the defendant has had transactions with the firm for some time—I have repeatedly served him with goods during the time I have been there, in quantities, showing that they were for sale—he never told me what he was; but I concluded that he sold the goods again, and was a hawker of drapery goods—all these are invoices of our firm—the earliest date is December, 1868—I should say that I have not sold him other goods than these invoices indicate—they are not in my writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a trimming manufacturer, of Globe Lane, Bethnal Green—I have known the defendant three years as a travelling draper with hosiery—I first became acquainted with him about three years ago, travelling with different goods—I do not travel—I have never known him as a professional betting man—I only recollect the accident at New Cross, by reading of it since—I recollect that it was on 23rd June—I went to the Crystal Palace that day—I got to London Bridge about 4.30 or 4.45, and it was past 5 o'clock when I got to the Palace—I went to meet a friend at London Bridge, who was not there, and went on to the Crystal Palace, and they were not there, and I strolled about the Palace by myself—I have a brother, a publican—I have seen the prisoner a great many times; but never knew up to 23rd June that he was' ruptured.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187001100101"></xptr>
               <p>—I had not been applied to for my evidence before that—the prisoner knew me well—I shook hands with him, and talked to him just a minute or two—I asked him about how business was, and so forth—I was not with him above two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And he never applied to you till last Saturday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not apply to me, the attorney applied to me—I know Osborn; he practices for Mr. Hicks—it was 9.40 or 9.45 when I spoke to the prisoner—no one was with him—I saw no young woman—we went and had something to drink at the bar—I had something to drink with him, but was not more than two or three minutes, because I was looking about for a party—that was all I saw of him that evening—I did not hear of the charge brought against him at the Police Court—I do not know his wife—I never heard about this till the attorney's clerk came to me last Saturday—I have not seen the prisoner in prison, or written to him—I gave Mr. Osborn my evidence, and I believe he wrote it down—I saw a waiter at the Crystal Palace who knew me very well—I do not know his name, but I know he was there, being with a young brother of mine—he is not here; if I could have found him I should have brought him here—I dare say I was there five hours—I got to London Bridge soon after 11 o'clock—I was not in the train that met with the accident—I spoke to nobody else than the waiter, who I cannot find—I was wandering about all the time—I was not dancing—I have not been in the habit of going there before—I went because I had to meet a friend, a young lady—I had made an appointment to meet her—I do not know her name or address—I promised her, on the day previous, that I would meet her at 4 o'clock—I had seen her once or twice before to drink with her, at the corner of Fore Street, leading. into Oresham Street—I do not know the name of it, but it is the corner house—I have met her three times, but have never been to any place where she resides—she is not a street-walker, that I am aware of—I treat her in a public-house when I meet her—I am married, and have had six children, one, a girl, is living—I started from my factory this day, I think, about 3.30—I was detained, as I had to give work to about fourteen or fifteen women—I had no object in going to the Crystal Palace except to meet this young woman—I had no other friend to meet—my brother is a publican—I believe he was going there, but I did not see him there—I shook hands with the prisoner, and asked him how trade was—he said, "Rather quiet," and so forth—he asked me if he could sell me some underneath shirts—I said, "No, I did not want any at present"—that was the whole of the conversation—it was simply about business—I dare say I might have seen him a week before that—I was in the habit of meeting him two or three times a week—I have met him at a public-house, not on business, but when I have been on business I have met him—I do not know where I met him five or six times a week—I bought four underneath shirts of him about eight or nine months since—that is the only transaction I have had with him—that is what I call doing business with him, that is all I meant to convey to the Jury—that is not doing business with him as a trimming manufacturer—that is the only business I did with him—I did not see him in May, that I am aware of—I did not know that he was at the House of Detention—I never heard that he was charged with other people, with attempting to defraud—I never knew where he lived—I met him perhaps ten or twenty times in 1869—W. Winter has seen me and the prisoner together—he lives in Old Ford Road—I do not know the name of the street—we met him in the City, late in 1868, or</p>

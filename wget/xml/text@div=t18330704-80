               <p>Q. Did they say they would see you down there, or past there? A. Down there, I think; they went with me - we turned down a place called Court-street - we got to the gate of Mr. Smith's distillery, and there is a lane with two dead walls there - when I got past the gate the other man on my left side came and put his arms round me, held my arms back behind me, while the prisoner who is now at the bar put his hands in my bosom, and took out my money and the paper with it; they ran away from me momently - they instantly ran away, and I at the moment fell, just for a moment; I then got up and hallooed, stop thief - they ran straight down between the two distiller's walls, towards North-street, which is at the top - I followed them, and kept crying, stop thief, till I got to North-street, I saw the prisoner three quarters of an hour or an hour afterwards at the station-house, which is Mile-end watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given a description of the persons in whose company you had been, before you saw him there? A. I met somebody who inquired what had happened to me, and I gave him a description of the persons I had been with - I am quite positive the prisoner is the man who took my money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you came into the public-house did you see me sitting down or standing up? A. He was sitting on a bench under the window, and came up towards me - he came up from the seat to ask me if I would buy the comb; the man who was with him, and who assisted to hold me, was sitting down in his company.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why do you say a man was in his company at that time, did you see them speak together? A. They were both together when the prisoner asked me to buy the comb, they both got up and came to me - I was perfectly sober - I had had but one pint of beer and a slice of bread and cheese before, and that was at the Cock, at Holloway.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was that coming home from Highgate? A. Yes; I had something going there in the morning - I had been there all day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the public-house you met the prisoner at, in a direct road to your own home? A. Yes; I always turn up Court-street and go to North-street, and then go through the bars - the public-house is in a direct way from Highgate - I pass it always.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How do you account for this being your direct way home? A. In the day-time I go the canal way, but at night I always come down the City-road and Brick-lane - I turn up Court-street always, and then go between the two walls, through the toll-bar, and cross up at the Prince Regent; I live directly opposite the Prince Regent.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there not a shorter way than between the dead walls. A. I always go that way, I know no other.</p>

             (policeman K 209). I was on my beat in Collingwood-street, on Saturday night the 29th of June, between half-past twelve and one o'clock, I heard a woman's voice, crying, stop thief, in the direction of Smith's distillery- I ran towards the place, and saw two men cross North-street (from that direction) towards me - they were running nearly as fast as they could run; they turned up Wellington-street - I overtook them, and took the prisoner into custody; the other man went off - he did not run directly, but he ran again soon after - when I stopped the prisoner, he said the other was the man, and pointed him out; and when I took him back towards where I heard the cry of stop thief, he said it was an old whore that they wanted to have connection with her, that they offered her fourpence halfpenny, and she would not take it; and then they were going away home, and she ran after them, and they ran away, and she cried, stop thief - I took him to the station-house - I followed the other man with the prisoner as far as I could keep sight of him, and sprung my rattle; no one came to my assistance to apprehend him, and he escaped - the prisoner repeated what he had stated several times going down to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never said anything of the kind as he states to you. Witness. I am quite certain he said what I have stated, another of my brother officers heard him mention it once, but he is not here.</p>

            . I am a policeman K 92. On Saturday night, the 29th of June, between twelve and one, I was on duty in Whitechapel-road - I heard the cry of stop thief proceeding from the back, towards Mr. Smith's distillery - I made my way up Thomas-street, and saw the prosecutrix opposite, under the wall of Mr. Smith's distillery - before I went to her, I went towards two men in Court-street - the woman complained to me that she had been robbed - she was crying - she appeared sober - she was very much frightened - I could not tell whether she was sober or had been drinking; she was sober when she came to the watch-house - that was about half an hour after - she gave a description of two men who had robbed her; she said one had a fustran coat on, and light trousers, and that corresponded with the prisoner's dress when I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040069"></xptr>him in custody about an hour after - I took a man in custody about sixty yards from the spot, in Court-street; she said, she thought that was the man, she thought it was the man who took her money - those were her words - when we got to the station-house there was more light; and she said, she thought then still that he was the man, when she first went in; but as soon as she saw the prisoner, she said, that was him - when the prisoner was brought out of the cell, she clapped her hands together, and said, "That is the man that robbed me and no other" - the man I had taken into custody was dressed in a fustian coat and light corded trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. You say she at first said the other was the man who took her money; give us her very words? A. I asked her if she thought that was the man? she said, yes, I think it is- she said, she thought it was the man who took her money, and said so again at the watch-house - I searched the prisoner in the watch-house, and found on him two shillings in copper, a silver sixpence, and this small-tooth comb, one old long comb, and one small one, the same size as this; there were three combs in all - I searched the other man; on him I found a tobacco-box, a pipe, and about fivepence in halfpence.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Is that a new comb which you have in your hand? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He found this money about me; I had been selling some combs.</p>

             re-examined. I recollect seeing the prisoner at the watch-house, when I said he was the man he denied it at first - he said he had not seen me before - I had then said I was sure he was the man and none else; but the other man who was in custody, was very much like the man who held me - I said to the officer, "I do think he is the man who robbed me," but not that took my money - I meant, that they both robbed me, although one took my money - I meant he was the man who had assisted; and when I got to the watch-house I knew he was not the man - I did not tell the officer he had taken my money, I said he was the man who robbed me - I did not explain whether I meant that he had assisted the other, or actually taken my money - neither the prisoner, nor the man in his company, had taken any improper liberty with me whatever - I am nearly forty-five years old - I have had fifteen children and am carrying my sixteenth - I was married in 1802.</p>

             re-examined. In Court-street, the prosecutrix said, she thought he was the man who took her money - she was so much alarmed, I hardly think she knew what she said; she was more collected at the watch-house - it was nearly half an hour before we got her to the watch-house; she was better then - I heard the prisoner say he had not seen her before; he said so untill the comb was produced - I had not seen my brother officer at that time; there was nobody present who could have referred to the conversation the prisoner had had with my brother officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the wine vaults in Whitechapel-road, sitting down with a man having a pot of half-and-half; the good lady came in with two penny pieces in her hand, and her gown was hanging down to the ground - she came to us and said, "Give us some beer" - I said it was half-and-half; I said "Sit down and you shall have some" - the other man rather objected at first, but she sat down and we gave her some- she said she would pay for another pot if we let her drink; and she did, and we drank that up, and came out of the house; and in passing Baker's-row, she said she would go in and have a pint of beer - after that was drank the other man called for six-pennyworth of brandy-and-water, and then another, and then she said she would pay for six-pennyworth herself; and we came out of the house, I said I must get home, and went towards my home.</p>

             re-examined. I declare positively, on my oath, I went no where with him till I went out to go home - I did not drink any brandy-and-water with him, nor enter any other house with him - I had in my bosom four half-crowns, two shillings, and two sixpences- until I changed a sixpence, I had no copper money whatever.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you buy the pies first or afterwards? A. I bought them in the house - I should have paid for some bread and cheese for him, as he said he had had nothing to eat, but they said they did not sell it - I lost a sixpence, but no halfpence - I am in the habit of collecting a great deal of money for Mrs. Ekins down at Globe-lane; and the neighbourhood, I have the care of about twenty houses, and she trusts to me to let the houses and collect the rents, just as if they were my own - the comb he offered to me was a small tooth-comb with the teeth out - it is the same to all appearance unless there are two alike- no further force was used to me than holding back my arms.</p>

            . I am a badge-porter of Lincoln's Inn - it is part of my duty to attend to the security of the Inn in the evening. On the evening of the 13th of October, in consequence of what Morris. Mr. Thompson's clerk, said to me, I went to No. 16, Old-square, and from there to No. 19 - I saw no person there; I went through the passage of that house, to No. 21, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner of No. 21, with a bundle under his arm, in a red handkerchief, with white spots - there was a gas-light within five or six yards of him; I took particular notice of him, and am certain he is the person; I have not the slightest doubt of him - I walked towards him, and when I got within five or six yards of him, he jumped back in the corner, threw the bundle over the rails, and then ran towards Chancery-lane; I followed him, caught him by the arm, and turned him round - he struck at me, got from me, and ran through the passage, towards No. 16 again, and then towards the New-square, but seeing Evans, a porter, coming towards him, he turned to the right, and ran up by the garden wall; I called Stop thief! he kept saying, "It is only a lark - let me go;" one of my fellowservants ran towards him, and Eldridge came up; he went to avoid him, and fell over him - I then secured him; I had not lost sight of him at all, and am positive he is the man who threw the bundle over the rails.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there not some turning which the person had to go round? A. None but what I could see him the whole time; he ran up towards No. 9, Old-square, and there I took him - I followed him so close that I never lost sight of him; he only turned one corner, and that is a very wide place, by the Vice Chancellor's Court.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the bundle picked up? A. Yes - it was picked up from the place I saw him throw it, and it appeared to be the same bundle; Mr. Bayley saw it in my presence, and claimed the contents.</p>

On the 13th of October, at half-past six o'clock, I was in the Inn, and as I came out of our chambers, No. 19, I saw one person standing at No. 19, and two at No. 16; I went away, after securing the door, and walked round the square - the two at No. 16 walked away, and went before me, into Chancery-lane: one went up Cursitor-street, and the other remained at the picture-shop. At half-past nine o'clock I went to see if our chambers were safe, and saw a person coming down the staircase - he said to me, very faintly, "Good night;" I went and told Walker what I had seen, and he secured the prisoner - I am not able to say I had seen him before.</p>

               <p>MR. FRANCIS BAYLEY. These chambers belong to me. I have examined the contents of these bundles carefully, and have no doubt they are all mine - they consist of all the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth 20l. at least.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are they new? A. Some of them. I sleep in the chambers very often - when I went there I found my door double locked, but on going in I found the trap-door in the roof was open - a person could then get from the chambers on the roof, and to No. 19.</p>

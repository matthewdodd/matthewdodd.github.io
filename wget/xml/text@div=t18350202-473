                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Ann's-place, Hoxton, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—I am a married man, but have no family—I and my wife live in the house, and a child which I have to look after; I have no lodgers. On the 13th of January I went out between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; it was about half-past four—I am sure it was after four, but I cannot exactly say how much—my wife and the child went with me—nobody was left in the house—I made the doors and windows all fast, I am quite certain—I came home about twelve o'clock, and my wife with me—I found the back window open, and a square of glass cut out—the window was right up two feet high—any body could get in there—the door leading into the yard was open—I had left both the doors and windows double-bolted inside—the drawers were stripped of every thing—I missed a coat, waistcoat, trowsers, a silk gown, two pillow-cases, a petticoat, bed<lb></lb>gown, and several other things—some of them were up stairs and some down—I have seen the coat again, and found a key of the front room up stairs in the pocket of it—it had been in the coat the last time I wore it.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner—I saw him in the North-road, Hoxton, about a quarter before eight o'clock on the night of the 13th of January, about a quarter of a mile from the pro<lb></lb>secutor's house—there was a lad by his side at the time I first saw him—he was going away from the prosecutor's house when I first saw him, and carrying a bundle under his arm—I asked him what he had got there—he told me a bundle of linen—I asked him where he got it from—he said he brought it from his mother, who was a laundress, and was going to take it to some gentleman's house by Smithfield—I asked him what it contained—he said he did not know whether it was shirts or sheets—I asked him if they were ironed or mangled—he said he did not know—I said I was not satisfied, and took him to the station-house, and took the bundle, which I produce.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live in the house of Mr. Tomlinson, a fishmonger, No. 71, Lower Thames-street Between 3 and 4 o'clock on. Sunday morning, 20th April, I had occasion to come down stairs to the water closet, and found a man bursting out through the window on to a bench underneath, it—the house stands up a passage, and the window faces the street—I pursued the man, calling "Stop thief!"—I did not see his face, only his back, but I never lost sight of him till I left the constable in pursuit of him and then both the man and the constable got out of my sight—to the best of my belief, the prisoner is the man; he is the man that was brought back—I could not swear to him, because I did not see his face, but he resembles the man in size and dress—I after<lb></lb>wards examined the window, it was open, the lower part slides up, two panes of glass were broken, and two nails which fastened down the sash were removed.</p>

On the evening or 19th Feb. the prisoner came to my shop—I knew her before—I had six ounces of cheese cut off in my shop—I was outside—my mistress, who was inside, gave me information—the prisoner bought a rabbit of me—(she had been inside and bought some butter)—I put it into her basket, and saw the theese; but as it was only a little bit; I thought I would not say any<lb></lb>thing to her, my wife said I always let her go; the prisoner had then got to the next shop—I went after her, and told her she had got a piece of cheese in</p>

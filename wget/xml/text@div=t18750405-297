                  </hi>. I live at 25, Addington Street, Lambeth—I was formerly in the police, I am now carman to Mr. Merewether—on 20th March, about 6.30 in the evening, I went to the Bell public-house, York Street, Lambeth, I found my brother Joseph there, Wright and two others, we were playing dominoes—in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, McKeogh came in and created a disturbance with me, he wanted me to fight—I said I was no fighting-man—he said "I can fight you on my own merits to-day, I shan't fetch Handy Casey—he stood some minutes jangling with me and at last struck me—I got up and we had a bit of scuffle, and he had a little the worst of it, and he was put out of the house by the potman—after that I sat down again—about an hour elapsed when the five prisoners, came in—I knew them before, I had had occasion to speak to three of them on three occasions when I was in the police—Burns looked over the table and said "Can you fight him now"—I said "No, I can't fight four or five," with that he struck me in the face a violent blow, I got up with the intention of defending myself from the next blow, when they all set upon me like wolves; I was pulled across the table by the whiskers and the hair of my head which they pulled out by the roots, and I was struck by all of them—I saw a kick coming across the table, I put up my hand to save it, and the kick almost broke my hand, I could not say who the kick was by—I did not see any act done by any particular prisoner, I was knocked insensible almost immediately, I don't remember anything more than being out in the back-yard with Mr. Crook and his attendants—I was taken to the hospital and attended by Dr. Lucas—I had not given either of the prisoner the least provocation.</p>

               <p>came in, and he and the prosecutor commenced wrangling about something, and eventually McKeogh struck him—Gray got up, and they had a fight in the room, of which McKeogh got ever so much the worse, and he was turned out of the house by the potman—after something a little over an hour the five prisoners came in—I don't know which came in first—Burns reached over the table and struck Gray, and Burke pulled him over the table by his whiskers, and as soon as he was over the table they all set about kicking him and punching him in a most disgraceful manner—they kicked him all over the body—I noticed John Tynan get on the table and kick him in the head, and he was about to kick him a second time, when I pulled him off the table by his leg—the prosecutor's brother went for a constable—I saw a poker in the hands of one of the prisoners, which it was I am not prepared to swear, because it was such a scuffle—I caught the poker in my hands as it was about to fall on Gray, and Michael Tynan said "Leave go the poker, or we shall kill you"—I said <hi rend="italic"></hi>" Kill away then, for I shan't loose it"—I was then got down immediately—I believe the poker eventually found its way into the potman's hands, I lost it as soon as I was thrown down—I went with Gray to the hospital and to the station—the other two persons who were with Gray went out directly the row commenced.</p>

The prisoners followed one another in, close on each other's heels—Michael Tynan did not come in long after the others—I did not see which came in first, I had my back to the door; they were all in the room in an instant—I was once summoned for an assault, and had to pay a fine; that is twelve months ago—I don't know whose hands the poker was in—I did not take it up, I could not—I was never near the fire-place—I was not going to strike anyone with it—I never had it in ray own hands clear, two or three had hold of it as well as me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. The tap-room is about 13 feet by 14 feet—the table was not in the centre of the room; there are some narrow tables on each side with fixed seats behind them; the tables are not fixed; the table I was sitting at was 7 or 8 feet from the fire-place, that was the table on which John Tynan jumped; be jumped first on the form, and then on to the table, and I went directly and pulled him off.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Burns.</hi> I did not say at the Police Court that you were the first that came in—you did not ask what game of dominoes we were playing—I did not hit Burke on the head with the poker and break his head—I struck anybody that I could—I had a black eye, but I did not mind it—I did not charge any of you with assaulting me—I said that I made good use of my time—I was not the first that picked up the poker from the fire-place, I was not near it; the table I was at was fixed with an iron column near the window—Gray had a punch in the eye in the first fight, and I sent for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of something to put on it; it was not a plaister.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a potman at the Bell—about 7 o'clock on this evening, I was upstairs—I heard a noise in the tap-room, went down and found Gray had got a black eye, and McKeogh was bleeding from the nose and mouth, knowing Gray to be a peaceable man, and McKeogh the reverse,</p>

               <p>I turned him out; in about an hour four of the prisoners came in and one other—I can't speak to Michael Tynan, they 'called for a pot of beer, which the landlord served them with, and they immediately went into the tap-room; I can't say which went in first—they all five went in together—suspecting their intention I followed them—I saw Burns lean across the table and whisper a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> words to George Gray, which I did not hear, and he deliberately struck Gray, a tremendous blow on the side of the head—Gray tried to get up evidently with the idea of resenting it, and they all rushed at him—John Tynan jumped on the table and kicked him on the head—he was about to do so again when Wright pulled him off the table by his legs and threw him off—Burke seized a quart pewter pot, and was about to strike him with it; but I got it from him, when I turned round they had got Gray on the ground, kicking him about most beastly—I went to his assistance, otherwise the prisoners would now be answering a much more serious charge—I saw Wright on the ground with a poker—they were trying to wrest it from him—Gray partly crawled and was partly assisted out of the room by some persons who had opened the tap-room door—he was semi-insensible—I bathed his head and gave him some brandy—he bled a great deal—I took him into the yard—I had not heard him give the prisoners the slightest provocation.</p>

               <p>I shall hot fetch Handy Casey to you this time"—my brother said "I don't want to have anything to say to you"—there was a fight, and McKeogh was put out by the potman—in about an hour he came back with the other four prisoners, he came in first and the others followed him—Burns said to my brother "Can you fight him now"—my brother said "No, I can't fight four or five of you"—Burns then struck me in the mouth—we had not given them any provocation—I went out to get a policeman—I did not see anything done to my brother—when I came back he was sitting in a chair smothered in blood—I saw Burns strike him as I was getting out of the door—I took my brother to the hospital.</p>

I am a surgeon of 8, Mount Terrace, Hercules Buildings, Lambeth—at 10.30 at night on 20th March, I was called to 35, Addington Street—I found the prosecutor there in bed his face was almost like a mummy, his eyes were closed, he had two black eyes, his nose was swollen, and the right side of his face and cheek covered with erysipelas—he had also got a large cut on the left cheek right through to the bone—he had bruises on the head, one behind. the ear and on the arms and legs, and one on the right part of the chest—they were such bruises as might be caused by a kick—he was under my care up to last Saturday, he has recovered so far as to be able to go about, but he is extremely weak, he was very much shaken in his inside—I did not notice any serious internal injury except that he was extremely shaken—the danger externally was the erysipelas—I was obliged to keep him from going to the Police Court for some days.</p>

I live in Swan-row, Blackman-street, Borough—I am single, and am unfortunate—last Monday night, about half-past eleven o'clock, I met the prisoner in Blackman-streer, near St. George's Church—we went to a public-house, and he paid 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a quartern of rum; be then accompanied me home—he had * * he gave me three different shillings, which I put between the counterpane and the blanket—after some time, he demanded the money back, or he would strangle me—I refused to give it to him—he caught hold of me by the dress, laid me on the floor, put his knees across my body, and held me by the throat with his right-hand—he hurt me—I was not able to get from him for some time—I told him I would give up the money if he would let go his grasp—he let me go, but he tried my pockets first—I told him that the money laid between the counterpane and the blanket—he went and took it, and put it in his trowsers pocket—I made an offer to go down stairs, and he got hold of the fender in his right-hand, and took hold of me by my dress, and threw me down—I said, "Let me go, I will call the policeman"—he said, "You may bring as many as you like, I will knock their brains out if they enter this room—I got out of the room—he got me back, and kneeled on me again, the same as before—I struggled, and got away at last, and got down to the street-door—I stood there two or three minutes, while he was making use of the most awful and threatening lan<lb></lb>guage—</p>

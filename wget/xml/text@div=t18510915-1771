I was on duty in the Harrow-road, on 17th Aug., at half-past 2 o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner coming up from the Canal-road; he had been several times pointed out to me at a convicted thief—I asked him where he had been, and where he was going; he said he was very drunk, and asked me to convey him home to No. 7, Windsor-gardens—I told him I should do no such thing, I should con<lb></lb>vey biro to the station—I took him into custody, and he drew a knife across my left wrist—it was a clasp knife, and I believe he had it in his hand when I stopped him—it cut my hand very much—he appeared perfectly sober—I then took hold of him with my right hand, and while I had him by the collar, he slipped out of his coat and ran away—I knew him before—I am sure he is the man—I followed him till I got weak with the loss of blood—he was stopped by a brother officer.</p>

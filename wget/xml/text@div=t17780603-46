               <p>On the 13th of May I had an information of three young men being seen to go to a house in Wimpole-street, Whitechapel, with a bundle. I went to the house at about eleven o'clock at night; I went up stairs, and found in a room (of which I forced the door open) the two prisoners, and an accomplice, and two women; I found them in the act of burning some papers.</p>

               <p>The prisoners and I had been playing together the night before at skittles; we had played some time, and drank some beer; Sharplin said he must get some money, and knew where to get a good deal, if Rice would go with him; he said he would get some out of his master's desk, (for he had formerly worked for Mr. Berger); we went to his master's place, and found the door open, but he did not choose to make the attempt that night, but said he would do it the next night.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The door is open, because I have some men at work all night.</p>
               <p>Mutton. The next day I met the two prisoners at a public house; then we went to Mr. Berger's house; he went in, and came out again in about five minutes; and then he gave me something in some brown paper, which I hid under some steps at a little distance; then Sharplin returned again into the house, Rice holding the door open for him; he stayed there some time; then he brought out the powder-horn and Indigo; he went in a third time, Rice still holding the door open; then he brought out several other things, and we all went away together; when we got part of the way over the fields, Sharplin wanted to go back to fetch some great coats, which were hanging up, which he had forgot, but we did not care to return; then Sharplin carried us to this house; when we got up stairs, we found two young women; we are some radishes; then we looked over the papers, but as Rice and I could not read, Sharplin undertook to see if they were of any consequence, and as they were of no consequence, he began to burn them, and while we were burning them, about three quarters of an hour after we got home, the constable came and took us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am hall boy at the University Club; I am fourteen years old. On 27th Sept. I was in Waterloo-place—I saw the prisoner about 3 o'clock—he asked me if I would go on a message for him, and he would give me a shilling—I said, "Very well"—I walked with him to the Commercial coffee-house, Chandos-street—I went in there with him, and saw him write a note—he gave it to me to take to Mr. Reynolds, in Vere-street, Lincoln's<lb></lb>inn-fields—I had not known the prisoner before—I left the coffee-house, and went to Mr. Reynolds, and delivered the note to the shopman—the prisoner at that time was just facing Vere-street—he had shown me Mr. Reynolds' shop, and told me to wait for an answer—when I delivered the note, I received in return twenty-four packs of playing cards—I gave the parcel to the prisoner, facing Vere-street, where I had left him—he put the parcel under his arm, and gave me a sixpence—I never saw him again till I saw him at Bow-street, about a fortnight afterwards—I have no doubt at all that he is the man I saw the first time—he told me when I delivered the note I was to say I came from Mr. M'Cleary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Reynolds. Between 3 and 4 o'clock, on 27th Sept., Ryder came, and produced to me this order—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"32, St. James'-street, Piccadilly. Could Mr. Reynolds possibly oblige by sending by the bearer fifty packs of cards, twenty-five packs at 27<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per dozen, and twenty-five packs the next highest price, as a lady is waiting for some. Mr. Reynolds will please send them with invoice, by boy, directed, 'H. J. M'Cleary. '")</p>

In consequence of directions from Mr. Reynolds, I watched his shop on 27th Sept.—I did not see Ryder go in—I saw him come out—the prisoner was in a public-house—Ryder went to him, and he came out, and Ryder gave him this packet of cards which I produce—I came up—the prisoner had the packet of cards under his arm—I took him into custody—Ryder told the inspector at the station that he saw the prisoner write the note in the coffee-house—the inspector asked the prisoner what he had to say—he said, "I must own I am guilty of doing this"—on searching him, I found this pistol in his pocket, loaded with small shot, and some small shot in a paper.</p>

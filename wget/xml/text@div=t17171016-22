                  </rs>, The Prosecutor deposed, that the Prisoner coming to his Aunt's House to drink with a Barber, who lives in the Temple discours'd of helping him to Money, and talk'd very big of being able to procure Money upon Note of any Housekeeper; for considerable Sums very easily; and talk'd of being a Man of mighty Business, as an Attorney having forty or fifty Causes to come on the next Term; upon which he advising with his Aunt (who kept the House, and had some Occasion for an Attorney in a certain Cause) they proposed the Matter to him. In answer to which, he gave himself the Character of so fair a Dealer that way, that he never took any Money of his Clients, till he had perform'd their Business. Upon which the Prosecutor told him if he could help him to the Sum of 20 or 25 l. upon his Note for three Months, he should be glad; which he undertook to do; wrote two Notes, one for 12 l. and the other for 13 l. which he was to get discounted; and that coming afterwards to the House again; and looking over some Papers that he pulled out of his Pocket; when he was gone, they found a Note drawn for 15 l. payable in three Months, in a Character imitating the Prosecutor's Hand, and sign'd with his Name: Upon which, he knowing, he had given no such Note began to be uneasy, went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171710160007"></xptr> him, to desire the two other Notes back again. But when he came to him, he hunted in a Drawer, tumbled over Papers several times, and at last pretended, he believed he had given them to his Partner; upon which, he would needs have the Prisoner go with him to his pretended Partner (who was, as he said, a Man of great Business, too) whose Name was Archbole, but when he came to him, found him to be a Soldier; who told him, he had given them, first to a Man at Kensington, and then to a Man in the Hay-market ; and first to one, and then to another; but he should have them again. He hunting them daily for the Notes, and being very pressing; at last, Archbole told him plainly, that as for the 12 l. Note, that he must pay, and as to the 13 l. Note, it was in his Power; asking him, What he would give him to let him have it again? The Prosecutor swore, the 15 l. Note was not of his Writing; and this was confirm'd by others that knew his Hand; and the Prisoner having gain'd a very ill Character by tricking Practices, the Jury found him <rs id="t17171016-22-verdict122" type="verdictDescription">

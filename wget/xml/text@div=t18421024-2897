                  </hi>. I live with my father, George Somerville, a shoemaker, in Norford's-buildings, St. Pancras. About eleven o'clock in the morning of the 7th of October, I was looking out of the window—I saw the prisoner take the boots off the window-ledge, and stand by the corner of the door, fumbling with her shawl—she came into the shop—I thought she was coming to try them on—she went out again with them—I went down to my father—I and my brother pursued, but she got quite away——I knew her—I have seen her about the street before—I am sure she is the person.</p>

On the 7th of Oc<lb></lb>tober the prisoner came to my shop, and asked for some boys' boots—my boy showed her one boot—she went out in a hurried manner, and said she would fetch the boy—on the Saturday afterwards I was up stairs—my boy called me down, and I saw the prisoner pass with the boots on her—I ran and caught hold of her, and asked where my boots were that she stole—she said, "Me?"—I said, "Yes, you have got them on"—these are the boots that were taken from her at the station, and are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am captain of a schooner in the river Thames, On the 15th of August I was in Tooley-street—the prisoner Smith said, "I want you to give us a drop of gin"—I took her, and sent for some gin—I gave a sovereign to the waiter—he brought me 19. back—I had a £5 note in my pocket—we went from there to an oyster-shop, and had some oysters, and some<lb></lb>thing to drink; then went to a public-house, and had three glasses of brandy; and my belief is, that something was put into it, for it stupified me; both the prisoners were with me—I said I wanted to go as far as London-bridge, and would employ a cab—I got into a cabt between twelve and two o'clock in the day, I should say—the two prisoners got in with me—I found myself at Rat-cliff-highway instead of London-bridge, about seven o'clock in the evening, without a single fraction in my pocket—I was stupified, I was not drunk—I have not found the note—the last place I recollect myself was in a cab at Snow's-fields—the caiman is not here, we could not trace him—I felt my money safe when I went into the cab—I have known Smith two or three years, and have had connexion with her.</p>

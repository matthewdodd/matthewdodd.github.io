               <p>Court. What did you say to him to induce him to acknowledge that, did you give him any promise, or hint that it would be better for him to confess, or anything of that kind? - No, my Lord; I told him, that as we were sensible from the state of our account which we kept of our gold, that we lost some of it in an unfair manner, that it was exceedingly necessary that he should give us an unequivocal account how he came by it; he hesitated for some time giving any answer, I told him upon that, that he had better give a direct answer, that that would be more likely to satisfy us, that nothing short of that would satisfy us.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot hear anything that he said after that, after you told him that he should not be prosecuted? - I did not tell him any such thing.</p>
               <p>But you told him the same thing in substance, you conveyed that idea to him, do you know any thing independent of what he himself said, after this? - Some things were found upon him, before he acknowledged them, they were two brilliant diamonds, they were in a paper in the lining of his breeches, not in the pocket.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you he had them about him? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you distinguish them to be your's? - No, it is impossible to swear to them.</p>
               <p>Had you lost such? - I cannot say we had, we are constantly losing one, which drops on the floor, and it is impossible sometimes to find it, though sometimes we do; the rose diamonds were found at his lodgings, I can say nothing to them.</p>
               <p>Court. It is only by his confession that you know they are your property? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury Gentlemen of the Jury, as this case stands, it will be impossible to reach the prisoner: with respect to the ingot of gold, the whole of that rests upon the admission of the prisoner, after the prosecutor told him it would be better for him to speak the truth, and nothing short of that would satisfy him. It is the law of this country, and a very proper one too in my opinion, that no evidence of confession can be received, that is procured on promise of indemnity.</p>

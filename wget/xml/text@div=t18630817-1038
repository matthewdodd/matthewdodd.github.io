                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of the Thames Police—I was with Inspector Clarke between 3 and 4 o'clock on 10th July, on Tower hill, Trinity-square—I saw Pickford's van, and the prisoner driving it—he stooped several times and put something into a sack—I watched the van through George-street on to Tower-hill—when he got there he tied the mouth of the sack up, got out of the van, and went to the prisoner Rees's cart, which was standing at the bottom of the hill near the Tower gates—I afterwards saw Cox get into his van, which moved towards the Trinity House—Rees, in his cart, went the contrary direction—they met opposite the Trinity House, and Cox threw the sack off the cases into Rees's cart, it bounced out again into the road, and Cox got out of the van and put it into the cart—the van went on, Cox went in a different direction, and Rees was coming towards the city with his cart when I stopped him—the cart was standing on Tower-hill, about 200 yards from Trinity-square—Tower-hill is very much frequented—Trinity-square is much quieter—I left Rees in charge of Inspector Clarke, and afterwards took Cox to the station—I found one case in the van had been broken open.</p>

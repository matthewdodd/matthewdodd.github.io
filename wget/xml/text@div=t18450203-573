                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Heavens, who keeps the Dove, at Westminster. On the 6th of Jan., about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was looking into a shop window in Westminster—I felt a touch on my left side, which induced me to look round—I had do pocket on that side, but had one on my right—I turned, and saw the prisoner—he took up a silk pocket-handkerchief, wiped his face, and immediately walked off—I felt my pocket, and found my purse was gone—I saw a</p>

               <p>City policeman within call—I said, "Policeman, that man has got my purse!"—he went after him—the prisoner walked deliberately till he got to the corner of Watchhorn-street—there was a sovereign, four shillings, and thirteen sixpences in my purse—he ran when he went round the corner—the officer ran and overtook him—in the struggle the prisoner dropped the purse—it was shown to me at the station, and it is mine—I described it before I saw it.</p>

About four o'clock that afternoon, I was opposite Lambeth-house, Westminster-road—I saw the prisoner standing on the left side of Mrs. Heavens—I passed them four or five yards, when Mrs. Heavens said, "That man has got my purse"—I followed him—he turned a corner, and ran—I called to a boy to stop him, which he did, and I took him—he said he would go no further—he stopped, and a mob of people collected—I saw the end of a purse hanging in his band, and saw him try to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> it into a female's hand, who was near him—I caught his arm, and he dropped it—I took it—it is the purse the lady swears to—it has a sovereign, thirteen sixpences, and four shillings in it.</p>

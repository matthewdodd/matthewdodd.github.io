                  </hi>. I am single, and am living with Thomas dynes, at No. 7, Richard's-buildings, Old-street. Last Saturday month, about half past 6 o'clock in the evening, I was at the Benbow public house—I saw the prisoner there—she looked into the tap room as I opened the door to come out—the tap room door opens at the side of the bar—she went out again, and when I got out I found her standing against the kerb, with her arms folded—she said to Clynes, "What did you strike my brother for?"—he said, "I did not strike him; I only took the poker from him"—she said, "I will give you worse than a poker," using very bad language; and he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his hand to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> her away—I ran in between them, and took hold of Clynes's hand, and prevented him from <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> her—I had not time to torn my head round to look at the prisoner before I was stabbed with a knife in the left eye—the effect of that was to burst my right eye out—I then ran to the station house—I did not see the prisoner have anything in her hand—I had not my head turned far enough round to see her at all before I received the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live at No. 41, Radnor-street, St. Luke's. I was outside the Benbow, and saw the prisoner there—Clynes and Barnes were inside—I saw them come out—the prisoner then began to make use of very bad language—I did not hear what she said—I saw Clynes <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> her away with his open hand—Barnes went in between them, and the prisoner <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with her hand and caught her in the right eye with her fist—she had a knife in her hand, and the knife caught her in the left eye—I saw the prisoner seized, and she dropped the knife—I picked it up, and gave it to Clynes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live with Jane Barnes. I was at the Benbow public house that night—when I came out I saw the prisoner on the kerb stone, with her arms folded—she asked me what right I had to hit her brother—I said, "I did not beat your brother; but if I had, it was no more than he deserves, for hitting me with a poker on the arm"—she said, "I will give you worse than a poker"—she then began with bad lan<lb></lb>guage, not fit to mention—I merely went to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> her away with my open hand, and, before I could <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> her away, Jane Barnes came in between, and tried to prevent me from <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> her—the prisoner then pulled out the knife and stabbed her—I did not see which eye she struck—I did not see exactly how the blow was given—the prosecutrix said she had a knife—I held the prisoner till the constable came—she dropped the knife, and Clark gave it to me—I gave it to the policeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He never mentioned the poker to me, nor <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to him. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I am quite certain that did pass—I had seen the brother as I was going home from work; I was talking to another young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi>, and the brother came and interfered—I said, "If you interfere I will pull your ear;" and he went away, and returned in about two minutes, with a poker, and he struck me on the arm with it—I took the poker away from him, and gave it to my father, and he gave it to the policeman—I did not strike the brother; I only took the poker from him—that was about ten minutes before I was at the Benbow—he is about seventeen years of age, but is nearly as tall as me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. On 7th April, about 8 o'clock in the evening, Barnes was brought to the hospital—I found a small wound on the left cheek, just below the left lower eyelid—both the lids of the right eye were enormously swollen—there was no cut or wound there—there was no appearance of the injury to the right eye being inflicted with a sharp instrument—I could not then get a sight of</p>

               <p>the right eye, the lids being so intensely swollen—as far as I could ascer<lb></lb>tain, the eye was in the socket—she had lost the sight of that eye when she left the hospital—I believe she is not likely to recover her sight—the eye appeared to have sustained some internal rupture, which caused very intense inflammation—I do not attribute that to the wound on the left eye—that was a small, irregular, punctured wound—it appeared to hare been done by some pointed instrument—it might have been done by an instrument like this knife—the point may have been turned on the bone—the wound was close on the orbit—it was beyond the bone, into the orbit, for about half an inch, or rather more—the nose was not cut—it might so happen that the knife may have caught one eye while she was striking the other.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I sincerely deplore that this did occur; I was having my tea, and heard that a man was ill using my brother; I had a knife in my hand, cutting some bread; I went out, and the man made use of bad language to me, and was about to strike me; I put up my arm to prevent his hitting me in the face; he seized my arm, and twisted it; the young woman interfered, and I hit the blow in the heat of passion, which I much regret; I had no idea of doing any harm.</p>

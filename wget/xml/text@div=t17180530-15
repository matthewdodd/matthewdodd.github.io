The Prosecutor deposed, the Prisoner being the Son of an intimate Acquaintance, and one whom he had known from his Infancy, came to see him about 11 a-Clock in the Forenoon on Sunday the 25th of May, whereupon he made him welcome, fetching a Full Pot of Drink and putting some Brandy in it; after that he fetch'd more Drink into which he put more Brandy; that they drank it, and the Prisoner lay down on his Bed, and he thought slept; that in the mean time he lighted a Pipe of Tobacco, and went out to the Door for about a quarter of an Hour; that the Prisoner Staid till about 5 or 6 in the Afternoon, and then went away; and when he was gone he look'd for his Flask of Brandy, but it was gone; then he look'd for his Money, which he had put in a Nook in the Chimney-Corner, and that was gone too: that there had been no body in the Room but the Prisoner, that it was there a little before the Prisoner came, he having put a Crown to it. The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, brought several to his Reputation, who gave him a very good Character, whereupon the Jury <rs id="t17180530-15-verdict71" type="verdictDescription">

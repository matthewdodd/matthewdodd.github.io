               <p>Luke's—I know Collins—he was in my service as carman about twelve months ago—between Saturday night, 11th January, and Sunday morning, the 12th, my counting-house was broken into—my attention was called to it at 10 o'clock on Sunday morning—I had an iron safe in my counting, house, where I kept my account-books and cheque-books in a drawer—I found a false key in the lock, but we could not get it out—the side was smashed in and the iron plates smashed—the key would not open the safe—I keep an account at Messrs. Prescott &amp; Co.'s—my cheque-book was in the drawer of the safe—I examined it some days after and found that two blank cheques had been torn out, these produced are the two—my desk was also forced open—I had a number of paid cheques in the desk, and they were all scattered about the place—this cheque, dated 9th November, 1867, "Pay Mr. T. Hammond or bearer 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," signed by me, was amongst them—the two cheques produced, and made payable to Mr. Hammond, are not signed by me or by my authority—I believe both to be in the handwriting of Collins.</p>

Bill, I will tell you who he is, he is a b——fool"—I said "Why?" he said, "Because we smashed one of his safes all to pieces the other night"—we went round Peckham for a walk, and I asked him where abouts it was that he smashed the safe—he said "You know very well, you will find it out in time, I shan't tell you; "—he said 'We had two 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I made them out and went to the bank and got the money, and <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> stayed outside for me"—he did not say whether he presented one or two—he put his hand in his pocket and showed me some money—I don't know what it was—we went into the Albany Road, and he gave me a sovereign to pay for a pint of ale—we had a great many pints of ale—he said that <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> was showing off a good bit with his money; that if anybody rounded on him he would stick a knife in him, and he would as soon stick it into me as anyone else—it was a clasp knife, with a saw and corkscrew—I did not make any answer to that—I saw him a few days afterwards, on the day I was sworn in—I met him on Holborn Hill, and had something to drink with him—I said "I know. where you did that job" he said "Well, you know all about it now"—I said that Mr. Scully had stopped me in the street and asked me about it, and as I had worked for him, I thought I should get into a bother about it—he did not say anything to that—I saw him again after that, and he said he had written out two cheques, and one was not so good as the other, and he had heard since that <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> had presented one, and got 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had not given him any money out of it.</p>

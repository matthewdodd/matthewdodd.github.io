                  </hi>. I am a labourer living at Tit St. Giles—on Saturday, 19th October, I was in the field where the fire was—I saw the drum and the straw; the drum was standing about 4 yards from the stack of mustard straw; it was a great lump of straw, it was not particularly a stack—there had been threshing going on there for two days before, and it was finished at 12.30 on Saturday—the theshing had been done with the prisoner's machine—the elevator was not there—I saw the engine there, that was taken away about 12.30; it was drawn out by horses—there was no road from the stack into the road, only what was left unploughed; it was an unploughed piece of the field—there was a road left straight up to the headland, and then from the headland up to the gate—there was a man</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187902100092"></xptr>
               <p>there named Joseph Hill who had been feeding the machine—I saw the prisoner there that day, and heard Hill say to him "What are you going to do with the old drum, are you going to pull her out of the way?"—Mr. Matthews said "No, it don't matter about her, I shall have her away on Monday morning"—I was about 6 yards from the drum at this time—I did not notice whether there was any straw under the drum at that time or not—I did not notice whether the shafts were on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was engaged for Mr. Dearlove during the whole of the thrashing—it began on the Thursday morning between 9 and 10 o'clock; they left off about 4 o'clock that afternoon; they broke a riddle—I don't know what time they worked on the Friday, I should say they began about 7.20, and left off a few minutes after 5 o'clock, as near as I can tell—before beginning work they would of course have to get up the steam—on Saturday we left off about 12.30; I believe they were done—I don't know how Mr. Matthews's men were paid—our men make half days and three-quarters—cloths are used in threshing, to lay under the machine to catch the waste seed—it is not always the custom in a mustard field to place straw under the machine on which to place the cloths; the object of putting the straw is to keep the cloths from the wet—I have threshed hundreds of days without straw, and hundreds of days I have had to put a great lot under—I will not take my oath that there was not straw under there on the Saturday, or that there had not been for the three days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I would not pledge my oath one way or the other whether there was or was not straw—you can crawl very well under the axle of the machine and the blower—the blower comes rather lower than the axle—the riddle of the drum broke some time between 3 and 4 o'clock on the Friday; that entailed a loss of time—I don't know whether the men got paid for their time notwithstanding that—Mr. Dearlove had five men at work the first day; I can't say how many Mr. Matthews had, I should say seven, perhaps he might have eight, I did not count them—15 or 16 in all were employed about the threshing after the first day; out of that number I should say Mr. Matthews employed eight or nine after the first days.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer at Wisbeach St. Mary—I have a piece of land at Leverington, which I hire of Mr. Dearlove—I entered into possession of that land on 30th September last—the preceding crop belonged to my landlord—the field in which this stack was was 16 acres—there were four stacks on it, which were threshed on the 17th, 18th, and 19th—this was the last of the four; it took two days and a half to thresh the four stacks—the straw was given to me by my landlord; it was really my straw—I should think there were 10 or 12 waggon loads in the stack that was burnt; it would make a good big lump, I valued it at 5 or 6 sovereigns—I saw the fire between 8.30 and 8.45 when I looked out at the door—I was at a distance—I did not know that the fire was on my own ground—I did not go to it—I heard the first thing in the morning that it was my straw that was burnt—while I was there the prisoner came there; that was about 10 in the morning—I said to him, "This is a funny thing about this fire, the straw to be burnt and your drum saved"—he replied, "I think I am one of the most fortunate persons in the world, as I was not insured; I was ill yesterday afternoon, and went to bed between 6 and 7, and knew nothing of the fire</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187902100097"></xptr>
               <p>until the police-constable called me up about 11 o'clock at night"—he also said again that he was not insured for that drum, neither for a new traction<lb></lb>engine; he said he had two sets insured—a set consists of an engine, a drum, and a jack-straw or elevator—next day when I went there I saw a water-tub in his cart that he was riding in; he was then in the ground where the fire was—he was there before me; he might have taken up the tub that morning—I can't tell how long he had been there before I got to the ground—it is 189 or 198 yards from Poplar Drove Gate to the stack, but I did not go in at that gate, I went in at Mill Lane gate—I can't tell you how far that is from the stack, it is near 400 yards—Poplar Drove runs on one side of the field and Mill Lane on the other—I did not notice the prisoner till he came up the ground—I know the roadway from the stack to Poplar Drove—there was a headland of ground left; there was nothing to prevent the cart going over it—on the first occasion before the Magistrate I was not represented by a professional man; the case was then dismissed—after it was dismissed I got a letter from Mr. Sidney Ollard, who appeared for the prisoner; this is the letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "November 11th, 1878. Sir,—I am instructed by Mr. James Matthews, of Parson Drove, to apply to you with reference to the serious charge preferred by you against him, namely, that of setting fire to your mustard straw, such charge being wholly false and unfounded As Mr. Matthews has, through your unjustifiable proceedings in the matter, suffered great anguish of mind, and been put to considerable expense, I am instructed by him to inform you that unless you do, on or before Thursday next, fully apologise to him for your conduct and pay 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. damages, legal proceedings for substantial damages will be forthwith commenced against you, without further notice. Yours, &amp;c., Sidney Ollard.") On getting that letter I went to my solicitor, Mr. Jackson, the Clerk to the Magistrates; he could not act because he was Clerk to the Magistrates, and I went to Mr. Wilkin and put the case in his hands—he had the conduct of the case before the Magistrates—a great number of fresh witnesses were called.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was rather dissatisfied on the first occasion—I should not have gone to my solicitor to ask his advice if I had not had that letter—I had fresh evidence—the fresh evidence was forthcoming before I went to my solicitor—we got some fresh evidence on the receipt of that letter—I was present at a time when the mustard was being threshed—there was no elevator used on that occasion—the elevator is used to put the straw on to the waggons, or stack, or anything—the straw was not scattered, it was all put up; it takes more ground to put it on when there is no elevator—it was on the Monday morning when I saw the prisoner there in his cart, and the tub was then in his cart—I say the straw is worth between 5 and 6 sovereigns; it is not worthless; it was given in exchange for other straw—it is not as combustible as other straw; it burns very quickly when once it is set fire to, as quick as any other straw—I did not complain of the straw being thrown about On the Thursday or Friday; I said they ought to have had an elevator there to put it on waggons as quick as they threshed it.</p>

I am an owner of land and a farmer living at Tit St. Giles, near Wisbeach—on the 25th September last I let a piece of land at Leverington to Mr. Way—he took possession on the 30th—I was to thresh the mustard and to have the seed, and to give him the straw—on the Monday morning, the day after the fire, I went to the spot in the course of the afternoon—I saw Matthews in the field, and spoke to him—it was about 11—he drove up to my trap, and said "This is a bad job, sir; I have no doubt it was done by some one who had something against me, as I am not insured for this, "meaning the machine—on Wednesday, 6th November, I saw "him at the Rose and Crown, Wisbeach—about 12 o'clock in the morning—he saw me coming in, and followed me—he said "I should like to have a little private conversation with you—he was on foot—that is the principal inn in the place—I took him into a private room—we were quite alone—he said "Your tenant, Mr. Way, has prosecuted me"—I said "I have no doubt it is right, as the police tell me they suspect you"—there had been a good deal of talk about it in the neighbourhood—the summons had been out some days, and the hearing was coming on the day after this conversa<lb></lb>tion—he said "I am innocent. I certainly was in the neighbourhood that night, and I bethought myself of a water-tub which was left"—he said "I was driving in my cart, and I thought I would fetch it; but when I got near the field I thought the ploughed land would be too heavy for me to go over, and as I was leaving the field I saw a man whom I afterwards heard was Thomas Holmes, but I could not swear to him"—he said he went to John Griggs after that—I had no agreement with Matthews for threshing the mustard—I had never grown mustard before, but I suppose I should pay about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day—that would include engine, time, and everything but coals.</p>

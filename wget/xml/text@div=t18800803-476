I live at 74, Southampton Row, and keep a fancy reposi<lb></lb>tory—on the 2nd July I was at a fancy bazaar at the Freemasons' Tavern for a charity—the prisoner came to my stall and wanted to dip in the dipping <hi rend="italic">tub</hi>, which contains prizes, and you put your hand in and dip on payment of a shilling—he gave me a coin representing a sovereign—I asked him what he gave me—I felt it was not a good one—I showed it to Mr. Fishley, and left the prisoner at the dipping tub waiting for the change—when I went back he was not there.</p>

I acted as steward at the bazaar—the last witness handed me this coin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she pointed the prisoner out to me—I said, "Is this the gentleman who wants the change for the sovereign?"—she said "Yes"—I said, "If you will step with me I will give you the change"—I took him up to the other end of the room, and I sent a messenger by one of the committee—I was going away from the dipping tub when he said, "Never mind, I will have the sovereign back again, I have a shilling"—I said, "I will give you your change directly"—he went up to the other end of the room and took off his Ulster coat which he was wearing and his hat, and came down towards the door—I stopped him at the door as he was going out and said, "I beg your pardon, but you have not your change yet"—he said, "I am very deaf, I can't hear; I wish you would speak louder"—I shouted out and said, "Wait a moment, it will be here in a minute of two"—he stopped then with a commissionaire I had by the side of me—then one of the committeemen took a cab and went to Bow Street Police-station, and the prisoner waited until he came back with a constable, and he was given into custody.</p>

I am an auctioneer, of 38, High Street, Clapham, and was one of the managers of the bazaar—I examined the coin brought to me by Fishley, and sent for a policeman, and the prisoner was given into custody—at the police-station he said that he had had the coin for some long time—the next day he said he had received it from a betting man within ten minutes of his entering the building.</p>

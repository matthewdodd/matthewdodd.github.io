                  </hi>. I am a carrier of Wakeling, in Essex—I was on my road from there to London on Thursday, 26th Oct.—I came to a place called the Cauliflower public house, near Ilford—I saw a man cross the road near the Cauliflower bridge; it was then as near 2 o'clock in the morning as possible—the prisoner then got up on the step of my cart—I said, "Halloo, mate, what do you want?"—he said, "I will b—soon let you know what we want; for what we want we will have"—I felt for a stick which I had in the cart, but could not reach it—I struck him with my fist, and knocked him out of the cart, but he saved himself from felling—he rose again, and I collared him—at that instant two more men sprang up to my horse and stopped him—one stopped by the horse's head, and while I was trying to get the prisoner down, the other man got up into the cart to him—I kept <hi rend="italic">scrimmaging</hi> with them—the prisoner held me down by my coat, while the other man rifled my pockets—I had 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. then; they took that, and then allowed me to get up—the other man took it, and then the prisoner said, "You have not got his watch;" they then felt for my watch, but I had none—the prisoner said, "Give him one for luck before you leave him," and then the other man jumped down, and the prisoner let go of my head—I rose my head up, and he struck it with his fist—as he left the cart, he struck at me with a stick, but the blow did not touch me—I saw the prisoner cross the road the same way as I had seen the men come—I had never seen the prisoner before, but am certain he is the man—I saw him on the next day at Chadwell, about a mile off", when I was talking to a policeman, and gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>about the robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and the prisoner came across the road towards us—I cannot say whether the policeman was in uniform—I cannot describe the other two men, but one was a short, stout man—I was not in a great fright, because had there only been two, I could have mastered them—this occupied ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—it was on the high road, not a mile and a quarter from Ilford.</p>

COOKE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it light? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was very light that morning—there was no lamp near—I was perfectly sober—I went with the prisoner to the station—he said to the policeman, "I am d—glad of it, for I want to get to Australia, and I want to get there cheap"—the policeman had told the prisoner what he took him for, and he said it was not likely that he had done a robbery to that amount, because he was going into the Union, and had got an order—that was about an hour after he was taken.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 59). I was standing outside my house on this morning in conversation with the prosecutor, when the prisoner passed by—the prosecutor made a remark, in consequence of which I fetched him back, and the prosecutor, in his hearing, said he was the man—he said he knew nothing of it—on the way to the station, which was about three miles, he said it would be a cheap way for him to go to Australia, as he wanted to go there, and he had got an order to go into the Union, which I after<lb></lb>wards found in his pocket.</p>

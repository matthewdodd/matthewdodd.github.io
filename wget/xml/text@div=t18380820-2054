                  </hi>. I live at Plumstead. Between eleven and twelve o'clock at night on the 25th of July, I was driving the prosecutor's cart with fruit and peas—I heard a noise when I got towards the Ship and Billet, on the Woolwich-road—I jumped down, and the peas were gone—I looked about, and saw them in the ditch under the hedge, and the prisoner was there-no one else was there—I asked him what he had done with the peas—he said he had seen none—I pulled him down as he was getting over a stile—I had seen him go from the cart as soon as I jumped down, and he went to<lb></lb>wards the ditch from the tail of the cart, just by where I saw the peas-and I saw him in the ditch when I went to him—I caught hold of him, and called the ostler.</p>

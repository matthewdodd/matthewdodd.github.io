The prisoner was in my employ - he was to receive money, and take it to a cashier, with a cheque for the amount, on paper - he was to make a bill, have it examined by a second person, and then take the money to the cashier - here is the prisoner's cheque-book in which he enters the amounts he receives; here is 7s. 1 1/2d. entered on the 12th of August, instead of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100141"></xptr>1ls. 1 1/2d.; the whole amount of the bill was 14s. 1 1/2d., and the lady paid 3s. afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long has he been in your employ? A. Five months - I have a lad named Champness, who has been my cashier some time - we have occasionally found errors into which he has fallen - we have discovered mistakes among the shopmen, which have been shortly afterwards rectified; the lady came afterwards, and paid 3s., which is regularly passed to account - he gave a ticket of the last payment - there had been a quarrel between the prisoner and Champness; the prisoner struck him.</p>

            . I went to the shop on the 12th of August, and bought goods amounting to 14s. 1 1/2d.; I paid the prisoner 11s. 1 1/2d., and said I had not sufficient with me, but I would bring the other 3s.; when I went in, I wished to be served by the prisoner - some other persons came in while I was there - this is the bill the prisoner gave me; it is 14s. 1 1/2d.; it has no receipt to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not desire that the part not paid should be marked on the bill? A. No; when I went back, I went to the prisoner, and paid him - two ladies came in to look at some crape shawls, after I was served - I do not recollect whether he attended to them before he made my bill out - he took the 3s. to the cashier the moment I gave it him, but the first money he did not take for several minutes; he was looking for a sheet of paper to put the goods in.</p>

            . I am cashier to the prosecutor. On the 12th of August the prisoner brought me this cheque of 7s. 1 1/2d., which he paid me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in the service of the prosecutor? A. Fourteen or fifteen months- I am apprentice there - Mr. Hall has complained of errors in my cash accounts; I do not recollect his saying he would turn me away - errors have been made by me, or the shopmen; an explanation has been given afterwards - I quarrelled with the prisoner, and he struck me; but I was not set to watch him particularly - there were a great many people in the shop - I saw two other ladies come in, but I think that was after the ticket came to me; I received the 3s.; I did not see Mr. Phillips present - I did not hand the money over to Mr. Phillips; I believe Mr. Phillips and all the rest were present when the prisoner was charged with this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has there been any charge against your honesty? A. No, there have been mistakes.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY to MR. HALL. Q. I believe you had a good character with the prisoner? A. Yes, for three years - I had engaged him as a foreman, and had the greatest confidence in him till within a few days.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When did you tell him of this? A. About two hours after it occurred - he denied it altogether, till the lady was brought over, and then he admitted it - the cashier slipped out after the lady, and asked what she had paid; when the lady was brought back, the prisoner admitted it, but did not say how it happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you know he had served other ladies before the charge was made? A. Yes, he served thirty-four customers that day - it was about nine o'clock at night when I spoke to him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the lady sent for? A. Yes; I had been over to inquire the particulars, and then brought her to the shop - he said, "I admit the lady paid me 1ls. 1 1/2d." he did not say he meant to pay the 4s. at some other time, nor would any young man be allowed to do so - that is my peremptory order.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose he had wanted 4s. for any purpose? A. He should have taken the whole money to the cashier - it does not appear by his book that the other ladies were served - the sums just above and below this are 1s. 10d. and 1s. 4d., and then here is a cheque for 5l. 12s.; the 7s. 1 1/2d. is not in the right place in his book; it is added afterwards.</p>

            . Q. Was the cheque given with the money at the time? A. I believe it was a minute or two after he paid the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Has not Mr. Hall entered the amount of your deficiencies to your father both before and after I was in the house? A. Yes - I believe you did say there were 3s. more to pay; I do not recollect that you were attending to any ladies at the time - you have at other times given your money without a cheque, when engaged with a second person - on the Monday night, I entered 1s. 9d. to your name which did not belong to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not left your desk totally unattended to for a quarter of an hour? A. No; I may for ten minutes - I do not think I was down stairs for twenty-five minutes while Mr. Hall was at Margate.</p>
               <p>Q. If a young man has given you a cheque, and it has been wrong, have you not asked how much he gave you last time? A. Yes; you have set me right - you were engaged with two ladies when you brought the 3s., but not when you brought the 7s. 1 1/2d., to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to MRS. HARLOW. Q. I believe at the time I was serving you, these ladies were sitting by you? A. Yes; you served them, and while you served them, tied up my parcel.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When you were brought back, what took place? A. The prisoner denied having received more than 10s. 1 1/2d. - I said, "Either you or I must have wronged Mr. Hall;" he paused for a while - I again said,"Either you or I must be guilty; I will take my oath I paid you 14s. 1 1/2d." - he said, "Well, then, I admit I have kept it;" Mr. Halls said, "Goulbourne denies having taken more than 10s. 1 1/2d. of you;" I saw him take the first money to the desk, and heard him say "The lady will bring you 3s."</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did not you say he was hunting for some paper? A. Yes; and the crape shawls for the ladies to look at were then on the counter, but I think the bill was made out before they were on the counter; I think the ladies applied to another young man first, and the prisoner said "If they will wait, I will attend to them;" the money laid on the counter at the time - he should have taken the bill up to the desk, but he did not; he gave it to me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long address to the Court, positively denied all intention of keeping the money; stating that it arose from a mistake on his part, and that the prosecution was the result of vindictive motives on the part of Champness.</p>

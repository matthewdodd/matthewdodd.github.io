                  </hi>. I live in Newcastle-street, Strand—I go about with a box of jewellery. On the 31st of March I was out, and met Davis and three more women—they asked me what I had got to sell—I said, "I don't think you will buy any thing of me"—I then opened my box—Davis took a ring out, and put it on her finger—she asked me what I wanted for it—I said, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there were some more girls who wanted to handle some more goods out of my box, and I would not let them—I shut the box up—I asked Davis to give me that ring back—she would not give it me—she would have run away, but I laid hold of her shawl—she tried to run away, and did run across the court—Green had been looking in my box as well as Davis, and when I took hold of Davis, Green said to me, "If you don't let that woman alone, I will break your nose for you"—I then let Davis go, and she ran away with the ring, and Green ran after her—the policeman came up, and I told him—I have never seen my ring since.</p>

On the 17th of April I went to bed soon after eleven o'clock - I went round the house myself, and saw that every thing was safe: it is my dwelling-house: it is unusual for me to awake before five o'clock, but from some cause or other I was awoke as near two o'clock as possible - I got up and opened the bed-room window-shutter, which is my custom; I found it was quite dark - I went to bed again. About six o'clock Foreigner, my servant, came to me, and I went down stairs with a light - I found several doors had been broken open; the first entrance had been made through the back kitchen window - the wood-work, into which the iron bar fastened, was cut away with a centre-bit, and the bar forced out - a pane of glass was broken in the casement, through which a hand could be put, and the hasp of the casement opened; a person could then enter the house: there were two doors bolted within before they could get in further - the first of these doors was forced off the hinges, and put on one side - the pannel of the second was cut out with a centre-bit - any one could then get through. I have a bureau in my front parlour, and my son has another; they were both broken open, and the papers in some measure displaced, but they appeared to have been disturbed in the act; a tea-chest in the room was broken open, and the tea taken out - that room was quite dark, and the shutters closed; they could not have been there without a light, though it was day-light when I was there.</p>

            . I am constable of Hammersmith. - On the morning of the 18th of April, about twenty minutes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310004"></xptr>past five o'clock, I met the prisoner at Hammersmith-turnpike, which is about four miles from Strand-on-the-Green; he was walking along very steady; I spoke to him just after he got through the turnpike - he had a bundle in his right hand; I asked him what it contained - he said what he had got he had come honestly by; I collared him, and said I wished to know what he had got - he said it was no business of mine; I took my staff in my hand, and said I insisted on knowing before he went further; he then dropped the bundle out of his hand, and tried to get away - he made no resistance then, but before I got him to the watch-house he caught hold of me by the throat; I struck him with my staff, and took him to the watch-house - I searched him there, and found on him a dark-lantern, a crow-bar, a chisel, a centre-bit, thirteen door-keys, a knife, a pair of scissars, a brad-awl, a die, a pair of black silk stockings, a silver purse, and a gold thimble, and he had a quantity of tea in a handkerchief in his hat which he had got on. I did not hear of the robbery till night; I went to Mr. Trimmer's the following morning. the 19th, and found a door forced off its hinges, and put on one side - I produce the pannel which had been taken out of the other door, one piece was cut out, and I took the other part out myself; I have compared the centre-bit found on the prisoner with the holes in the pannel, it fitted them exactly; the centre-bit was broken at one of the points, and will not cut so clear as a perfect one - these holes appear to have been cut with a broken centre-bit. I showed the articles found to Miss Trimmer, and she claimed some of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At what hour do you leave your beat? A. At five o'clock, or sometimes a few minutes past; I had left then: it was exactly twenty minutes past five when I was at Hammersmith-turnpike, just before I stopped him; it was quite light enough for me to see the clock.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. Is there a clock at the turnpikegate? A. Yes. He was about four miles from the house; I will not swear it was exactly four miles from the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear it is three miles and a half? A. I will not swear exactly to the distance; I will swear to two miles and a half, and I think it is more; I judge it to be four miles, but I never went to Strand-on-the-Green before.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter, and live with him. This purse, gold thimble, and silk stockings are mine - I know the stockings by a mark - they are worth 2s. or 3s. I know the purse by the string being broken, and one of the tassels bent; it is silver, and cost 10s., but being broken I suppose it is worth about 2s.; this is part of an old gold thimble. I saw the stockings safe on the day of the robbery, and the purse and thimble a few days previous - I kept them in my desk, which had been opened, but I had left it unlocked. I came down between six and seven o'clock in the morning, and missed them; when I went to bed on the night of the 17th I put the candles out, and left two candlesticks on the parlour-table, where the desk was - they were gone the next morning; they are not worth more than half-a-crown. I missed the silver prong of a toasting-fork from the other parlour - I had seen that the morning before - it was worth about 5s. The fork and candlesticks were my father's property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This prong had been separated from the handle? A. It was screwed up on the Tuesday morning, when I saw it, but is now unscrewed, and the handle left behind - it was my grandmother's, and had been in use some years; the top of the thimble had been knocked off by one of my brothers.</p>

            . I am house-keeper to the prosecutor. On the morning of the 18th of April Deans called me - I got up, and alarmed my master and the family; I went down stairs, and found things as my master has described; I missed a piece of cloth from the kitchen, which measured fourteen or fifteen yards; it was Mr. Trimmer's. I had left it on the dresser about eleven o'clock on Tuesday night, when I went to bed; I am sure there were fourteen yards; it was new and worth 2s. 6d. a yard; my own tea-caddy was broken open, and some tea taken out; I missed a silver spoon of Mr. Trimmer's, which I had put into the cupboard with some tea things that night - it was worth 1s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was the Irish linen to be done to? A. To be scalded before it was made up for shifts or shirts - I do not know what it cost of my own knowledge; I measured it in a rough way, not with a measure, but am sure it was fourteen yards.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. Do you conceive it to be worth 2s. 6d. a yard? A. Yes.</p>

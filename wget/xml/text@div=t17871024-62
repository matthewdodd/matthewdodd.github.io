               <p>I found this watch underneath the prisoner's left breast, pinned in a bit of rag; she denied it; I searched her two or three times over; at last, she said, she did not know how it came there.</p>

               <p>How long have you been master of that watch? - On the Saturday night before, it was given to me; I went to wind some clocks up at Mr. Solomon's in Clapton, and the maid gave it me to put a glass in; I told the constable the maker's name.</p>
               <p>Court to constable. Did he tell you the maker's name? - No; he knew the watch the moment I produced it; I did not ask him before.</p>

               <p>I went to order some porter at the Bell last Sunday, and this man was there with one Joe Rix, that is not here; Rix asked me, if my husband was at home; I asked him to come, and this young man insisted on coming along with him; when he came over, he had only two pence in his pocket; I ordered two pots of beer; he staid all the evening, and drank a good deal of gin and strong beer; he pulled out the watch several times and wanted to pledge it; I gave him two shillings on it; to be sure I had a little drop in my head, when he brought in the constable, and I did not recollect exactly where it was; the young man that was with him, took his shirt and things out of his pocket, and I desired him to return them; I should have delivered it up on the Monday morning.</p>

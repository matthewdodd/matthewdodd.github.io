                  </hi>. I am single; I was on a Visit at New-street-square. On the afternoon of 28th June, I was in the Waterman steam-boat, No. 12, on my way to London—between seven and eight o'clock in the evening we were passing Greenwich, it began to rain, and I was about to descend into the cabin with a number of persons—the prisoner was behind me—I felt a jerk at my side-pocket, when I got down the steps I missed my watch—it was safe when I got up to go down into the cabin—the prisoner had been sitting near me before, and the man that was with him had asked my cousin to lend him a book—when I lost my watch, the prisoner was immediately behind me—he rushed past me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in New-street-square with Louisa Beak—I was in the steam-boat, and was going down to the cabin—the prisoner came behind me, and put his arm round my waist, and had his hand on my left side—I had no watch on—the prisoner passed quickly by me, at the bottom of the stairs—Miss Beak told me she had missed her watch—I told her I suspected the prisoner—she then told the passengers who were standing by.</p>

I was a passenger on board the steam-boat—the prosecutrix informed me of her loss, and pointed out the prisoner—I took him in custody—he denied any knowledge of it—at that moment a lady directed my attention to something shining on the cabin-floor, about two inches from the prisoner's right foot—it turned out to be this watch, claimed by the prosecutrix—the prisoner was about five yards from the prosecutrix—he gave an address which turned out to be false—the face of the watch was lying upwards, and the glass was broken.</p>

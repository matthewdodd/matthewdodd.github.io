            . I am a bookbinder, and live in Canterbury-court, St. Andrew's-hill - I know the prisoner. I had no connection with him until the 8th of June, and then informed Armstrong that I had engaged to meet the prisoner on the 9th of June at the George, in Grafton-street, Soho, to purchase half a score of counterfeit shillings of him - he said they would come to 5 s. Before I met him I went to Armstrong, who searched me every where - I had only one penny about me. They gave me four shillings and two sixpences in good money, which they marked - this was at Worship-street; they then accompanied me in a coach to Grafton-street, and waited about fifty yards off. I saw the prisoner opposite the George, public-house, he came to me, and asked how many I wanted? I said half a score, what I had agreed for - he said he had but seven, took them from his left hand sleeve, and gave them to me. I gave him 3 s. and a 6 d. of the money Armstrong had given me, keeping the other shilling and sixpence. Armstrong came up, seized us both, and took us into a public-house; he searched us, found the seven bad shillings on me, and 1 s. 6 d. of the marked money, and the 3 s. 6 d. on him; they asked me who I had the bad money from? I said from the prisoner - he made no answer.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. Masters gave me information. I and my son met him on the 9th of June, at a public-house next door to the office, and searched him - he had no money; my son gave him 4 s. and two 6 d., which were marked on the head; we went with him in a coach to Grafton-street, got out, and let him go before, but kept him in sight, in about two minutes he came out of the George, I then saw him walking down the street with the prisoner, he gave a signal, by touching his hat - we seized them, and took them into the King's Head, public-house. I found a paper on Masters, containing seven counterfeit shillings; he said he had them from the prisoner - the prisoner said nothing.</p>

            . I was with my father, he has spoken correctly. I searched the prisoner, and found one of the shillings I had marked in his hand, and 2 s. 6 d. in his pocket, which I had also marked. He had no other money.</p>

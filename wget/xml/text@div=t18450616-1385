On Tuesday morning, the 20th of May, I saw the prisoner standing in the hall, at the Bank, about a quarter before nine o'clock he came up to me with a note—I said, "You have taken time by the forelock; we don't begin business before nine o'clock; you must go and write your name on the note"—I did not look at the note then, I only saw that he had one—he went away to write his name on it, and almost immediately after the clock struck nine he handed the note to the cashier, in my presence—it was in<lb></lb>spected, and passed into my hands—I looked at it, and called out, "Cambray"—the prisoner answered—I said, "What do you want for it?" he said, "Sovereigns, or gold"—I gave him twenty sovereigns—I was not aware that the note was stopped—they begin business in the office where the notes are stopped at nine o'clock—the name of "James Cambray, 12, Holywell-street, Strand," was on the note—it was paid about two minutes after nine, and they could not give me notice till nine.</p>

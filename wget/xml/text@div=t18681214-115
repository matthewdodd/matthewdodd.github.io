                  </hi>. I am a glass shade stand maker, of 12, Kentish Town Road—on Saturday night, 21st November, a little after 12 o'clock, I went into a watering place near Meux's brewery, up a turning out of Oxford Street, and as I came out I was struck in the face, which knocked me down, my eye was blackened, and my nose bled very much—I lost my hat and my walking stick—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I do not think the person who knocked me down had anything in his hand—I got up and complained to a constable—the prisoner is the person who struck me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E R</hi> 20). About 12.30 on the morning of 21st November, I saw the prosecutor in New Oxford Street, without a hat, and his face bleeding—in consequence of what he said I went to No. 1, Fletcher's Court, Church Street, with another constable, and found the prisoner at the top of the stairs—he said, "What do you want here?"—I said "I want a man out of this room of the name of Brickley"—he said "My name is not Brickley, my name is Donoghue"—I called him Brickley because I had received information—he had the stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his hand, and was holding something behind him—about twenty of his companions followed me into the court—he took off his coat and waistcoat and said he could fight the pair of us—I told the constable to go into the lane, and I waited at the bottom of the stairs—the prisoner came down stairs and put the hat and stick in the water closet when he left—I took them, and got a sergeant, and met the prisoner in the lane, and took him in custody for unlawful possession of the hat and stick—he said "You think you have got me right, but you have not"—on the Saturday I brought the prosecutor to the station, and he identified the hat and stick—I put the prisoner in the yard with nine other men, and the prosecutor picked him out.</p>

               <p>Benjamen Wyersdale thus depos'd. I, my Wife, and a Kinswoman, having been at my Lord Castlemains Gardens, we were returning home in a Hackney Coach. It was a bright Moon light Night, and about Nine o'Clock when we came upon <placeName id="t17260831-35-crimeloc165">Cambridge-Heath</placeName>

G - D - ye Stand! or I'll Shoot ye through the Head. My Wife sat facing the Horses, and I on the other side. The Man came up to me, and Claping a Pistol to my Breast, he said, D - ye deliver. I desir'd him to be Civil, and he should have my Money. Come, Come, G - D - ye says he deliver immediately. I gave him about a 11 s. and some Halfpence. G - D - ye says he, wheres your Gold, and your Watch, I told him I had none, Why then by G - I'll kill ye says he. I assure ye Sir says I, that I have given you all, and therefore I beg you would not use me ill. - My Wife then gave me 6 or 8 s. more, I gave it to him, he still cry'd, D - ye whereas your Gold! your Gold! I must have it. I again told him that I had none upon which he turn'd about Cock'd his Pistol, clapt it to my Breast, Swore he'd Shoot me, and then pull'd the Triger. The Flint struck Fire, but I believe the priming was blown away, so that it did not go off. Then he let the Coach pass, and we thought he was gone, but he quickly came up again and searched my Fob, he was going round to the other side of the Coach, and had like to have fallen in a Ditch, but recovering himself, he rode off towards Bednall Green, and we drove homeward, Shoreditch way. I believe the Prisoner to be the Man, I cannot Swear positively, though I did think then, that I had seen such a Face before, but could not remember where - When I came home, I was talking of my loss, and described the Man: and Horse as exactly as I could, and several people said, that it must be the Prisoner who was a <rs id="t17260831-35-deflabel166" type="occupation">Bricklayer</rs>

I had some knowledge of him before, and I told my Husband so that next day, - and when he was carried before the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172608310007"></xptr> Justice, I knew him again, both by his voice and Face; I am so certain that he is the very Man, that I was never more fully satisfied of any thing in my Life. - I remember when my Husband told him that he had no Watch not Ring's he answer'd, as if he know him, What!

             the Coachman. Confirm'd Mr. Wyersdells Evidence, and thus added. The Man was tall and thin, in a dark brown Coat, and a light Wig. He rode upon a black Beast with a white Bridle; I could not exactly observe his Face, because his Back was mostly towards me - On the Friday following, I went to see the Mare and the Prisoner, and do really believe that the Mare is the same, but I am not quite so certain as to the Man. However I had some talk with him, and he told me at first, that his Mare had not been out of the Stable, that Evening the Robbery was Committed, but afterwards he said, that his boy had taken her out to Water.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wyersdale again depos'd. That when the Prisoners boy was Examin'd about the Mare, he said that he rode her to Bartholomew Fair, and return'd about 7 at Night. Most of this Deposition was corroberuted by

They staid drinking there till after 7 in the Evening. and then came away together. They were overtaken near the Shoulder of Mutton, by Mr Herbert a Bricklayer, who went with them to the Salmon and Ball, and call'd for a Pint of Wine, it was then about half an hour past 8. They had not sat long before a Hackney Coach came by, and the Coachman told somebody at the Door, that the Coach had been rob'd, by a Highwayman upon Cambridge heath, (which was but a little way from thence,) about 9 a Clock, they all three went to the Prisoner's Door, where Mr. Herbert left them, but Pitman kept him Company till a 11 a Clock, and he was sure, that the Prisoner was not upon any Horse or Mare that Night.</p>
               <p>The Coachman depos'd, that he call'd at the Salmon and Ball Door, and told somebody that the Coach had been rob'd upon Cambridge-heath. And the Prisoners Boy depos'd. That between 6 and 7 a Clock in the Evening, he rode the Mare out to water upon Cambridge heath and return'd at 7 or a little after, and lockt the Mare up in the Stable, and he was sure she was out no more that Night.

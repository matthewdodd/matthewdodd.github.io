                  </hi>. I keep the Prince of Wales, Woolwich. On 9th Nov., about half-past eight o'clock, there was some sappers fighting in my room—I went and separated them—the prisoner and three of his comrades were there, but they had nothing to do with the disturbance—they were in the passage—one of them was going into the tap-room as I came out—he swore he would be revenged on some one—I said, "There has been quite disturbance enough, my man; be quiet"—he struck me, and we both went down in the passage—the prisoner and his comrades were outside, striking with sticks—Smith tore down the top half of the door, and entered the bar, and struck my wife with a stick, on the head—his com<lb></lb>rades said, "Break the door down, and fetch the b——out; if we get him outside, we will kill him"—I was struck by some one—my wife struck the prisoner with a stick—he took the stick from her, and struck me on the head—my head was cut open—I cannot say whether the prisoner did that—he had been drinking, but was not drunk.</p>

I was in the bar, and heard a noise—three soldiers attacked my husband—one knocked him down—I pulled him into the bar, bolted the door, took the staff down, and told the prisoner if he entered the door, I would knock him down—he dragged the door till he got it open—he pulled the bottom of it to pieces—he entered, and I made a blow at him—he took the staff from</p>

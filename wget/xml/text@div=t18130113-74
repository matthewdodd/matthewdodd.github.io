I ran out of the shop, and saw a man of the name of M'Cormack bringing the prisoner up with two pair of half boots. He immediately gave them into my hands, and we conveyed the prisoner to the watchhouse. The half boots stood outside of the shop, on a board, for shew.</p>

            . On Tuesday, the 5th of this month, I was going up George-court, towards my lodgings. I saw the prisoner looking at some boots and shoes that were outside of Mr. Cranmer's. I observed he looked as much at the people that passed as he did at the shoes; that gave me suspicion. I watched him. I saw him take the half boots. I followed him down the court, and going across Piccadilly I saw him drop them. I picked them up, and catched him before he went ten yards further. I am certain the prisoner is the man. I never had him out of my sight.</p>
               <p>- JONES. I am an officer. I produce the boots. I took charge of the prisoner.</p>

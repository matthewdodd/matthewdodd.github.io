                  </hi>. I am a money lender; I occasionally reside in St. Martin's-lane. In Oct. last, application was made to me for a loan, to be advanced to James Gillard, and I in consequence called on the prisoner on 28th Oct., at 17, Winchester-place, Pentonville—I inquired at the door for Mr. Ion, and was shown to the prisoner—I asked him if he was the landlord</p>

               <p>of the house; if he rated the house—he told me he had been landlord of the house upwards of two years—I asked him to produce his rent and taxes receipts, which he did—this paper is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I acquainted him with my business, that his name had been put on a promissory-note to become security for one Mr. Gillard—he said he was quite agreeable—appli<lb></lb>cation had been made for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but not liking the other party who was put on the bill, we accepted the prisoner's responsibility for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many deposits had you received? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You cannot tell that way; I commenced with 3,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when I first opened betting, and left with about as many farthings; but I had money deposited with me for other persons, about 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say you paid that out of the money deposited with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Having lost all my own; on the race previous, I lost 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand you paid your own debts out of the money deposited with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A portion of the money was deposited with me, of the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have paid 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the rest was made up of my own.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is the deposit made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By calling and taking a ticket, and paying their money, those who deposited 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. did get something, those who deposited 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., those who deposited 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., those who deposited 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I gave eighty—that was not on the principle of first come first served, it was on no principle at all; I should have thought that subject was quite worn out, it is quite threadbare in the Courts—I charge five per cent interest for twelve months for all money—before I started this, I was a journeyman shoemaker—I had something like 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left me by my mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCKLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said there were some other receipts produced for rent, did the prisoner say anything about them at the time he produced them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he said he was quite ashamed that Mr. Gillard had mixed up his name with a disreputable fellow like this in Westminster, who had no receipts to show—Mr. Ryan, my clerk was with me, nothing was said about payment of the rent, or arrears of rent—it was at the last Chester Cup that I lost the money, on 29th April, or 1st May, 1851—I have replaced the whole of the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I am speaking with regard to the tickets, on which people would have claims—they would produce a ticket to receive the amount I advertised to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185112150025"></xptr>
               <p>give—they are nearly all in—I did keep a betting list at that time—what I mean is, it took me nearly 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to replace the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have only lent 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is on the responsibility of the prisoner—we did not accept the other person, but took the prisoner as security for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when there are two securities, it is joint and several surety ship.</p>

               <p>for his rent—he said, "Yes"—he asked him to show them to him, and he produced several pieces of paper purporting to be receipts for his rent—he also showed Rome receipts for rates—I was near enough to see some of them—I think the one produced is one of them.</p>

On the 11th of September, I had been to the Hope public-house, in St. John-street. I was very much intoxicated. Next morning, about five o'clock, I was awoke by the prisoner, and found myself in a lodging-house in West-street, and missed my watch and money. I asked him if he knew where they were? he said, my friends that I had been with the evening before had got them.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About a quarter after one o'clock in the morning, I was called, and found the prosecutor laying on the ground in West-street. The prisoner came up to him, and said he knew him very well-that he was his fellow-servant, and said he had been at work with him that day. I asked him several times if he knew him? he said he did; he said he lived in some yard(which I do not remember). He took a watch and some money out of his pocket, two keys and a knife. I told him he had better take him home as soon as he could - I am positive the prisoner is the man. I helped him to the end of my beat. He said he would get him a lodging - He got him one, paid for it, and put him to bed. When he came down, I told the landlady that the prisoner had the watch and money, and that he said he was his friend. Next night, I heard the prosecutor had not got his property. He came to me about half-past ten o'clock - I went in search of the prisoner. He described him to another watchman; they took him. I am certain the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . I keep a coffee-shop in Field-lane. On the 11th of September, between one and two o'clock in the morning, the prisoner had some coffee at my shop - He shewed me a silver hunting-watch, capped and jewelled, which he said he took from his fellow-servant, whom he found asleep in the street. The next night, between ten and eleven o'clock, I heard of the robbery, and described the prisoner; about eleven o'clock he came in - I had him secured.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About half-past two o'clock, O'Hara and the prisoner came to me; the prisoner asked me to have some coffee, which I did; he pulled out a hunting-watch, and said he had taken it from his fellow-servant, with his money and two keys, and said one of the keys was the key of a chest. The next night Ayres came to me, and asked me if I knew the prisoner? I told him I should know him again; he told me to take him up. In about a quarter of an hour I was called in and found the prisoner there. I asked him if he had returned the watch to the man; he said he had given it to an acquaintance of his; I asked him if he called upon him in the morning, he said he did.</p>

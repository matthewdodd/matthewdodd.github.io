                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Lovell &amp; Christmas, provision merchants, of Snow Hill—on 18th March, about noon. Hall came in, and asked me the price of eggs—I told him I could not give it then, as it was market-day, upon which the prices were regulated, but I thought they would be down 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per 1000—he said that he would call next day, but he returned about 2 o'clock the same day—I was in the back counting-house, which is at the farther end of the warehouse—I heard somebody walk across the shop—I got off my stool, and met Hall at the counting-house door—he came into the counting-house, and asked me if I would give him the price of eggs—I told him it was impossible, without knowing the state of the market—he said that he wished to make a large purchase—I then moved to the front of the fireplace, where I could see the street door—he then asked me about rabbits—I said they were very scarce—he pressed me to put down on paper what I considered the probable price would be—I told him it would be of no use—I then noticed Gibson going from the front counting-house towards the street door, with an overcoat on his arm—I rushed to the front door, locked it, took the key out, and put it in my trowsers pocket—I noticed that Gibson had a cash-box under his coat, and said "Drop that cash-box"—by that time Hall was at the front of the warehouse—Gibson went two or three paces back, and put down two cash-boxes and a bag of silver—Hall, who was nearest to the door, tried to open it—I took the cash-box and bag, walked into the private passage, and called Mr. Christmas, who asked what was the matter—I said, in Hall's hearing, "They were only going to walk off with the cash-box, that is all"—Mr. Christmas came down, and sent for a constable—the two cash-boxes were kept in the front counting-house—one contained 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other a bill of exchange for 1200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another for 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on the road to the station, Gibson ran away—I caught</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They were taken to Smithfield Station, 100 yards, or more, from our place—the constable had both prisoners, till Gibson got away; I had not put my hands upon Hall—when I heard the stealthy steps of Gibson, I went, as quick as I could, and turned the key—I then turned and confronted Gibson, who was close up to the door, but I had got the key in my pocket then—Hall then turned the handle, as if he expected the door to be open—Mr. Lovell came down stairs with Mr. Christmas.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business with Mr. Snell, as provision merchants, at 35, King Street, Snow Hill—on 13th March, about 2 o'clock, I was dining with Mr. Snell, and was called down by Payne and saw the prisoners in the warehouse—Payne said "They have been trying to walk off with the cash-boxes"—I did not hear that either of them spoke—I fetched a constable—Mr. Snell is not here.</p>

On the 14th she went up to clean the rooms, and came down in about six minutes after, and desired my wife to let her go to a neighbour's necessary, there being people in our yard, she went and in about ten minutes after my wife went up stairs and found a drawer broke open and some guineas missing (she is sick at home and can't attend) she came down and told me, so I ran to the house where her mother lodged, and was informed my servant had been there but was gone. Six or 7 of us went in pursuit of her next day, but could not find her; a neighbour accidentally seeing her getting into the Barnet stage coach came and let me know, so I, and an evidence, took horses, pursued her, and near Whetstone took her and her mother out of the coach, carried, them to Barnet, and tax'd her with stealing my money; she directly owned that she had forced open the drawer with an old key, and took out 14 guineas. I can safely say there were 17 missing; she had left six behind in the drawer. I search'd her, and found six guineas in gold and 10 s. 6 d. in silver upon her. The old woman said to me, she would have had her daughter brought me the money the night before They had bought themselves cloaths with part of the money, being now both very tight, but were very ragged before. I asked them where they were going, and they said into Bedfordshire to the mother's sister's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing found upon the old woman?</p>
               <p>Hudson. There were 7 s. found upon her, which the girt said was part of my money. The old woman pulled it out, and said, it is all I have got, it is what my daughter gave me.</p>
               <p>John Collier. I went along with Mr. Hudson in pursuit of the prisoners. We overtook them about, 3 miles on this side, Barnet. I ask'd the daughter, how she could be so base to rob her master of 17 or 18 guineas. She said, she believ'd it was not so much, it was but 14. We took her to Barnet before justice Haswell, where she said she found a key in her mistress's under drawer, with which she forc'd open the drawer in which was the money, and took 14 guineas, and that the devil put it into her head. The old woman said she knew nothing at all of the matter, till such time she was going to take coach to go out of town. She deliver'd 7 s. to the officer, and said it was money her daughter had given her.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The officer that lives at Barnet has got the cloaths which they had bought with part of the money, but he is not here.</p>

               <p>I did not break the lock, it was left open, and I took the money. My mother did not know any thing of it. As to the 7 s. found upon her it was her own property.</p>

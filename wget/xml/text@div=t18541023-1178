                  </hi>, I am Inspector of Police in Her Majesty's Dockyard, at Woolwich. The prisoner has been at work in the Dock-yard as Armourer to the Dockyard Battalion; it was his duty to take care of the arms—on 11th Oct he came up the yard, about half past 5 o'clock in the afternoon—I gave directions that he should be stopped and searched—I saw him stoop down as he went into the office—I followed him, and found a piece of copper bolt in his right hand trowsers pocket—it was about 3 lbs. 10 oz., and had the mark of the broad arrow upon it—I put my hand, and felt something in his right hand trowsers pocket—I said, "This is what I want; take it out"—he took out his spectacle case—I then felt, and it was gone—I said, "Where is it?"—I found it in his hand, in his hat—I said, "Where did you get this?"—he said, "It is all right; it was given me by a man to make a soldering iron of"—I said, "What man?"—he said he did not know—I said, "Where does he belong to?"—he said he did not know—he had no right whatever to take this away—after he was given in charge, I searched a drawer belonging to him, in the Armoury—the drawer was locked—I found the key hanging up in the Armoury—I had some little difficulty in finding it, as well as the key of the shop—I found in that drawer, eight pieces of copper bolt, most of them marked with the broad arrow—I asked the prisoner, in the station, what was in that drawer that was locked, in the shop—he said, "Nothing particular"—I said, "Tell me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185410230130"></xptr>
               <p>what is in it"—he said, "A parcel of rubbish"—he then said, "There is a pistol"—I said, "Is there any copper?"—he said, "There may be"—I said, "If there is copper, you must have it in charge"—he said, "No"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said, "When a ship is paying off, the men sometimes are very kind, and they sometimes give me pieces"—He had no right to these bolts, nor had any one a right to take them out of the yard.</p>

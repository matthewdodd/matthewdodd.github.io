In the night of the 5th or 6th of July, I lost between four and five quarters, I believe, but I cannot be exact. I know they were lost the night of the 5th or 6th, because I was on board the barge in the evening, and left the men to lock up the hatches, which they neglected to do. I heard there was a robbery committed in the barge.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoners? - Yes; they are both lightermen and watermen.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I was called out between eleven and twelve o'clock by the watch, and the officer of the night, when Mr. Bennett's barge was robbed, and was informed there was a boat seised with peas in it; at the same time the watch desired to know what they were to do with them. I went down to the water-side, and ordered them to be lodged in the watch-house, and that one of the officers might take charge of the boat, for there was nobody with the boat when I was there. I went to bed at half after one; at half after two the watch knocked me up again, and said they had got a man they believed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150029"></xptr> belonged to the gang, and they partly knew, I believe, who they were.</p>
               <p>(There being no other evidence but an accomplice, whose testimony was not confirmed by any corroborating circumstances, he was not called.)</p>

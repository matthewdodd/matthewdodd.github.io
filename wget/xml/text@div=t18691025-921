                  </hi>. I and the prisoner were employed at the Gas Works, North Woolwich—on the evening of 13th September, when blowing a forge, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186910250046"></xptr>
               <p>picked up a boot lace—prisoner said, "Give me that lace"—I said, "What lace?"—then he hit me and knocked me down on the ground with his fists—I got up and said, "Is this your lace? if it is you shall not have it"—I ran to the back of the forge, and then he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the tongs at me, but they didn't strike me—next he came after me and knocked me down again, and, drawing his knife, said, "I will have it now"—then he tried to cut the lace, and said, "You b—, if you don't lie still I'll knife you"—I saw the knife in his hand—he cut part of the lace, and then stabbed me in the thigh with the knife, as I lay on the ground.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at Nuttree House, Plaistow—on the morning of the 14th September I was called in to see the prosecutor—he had previously been brought to my house—I found him lying on a sofa, suffering from a stab in the thigh—there was a transverse wound towards the middle of the left thigh, about three and a half inches in length—I believe it was caused by a sharp instrument, and not by the tongs—in the middle it was half or three-quarters of an inch deep—there was a cut through the trowsers, which could not have been done by a screw or pincers—the knife produced would cause such a wound.</p>

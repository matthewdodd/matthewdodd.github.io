               <p>Q. Did you understand the meaning of boning something? - A. Yes, thieving; upon that, he said, if some of you will pursue him we shall take him; I was the second after him; just as Lumley got over the style, he cried, "here he is," when I got to him, he had laid hold of him, which was about four yards from the ditch; me and another young man held him by the collar, while Lumley went to the ditch and took the property out; we then brought him back to the Coach-and-Horses, and delivered him into the hands of the constable; there was a coat, waistcoat, and breeches; as the young man and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170064"></xptr>I held the man by the collar, the breeches gingled; and Lumley said, there is something in the pocket, let us take it out, left it should fail out; and he took out seven shillings and sixpence, and two pocket-pieces.

I heard there was a thing going on as a mountebank, jumping and dancing, and tumbling and jumping in sacks, I went to see it; and as I was going home, over the field, these men came and stopped me, and said, I was the man; I never was nigh the ditch, and they found nothing upon me.)(The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

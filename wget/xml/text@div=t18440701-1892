                  </hi>. I am an attorney, and live in the Adelphi. I was in the Half Moon, at Putney, on the 22nd of June—I felt something, and missed my handkerchief out of my pocket—it was safe about half a mi<lb></lb>nute before—I turned round immediately, and saw the prisoner a little behind me—I seized him—I observed his right hand drop immediately, and saw the superintendent of police pick up my handkerchief—this is it.</p>

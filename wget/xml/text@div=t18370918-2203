                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 121.) On the 10th of July, 1836, I was on duty in Virginia-row, Bethnal-green, about a quarter after four o'clock in the morning—there was a disturbance—I saw the prisoner there—I had a man named Richard Kendrick in custody—he was one of the party who had been making the disturbance—he had been up stairs into the house No. 4, hoisted up the window, and presented a pistol at me, and swore he would blow my b——brains out—he jumped out of the window as I was going in at the door, and I took him into custody—I was taking him to the station-house, and the prisoner came up, and said, "Dick, you are not going so easily as that"—the prisoner then seized me by the collar—a scuffle ensued between the two, and they got me down—the prisoner then wrenched my staff out of my hand, and struck me several blows on the back part of my head with my own staff—he then stooped down, picked up a stone while I was lying on the ground, and dashed it down on my head with both his hands—it was not a very large stone—it struck me on the fore part of my head—I was stunned for a time, and the man I had in custody got out of my hold, and they both ran away—when I recovered I got up, and made towards the house—two of my brother officers came, and conveyed me to the station-house—I was unable to do my duty for three weeks in consequence of the blows—I was attended by two surgeons—my head</p>

On the 30th of July, I went out with my wife, at about two o'clock in the afternoon, and left my son at home. I returned at about eleven o'clock the same night; the street door was all right, but when I came up to the shop and parlour, I stooped down to get the key from under the mat, but found the door open. I thought my son was asleep inside, but on our striking a light, we found nobody there. On my going into the back parlour, I found my case in which I keep my work, on the floor, and empty; all the things named in the indictment were gone. I had left the canary hanging outside of the window, but the cage was put on the top of the bed and the bird taken out. The prisoner at the bar lived within six doors of where I live now.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness. On the 30th of July, I staid at home after my father and mother were gone out, until eight o'clock; I then went out with a young man named Burgoyne, who called for me. We locked the door, and put the key under the mat. We met the prisoner Townsend, and a young man named Marrian, together. Townsend asked me if my father was out? I told him, he was. They asked me where I was going, and I said to the Wheatsheaf, in Drury-lane. They asked me how my father would get in when he came home? I told them, he would find the key under the mat. They said, they would come down to me at the Wheatsheaf. That was all that passed. Marrian had been a school-fellow of mine; I did not know where Townsend lived at that time. I heard that my father was robbed, for the first time, at about eleven o'clock, the same night when I went home. Neither Townsend nor Marrian came to us at the Wheatsheaf. The next morning, I told Townsend, that I had a suspicion it was him that did the robbery; he denied it. At eleven o'clock, I got a search warrant, and searched his place, but found nothing.</p>

            . On the Sunday night that the robbery was committed, I saw the prisoner and Marrian walking up and down Duke-street. The last time I saw them was making believe to make water against a water spout, at about three doors from the prosecutor's house. In a moment I missed Townsend from the spout, and saw Marrian go into the prosecutor's house; he pushed the door, and it opened of itself. I went into my father's house, and saw nothing more.</p>

The next morning, the 1st of August, I opened the prisoner's door to let young Alders in to him; young Alders said to him, in my hearing, you have ruined my father for ever. Townsend made answer, and said, it may be better than what you imagine; the things were sold for four pounds ten shillings, and if the money could be raised, they might be got back again. They both went to Marlborough-street, and then Townsend denied all knowledge of the robbery whatever.</p>

He asked me if Jack had brought any thing to my house; I said, he had not. He said, if you have any thing here that Jack has brought, put it out of the way.

I live at 74, Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square—in June, 1878, I lodged with the defendant's father in Milton Street, Dorset Square—the defendant also Jived there—I had just come to England, and I said that I should like to find some words to compose music to; some words were lyin there, and the result was that I composed the music of "The Tar's Return"—I cannot say whether I received the words from the defendant's father—I went to Signor Foli with the song; he liked it very much, and I went there again with the defendant, who desired to publish the piece, and made an arrangement that he was to pay 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187910200039"></xptr>
               <p>I came to go the prisoner's house—my wife did not apply for the place of housekeeper—there was an advertisement in the paper for some employment at the prisoner's house relating to music, and my wife went in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and I went in the evening—I did not tell the prisoner that I was badly off—the result was that we went to live in the prisoner's house a week after<lb></lb>wards, or less—we were then living in one room on the second floor in Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, and paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week regularly—in the beginning we were invited to the prisoner's house to dinner, and he made me hear his son sing; I wish to show how we were coaxed to go into their house—we remained there a very long time till after July, when I had finished some work which was in their hands—we went there in May, 1878, and remained till January last—I composed this song while I was there—we provided our own food, except when we dined downstairs with them—I was engaged, and they were to give me from 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day for giving lessons to the prisoner's son, but I was getting nothing, and I suppose they let the rent run on—I was not to compose music for them—I had food and lodging, and there was compensation for it in the lessons I gave his son daily in music and singing; it was that which brought me to the house—his son has a tenor voice—I do not know that he has a French medal—I never saw this medal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—all this was to be supplied for teaching—that was all I hud to do—my wife was to do nothing at all—they were delighted at my coming there to prepare him, and bring him out at the opera—I got the words of the song about three weeks after I was in the house, and I wrote the music to them in a very few days—I did not know at first whether I could compose any music to the words; they were given to me to try what I could do—there was no arrangement as to whom the music was to belong to if I succeeded, because I did not expect to succeed, as the words were very ugly, and very irregular—the words profess to be by "Nollo," that is a gentleman named Davis—I have heard that there was an arrangement between him and the defendant for the words, and I did not suppose that he was going to pay Davis and give me the words—I know that Signor Foli, Signor Santley, and Mr. Sims Reeves sing songs for the purpose of getting them sold, and that they are paid for singing them, either so much or by royalty—the prisoner's father is, I believe, a music publisher in Newman Street, but I cannot say for certain, because there are so many of them—when I went to Signor Foli it was not to ask him to sing the song which I had composed, but to see if he liked the music, and if he did he would undoubtedly accept it—he has a bass voice—the song was for a bass voice, but still it may be called a baritone—it was peculiarly suited to Signor Foli's voice; a song can be made suitable to a baritone, and also to a bass by transposition—I suggested taking it to Signor Foli—this song was published in Shrewsbury by some Dobrowolski—my name appears twice on the MS.—I have done so with all my music; the first signature was written so imperfectly that I wrote the second so that the engraver might make no mistake—I have been in the habit of doing so for a long time—this writing at the bottom is mine; I have always been in the habit in America of entering my music in my own name, and I put "Entered at Congress," hut that is scratched out—I did not receive any money for this—I went to Signor Foli to show it to him—I played it over to him, and asked him whether he liked it—he said he did very much, and offered to buy it—I said "The words do not belong to me, I must bring the person who has got</p>

               <p>the words," that was on the 10th or 11th June, and I waited till February but it had been published, and copies had been sold before I sold it—it was published directly, and I believe 3,000 copies were sold—Signor Foli arrived, I believe, on April 15th, and I gave him this receipt for 10 guineas; it is in my writing—I lived in his house while Madame Foli was in America—he went there first, and she went afterwards, and they came back together—my wife lived there too; I did not pay there—I did not compose for them, nor did I teach Signor Foli to sing—I went to stay there as a friend while they were away—I know that Signor Foli claimed his royalties from the prisoner—I am now living at 45, Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square—I have no friend there to keep me and my wife for nothing—I work, and receive money, and am very well paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I remember putting my two signatures to this manuscript—this "Received 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." was not there then—when I said that I had not the right to the words, I went immediately afterwards with the defendant to see Signor Foli—he wished to buy the words, and he said, "You can pay the gentleman who wrote the words two or three guineas, and come to me after;" so I suggested to the defendant to buy the words—he said, "I need not do that, Davis gave them to me, I can have them for nothing, I will give Davis a drink"—the property in the music was mine—the prisoner said be would give Signor Foli 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. royalty—the music was to be printed at Dobrowolski's, and a proof brought of it, but it was never done.</p>

It is my son who has premises in Shrewsbury—I have a house in Dorset Street—the de<lb></lb>fendant stayed with me at times, and travelled for me all over England—he sometimes went to Shrewsbury—I afterwards took premises in Newman Street, where I now carry on business—I published this song; I was ordered to do so by my son—I advertised for a housekeeper, and M. Mora's wife came; but she was so very fine—her husband came in the evening—he said "My wife called this morning. I am a pianist, and wish to speak to you, and show you my style of playing"—he began to play, and he played very well—he said he was starving, and for two days had nothing to eat—I said "That is a pity for a man with talent like you," and I took a sympathy for him—he said he had two situations to go to to-morrow, one to keep the books of a sweep, and the other as a potman—I said "It is a pity.

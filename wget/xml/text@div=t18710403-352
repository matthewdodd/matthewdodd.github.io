                  </hi>. I am a moulding-machine worker, and live at 21, Grafton street, Lambeth—on Sunday evening, 5th March, I was in Kent Street, and went to a brothel with the female prisoner—I undressed myself, and sat on the bed—I had not been in the room two minutes and a half, before I felt a violent blow on the back of my head, and another on my ear, and the male prisoner assaulted me in front—he held me while the female rifled my pockets—she escaped from the room, and in came four or five men—I broke from Collins, and rushed to the window, and called out "Murder!" and "Thieves!"—a policeman came to my assistance, and I gave Collins in charge for an assault—on dressing myself, I found I was minus my coat and boots, and I lost a sovereign, a half-sovereign, several 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces, and some small coin—I saw the female prisoner again that same afternoon, at the station, and recognized her—my mouth was cut by the male prisoner, but I can't remember how it was done.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Collins. Q.</hi> Where were you when I first saw you?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sitting on the bed, and you caught hold of me—I did not throw a candlestick at your head; I have no recollection of it—we did not have a fair stand up fight, there was no fight whatever—I might have struck you, in the scuffle, but only to protect my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Lightfoot. Q.</hi> Did I take the money out of your pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and no one else—I was not in bed when the man came in—I had taken off my trowsers, coat, and waistcoat, and put them on a chair, and while the man was standing in front of me, so that I could not move, I saw you take the money out of my trowsers—this was between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing—I was not sober or I should not have been there, but I knew what I was about—I did not jump out of bed and throw the candlestick at the man—the money did not fall from my trowsers on the floor—there was none left and the pockets were turned inside out.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where had you met with the female? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between Bedlam and St. George's Catholic Cathedral—we went into two public-houses before we got to this house—I asked her to go to Woolwich with me—I was not drinking with different men, only with the female—I might have said, before the Magistrate, that I drank with two or three men; it has passed my recollection—I was not ordered out of any house—the constable afterwards showed me a sovereign, a half sovereign, and sixpence.</p>

               <p>down on the bed while the woman rifled my pockets"—the prisoner denied it—he gave his address as residing at the house—he was sober—the pro<lb></lb>secutor was very drunk, and was naked except his shirt and stockings, his trowsers were lying on the floor with the pockets turned inside out—I looked for his boots, coat, and hat, but could not find them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer M</hi>). I went to this brothel about 3 o'clock on the Sunday afternoon, and saw the female prisoner there, with two other women—I told her I should take her into custody for being concerned with the man she lived with in robbing a man in her room, about 1.15 that morning—she said "I was not there, and I know nothing about it"—I told her she would have to accompany me to the station—she went towards the window, and took something from her bosom—I took it from her hand—it was a purse, a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and sixpence—I asked what she meant by this; she made no answer—at the station she said "There was a fight in the room, and the money dropped out, and I picked it up and kept it"—I searched the place, but did not find any of the clothes—they have not been traced—I have frequently seen the prisoners together—they had lived at this house for six weeks or two months—the female was not in her own room when I took her, but in another room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Collins' Defence.</hi> I know nothing at all about the robbery. I lost my coat as well in the scuffle. We had a fair stand-up fight, and he halloaed out "Police!" and "Murder!" after I got the best of him; and when the policeman came, he said he would give me in charge. If I had robbed the man I could have got away before the policeman came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ligktfoot Defence.</hi> I did not steal the money; I picked it up. I thought he was locked up, as he went to the station-house. I don't know anything of his clothes. I lost several of my own things. When he screamed "Murder!" no end of people came into the room.</p>

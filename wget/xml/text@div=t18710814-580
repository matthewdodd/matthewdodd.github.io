I am the wife of Frederick Atlee, of 4, Crown Court, Seething Lane—we live on the third floor—the prisoner lives on the second floor, in the same house—on Friday night, 30th June, my husband came home from work and came up stairs—the person on the first floor called him to look at a bird—he went down—the prisoner came up stairs and began quarrelling with his wife—he then began quarrelling with my husband, and he up with his fist and aimed a blow at him, which hit Mrs. Gupp—my husband went down stairs and sat on the door step—the prisoner went after him, and said "You b——, come out and fight, I will have a fight with someone to-night"—my husband said "No, I don't wish to fight;" and the prisoner up with his foot and said "Take that, it will do you good," and he kicked him in the eye—I took him to the hospital—his eye was very bad—the prisoner was drunk—my husband was sober.</p>

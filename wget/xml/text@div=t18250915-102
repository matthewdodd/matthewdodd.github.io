I said "I don't want to go with you, I have but 1 d. in my pocket, which I will give you to go away;" she took that, and then came round to my right-hand pocket, put her hand in and drew the pocket half out, in taking her hand out. I felt my pocket, and missed half a crown. I said "If you don't return it, I will put you where the dogs can't bite you;" she said "Me, you villain," and called the Watch, and said I had charged her with robbing me.</p>

            . The prisoner came to the watch-house with the prosecutor, who charged her with robbing him of half a crown. I searched her, and found a half crown, 1 s. and 1 d. - he said he had given her the 1 d.; he at first said "Give me the half crown, and you may go," but she denied having it. When I found it on her, she said "You may take it," but I said "It is too late now;" she said she had got the 3 s. 6 d. from a gentleman in Whitcomb-street.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, charging the prosecutor with taking liberties with her, and that on her resistance, he charged her with this robbery.</p>

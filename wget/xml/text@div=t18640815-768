                  </hi>. I am a Greengrocer, at 86, Milton-street, City—on Sunday night, 31st July, about half-past 11, I was sitting at my own door, which is about twenty yards from Sun-court, I saw a lot of people collected a few yards lower down—I stepped out into the road to see what was the matter, and saw the prisoner and deceased preparing to fight—I can't say whether that was the beginning of it, they might have been fighting before—I heard nothing said—a scuffle ensued, and in the next round the prisoner struck the deceased a tremendous blow in the face—I never saw a blow struck like it—the force of the blow sent the man to the ground imme<lb></lb>diately—he fell on the kerb or on the stones—the prisoner was in a des<lb></lb>perate rage, and he made at least two efforts to get at the deceased while he was on the ground—I knew the deceased very well by sight—he laid on the ground some minutes, quite senseless to all appearance—he was carried off—the whole that I saw occupied about ten minutes.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186408150032"></xptr>
               <p>I was standing at the end of the court in Milton-street—the prisoner came up and was talking so me and four others for a few minutes—Coney came up the street looking rather wildish—I asked him what was the matter—he said that two or three persons at the top of the street were going to hit him—I said, "Do you know them?"—he did not answer—Collins turned round and said, "Don't you know them?"—"Yes," he says, to Collins," You know them well"—they had two or three words after that, and Coney hit Collins in the jaw—Collins returned it, and hit him with both hands—they bad hold of one another, and Collins went down first—they rolled over one another on the road—they then got up and began to hit one another again, then Collins threw Coney down—I went between them to part them as well as I could, but I could not keep them away from one another—I laid hold of Coney to keep him away—they went at it again, and Collins caught him round the hips and threw him, and the bock of his head came against the stones—he was not able to move after that—he was carried in doors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It was the deceased who first struck Collins in the jaw? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; after they were parted the deceased insisted on renewing the fight—they were just alike as to that—they agreed to fight.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might the spitting of blood be caused by the rupture of a vessel, from over-excitement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very likely; or it might have been from the lungs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's hospital—the deceased was brought there late at night on 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> August—I attended upon him—he was quite insensible, and in convulsions—he re<lb></lb>mained insensible, with all the symptoms of inflammation of the brain until he died on the morning of the 5th; he was in convulsions the whole time—there were some large bruises upon his left cheek and round his left eye, and some bruises on the back of his head, and other bruises about various parts of his body—I examined his body after death—his brain, and the membranes of his brain, were very much inflamed, and the base of the skull on the right side was fractured—the inflammation was caused by that frac<lb></lb>ture—a severe fall on the back of the head would be the most likely thing to cause that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

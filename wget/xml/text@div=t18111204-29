I received information from Mr. Brown, stating that he had seen the prisoner Nash in Blue-coat-fields with hairs, I informed Mr. Pigg of it; an officer was sent for, and the prisoner called down stairs, and charged with the theft.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this - A. The 12th of November. The prisoner denied it. He was informed that if he would make an ingenious confession he should not be prosecuted. He then said the bristles were at one Clowes a shoemaker in Chapman-street, Commercial-road; the officer and myself went there, we found the bristles between two and three pounds, worth fifteen shillings. The prisoner Nash was with us, he pointed out the place. We then went to Field; he told us that he had sold the bristles that he had received from Nash to Mr. Brown in Ratcliffe Highway; and had given Nash the money. Nash said, if it was the employers wish to transport Field he would do all in his power to do it.</p>

            . I am a brush-maker in Ratcliffe Highway. On the 11th of November I met the prisoner Nash with some hairs under his coat; I said to him, you have some lilly white hairs; he said, yes. I thought he seemed confused and wished to conceal them. I had suspicion that he had stolen them; Mr. Pigg had been to me a few days before to borrow such an article. The next morning I saw the foreman, I told him my suspicion, and that I had bought hairs of the prisoner Field two or three times. I had purchased hairs of Field three times.</p>

I asked Field what he had done with the hair that he received from Nash; he said if Nash had done wrong it was unknown to him, that he had brought hair to him, and he had sold it three different times to a Mr. Brown in Ratcliffe Highway. I have the bristles I found at Mr. Clowes.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Pigg.</p>
               <p>Q. In November last, and some time before November had you any acquaintance with the prisoner Field - A. When I was with my late master I became acquainted with Field about a twelvemonth ago; he did some business for my late master; When he was failing he had the turning of me over to Mr. Pigg of Wapping Wall.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you any conversation with Field about any hairs - A. When I was at Mr. Hills I did the business for him when he was out of the way, and Field was put in the house to let it; he did let it, and he was to take some of the things to sell. After I was turned over to Mr. Pigg I had a small parcel of hairs to sell, about seven ounces; I applied to Field, he sold them for Mr. Hill. After I had been with Mr. Pigg about a week he applied to me for more bristles to sell; he bought them of me, and paid me; the first sum that I received was four shillings, they came to five shillings and sixpence, eighteen pence he kept for himself. The next I received was nine shillings and two brooms, he said he kept the rest for commission, I do not know what he received. The next parcel he received was one pound five shillings and eleven pence, he said he only got twenty two shillings for them; he gave me a pound, and said he kept the rest for commission.</p>
               <p>Q. You kept all this money yourself - A. Yes; I did not bring it to account to my master.</p>
               <p>Field's Defence. I never applied to him for any hairs in my life; Nash applied to me to sell the hairs to Mr. Brown, and I believed them to be taken from his late master, Thomas Hill, for board wages.</p>

On Saturday morning, 16th Aug., about half-past 6 o'clock, I brought two dead lambs from the shop of Mr. Firmin—I was employed to do so by William Lowe, Mr. Moyce's foreman—I was to put them into his cart—I did not do so—I hung them on the rails in Newgate-street, as they were just killed, and were hot, in order to put them on the top of the other things when the cart was loaded; but I forgot them, and left them there, and the cart went away without them—I was backwards and forwards in the market afterwards, but took no more notice of them.</p>

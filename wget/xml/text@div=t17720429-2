I serve in the shop. On Friday night the 27th of March, at half an hour after nine o'clock, my master sent me with a message to Oxendon-street. The prisoner overtook me at the bottom of Dean-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I have seen him in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever speak to him before?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes. I have when he has been upon his stand; he is a <rs id="t17720429-2-deflabel11" type="occupation">chairman</rs>

He asked me if I wanted a chair. I told him no; and that I was going about my master's business. He pulled me about, and hit me a slap in the face. This was at the bottom of Dean-street. I went along; and he followed me still; he came and gave me another slap in the face, and insisted upon my going with him, and pulled me about. Then I was got as far as Princes-street, when he pulled me from one side of the street to the other, and insisted upon my drinking with him. Then he took me in his arms, and carried me into a publick-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lift you from the ground?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes, and carried me to the Plow.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from this Plow when he took you up?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. The other side of the street; he carried me across the street to the house; he had a pint of beer, and drank it; I drank none of it. Then he wanted me to go backwards; the place lay backwards where the people drank; I would not go with him; he paid for the beer, and we both came out together. Then I said it was too late to go where I was sent, and desired he would let me go home. He insisted upon my going with him to another place, which I did not know. He led me about from street to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177204290004"></xptr> street till I did not know where I was; and he got me into a street by <placeName id="t17720429-2-crimeloc12">Covent-garden</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you not know where you was?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Not till the next day. He told me I should not go home at all, that I should stay all night, and that he would get me a bed. He dragged me up an alley, when a woman came along with a pot of beer in her hand; he asked her to let me go into a house there; she said she would; I said I would not; she said I was a fool, and so pulled me in with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was nine o'clock when you set out from your master's, what time might it be when you got into this alley?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Near twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at the publick-house?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Not above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all the rest of the time you was about the streets with him?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What country are you of?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Devonshire?</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in London?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. About half a year. The man went into the house before me; and the woman pulled me up stairs by the hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you walked up, being pulled by her?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes. She took me into a room, she went out, and bolted the door on the outside. Then he strained my stays open with his hands, and took off my shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he undress you quite?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do then? Was he rude to you?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he undressed?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer any violence to you?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. He pushed me upon the bed. I made a noise; and he stopped my breath with his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the room besides yourself?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Not in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do any thing to you after he stopped your mouth?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell what it was. Did he threaten you?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. No; he only stopped my breath when I made a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. By the side of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do to you after he stopped your mouth?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. He was concerned with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean he lay with you, had carnal knowledge of you?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not a married woman, are you?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The last account you gave was, that he was standing by the side of the bed when he pulled you down on the bed. I suppose he altered that position before he had carnal knowledge of you?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. He fell down a top of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he enter your body?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he with you on the bed?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he stopping your mouth with his hand all the time?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. When I made a noise he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of him after this?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. He still kept me there.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you all the time upon the bed together?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. No, we were in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay together on the bed?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I can't justly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. A quarter of an hour, or half an hour, or how long?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I can't justly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You can recollect whether you staid on the bed an hour?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I can't.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he get in the bed?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get out of the house?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. At eleven o'clock the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been off the bed when you came out of the house?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lye on the bed with him for six hours together?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you for five hours?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I did not lie on the bed all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you lie on the bed?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up from the bed was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. It was dark at first.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177204290005"></xptr>Q. Did you lye down again?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes, I was pushed on the bed again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he carnal knowledge of you the second time?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been off the bed the last time before you went out?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. A good while.</p>
               <p>Q. How long?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Two or three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you doing?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Both sitting still then.</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes, I could not get out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who let you out at last?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. The woman unbolted the door and I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go out with you?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. He got out before me?</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay after him?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I came out soon after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after he came out in the street?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. Yes, I saw him go along the street a good way.</p>
               <p>Q. What street.</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I don't know the name of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you went home?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I did not go home; I was afraid as I had been out all night; I went to my brother's house in St. Ann's Court.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get there?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I was obliged to walk the streets all the next night, and went to my brother's on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him this story when you saw him?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. No, I told my mistress of it on Sunday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. No, my master and she could not be out together.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether, in all the time he was walking about with you, till he took you to the Plough, you called out for help.</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I was afraid he would murder me, as he had hit me two or three slaps on the face.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not at the Plough call out for assistance?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I thought he would let me go.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not call out for assistance to apprehend him, when you saw him in the street next morning?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I did not know it was proper to call out to strangers.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. The Tuesday following. I went to the Justice on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Devonshire do you come from?</p>
               <p>Hawkins. I was born at Exeter.</p>

             and another man; we went to lye there; we were drinking a pot of beer when the young woman came through the room we were in; she came at first and said she would not lye there without she could have a room for her self and her spouse by themselves, the prisoner came up directly after; one asked him to drink, which he did; and they went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that they went to bed?</p>
               <p>Glover. They shut the door, and there was a bed for them to go to.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there?</p>
               <p>Glover. Till seven next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they fasten themselves in?</p>
               <p>Glover. They pulled the door to; I don't believe there is any fastening; it is a little room like a closet, there is just room for a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise?</p>
               <p>Glover. No.</p>

            . I am a coachman; I lay in that house; two people came through, the room I lay in, to go to bed; I know the chairman, I don't know the woman; she came first into our room, she said she would not lie there unless she could have a room for herself and her spouse; the maid of the house said you may have one to yourself, so they went through our room into another room; the door was hardly shut; she must get upon the bed to go into the room; there were four or five beds upon the same floor, the partition was very thin; the woman went in first and sat down upon the bed, she must sit down upon the bed, for the bed touched the door; I never was in the house before, and never will go there again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any disturbances in the night?</p>
               <p>Robinson. There was no other disturbance but the maid of the house came up drunk and plagued us.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been any crying out then, you must have heard them?</p>
               <p>Robinson. If they had spoke I must have heard them.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutrix. The witnesses sware you said you would have a room for yourself and your spouse.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I never said any such words; when the maid dragged me up stairs, I said I would not lie in any such house, I was afraid it was a bad house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into any of the houses the prisoner has mentioned, to drink with him?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, only that one house at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sit with him all night in the chair?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, I was walking about all night, I did not sit down at all, and I ate nothing all the time.</p>

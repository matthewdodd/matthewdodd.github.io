                  </hi>. The prisoner is my husband—we have been married twenty-five years, and lived in Grange-walk, Bermondsey—when in liquor his conduct is bad—it is not so bad when he is in his solid senses. On 19th Oct. we had been out walking, we returned about nine o'clock and met my daughter and her sweetheart at the door—my husband was very tipsy—he was angry with my daughter and the young man, and they went out—I was rather obstinate, and insisted on letting them in again—I had had a drop of drink as well as him—I called him a bad father—he was mending a pen, and jumped up to hinder me opening the door—I was very obstinate—he went to shut the door, and I felt the knife come into my right breast, and recollect nothing else.</p>

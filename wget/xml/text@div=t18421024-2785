               <p>No. 4 Grocers' Hall-court—I found the two prisoners there—I found a quantity of Bank-notes apparently, lying open on a deak, about two feet from both the prisoners—Banister was standing in front of the desk, and Campbell at the back part—I found an engraved plate in the hand of Camp<lb></lb>bell—I found four good 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold on Ban<lb></lb>ker—I gave them to Mr. Fresh field—the notes and plates produced are what I found on the desk—this note is one of them, and these are three of the good notes I found—I asked Banister if his name was Banister—he said, "Yes"—I turned, pointed to the notes, and said, "Halloo, what are you going to do with these?"—he paused a moment, and then said, "I was not going to do any thing wrong with them"—he did not then say what he was going to do with them—I searched the desk, and found a quantity of papers there, one of which was the agreement produced—after searching the desk, Banister said, "I intended to give them to the hawkers as a kind of attraction"—I then asked Campbell who he was—he said, "I am the servant of Mr. Banister"—Banister said nothing to that—I took them away.</p>
               <p>The papers produced were as follows: "19th Sept. 1842. Hartwig and Co. agree with J.

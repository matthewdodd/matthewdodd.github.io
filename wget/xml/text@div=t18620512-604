On 7th April, about mid-day, I was in Camberwell New road with a man named Cartwright, and saw the prisoner running towards me, with a mob after him—that is the road from Camberwell-green to Kennington-common—I heard somebody call "Stop thief"—I caught hold of the prisoner, and he tried to throw me, but Cartwright helped me—the prisoner drew his hand out of his pocket clenched, and Cartwright said, "Look out <hi rend="italic">Bill,</hi> he has got something in his hand"—Cartwright laid hold of his hand—Mr. Wright came up and said that the prisoner must be taken to the station, and we took him there, Cartwright holding the hand that was closed, so that he could not open it.</p>

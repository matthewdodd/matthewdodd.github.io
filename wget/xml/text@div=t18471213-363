                  </hi> I live in Well-street, Wapping. On 11th Dec. I went to the crown and Seeptre public-house, and had some beer, there were five men and three women there—the prisoner was there, about three yards from me—I knew her by sight—she did not have any of the beer—I took my purse out of my bosom—there were two half-sovereigns, eight half-crowns, and 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I took it all out, to get some change—the prisoner was looking at me—I went away to go home—somebody took me to another public-house, about half an hour afterwards—I am sure I had the purse and money then—the prisoner was there, and sat on one side of me in the tap-room—she put her arm round my neck, and her hand in my bosom, and asked whether I was <hi rend="italic">ticklesome</hi>—I said I was not, and told her to keep her hands off me—I got up, and missed my money—she was then standing by the tap-room door—I asked her for my money—she said she had not got it—I went outside for a policeman, but could not find one—I went in again—she was still there—I told her to give me my money—she said she had not got it—no other woman did anything to me—I was quite sober—I never found either money or purse.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) On the Sunday afternoon, after this Friday, I took the prisoner and told her the charge—she said, "I know nothing about the money; I told him to have a constable and have me searched at the time he accused me, but he would not."</p>

Q.</hi> Did not you hear him tell the inspector that I asked him to get a policeman and have me searched, as I had not left the place where I had been sitting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he said he ran out of the house, as he was frightened; as there were two or three men who frightened him.</p>

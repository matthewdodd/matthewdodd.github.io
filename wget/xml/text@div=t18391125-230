On the 13th of November, between two and three o'clock in the morning, I was coming down Mile-end-road, and met two females, who followed me down to Red Cow-lane—we had a little conversation, and the prisoner, who was one of them, began to feel about my person—she went away immediately, spoke to the other, and then came back to me—the other did not feel me—I missed my watch, which I saw safe about ten minutes before—I will swear that it was there when she began to feel—I was not sober—I had suspicion—I went after her, and gave her in charge for stealing my watch—I have not found it.</p>

               <p>MR. CURWOOD conducted the prosecution.</p>
               <p>EDWARD PARR. In 1819 I had a furnished house in <placeName id="t18300708-142-crimeloc801">St. Mary-axe</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18300708-142-crimeloc801" type="placeName" value="St. Mary-axe"></interp>

                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18300708-142-defend999 t18300708-142-deflabel802"></join> for two or three years; I had a good opinion of her. On a Wednesday in August in that year, I had occasion to leave town - I think on the 18th; I returned on the Tuesday after - I went to this house; I found it shut up, and the furniture was gone - after I had extricated myself from the King's Bench prison, I found where the furniture was gone, but I did not find the prisoner for a length of time; I endeavoured to find her, and offered 20l. reward - I at last found her in a lodging-house in Sutton-street, Soho-square; I went to her, and asked what she had done with the furniture she had taken from my house in St. Mary-axe - she told me it was an unfair question; I went for an officer, but she was then denied; I found her again on the 12th of June last year, at a lodging-house in Winslow-street, Oxford-street, and gave her in charge - the furniture was really mine; I bought the greater part of it - she had no authority to dispose of any part of it; she was nothing more than my servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What sort of a house was it? A. The same sort as the one I found the prisoner in; I was in trouble about a licensed house, where soldiers were quartered - I was fined 500l.; I am separated from my wife, but did not make over the furniture to her - I have no person here, of whom I bought any part of it; the prisoner arrested me and sent me to the King's Bench about 1819, and in 1820 I surrendered; I put in her claim as a disputed debt; I only recollect seeing her once in the presence of Mary Hughes, between 1819 and the time I apprehended her - I do not know Mary Roberts; I know

             - I cannot recollect seeing her in his presence; I know she had a son - I did not see her in his presence; I never went to solicit her to interfere with my wife to give me some money to keep me from starving - I was in trouble thirty years ago, and was honourably acquitted in the other Court; it was something about a man taking some boots, and I happened to be in his company - I was charged with robbing a washer-woman, but proved I did no such thing; I was in gaol, but cannot tell where - I have been in Newgate, Clerkenwell, Tothill-fields, and Giltspur-street.</p>

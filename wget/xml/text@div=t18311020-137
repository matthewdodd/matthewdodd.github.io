On Sunday morning, the 18th of September, I was called down stairs - I went out, and saw Francis Davis beckoning to some person; I ran and asked him where the woman was who had been with him in my shop- he said he had no woman with him; I said if he would tell me where she was, and would give me the piece of bacon, he might go about his business; he denied it - I called an officer, and gave him in charge.</p>

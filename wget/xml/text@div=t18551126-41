I am the prisoner's daughter; the deceased, Ca<lb></lb>therine Lordon, was my mother—I was living with my father and mother in Parliament-court, Finsbury, near the Old Artillery-ground—we had only one room, the front room, second floor—my father and mother, myself and two brothers occupied the same room—my brothers are younger than I, one is fourteen, and the other twelve years of age—my father used to be a weaver—for some time before my mother's death he had been employed in the tea warehouse, at St. Katherine's Docks—on Monday night, 17th Sept, I was at a raffle at the Green Dragon public house—it was a raffle for the benefit of my mother—I went there about 10 o'clock by myself—when I got there, I found Mr. Kingston, my father and mother, and two of my mother's brothers, their wives, and a daughter of one of them, and seve<lb></lb>ral other people—Kingston worked in the same employment as my father—he was an acquaintance of my father's—my father was intoxicated, and so was Kingston—my mother was sober, she might have had a drop of some-thing to drink, but you could not see it—I remained at the Green Dragon till twenty minutes after 12 o'clock—there was not much drinking going on, while I was there—there were several pots of porter had, but no spirits—about a quarter after 10 o'clock one of my brothers came in for me, to fetch me—I did not go with him—upon that, my father <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me, and one of my uncles, Daniel Crees, got up and took my father by the shoulder, and pushed him down the stairs—in about twenty minutes afterwards, my father came back again to the room, and brought a pint of beer in his hand—Thomas Crees then took him by the waist and half way carried him down stairs, and then let him fall the rest—my father was tipsy at that time—he was not more tipsy than he was before—he did not return to the room after that—I remained there till a quarter past 12 o'clock, and then went home with my mother—as we went out of the public house I saw my father standing on the kerb—he did not speak to us—as we were going home we met Kingston at the door—he was at the door when we came there—he sent me for a pot of beer, and he, and my mother, and I drank it at the door, in the court—I took the pot back and then returned,</p>

"—my father struck Kingston with the poker, they then had a struggle, and both fell on the pavement, and then Kingston got up and went away—my father, after that, went up into his room on the second floor—I followed him—I went into the room and lay down on the bed—my father went out again about two minutes afterwards—my mother was on the third landing at that time—my father went out and went through the court, but I could not see which way he turned—in about ten minutes he came back—I was then on the first floor landing—he passed me—it was dark there, he could not see me as he went by—he went up into his room on the second floor, and locked the door—my two brothers were at that time asleep in the room—I passed the night on the first floor landing—ray mother passed the night on the third floor landing—about half-past 5 o'clock in the morning my mother called one of my brothers to go to his work—he left the house just before 6 o'clock—about half an hour afterwards my other brother went out—my mother called him to go—he left about twenty minutes to 7 o'clock—I walked to the door of the court with him—after that, my mother came down stairs to me at the door—she took a walk with me in the street—I was going somewhere to some business I had—before I parted with my mother, I saw my father at the corner of Sandy's-row; that is a court close by where we live—that was about quarter to 7 o'clock—I parted with my mother at the top of the street—that was the last time I saw her alive—I heard of her death about quarter to 8 o'clock.</p>

By sergeant Horan's direction, I went with the prisoner to his house, in Parliament-court—it was about 150 or 200 yards from the station—it only took two or three minutes to go—I followed the prisoner up to the first-floor landing—I there saw the deceased sitting down in the corner, with her head lying on her knees, and her two arms on her knees likewise—both hands were drooping, hanging down—I took hold of her hands—I believed her to be dead then—her hand was cold—when I lifted up her arm, it dropped down again—I lifted her head up—the face was pale, and I saw blood running from the right side down the breast, and in her lap was a great quantity of blood congealed—when I moved her head, I saw that she was dead—the prisoner was standing by while I did this—I said to him, "Where did you do this, here? "—he said, "No, up stairs"—I said, "What did you do it with?"—he said, "With a knife "—I said, "Where is that knife? "—he said, "Come up stairs, and I will give it you"—I followed him up stairs to the second floor front room—he then gave me a knife—he walked round the bedstead, and took it from the hill of the window—the bedstead was between the door and the window—the knife was wet with blood—at the corner of the door, as I entered the room, I put my foot into a pool of blood—that was just by the bedstead, at the corner of the door—the bedstead was hardly two feet from the door—there was just room for the door to open—the pool of blood extended from the door into the passage—there was blood all the way down the stairs to the landing where I found her—it had gone all the way down—the pool of blood was at the door in the bedroom, and there was blood to the landing—I do not mean that the blood had run down the stairs—it was not a running stream, but drops of blood—there was a quantity of blood in her lap—I asked the prisoner what had taken place previously—he said he had been to a raffle, and had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with his wife, and he did not wish to say any more to me, he wished to be locked up—I asked him where he had had the knife previous to his striking her, and he lifted up the tick of the bed, and pointed between the bed tick and the mattress, and said, "There; now lock me up as soon as you can," and with that I took him to the station, and locked him up—Mr. Shaw, the surgeon, was sent for directly—I was present when the prisoner afterwards made a statement—he had expressed a wish to see his sister, and he wished</p>

               <p>for pen, ink, and paper, to write a note to her—I got him pen, ink, and paper, and told him that what he wrote I would take possession of, and he wrote this note to his sister—(<hi rend="italic">The note was here produced and read, as follows</hi>—"My dear Mary, make yourself as happy as you can. If you and I are allowed to speak to each other, I shall be very glad, and I will tell you something. Daniel Lordon. To Mrs. James Mahoney, 11, John<lb></lb>street, Cannon-street-road, St. George's East")—I took that note to his sister, and she came to the station with me—the inspectors Gernor and Marsh were then with the prisoner—they gave him a caution that what he said would be taken down in writing—he was taken out of the cell by the inspectors, and taken into the inspector's charge room, and he and his sister had a seat together—the caution was given in my presence—the answer he made to it was, "Very good," or to that effect—he then made a statement to his sister, which was taken down in writing by Inspector Marsh.</p>

I went to the place where the death occurred on the morning in question—I afterwards returned to the station, and was there when the prisoner's sister arrived—the prisoner was at that time in a cell—I brought him out of the cell into the office—I asked him if he wished to speak to his sister—he said, "Yes"—I said, "You cannot do so unless in the presence of the police; but if you do wish to speak to her, I shall take down what you say in writing, and use it as a statement before the Magistrate"—he said, "I am aware of that, I do wish to speak to her"—he then made a statement to his sister, which I took down, and produce—I wrote it down as he spoke it to his sister, in the pre<lb></lb>sence of inspector Gernon—after he had concluded his statement, I gave it to Gernon to sign—he signed it, and then read it aloud in the hearing of the prisoner, and he either said, "That is right" or, "That is correct"—this was near 2 o'clock in the day—I had seen the prisoner shortly after 10 o'clock that morning—he looked to me like a man that had been drinking very heavily over night.</p>

I was there when the prisoner's sister came—the prisoner made a statement, which was taken down in writing, and which I afterwards read over—upon my doing to, the prisoner said, "It is correct," or words to that effect—this is the statement, I signed it—(<hi rend="italic">Read:—Statement of Daniel Lordon</hi>, 18<hi rend="italic">th Sept</hi>., 1855—"I had an appointment with a man to get some work, I saw him at the place ap<lb></lb>pointed, at a beer shop, near the London Docks.

"I said, 'No.' He said, 'If you'll go, I'll go.' I said, 'I will go;' and a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> took place at the Green Dragon beer shop, Half Moon-street: one of my wife's brothers threatened to throw me down stairs.

               <p>know whether I spoke first or not. Kingston and me struck each other, had several blows—I cannot say who struck first, he aggravated me very much. I struck Kingston with a poker. I then went out again and spoke to a policeman, a city man, saying the people wished to waylay me; he told me to go away. I went home, lay upon the bed, and believe I took off the coat; my wife called the two boys this morning. I went down stairs and spoke harshly to my wife, and went up stairs again, and lay down; she came in soon after, and I asked what she did there. No further words ensued, when I put my hand under the tick, took the knife, and inflicted the wound now seen, which caused her death. I have no more to say."

I am a surgeon in Bishopsgate-street—I accompanied the policeman to the house in question on the morning this matter occurred—I got there about 8 o'clock—I saw the body of the deceased woman on the first landing, doubled up—I found a wound in the throat, it was a jagged cut—I have seen the knife produced—it appeared to be a stab wound—there were two wounds, one was a horizontal wound, and the other an oblique wound, about two and a half or three inches long—the fatal wound was two and a half or three inches long—I have no doubt that that wound caused her death—it was the result of a blow of great force—I examined the vertebrae afterwards, and found that a portion of it was chipped—that would indicate considerable force.</p>

When I got up on the 26th of January last, my servants, Sutton and Holmes, told me they found my shop broke open: we miss'd the goods mentioned in the indictment (mentioning them), and many other things: I went to Justice Fielding, and got them advertised, but heard nothing of them till about four months after; then one Mrs. Paddock sent for me, and said she belived she could inform me where my goods were. This was the last day of last sessions. It being pretty late that Saturday night, we went on the Monday Morning; she had told me, a poor woman that lived in the house where Munden lives, could inform me where they were gone to pawn. About six o'clock on the Monday morning, the constable, one of my servants, and I, went to Munden's house in Crow-alley, Whitecross-street; we took him and his wife to Bridewell; he sent for his sister,

I saw a tea-chest and other things, that I believe to be mine, there: we took the prisoner up to Hicks's-Hall; they were committed for farther examination, the man to Bridewell, the others to New Prison. When Munden was got to Bridewell, he turned back to give evidence against his accomplice: he told the Justice, if he might be admitted evidence, he would divulge his accomplices; he was told, very likely he might be admitted, but did not promise him. He wanted to impeach

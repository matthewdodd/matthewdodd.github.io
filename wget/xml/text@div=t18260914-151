I have seen the prisoner pass my door - one day, in July, he asked me if I wanted to buy a duplicate of a watch - I went to look at it at the shop - I paid the interest, and had a fresh ticket written - I brought it back to the prisoner, and said I did not like the watch, and would not have it; next day I went to a public-house and saw him again; he asked me again to buy the duplicate, and said I should have it for 4s.; I had not so much, but I gave him 3s. 5d.; I asked if it was his own - he said Yes, but it had been his brother's, but being out of place he wanted to get a few shillings - I went to Smithfield the next day to buy two pigs, and wanting money, I pawned the watch in Theobald's-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known the prisoner long? A. No; I had not seen him more than nine or ten times; this was the first time I ever spoke to him.</p>

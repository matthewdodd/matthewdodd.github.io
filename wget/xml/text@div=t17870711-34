               <p>How long might they be committing this robbery on you? - I look upon it very near three minutes.</p>
               <p>How were they dressed? - Adams was dressed in dirty clothes, with a slouched hat on, in regimentals; Riness seemed to be much cleaner in his clothes, his were regimentals.</p>
               <p>Had you known either of the men before? - I never saw them before to my knowledge, I saw them again on the Tuesday, I think it was; I was robbed on the Sunday evening, I saw Riness on guard, and I was there when he was taken; I was taken to see them, to see if I should know the men that robbed me; I saw Riness on the parade, and I told Shepperd, the man that took me, that I thought he was the man; I was not quite sure at that time, that he was the man; Adams was taken the same day, but not on guard; I saw him the same day, I knew him immediately when I saw him; I cannot rightly tell the place where he was taken, I believe they call it Duck-lane, Westminster; I was sure as to Adams.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him? - He was in his own apartment in Duck-lane in bed, when I saw him, I believe it might be about eight or nine in the morning; I saw Riness some little time before that; Riness was dressed very clean at the time I saw him, I went to his lodgings along with Shepherd, and he undressed there, and he put on some other regimentals; and then I was more sure.</p>
               <p>How far was it from any house that you was robbed? - About twenty yards from the Half-way House, there were people in it, I did not cry out or make any noise, I saw nobody in the fields, but I met three gentlemen coming down the field, and I told them that I had been robbed; it might be two minutes after I was robbed.</p>

               <p>But to any body else when you was present? - Not to my knowledge; I did not see Riness till after he was taken up by Shepherd; I was on the parade at the same time he was taken up, and that was the first time I saw him; Shepherd took hold of him when I first observed him, and I thought he was the man; he had been pointed out to Shepherd by a drummer for something else.</p>

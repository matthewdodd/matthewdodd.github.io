               <p>"You must known then, (meaning know) that I used, together with a variety of youthful attachments, to be very fond of birds and poultry; and among other things of this kind, I had a very fine majestic kind of animal, a game cock."(meaning thereby to denote and represent our said Lord the King)"a haughty, sanguinary tyrant, nursed in blood and slaughter from his infancy, fond of foreign wars and domestic rebellions, into which he would sometimes drive his subjects, by his oppressive obstinacy, in hopes that he might increase his power and glory by their suppression. Now this haughty old tyrant." (again meaning our said Lord the King)" would never let my farm yard be quiet, for not content with devouring by far, the greater part of the grain that was scattered for the morning and evening repast, and snatching at every little treasure, that the toil of more industrious birds, might happen to scratch out of the bowels of the earth, the restless despot."(meaning our said Lord the King)"must be always picking and cussing at the poor doves and pullets, and little desenceless chickens, so that they could never eat the scanty remnant which his inordinate taxation left them, in peace and quietness: now though there were some aristocratic prejudices hanging about me from my education, so that I could not help looking with some considerable reverence upon the majestic decorations of the person of King Chaunticlere."(meaning our said Lord the King)"such as his ermine spotted breast, the fine gold trappings about his neck and shoulders, the flowing robe of Plumage tucked up at his rump, and above all, that fine ornamented thing upon his head there,-his crown or coxcomb, I believe you call it, (however, the distinction is not very important) yet I had, even at that time, some lurking principles of aversion to bare faced despotism, struggling at my heart, which would sometimes whisper to me, that the best thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179402190150"></xptr>that one could do, either for cocks or hens or men and women, was, to rid the world of tyrants."(meaning our said Lord the King, among others,) "whose shrill martial clarions (the provocatives to same and murder,) disturbed the repose, and destroyed the happiness of their respective communities; so I believe if guillotines had been in fashion, I should certainly have guillotined him, being merciful even in the stroke of death: and knowing, the instant the brain is separated from the heart (which, with this instrument is done in a moment,) pain and consciousness is at an end, while the lingering torture of the rope may procrastinate the pang for half an hour. However I managed the business very well, for I caught Mr. Tyrant by the head, and dragging him immediately to the block, with a heavy knife in my hand, separated his neck at a blow; and what will surprise you very much, when his fine trappings were stripped off, I found he was no better than a common scratchdunghill pullet; no nor half so good, for he was tough, and oily, and rank with the pollutions of his luxurious vices." In contempt of our said Lord the King, and his Laws, to the evil and pernicious example of all others in the like case offending, and against the peace of our said Lord the King, his Crown, and Dignity.</p>

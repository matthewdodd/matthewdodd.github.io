               <p>Relate what passed after he came there? - When he came, I went out, he followed me, and said what he had suffered by his wife leaving him, and a young family, and threatened he would have me taken up for harbouring his wife, who had left a husband, and a sick family.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing at all respecting Mrs. Lee? - Not then.</p>

               <p>Did he do so? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You seem to me to have given a very fair and full account, and not to have suppressed any thing; the purpose of this man's coming, was to see his wife and child? - Yes; the wife slept with me; she was no relation to me, I only lodged in the same house with this man's wife; Lee was own brother.</p>
               <p>There was a boy that was in the blue-coat school? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you know these people much? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lee which is dead, was one of Mr. Romaine's congregation, was not she? - Yes, she was a pew-opener.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect this man's saying that he should complain to Mr. Romaine? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>You say she was black in the face; do you remember her saying that he was a rascal and villain, and that if he attempted to deprive her of her bread, she would lay him in gaol for life? - Yes, I do; her hands were clinched, and she was black with passion.</p>
               <p>To all this he said, madam, your age and sex protects you, but if you do provoke me, I will throw down all your tea-things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Has Lee both his arms? - Only one.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing this man bloody, soon after he was knocked down? - Yes, I do; my hands were all over blood endeavouring to part them.</p>
               <p>Did not Lee instantly after he knocked down this man, take hold of the poker and endeavour to get it? - They were all struggling at one time.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you may have heard from Lee that he did take the poker? - Yes, Lee told me at the same time that it was a mercy there was never a knife in the way; he said he went to the poker in his own defence; all their hands were at the same time at the poker; I got some blows in endeavouring to part them; the first thing I saw was the poker in Lee's hand at the bottom of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing the prisoner's son there, the blue-coat boy? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Now after this man had thrown drown her tea things, did you hear the deceased hooting at him and saying, now you have done it finely? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had no idea that this woman had received any blow while you was in the 
room? - No, Sir.</p>


               <p>Upon the oath you have taken, do you believe that any wilful blow was given to that woman by any body? - No Sir, I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Lee's swearing that he would massacre them? - Yes Sir, he had the poker and kept the others off; then one of them said, lay down the poker and fight us like a man.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not know this man before that time? - No.</p>
               <p>You have seen him since that time? - I never saw him since that time till to day.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130111"></xptr>Have you had no conversation with him since the affair happened nor since you gave your evidence before the Coroner? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Have you had no conversation on his behalf since you gave your evidence before the Coroner? - I have had no conversation with any body but his wife.</p>
               <p>You said just now that you had no notion of this woman having received a blow till you came down the stairs? - No Sir, I had not.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell us that you saw the woman down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you then conceive that she had received a blow? - No Sir, I never saw the least of a blow in the world till I saw her down at the door all over blood.</p>
               <p>Have you had no conversation with any body about your evidence, since you gave your evidence before the Coroner? - No Sir, not particularly, many have asked me, and I have told them; I did not recollect every circumstance at first; I was much frightened and so was she.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. From this evidence I submit whether Lee is competent to be examined; for one or other of these men, either by accident or design, has occasioned her death?</p>

               <p>I believe you hit him a pretty hard blow; you knocked him down the first time? - Yes, I did, upon that I instantly got hold of the poker, and hit him again with the poker.</p>
               <p>How came you to lay hold of the poker? - Because he and the other young man in the room were going to hit me again, and I laid hold of the poker and hit them both.</p>
               <p>Morgan had struck you then? - Yes, he had hit me.</p>
               <p>Tell us distinctly what happened in this unfortunate business? - I was in the affray, and received a blow on my head with wringing the poker out of my hand, then I got hold of the prisoner directly, and pulled him out of the room.</p>
               <p>Court. I will ask you at once the question; did you see your mother receive a blow, before you pulled the prisoner out of the room? - No Sir, if he had been my own brother over and over, if I had seen him, I would have done so.</p>
               <p>You did not know of that misfortune till after? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Then in what way that blow was struck, whether in the struggle for the poker by you all three you do not know? - No Sir, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was your mother in the state of a dying woman, any time before early on Wednesday morning? - I cannot say, for I was not in the room with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You did not suspect that this man had any design to kill your mother? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, the witnesses behind, are only for the purpose of proving that the blow given to this unfortunate woman, from whose hand soever it proceeded, was most undoubtedly the cause of her death; but if it is not proved that that blow was given by the prisoner, that death cannot certainly be imputed to him in any degree; and here there is no evidence at all from either of the witnesses present: Mr. Lee has given a very fair evidence, and he states expressly, that he did not see the blow given; and therefore it does appear that this was an unhappy accident arising from the affray.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of the Hon. Mrs. Bathurst, in Gros<lb></lb>venor-square. On 17th Oct. the prisoner came to her house—he brought some china, which he said was from the Exhibition—I paid him the amount of the bill, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he gave me this receipt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am book-keeper to Messrs. Cottam and Co. I saw the prisoner on 27th Sept.—I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for porcelain purchased at the Exhibition—he gave me this bill and receipt—I paid him the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for Baron du Tramblay.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I am a manufacturer in France, of china. I was an exhibitor at the Great Exhi<lb></lb>bition—I sold articles of china to the Hon. Mrs. Bathurst, of Grosvenor-square, and to Mr. Mortan—I had employed the prisoner for three months to take out goods, and to deliver them, and bring back the receipt if the money was not paid—he ought always to receive the money if persons were in the way—he did not bring me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Bathurst—I believe he did not bring this bill back (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—he never gave me any account of these moneys received from Mrs. Bathurst and Mr. Mortan—he told me he did not receive it—when he received money for me, he ought to pay it me on the same day, or on the following morning if he did not return in the evening—he speaks and understands French perfectly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Can you swear that these bills were delivered by you to me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; you had a porter with you to carry the goods—there was one bill delivered to you in my absence—all these bills were delivered to you to receive money, of which you have returned none—I have a list of the debts and the money I received from the prisoner—this is my book—there is no entry, of this 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Bathurst, and 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Morton—you stated that the persons were absent, and would not be at home for some time—in con<lb></lb>sequence of that I did not enter them—I believe it was not to me that you made the observation that the money was not paid, because I was continually at the Exhibition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you Madame Verrell's receipt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; every day's account—I made the account myself—I arrived from France on 2nd Oct.—I have the book which was delivered to me when I came back by Madame Verrell—she received money also, and she was to account to me—she put down the goods that were sold—she gave an account what money she received—I put it down in my book—I alone was to receive the money—Madame Verrell paid you your last commission on 23rd Oct.—it is down in this book, and was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any partner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; Madame Verrell was entitled to receive money for me when I was in France—I was to receive it when I was at home—even when I was in England she might receive money on my account—there was no one beside her that might receive money from the prisoner for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I received the bill of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and paid it to Madame Verrell next morning, when I went with my porter to take more goods out; she has kept the whole books; Cottam and Mortan's I received, and paid to Madame Verrell previous to the Baron arriving in England; he has never</p>

               <p>asked me for these moneys; I have seen him two or three times a week; the last time I saw Madame Verrell, I paid her 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and she asked what she was indebted to me; I said 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and she said it was only 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I said it was a poor commission, when I had to pay a man 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day; I said I would rather have my 10 per cent, than go on so; she said, "Very well, we will have somebody else," and I went away; I was told by the policeman that the prosecutor wanted to speak to me; I went, and he was not at home; I went to the station, and he came; if Madame Verrell were here, it would appear that I have not been a felon; all I have to say about these two sums is that I paid them in.</p>

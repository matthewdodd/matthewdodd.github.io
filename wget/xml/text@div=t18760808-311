                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living in Adela Street, Kensal New Town—I have been living with the prisoneras my wife rather more than twelve months—about eleven weeks ago she was delivered of a girl—she continued to live with me after that—I gave her money for the support of the household, including the child, from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, just according to my earnings—the child was left with her to take care of—at first she used to suckle it, for two or three weeks—the child died on 4th July—it was then seven weeks old—after the first week from its birth it had a little breaking out; on its feet and back—the prisoner showed it to me, and said she had taken it to a doctor's, and he had given her six powders—that was four or five weeks before its death—she said the doctor said it was skin disease, and there was no danger—on the Friday night week before I went before the Magistrate, I went with her to a seafaring doctor, and gave her 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for his fee, and she got a bottle of medicine and three powders—on the Tuesday week before it died, in consequence of what my landlady told me, I went to a neighbouring public-house about 8.30 p.m, and found the prisoner there—I asked her if she would come home, for she had left the child from 9 o'clock in the morning—she said "It is a lie; I have not been long out"—she was drunk—she did not come home with me, she stopped talking with another woman—it was 9.30 before she came home; she then sat down in a chair and went to sleep—she gave no attention to the child or any nourishment—I shook her, and said "For Heaven's sake, give the child the breast, it has been crying all day"—she then got up and laid on the floor—I picked her up, put her on the bed,. opened the front of her dress, and pulled her breast out and put it to the child, and they both dozed off to sleep—the child gradually grew worse after that—on the Tuesday, I left home about 4.10 to go to my work—the child was then alive—I came home about 8 o'clock, the prisoner was not there—she had been out all day drinking along with other men—the child was dead, and laid out on the table—I went out and found the prisoner against the Portobello Arms; she appeared to be sober—I said "The landlady tells me the child is dead, and I have been up and seen it"—she said "Well, I can't help it"—I asked her to come home—she said "I won't; I want to get the child's things out of pawn," and I went with her to get them, I would not give her the money, she always spent it in drink.—I usually found her drunk when I came home—I treated her kindly, I never failed to give her money every Saturday.</p>

               <p></p>
               <p></p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.You had your senses about you? A.Perfectly so - I sang very little; I do not recollect seeing Davis in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.You went to one or two public-houses? A. To the St. Paul's public-house; I am sure I had no spirits - they wanted me to drink some gin; I refused, and they spilt it down my neck - I do not know who that was; I knocked the glass away and none went down my throat - I gave the same evidence before the Magistrate, and did not want Phillips to remind me of any thing; I once thought of leaving this prosecution alone, as I was afraid of losing my situation - I never heard Phillips tell the Policeman he should have 3s. 6d. a day; he never said so in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you so drunk that Swan picked up your watch, and gave it to Phillips to save for you? A. No, she did not - the landlord and landlady saw her take it from her bosom when the Policeman came in; I did not want more drink there, which was refused - when the tap-room door was pushed open I could see by the light from the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you been sparring with Phillips? A.No; there were a great many people in the tap-room - I do not know at what time I lost my purse; I bottoned my breeches pocket up a moment before Phillips came in - that was before the two men pulled me back; when I saw Johnson he stood facing the door - I cannot swear he was in the room when my watch was taken - I did not see him till Phillips brought my purse, and pointed to him; it could not have fallen from my pocket - Peak, the Policeman, did not tell me to say the prisoners were the persons, or they would get off - it was Phillips gave Johnson in charge.</p>
               <p>HENRY PHILLIPS. I am cook at an eating-house in Chiswell-street. I went with Garness to the Boot, and had a pint of ale - I had passed through the St. Paul's public-house when he was there, but I drank nothing; we both went into the Golden Boot between eleven and twelve o'clock, and had a pint of beer between us at the bar, and as there was singing in the tap-room, Garness said, "Let us go in, and hear a song, and drink the rest there" - we went in and sat down ten or eleven minutes; they called on Garness for a song - I saw Swan and Davis in the room at that time; Garness attempted to sing, but they howled, and he left off - I got up and said, "We had better be going;" he said, "Stop a bit" - I did not see him follow me; I was not out half a minute, and when I came in again he had shifted his seaf, and was sitting between two or three men, who called on him to sing again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any thing when you said he had better be going? A. I saw some persons rubbing their hands across his pockets, and thought all was not right - I went out, came in again, and, to get him out, said,"George, your master wants the keys of the stable;" he got up, and attempted to come out - they pulled him down, and said, "Let him finish his song;" that was neither of the prisoners - they began to sing again; I asked if he was coming - he attempted to get up, and was pulled down again by the same persons - I went over to the house opposite, to get somebody to pull him out; I was not gone half a minute - I returned, and saw him sitting quietly in the same company as before; I laid hold of his collar to pull him out, and the gas was immediately put out - I heard somebody in the room say ding; I was struck, and a bad expression used to me - I was separated from him; I ran to the tap-room door, and opened it - that threw a light into the room; I saw Swan round him and Johnson, but did not see Davis - I saw Swan drop the watch; she then kicked it into the bar; I saw Johnson take the purse out of Garness' pocket - I snatched it from his hand; Garness was then on his back on the tap-room floor; I saw Johnson's hand come from the pocket with the purse-Swan and others were making their way out of the room, and the landlady said, "Stop that woman, she has got his watch in her bosom;" I got hold of it, and the Policeman took it out of my hand - Davis came up, and said she was his wife, and should not go to the watch-house - he was in the house; the Policeman took her to the station - there was an attempt to rescue Swan, and by that means they were all secured.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was nearly all over before Davis interfered? A. He was in the room all the time, but I only saw him attempt the rescue - I was sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Was the prosecutor sober? A.He was half and half - he knew what he was about; he had no gin at the Boot; I have left my situation because I was not satisfied with my food; I have not talked with the Policeman about how much a day I should get here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You made no charge against Johnson at the station? A. No; I do not know whether he was locked up for an assault - the robbery was committed in the middle of the tap-room, right opposite the door.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Golden Boot. I was inside my bar the early part of the evening - the three prisoners came in about eight o'clock, in company with two men, and about eleven Garness and Phillips came in - they had some beer in the tap-room; they had no spirits, to my knowledge; after they went into the tap-room I heard the prosecutor singing - he was sitting under the window; I had not heard singing before - I observed some of my customers near him, but not either of the prisoners were at that time near him; I then returned to the bar, and was standing there; Johnson came out with two women, and called for some gin - I do not recollect whether Swan was one of them or not; while Johnson was drinking at the bar a Policeman came in, and said,"Take in a light;" I took a candle into the tap-room, and found the gas-light out - I lighted it directly, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170113"></xptr>saw the prosecutor laying on the floor - Phillips had hold of his collar; I stopped there a little while, then came out, and heard somebody say, "This is the woman who has got the watch" (I had heard the prosecutor say nothing); I did not see what woman was meant, and who said so I do not know; I saw the Policeman come in, and he took the female prisoner by the side of the bar - I did not see the watch taken from her, nor see it at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Did you see Swan standing at the bar with Davis' wife? A. A young woman was drinking there with Davis; Swan was in and out that evening - two women and two men were at the bar at the time the light was called for, but whether one was Swan I cannot say; the bar is on the same side as the tap-room; when the gas was out I do not think a person could see what was passing, till I took the candle - a great many people were running in and out; I am sure nobody could see, for I am in the habit of going in when the gas is out - it was as I came out from lighting the gas that somebody said the woman had the watch - I did not see it kicked by anybody, but after they were taken to the station-house I saw the remains of the watch-glass close to where the prosecutor lay; when I heard my wife say"She has got the watch," I saw it open in Swan's hand, not in her bosom - the Policeman ran in at that moment; she was standing in front of the bar, not attempting to go out; Garness was so drunk, that at the station-house he could not give a word of his statement; he sat in a chair there, and shammed a fit - Phillips was not drunk; two strange bad characters had come into my house, and at the time of the robbery they ran out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Are you sure Johnson came out of the tap-room with two women before you heard the noise? A.They were outside at the time the robbery was committed, and I left Johnson standing at the bar when I went, in and found Garness on the floor - I did not see Phillips take the purse from Johnson, nor hear it mentioned either at the house or station - it was about half-past eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you keep your house open so late? We are allowed to keep open till twelve o'clock all round the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>- ATKINSON. I am the landlady. The first thing I saw was the prisoners standing at my bar - Garness ran out, put his back to the door, and said, "Oh, I am robbed, I have lost my master's watch;" at that time Johnson and Swan were at the bar - Johnson had just called for a quartern of gin; Swan stood with her right arm at the corner of the bar - I saw her stoop down, and pick up a watch with her right hand; I never saw it in her bosom - she picked it up between the bar and the tap-room door - the prosecutor was so tipsy he could not stand; he reeled from the door, and the Policeman came in; I said,"Here is the woman who has got the watch;" the Policeman took her round to the right-hand side of the bar, and she delivered the watch to him - she had it open in her hand before that - neither Garness nor Phillips said any thing about her taking it at that time; when Garness saw it in her hand he charged her with it - when the Policeman came; he could scarcely stand then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Did you tell any body to stop Swan? A. I did not - I said, "Policeman, here is the woman who has the watch;" she was not attempting to go away - she could have no hand in stealing the watch.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was going by the house on my beat, and heard singing - I looked through the window, and saw Phillips go towards Garness; they sat right opposite the tap-room door - he said something, but I could not hear what; after he had been there about a moment the gas was put out or went out - I then put my head in, and told Atkinson to take a light in; he was in the bar at the time - there were men and women standing at the bar, but I cannot say who; in three or four minutes I heard Garness say he was robbed of his watch - he was then in front of the bar, and had come out of the tap-room- he had been drinking, but was not so drunk but what he knew what he was about - as soon as I heard he had lost his watch I entered the house, and Swan was then coming out of the street door - I had not seen her at the bar; Mrs. Atkinson said, "Stop that woman, she has got the watch; she has got it in her bosom" - I went to get hold of her; she put her right hand into her bosom, and took the watch out - it had no chain or seal to it then; she was not standing at the bar - I am quite sure Mrs. Atkinson said she had it in her bosom; and I saw her take it from her bosom - Mrs. Atkinson was in the bar at that time, but I think Mr. Atkinson was in the tap-room; as Swan took the watch from her bosom Phillips held his hand out to get hold of it, but I took it from him - after I got the watch I put Swan into the passage, and sent for assistance, because I had been ill-used before by taking persons out of that house; the landlord sent a boy to the station for assistance, and a man came and kept the people back while I took her out - Davis claimed her as his wife in the public-house - Atkinson and his wife were there; Davis took hold of her gown, and said, "Come away, are not you coming home?" he said she was his wife - he pulled me by the sleeve, but used no violence there; when I had got Swan twenty or thirty yards from the house, Johnson came behind and hit me on the back of the head; I had heard no charge against him then - I called for a Policeman, and Gladwell took him - Garness came to the watch-house; he said the watch did not belong to him, and raved about it, so that as last he went into a fit - before that he was sensible, and knew what he was doing - when Johnson struck me he sprang the rattle for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Have you heard Mrs. Atkinson's evidence? A. I have - on my oath she told me to stop Swan; Garness came to me after the parties were fully committed, and said, "Some of their friends have been to me, what am I to do? "I said, "You are bound over to appear, and may do as you like;" he said something about being afraid that he should lose his place in consequence of the time it would take - the public-houses are open till twelve o'clock; we have no orders to prevent it - Mrs. Atkinson's name was struck from the back of the indictment, by the clerk, at the time we were sworn, as she was gone away ill in a coach; she was present when the bill went before the Grand Jury, but was not called -I did not know what she would state; she contradicted me before the Magistrate, respecting Swan's coming out of the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.How long were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170114"></xptr>you in the house? A. I dare say ten minutes altogether; when I got a certificate from the Magistrate, Phillips asked why I had two papers; I said one was a certificate for 3s. 6d. a day - he did not tell me he had seen Johnson's hands come from the prosecutor's pocket, and that he took the purse from him, till next morning.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was in Chiswell-street, and met a boy coming to the station - he sent me to the Boot, where I found Peak, who asked me to keep the people away while he got Swan out; when he a few steps from the door, he called out - I went up, and saw Johnson strike him once or twice on the back of the head - I secured him; Davis was on the spot, and I received several blows from somebody.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK MILES. I am a Policeman. Atkinson's servant fetched me from the station; I found Johnson in Gladwell's custody - Davis said I should not take him away, as he was his brother, and I took him for attempting to rescue Johnson; Atkinson and his brother forfeited their recognizances yesterday against another prisoner.</p>

               <p>Swan's Defence. What the prosecutor has sworn is false - it is not in my nature to do any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Johnson's Defence. I came out of the tap-room to go home, and during that time two men whom I knew came in, and we had something to drink at the bar; while it was being poured out the other two prisoners came out to the bar, and partook of what I was drinking - a man named Sadler came out; he had been singing - he stood there talking: a scuffle eusued in the tap-room, but I never moved from the bar - a watch was kicked out of the tap-room; the female prisoner took it up - I never offered to go from the bar till she was taken out; I then went to see where she was going - the Policeman then collared and dragged me away; the prosecutor was very much intoxicated - the Policeman said I was taken for an assault; they said nothing about the purse. In the morning, at the office, the prosecutor said to the Policeman, "Is that the woman?" he touched him with his elbow, and said, "Yes, and these are the two men - you must mind what you say, or they will get off," and then they charged us all with the robbery.</p>
               <p>CHARLES NUTT. I live in Holywell-lane. I went into the Boot at ten o'clock on the night in question, and saw the prosecutor, who I have known for years, sitting between two young men, singing; he told me he had been to sea - he was a little intoxicated: I told him his master wanted to speak to him outside, as he had the key of the stable, thinking if I got him out he might be induced to go home - Phillips was not in the room then; several songs were sang - I saw him drink three glasses of gin, which two young men gave him, and several times he drank out of different pots of porter; I then tried to prevail on him to go home, but he said, "Mind your own business," and that he would cut my head with a quart pot; he called for more gin - one of the men who sat on his right, called for a quartern, and poured out a glass - he was so tipsy he could scarcely take it; the prisoners were not those men when I went in the male prisoners were at the further end of the room, at some distance from him; the young men put the gin to his mouth; he drank some, and some he spilt down his clothes - he then began to sing another song- there was no room for me to sit; I stood at the tap-room door, and had another pint of half-and-half; Swan and Johnson asked a young man who had sung to come and have something to drink at the bar; nothing had been done to the prosecutor at that time, for I stood opposite him; Swan and Johnson left the room, and stood - I stood aside, opened the door, and let them out with two more young men; when they had been out about five minutes, three young men came into the tap-room, and took the seats they had left, by the fire-place, and in a few minutes the gas was put out - I thought it was done accidentally; I opened the door, and told Atkinson they were in the dark - he ran in with a light; I did not go into the room again, but sat on a table opposite the bar; when Atkinson took in the light I saw the prosecutor laying on the ground - Swan was then at the bar, drinking spirits, and Johnson had the measure in his hand, close to her; there was another young man with them - the tap-room was nearly full - as soon as the door was opened people rushed out into the street, and I saw the watch kicked out of the taproom; Swan stooped and took it up as she stood at the bar- it is impossible that she could have interfered in the robbery; she had left the tap-room for a quarter of an hour -Mrs. Atkinson said, "This woman has got the watch;" she was not going away - Atkinson did not say Stop her! the watch was open in her hand - the prosecutor said, "Give me the watch, and I will run away, for I will never give any body in charge;" a Policeman coming in saw her with the watch in her hand, and took her in charge by the bar; she never had the watch in her bosom, on my oath; it was in her hand, and partly in the prosecutor's hand - she was in the act of giving it to him when the Policeman came in; I was holding him at the time, for he could scarcely stand.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What are you? A. A house-painter - I believe the prosecutor had his senses so as to know what he was saying - any body could hear what he said; I cannot say whether Mrs. Atkinson heard it - I was close to her, but she was the only person to take care of the bar - she might not have heard it; she said, "That woman has the watch," but that was not to the Policeman - it was before he came in; she said it to the prosecutor - I cannot say she did not say it again when the Policeman was there- I do not think she did.</p>

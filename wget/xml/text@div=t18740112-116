I am a cab-driver, and live at 3, Duke Street, Mile End—on Sunday, 4th January, about 12.45 a.m., I was going home through Charles Street—I met the prisoner and two other men—the prisoner hit me on the hat—I said "What is that for? "and he hit me fair in the mouth, and I went down in a lot of mud—he put his hand in my right hand pocket, and I had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there—I said "Let me have my 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I no sooner said that than the other men kicked me in the ribs—I caught hold of the prisoner and struggled with him, and I went down on my head—I stuck to him and got him against the wall, and halloaed out "Police and Murder"—the other two got away—a constable came up, and I gave the prisoner into custody—I afterwards went to the London Hospital—I am bandaged up now, and can't work or lift anything.</p>

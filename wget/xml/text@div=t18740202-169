I am in the service of John Hoare, a grocer, of 1, Charlotte Street, Mile End—on the night of 23rd January I closed the house about 11.30 and fastened the parlour window, where I sleep—I put the two latches down and fastened them—I was disturbed about 1.15 on the morning of the 24th—the window was then open, and the shutters up—it could have been opened by putting up this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and putting the latches back.</p>

I am the prisoner's brother—I am an actor, and he is a ticket writer and occasionally a photographer—he lived with me fourteen years in one house, and three years in my present house—I have not slept away from home since 10th December—I have examined the window which the prisoner is charged with breaking open—I do not think it possible to get in with a knife—I produce one of the latches; it was fastened with two of these, and when the window is dropped down the latch drops into its place; this part is 1 1/2 inches from the crevice, and it is impossible to reach it with a knife—I have seen my brother with this knife many times—I believe he found it—one blade was broken when I first saw it; the small one I believe, and about a month ago when he was cutting the letters on this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), he broke the other blade—it is impossible that this damaged knife could open that window, the blades are broken close—I am a music hall artist, and so is my wife—on the afternoon of the day this happened the prisoner was at the Agricultural Hall with Mr. Chapman and Mr. Jacobs—I have never known a single stain against my brother's character; there was always a good home for him to go to, and he was always industrious and honest.</p>

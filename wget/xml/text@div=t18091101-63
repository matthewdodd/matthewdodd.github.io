            . I live opposite of Mr. Mirach. I saw the prisoner go in Mr. Mirach's house; the door was left open, it was near twelve o'clock. In the course of a few minutes I saw him come out again, he had a great coat in his right hand; he seemed to be in a hurry; he walked as fast as he could, so as to make a run of it. I went over the way and informed Mr. Thomas of it.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Mirach's accompting house. From Mr. Laws information, I pursued the man, I saw him go up St. Mildred's court; he held the coat with his two hands, looking at it. I went to the compter and asked for a constable, and just as the constable and I were coming out of the Poultry compter, the man was going past, he took him into custody. I am sure this is the man I saw with the coat.</p>

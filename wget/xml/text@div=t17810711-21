             sworn.</p>

               <p>Last Friday I went out to supper, about ten o'clock at night, to the White-Horse in Turnmill-street; I left nobody at home; I locked my door, and put the key in my pocket. I came home about half after eleven o'clock, lighted a candle, and went out again; I left a candle burning on the table till I returned: I took a walk round Smithfield, as I commonly do every night, after I have had my supper, for the benefit of my health. I came back, and went into the Coach-and-Horses, and had two or three pints of beer; the two prisoners were then sitting in that house. I have seen them before in the neighbourhood. It was near one o'clock, I believe, when I came out of the house. I stopped on a cellar window of a sheep's-head shop, on account of my shortness of breath. As I was leaning upon my arm, I saw the prisoners come out of the court where I live, with each of them a bundle: the youngest, Sarah Hill, walked very fast a-cross the way, and the eldest followed her: I moved my head as they went a-cross the way, and saw them go up the court where they live, but I did not think they had got any thing belonging to me with them. Soon afterwards I went home, and found my street door standing about a quarter of a yard open; I put my hand to the lock, and it was hanging by one nail: I went up stairs, and found the candle was put out, and all the things were gone. I went and called the watch: I told him I had been robbed, and suspected the two women that went out of the court, and described them to him, and we went up the court where they lived: I could not tell the house they lived in; but I saw a dog sitting at the door; that I had seen follow them up and down the street. I said to the watchman, I believe this is the house; for I have seen this dog follow them. He knocked at the door. Nobody came. He pulled open the shutters, which were not fast, and put up his lantern to a broken pane of glass, and there we saw both the prisoners lying down on the things on the floor. I went to one Mr. Isaacs, a constable; he came, and told them, if they would not open the door, he would get in at the window. At last the short one opened the door, and we went in; I saw my things on the floor: they said they did not know how the things came there.</p>

               <p>Were the things there when you came home to light the candle? - Yes; I saw them there.</p>

               <p>These women, you said, were in the publick-house where you was. Did they go out before you? - I do not know whether they went out before me, or after me. I believe I stopped in the street twenty minutes: I could not get along, my breath was so bad.</p>

               <p>To Prosecutor. Was you quite sober? - I never was drunk in my life. I have a poor state of health. I did not drink the beer I paid for; I went into the house to get a bit of rest: the people in the house drank the beer.</p>
